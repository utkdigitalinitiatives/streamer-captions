00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:44.370


2
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.500
In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.

3
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.930
It wearies me.

4
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.430
You say it wearies you,

5
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.670
but how I caught it, found it, or came by it,

6
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.170
what stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born

7
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.500
I am to learn.

8
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.130
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me

9
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.870
that I have much ado to know myself.

10
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.100
Your mind is tossing on the ocean.

11
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.570
There, where your argosies with portly sail,

12
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.970
like signiors and rich burghers on the flood

13
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.970
or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,

14
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.530
do overpeer the petty traffickers

15
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.730
that curtsy to them, do them reverence,

16
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.070
as they fly by them with their woven wings.

17
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.970
Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,

18
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.570
the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad.

19
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.530
I should be still plucking the grass

20
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.730
to know where sits the wind,

21
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.030
peering in maps for ports and piers and roads,

22
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.730
and every object that might make me fear misfortune

23
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.500
to my venture out of doubt would make me sad.

24
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.970
My wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague

25
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.770
when I thought what harm a wind too great might do at sea.

26
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.700
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,

27
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.970
but I should think of shallows and of flats

28
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.870
and see my wealthy Andrew docked in sand,

29
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.700
vailing her high-top lower than her ribs to kiss her burial.

30
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.630
Or should I go to church and see the holy edifice of stone

31
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.630
and not bethink me straight on dangerous rocks,

32
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.700
which touching but my gentle vessel's side,

33
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.370
would scatter all her spices on the stream,

34
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.630
enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,

35
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.170
and, in a word, but even now worth this

36
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.870
and now worth nothing?

37
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.530
Shall I have the thought to think on this,

38
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.370
and shall I lack the thought

39
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.000
that such a thing bechanced would make me sad?

40
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.570
But tell not me.

41
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.370
I know Antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise.

42
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.630
Believe me, no.

43
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.070
I thank my fortune for it.

44
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.230
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,

45
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.030
nor to one place, nor is my whole estate

46
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.170
upon the fortune of this present year.

47
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.600
Therefore, my merchandise makes me not sad.

48
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.100
Why, then you are in love.

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.830
Fie, fie.

50
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.530
Not in love neither?

51
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.100
Mm-hmm.

52
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.100
Then let us say that you are sad because you are not merry.

53
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.030
And 'twere as easy for you to laugh and leap

54
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.400
and say you are merry

55
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.170
because you are not sad.

56
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.070
Now, by two-headed Janus,

57
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.730
nature hath framed strange fellows in her time,

58
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.770
some that will evermore peep through their eyes

59
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.330
and laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,

60
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.600
And other of such vinegar aspect

61
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.000
that they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,

62
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.200
though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

63
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.370
Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,

64
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.800
Gratiano and Lorenzo.

65
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.000
Fare ye well.

66
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.070
We leave you now with better company.

67
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.870
I would have stay'd till I had made you merry

68
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.430
if worthier friends had not prevented me.

69
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.830
Your worth is very dear in my regard.

70
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.500
I take it your own business calls on you

71
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.870
and you embrace the occasion to depart.

72
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.070
Good morrow, my good lords.

73
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.670
Good signiors both, when shall we laugh?

74
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.870
Say, when?

75
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.800
You grow exceeding strange.

76
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.100
Must it be so?

77
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.230
We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

78
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.770
My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,

79
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.130
we two will leave you.

80
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.430
But at dinner-time, I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

81
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.630
I will not fail you.

82
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.200
You look not well, Signior Antonio.

83
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.970
You have too much respect upon the world.

84
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.530
They lose it that do buy it with much care.

85
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.100
Believe me, you are marvelously changed.

86
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.500
I hold the world, but as the world, Gratiano,

87
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.000
a stage where every man must play a part, and mine a sad one.

88
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.330
Let me play the fool.

89
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.870
With mirth and laughter, let old wrinkles come

90
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.900
or let my liver rather heat with wine

91
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.130
than my heart cool with mortifying groans.

92
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.770
Why should a man whose blood is warm within

93
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.800
sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,

94
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.530
sleep when he wakes,

95
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.270
and creep into the jaundice by being peevish?

96
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.970
I tell thee what, Antonio,

97
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.900
I love thee, and 'tis my love that speaks.

98
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.900
There are a sort of men whose visages

99
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.070
do cream and mantle like a standing pond

100
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.030
and do a wilful stillness entertain

101
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.930
with purpose to be dressed in an opinion

102
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.870
of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,

103
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.070
as who should say "I am Sir Oracle,

104
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.100
and when I ope my lips, let no dog bark."

105
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.470
Oh, my Antonio, I do know of these

106
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.800
who therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing,

107
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.670
when, I am very sure, if they should speak,

108
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.130
would almost damn those ears which, hearing them,

109
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.500
would call their brothers fools.

110
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.270
I'll tell thee more of this another time.

111
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.870
But fish not with this melancholy bait,

112
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.470
for this fool gudgeon, this opinion.

113
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.770
Come, good Lorenzo.

114
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.870
Fare ye well awhile.

115
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.800
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

116
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.030
Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.

117
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.270
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,

118
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.570
for Gratiano never lets me speak.

119
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.170
Well, keep me company but two years moe,

120
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.200
thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.

121
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.430
Fare you well.

122
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.300
I'll grow a talker for this gear.

123
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.930
Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable

124
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.400
in a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

125
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.130
Is that any thing now?

126
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.600
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,

127
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.400
more than any man in all Venice.

128
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.030
His reasons are as two grains of wheat

129
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.770
hid in two bushels of chaff.

130
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.170
You shall seek all day ere you find them,

131
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.170
and when you have them, they are not worth the search.

132
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.730
Well, tell me now what lady is the same

133
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.370
to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage

134
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.030
that you to-day promised to tell me of?

135
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.870
'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,

136
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.070
how much I have disabled mine estate

137
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.630
by something showing a more swelling port

138
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.170
than my faint means would grant continuance.

139
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.770
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate,

140
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.830
but my chief care is to come fairly off

141
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.200
from the great debts wherein my time

142
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.700
something too prodigal hath left me gaged.

143
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.670
To you, Antonio, I owe the most in money and in love.

144
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:13.970
And from your love,

145
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.200
I have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes

146
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.070
how to get clear of all the debts I owe.

147
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.970
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it.

148
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.930
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,

149
00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:26.670
within the eye of honour,

150
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:31.100
be assured my purse, my person, my extremest means

151
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.800
lie all unlocked to your occasions.

152
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.070
In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,

153
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.470
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight

154
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.730
the self-same way with more advised watch

155
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.170
to find the other forth.

156
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.830
And by adventuring both, I oft found both.

157
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.430
I urge this childhood proof,

158
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.800
because what follows is pure innocence.

159
00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.470
I owe you much,

160
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.830
and, like a wilful youth,

161
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.800
that which I owe is lost,

162
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.530
but if you please to shoot another arrow

163
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.370
that self way which you did shoot the first,

164
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.900
I do not doubt, as I will watch the aim,

165
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.130
or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again

166
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.100
and thankfully rest debtor for the first.

167
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.030
You know me well, and herein spend but time

168
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.430
to wind about my love with circumstance.

169
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.900
And out of doubt, you do me now more wrong

170
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.400
in making question of my uttermost

171
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.800
than if you had made waste of all I have.

172
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.430
Then do but say to me what I should do

173
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.330
that in your knowledge may by me be done,

174
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.470
and I am prest unto it.

175
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.570
Therefore, speak.

176
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.500
In Belmont is a lady richly left.

177
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.270
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,

178
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.800
of wondrous virtues.

179
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.630
Sometimes from her eyes,

180
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.730
I did receive fair speechless messages.

181
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.630
Her name is Portia,

182
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.930
nothing undervalued to Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia.

183
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.730
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,

184
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.130
for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors,

185
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.430
and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece,

186
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.300
which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,

187
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.670
and many Jasons come in quest of her.

188
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.970
Oh, my Antonio, had I but the means

189
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.370
to hold a rival place with one of them,

190
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.370
I have a mind presages me such thrift

191
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.800
that I should questionless be fortunate.

192
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.570
Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea.

193
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:53.300
Neither have I money nor commodity to raise a present sum.

194
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.830
Therefore, go forth.

195
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.930
Try what my credit can in Venice do

196
00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:01.170
that shall be racked, even to the uttermost,

197
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.230
to furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.

198
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.030
Go, presently inquire, and so will I, where money is.

199
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:13.430
And I no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake.

200
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.700
By my troth, Nerissa,

201
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.370
my little body is aweary of this great world.

202
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.570
You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries

203
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.700
were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are.

204
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:49.800
And yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much

205
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.930
as they that starve with nothing.

206
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.570
It is no mean happiness, therefore,

207
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.100
to be seated in the mean.

208
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.600
Superfluity comes sooner by white hairs,

209
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.670
but competency lives longer.

210
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.570
Good sentences and well pronounced.

211
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.770
They would be better if well followed.

212
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.230
If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,

213
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.230
chapels had been churches,

214
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.630
and poor men's cottages, princes' palaces.

215
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.300
It is a good divine that follows his own instructions.

216
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.100
I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done

217
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.700
than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.

218
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.400
The brain may devise laws for the blood,

219
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.030
but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree.

220
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.900
Such a hare is madness the youth

221
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.000
to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple.

222
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.200
But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband.

223
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.300
Oh, me, the word "choose."

224
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:53.900
I may neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I dislike.

225
00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:02.700
So is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father.

226
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.370
Is it not hard, Nerissa,

227
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.300
that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

228
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.700
Your father was ever virtuous.

229
00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.470
And holy men, at their death, have good inspirations.

230
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.430
Therefore, the lottery that he hath devised

231
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:22.670
in these three chests of gold, silver and lead,

232
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:28.000
whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you, will, no doubt,

233
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.430
never be chosen by any rightly but one whom you shall rightly love.

234
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.330
What warmth is there in your affections

235
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.630
towards any of these princely suitors that are already come?

236
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.170
I pray thee, over-name them.

237
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.800
And as thou namest them, I will describe them.

238
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.700
And, according to my description, level at my affection.

239
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.630
First, there is the Neapolitan prince.

240
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.200
Ay, that's a colt indeed,

241
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.470
for he doth nothing but talk of his horse.

242
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.970
And he makes it a great appropriation

243
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.800
to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself.

244
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.200
I am much afeard, my lady,

245
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.830
his mother played false with a smith.

246
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.470
Then there is the County Palatine.

247
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.730
He doth nothing but frown, as who should say,

248
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.170
"If you will not have me, choose."

249
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.600
He hears merry tales and smiles not.

250
00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.530
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old,

251
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.030
being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.

252
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.730
I had rather be married to a death's-head

253
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.900
with a bone in his mouth than to either of these.

254
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.300
God defend me from these two.

255
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:36.530
How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?

256
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.870
God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.

257
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.100
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker,

258
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.730
but, he, why, he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan's,

259
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.100
a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine.

260
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.200
He is every man in no man.

261
00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.730
If a throstle sing, he falls straight a capering.

262
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.230
He will fence with his own shadow.

263
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.230
If I should marry him, I should marry twenty husbands.

264
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.570
If he would despise me, I would forgive him,

265
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.800
for if he love me to madness, I shall never requite him.

266
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.600
What say you, then, to Falconbridge,

267
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.300
the young baron of England?

268
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.700
You know I say nothing to him,

269
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.470
for he understands not me, nor I him.

270
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.830
He hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian,

271
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.670
and you will come into the court

272
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.300
and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.

273
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.370
Oh, he is a proper man's picture,

274
00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.770
but, alas, who could converse with a dumb-show?

275
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.600
How oddly he is suited.

276
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.100
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France,

277
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.100
his bonnet in Germany, and his behavior everywhere.

278
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:38.100
What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor?

279
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.900
That he hath a neighborly charity in him,

280
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.830
for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman

281
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.930
and swore he would pay him again when he was able.

282
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:47.100
I think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another.

283
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:50.300
How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

284
00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.630
Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober,

285
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.270
and most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk.

286
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.130
When he is best, he is a little worse than a man,

287
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:04.070
and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast.

288
00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.670
And the worst fall that ever fell,

289
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.400
I hope I shall make shift to go without him.

290
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.530
If he should offer to choose, and choose the right casket,

291
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.570
you should refuse to perform your father's will

292
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.530
if you should refuse to accept him.

293
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.130
Therefore, for fear of the worst,

294
00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.400
I pray thee, set a deep glass of Rhenish wine

295
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.700
on the contrary casket, for if the devil be within

296
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.130
and that temptation without, I know he will choose it.

297
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.030
I will do any thing, Nerissa,

298
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.270
ere I will be married to a sponge.

299
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:34.500
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords.

300
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.130
They have acquainted me with their determinations,

301
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.000
which is, indeed, to return to their home

302
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.630
and to trouble you with no more suit

303
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.970
unless you may be won by some other sort

304
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.070
than your father's imposition depending on the caskets.

305
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:53.170
If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as Diana

306
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:58.500
unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will.

307
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.100
I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable,

308
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:05.570
for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence,

309
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.230
and I pray God grant them a fair departure.

310
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.430
Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time,

311
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.400
a Venetian, a scholar and a soldier

312
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.130
that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?

313
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:25.500
Yes, yes, it was Bassanio.

314
00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.070
As I think so was he called.

315
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.530
True, madam.

316
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:33.070
He, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon,

317
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:37.430
was the best deserving a fair lady.

318
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.030
I remember him well,

319
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.730
and I remember him worthy of thy praise.

320
00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.300
How now, what news?

321
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.470
The four strangers seek for you, Madam, to take their leave.

322
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.430
And there is a forerunner come from a fifth,

323
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:52.500
the Prince of Morocco,

324
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:57.630
who brings word the prince, his master, will be here to-night.

325
00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.770
If I could bid the fifth welcome

326
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.370
with so good heart as I bid the other four farewell,

327
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.970
I should be glad of his approach.

328
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.270
If he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil,

329
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.330
I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.

330
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.970
Come, Nerissa.

331
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.430
Sirrah, go before.

332
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:22.370
Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.

333
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.230
3,000 ducats.

334
00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.200
Well--

335
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.570
Ay, sir, for three months.

336
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.670
For three months.

337
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.770
Well--

338
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.430
For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

339
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.670
Antonio shall become bound.

340
00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.070
Well.

341
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.570
May you stead me?

342
00:17:58.570 --> 00:17:59.870
Will you pleasure me?

343
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.800
Shall I know your answer?

344
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.470
3,000 ducats for three months and Antonio bound.

345
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.530
Your answer to that.

346
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.870
Antonio is a good man.

347
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.730
Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?

348
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.170
Oh, no, no, no.

349
00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.470
My meaning in saying he is a good man

350
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:26.830
is to have you understand me that he is sufficient.

351
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:30.100
Yet his means are in supposition.

352
00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.230
He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the Indies.

353
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:35.500
I understand moreover, upon the Rialto,

354
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.370
he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England,

355
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:43.600
and other ventures he hath squandered abroad.

356
00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.500
But ships are but boards, sailors but men.

357
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.170
There be land-rats and water-rats,

358
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.330
land-thieves and water-thieves--

359
00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:56.230
I mean pirates--

360
00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:00.830
and then there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.

361
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:07.870
The man is--notwithstanding-- sufficient.

362
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.430
3,000 ducats.

363
00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.970
I think I may take his bond.

364
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:17.070
Be assured you may.

365
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.570
I will be assured I may.

366
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.130
And, that I may be assured, I will bethink me.

367
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.430
May I speak with Antonio?

368
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.100
If it please you to dine with us.

369
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.030
Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation

370
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:31.100
which your prophet, the Nazarite,

371
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.570
conjured the devil into.

372
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.730
I will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,

373
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:36.100
walk with you, and so following,

374
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.730
but I will not eat with you, drink with you,

375
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.100
nor pray with you.

376
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.870
What news on the Rialto?

377
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:43.970
Who is he comes here?

378
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:46.330
This is Signior Antonio.

379
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:50.200
How like a fawning publican he looks.

380
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.100
I hate him for he is a Christian,

381
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.270
but more, for that, in low simplicity,

382
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.100
he lends out money gratis

383
00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.430
and brings down the rate of usance here with us in Venice.

384
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.130
If I can catch him once upon the hip,

385
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.170
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.

386
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.070
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,

387
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.970
even there where merchants most do congregate,

388
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.870
on me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,

389
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.200
which he calls interest.

390
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.900
Cursed be my tribe if I forgive him.

391
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.030
Shylock, do you hear?

392
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.470
I am debating of my present store.

393
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.400
And, by the near guess of my memory,

394
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.700
I cannot instantly raise up the gross

395
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.800
of full 3,000 ducats.

396
00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.930
What of that?

397
00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.130
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, will furnish me.

398
00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:42.400
But soft.

399
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.130
How many months do you desire?

400
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:47.600
Rest you fair, good signior.

401
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.630
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

402
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:53.270
Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow

403
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.300
by taking nor by giving of excess,

404
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.200
yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,

405
00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.430
I'll break a custom.

406
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.070
Is he yet possessed how much ye would?

407
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.400
Ay, ay, 3,000 ducats.

408
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.670
And for three months.

409
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:05.430
I had forgot-- three months.

410
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.730
You told me so.

411
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.070
Well then, your bond.

412
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.770
And let me see.

413
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:13.070
But hear you.

414
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:18.900
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow upon advantage.

415
00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.170
I do never use it.

416
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:26.200
When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--

417
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.200
this Jacob from our holy Abram was,

418
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.970
as his wise mother wrought in his behalf, the third possessor.

419
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.170
Ay, he was the third--

420
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.370
And what of him?

421
00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:35.570
Did he take interest?

422
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.000
No, not take interest,

423
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.630
not, as you would say, directly interest.

424
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:42.630
Mark what Jacob did.

425
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.800
When Laban and himself were compromised

426
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.970
that all the eanlings which were streaked and pied

427
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.300
should fall as Jacob's hire.

428
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.600
The ewes, being rank,

429
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.630
in the end of autumn turned to the rams.

430
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.770
And, when the work of generation

431
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.970
was between these woolly breeders in the act,

432
00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.630
the skilful shepherd peeled me certain wands.

433
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.930
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,

434
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.570
he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,

435
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.400
who then conceiving did. in eaning time,

436
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.730
fall parti-coloured lambs, and those were Jacob's.

437
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.070
This was a way to thrive, and he was blessed.

438
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.430
And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.

439
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.870
This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for,

440
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.500
a thing not in his power to bring to pass,

441
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.670
but swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven.

442
00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:40.070
Was this inserted to make interest good?

443
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:41.770
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

444
00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.000
I cannot tell.

445
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
I make it breed as fast.

446
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:48.930
But note me, signior.

447
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:50.330
Mark you this, Bassanio,

448
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.100
the devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.

449
00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.830
An evil soul producing holy witness

450
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.030
is like a villain with a smiling cheek,

451
00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.570
a goodly apple rotten at the heart.

452
00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.970
Oh, what a goodly outside falsehood hath.

453
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:08.600
3,000 ducats, 'tis a good, round sum.

454
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.670
Three months from twelve.

455
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:14.030
Now, let me see.

456
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.270
The rate--

457
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.230
Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

458
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:26.100
Signior Antonio, many a time and oft in the Rialto,

459
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:30.800
you have rated me about my money and my usances.

460
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.370
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,

461
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.470
for sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.

462
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.100
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,

463
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.870
and spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,

464
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.200
and all for use of that which is mine own.

465
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.470
Well then, it now appears you need my help.

466
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.770
Go to, then.

467
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:54.100
You come to me, and you say,

468
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.870
"Shylock, we would have moneys."

469
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:57.070
You say so.

470
00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.100
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard

471
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.970
and foot me as you spurn a stranger

472
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.330
cur over your threshold.

473
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.970
Moneys is your suit.

474
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.500
What should I say to you?

475
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.870
Should I not say "Hath a dog money?

476
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.330
Is it possible a cur can lend 3,000 ducats?"

477
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.700
Or shall I bend low and in a bondman's key

478
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:18.570
with bated breath

479
00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.630
and whispering humbleness say this,

480
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.400
"Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last.

481
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.670
"You spurn'd me such a day.

482
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.230
"Another time, you called me dog.

483
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.200
And for these courtesies, I'll lend you thus much moneys"?

484
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.000
I am as like to call thee so again,

485
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.400
to spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.

486
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.370
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not as to thy friends.

487
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.570
For when did friendship take a breed

488
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.330
of barren metal for his friend?

489
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.330
But lend it rather to thine enemy who, if he break,

490
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.200
thou mayst with better face exact the penalty.

491
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:50.530
Why, look you, how you storm.

492
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.200
I would be friends with you and have your love--

493
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.330
forget the shames that you have stained me with--

494
00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.830
supply your present wants

495
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.200
and take no doit of usance for my moneys,

496
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.430
and you'll not hear me.

497
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.700
This is kind I offer.

498
00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.830
This were kindness.

499
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.970
This kindness will I show.

500
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.400
Go with me to a notary.

501
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.100
Seal me there your single bond.

502
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.270
And, in a merry sport--

503
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.400
If you repay me not on such a day, in such a place,

504
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.830
such sum or sums as are expressed in the condition,

505
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:32.070
let the forfeit be nominated for an equal pound of your fair flesh

506
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:36.170
to be cut off and taken in what part of your body pleaseth me.

507
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.570
Content, i' faith.

508
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.830
I'll seal to such a bond

509
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:42.070
and say there is much kindness in the Jew.

510
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.470
You shall not seal to such a bond for me.

511
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.470
I'd rather dwell in my necessity.

512
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:49.670
Fear not, man.

513
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.800
I will not forfeit it.

514
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.930
Within these two months,

515
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.600
that's a month before this bond expires,

516
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.730
I do expect return

517
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:56.530
of thrice three times the value of this bond.

518
00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:01.700
Oh, father Abraham, what these Christians are

519
00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:06.500
whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect the thoughts of others.

520
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.730
Pray you, tell me this.

521
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.800
If he should break his day, what should I gain

522
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.730
by the exaction of the forfeiture?

523
00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:15.130
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man is not so estimable,

524
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.930
profitable neither, as flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.

525
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:23.670
I say, to buy his favour, I extend this friendship.

526
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.230
If he will take it, so.

527
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.000
If not, adieu.

528
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.700
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

529
00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.030
Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

530
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.870
Then meet me forthwith at the notary's.

531
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.600
Give him direction for this merry bond,

532
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.130
and I will go and purse the ducats straight,

533
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.600
see to my house

534
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.200
left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave,

535
00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.270
and presently I will be with you.

536
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:50.800
Hie thee, gentle Jew.

537
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.630
The Hebrew will turn Christian-- he grows kind.

538
00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.330
I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

539
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:01.530
Come on.

540
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.100
In this there can be no dismay.

541
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.930
My ships come home a month before the day.

542
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:28.070
Mislike me not for my complexion,

543
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:30.300
the shadowed livery of the burnished sun

544
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.370
to whom I am a neighbour and near bred.

545
00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:35.330
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,

546
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:39.630
where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles.

547
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.500
And let us make incision for your love,

548
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.830
to prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.

549
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:52.900
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine hath feared the valiant.

550
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.500
By my love, I swear the best-regarded virgins

551
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.730
of our clime have loved it too.

552
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.870
I would not change this hue,

553
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:07.170
except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

554
00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:10.230
In terms of choice, I am not solely led

555
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:13.530
by nice direction of a maiden's eyes.

556
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.530
Besides, the lottery of my destiny

557
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:18.370
bars me the right of voluntary choosing.

558
00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:22.370
But if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit,

559
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.000
to yield myself his wife

560
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.270
who wins me by that means I told you,

561
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:30.030
yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair

562
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.900
as any comer I have looked on yet for my affection.

563
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.470
Even for that, I thank you.

564
00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.770
Therefore, I pray you,

565
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.170
lead me to the caskets to try my fortune.

566
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.300
AAGGHH!

567
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.230
By this scimitar that slew the Sophy

568
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.270
and a Persian prince that won three fields of Sultan Solyman,

569
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.970
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,

570
00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:03.000
outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,

571
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.600
pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,

572
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.700
yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey to win thee, lady.

573
00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.100
But, alas the while.

574
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:23.430
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice which is the better man,

575
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:28.530
the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand.

576
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:32.000
So is Alcides beaten by his page.

577
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.670
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,

578
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.700
miss that which one unworthier may attain

579
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.430
and die with grieving.

580
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:47.070
You must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all

581
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:51.070
or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong,

582
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.300
never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage.

583
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.770
Therefore, be advised.

584
00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:01.570
Nor will not.

585
00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.430
Come, bring me unto my chance.

586
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:06.470
First, forward to the temple.

587
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.930
After dinner, your hazard shall be made.

588
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.100
Good fortune then

589
00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.770
to make me blessed or cursedest among men.

590
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:35.570
Certainly my conscience will serve me

591
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:38.130
to run from this Jew, my master.

592
00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:42.270
But the fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me, saying to me,

593
00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:48.470
"Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot,"

594
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:53.200
or "good Gobbo,"

595
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.330
or "good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs.

596
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.500
Take the start; run away."

597
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.400
My conscience says,

598
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.470
"No, take heed, honest Launcelot.

599
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.070
"Take heed, honest Gobbo," or, as aforesaid,

600
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.370
"Honest Launcelot Gobbo, do not run.

601
00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.100
Scorn running with thy heels"

602
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.500
Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack.

603
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.330
"Via," says the fiend.

604
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:21.970
"Away," says the fiend.

605
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.730
"For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind," says the fiend,

606
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:26.800
"and run."

607
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.230
Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart,

608
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.570
says very wisely to me,

609
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:37.170
"My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest man's son"--

610
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:41.600
or rather an honest woman's son, for, indeed,

611
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.870
my father did something smack, something grow to,

612
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:48.300
he had a kind of taste.

613
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.770
Well, my conscience says "Launcelot, budge not."

614
00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:52.870
"Budge," says the fiend.

615
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:54.200
"Budge not," says my conscience.

616
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:58.500
"Conscience," say I, "you counsel well."

617
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.570
"Fiend," say I, "you counsel well."

618
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.970
To be ruled by my conscience,

619
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.430
I should stay with the Jew, my master,

620
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:10.430
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil.

621
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.670
And, to run away from the Jew,

622
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.230
I should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your reverence,

623
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.800
is the devil himself.

624
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.030
Certainly, the Jew is the very devil incarnation.

625
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.930
And, in my conscience,

626
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:29.300
my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience

627
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.430
to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew.

628
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.130
The fiend gives more friendly counsel.

629
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.330
I will run, fiend.

630
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.700
My heels are at your commandment.

631
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.170
I will run.

632
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:47.630
Master, young man, you, I pray you,

633
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.300
which is the way to master Jew's?

634
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.030
Oh, heavens, this is my true-begotten father,

635
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:59.270
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.

636
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.700
I will try confusions with him.

637
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.400
Master, young gentleman, I pray you,

638
00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.730
which is the way to master Jew's?

639
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.770
Turn up on your right hand at the next turning,

640
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.970
but, at the next turning of all, on your left.

641
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.900
Marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand,

642
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.530
but turn down indirectly to the Jew's house.

643
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:25.070
By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit.

644
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.770
Can you tell me whether one Launcelot

645
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:31.030
that dwells with him dwell with him or no?

646
00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:35.200
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

647
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.330
Mark me now.

648
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.830
Now I will raise the waters.

649
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:44.530
Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

650
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.700
No master, but a poor man's son.

651
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:52.400
His father, though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man

652
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.200
and, God be thanked, well to live.

653
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.170
Well, let his father be what a' will.

654
00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:02.230
We talk of young Master Launcelot.

655
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:05.870
Your worship's friend and Launcelot.

656
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.870
But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,

657
00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.700
talk you of young Master Launcelot?

658
00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.100
Of Launcelot, sir, an't please your mastership.

659
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.930
Ergo, Master Launcelot!

660
00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:23.700
Talk not of Master Launcelot, father,

661
00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.970
for that gentleman, according to Fates and Destinies

662
00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:29.870
and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three

663
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:35.000
and such branches of learning, is indeed deceased,

664
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.230
or, as you would say in plain terms, gone to heaven.

665
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.530
Marry, God forbid.

666
00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:46.570
The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.

667
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:51.270
Do I look like a hovel-post, a cudgel, a staff or a prop?

668
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.300
Do you know me, father?

669
00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.200
Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman.

670
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.800
But, I pray you, tell me,

671
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.500
is my boy, God rest his soul, alive or dead?

672
00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.470
Do you not know me, father?

673
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.230
Alack, sir, I am sand-blind.

674
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.430
I know you not.

675
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.130
Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes,

676
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:10.670
you might fail of knowing me.

677
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.970
It is a wise father that knows his own child.

678
00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.470
Well, old man, I will tell you news of your son.

679
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.630
Give me your blessing.

680
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.000
Truth will come to light.

681
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.430
Murder cannot be hid long.

682
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.670
A man's son maybe, but, in the end, truth will out.

683
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:31.030
Pray you, sir, stand up.

684
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:34.270
I am sure you are not Launcelot, my boy.

685
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.670
Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it,

686
00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.330
but give me your blessing.

687
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:41.830
I am Launcelot, your boy that was,

688
00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.200
your son that is, your child that shall be.

689
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.870
I cannot think you are my son.

690
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:50.300
I know not what I shall think of that,

691
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.330
but I am Launcelot, the Jew's man,

692
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.500
and I am sure Margery, your wife, is my mother.

693
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.300
Her name is Margery, indeed.

694
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.400
I'll be sworn, if thou be Launcelot,

695
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.800
thou art my own flesh and blood.

696
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.500
Lord worshipped might he be.

697
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:13.870
What a beard hast thou got.

698
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:15.900
Thou hast more hair on thy chin

699
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.330
than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

700
00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.670
It should seem, then, Dobbin's tail grows backward.

701
00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:23.130
I am sure he had more hair of his tail

702
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:25.070
than I of my face when I last saw him.

703
00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.900
Lord, how art thou changed.

704
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.400
How dost thou and thy master agree?

705
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.300
I have brought him a present.

706
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.830
How 'gree thee now?

707
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.130
Well, well.

708
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:39.800
But, for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away,

709
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.200
so I will not rest till I have run some ground.

710
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.530
My master's a very Jew.

711
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:45.870
Give him a present?

712
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.970
Give him a halter.

713
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:50.130
I am famished in his service.

714
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.500
You may tell every finger I have with my ribs.

715
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.170
Father, I am glad you are come.

716
00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:59.330
Give me your present to one Master Bassanio,

717
00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.200
who, indeed, gives rare new liveries,

718
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.400
If I serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground.

719
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.530
Oh, rare fortune.

720
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:09.800
Here comes the man.

721
00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:13.830
To him, father, for I am a Jew if I serve a Jew any longer.

722
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.000
You may do so, but let it be so hasted

723
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.830
that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock.

724
00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:23.030
See these letters delivered.

725
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:24.670
Put the liveries to making,

726
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:29.000
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

727
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.200
To him, father.

728
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.930
God bless your worship.

729
00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.270
Gramercy.

730
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.670
Wouldst thou aught with me?

731
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:40.100
Here's my son, sir, a poor boy.

732
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.270
Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man

733
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.300
that would, sir, as my father shall specify--

734
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.400
He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--

735
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.770
Indeed, sir, the short and long is, I serve the Jew,

736
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.030
and have a desire, as my father should specify--

737
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:56.330
He and his master, sir, saving your worship's reverence,

738
00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.170
are scarce cater-cousins--

739
00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.330
To be very brief, sir,

740
00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:01.130
the truth is the Jew, having done me wrong,

741
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.830
doth cause me, as my father, being,

742
00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:05.230
I hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--

743
00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:08.600
I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow on your worship,

744
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:09.900
and my suit is--

745
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.670
To be very brief, sir, the suit is impertinent to myself,

746
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:14.930
as your worship shall know by this honest old man.

747
00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:18.470
And, though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.

748
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.170
One speak for both.

749
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:24.930
What would you?

750
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.830
Serve you, sir.

751
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.570
That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

752
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:35.170
I know thee well; thou hast obtained thy suit.

753
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:37.270
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day

754
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.500
and hath preferred thee,

755
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.000
if it be preferment to leave a rich Jew's service

756
00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.870
to become the follower of so poor a gentleman.

757
00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:46.330
The old proverb is well parted

758
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:48.400
between my master Shylock and you, sir.

759
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:54.330
You have the grace of God, sir, and he hath enough.

760
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.330
Thou speak'st it well.

761
00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.570
Go, father, with thy son.

762
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.300
Take leave of thy old master and inquire my lodging out.

763
00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:04.800
Give him a livery more guarded than his fellows'.

764
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.170
See it done.

765
00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:09.630
Father, in.

766
00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.630
I cannot get a service, no.

767
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:14.900
I have ne'er a tongue in my head.

768
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:17.970
Well, if any man in Italy have a fairer table

769
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:20.770
which doth offer to swear upon a book,

770
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.930
I shall have good fortune.

771
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.570
Go to, here's a simple line of life.

772
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:30.130
Here's a small trifle of wives.

773
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.370
Alas, fifteen wives is nothing.

774
00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.000
Eleven widows and nine maids

775
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.030
is a simple coming-in for one man.

776
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:40.200
And then to 'scape drowning thrice,

777
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.430
and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed.

778
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.230
Here are simple 'scapes.

779
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:49.030
Well, if Fortune be a woman,

780
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.030
she's a good wench for this gear.

781
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:52.230
Father, come.

782
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:56.130
I'll take my leave of the Jew in a twinkling.

783
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.070
I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.

784
00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.430
These things being bought and orderly bestowed,

785
00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:02.230
return in haste, for I do feast to-night

786
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.630
my best-esteemed acquaintance.

787
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:06.530
Hie thee, go.

788
00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.170
My best endeavours shall be done herein.

789
00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:11.830
Where is your master?

790
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.030
Yonder, sir, he walks.

791
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.270
Signior Bassanio!

792
00:40:14.270 --> 00:40:15.370
Gratiano!

793
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.600
I have a suit to you.

794
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.800
You have obtained it.

795
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.000
You must not deny me.

796
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.470
I must go with you to Belmont.

797
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.800
Why then, you must.

798
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:26.030
But hear thee, Gratiano.

799
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:31.600
Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice.

800
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.430
Parts which become thee happily enough

801
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:35.700
and in such eyes as ours appear not faults.

802
00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.100
But where thou art not known,

803
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.270
why, there they show something too liberal.

804
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:43.730
Pray thee, take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty

805
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:47.770
thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior,

806
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:52.130
I be misconstrued in the place I go to and lose my hopes.

807
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.030
Signior Bassanio, hear me.

808
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.100
If I do not put on a sober habit,

809
00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:02.330
talk with respect, and swear but now and then,

810
00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.500
wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely, nay more,

811
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.670
while grace is saying, hood mine eyes thus with my hat,

812
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:10.670
and sigh and say "amen,"

813
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:12.930
use all the observance of civility

814
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.930
like one well studied in a sad ostent

815
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:18.170
to please his grandam, never trust me more.

816
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:21.570
Well, we shall see your bearing.

817
00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:22.770
Nay, but I bar tonight.

818
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:24.930
You shall not gauge me by what we do tonight.

819
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.400
No, that were pity.

820
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.530
I would entreat you rather

821
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.230
to put on your boldest suit of mirth,

822
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:31.030
for we have friends that purpose merriment.

823
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.170
But fare thee well.

824
00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.400
I have some business.

825
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.800
And I must to Lorenzo and the rest,

826
00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.470
but we will visit you at supper time.

827
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.430
I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.

828
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.530
Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,

829
00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:47.170
didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.

830
00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:52.230
But fare thee well.

831
00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.530
There is a ducat for thee.

832
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:59.070
And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo,

833
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.300
who is thy new master's guest.

834
00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.400
Give him this letter.

835
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.930
Do it secretly.

836
00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:05.700
And so farewell.

837
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.830
I would not have my father see me in talk with thee.

838
00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:08.970
Adieu.

839
00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.530
Tears exhibit my tongue.

840
00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:15.070
Most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew.

841
00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.100
If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee,

842
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.370
I am much deceived.

843
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.400
But, adieu.

844
00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:25.500
These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.

845
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.300
Adieu.

846
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.300
Farewell, good Launcelot.

847
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.370
Alack, what heinous sin is it in me

848
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.570
to be ashamed to be my father's child?

849
00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:56.030
But though I am a daughter to his blood,

850
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:59.330
I am not to his manners.

851
00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:04.000
Oh, Lorenzo, if thou keep promise,

852
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.430
I shall end this strife,

853
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:09.370
become a Christian and thy loving wife.

854
00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:11.570
Nay, we will slink away in supper time,

855
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.700
disguise us at my lodging, and return, all in an hour.

856
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.130
We have not made good preparation.

857
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.930
We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

858
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:20.730
'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered

859
00:43:20.730 --> 00:43:22.730
and better, in my mind, not undertook.

860
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.130
'Tis now but four o'clock.

861
00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.170
We have two hours to furnish us.

862
00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:27.830
Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

863
00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:29.730
An it shall please you to break up this.

864
00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.330
It shall seem to signify.

865
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.170
Mm-hmm.

866
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:34.800
I know the hand.

867
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.100
In faith, 'tis a fair hand.

868
00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.700
And whiter than the paper it writ on

869
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.930
is the fair hand that writ.

870
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:41.100
Love news, in faith.

871
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.300
By your leave, sir.

872
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.500
Whither goest thou?

873
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.070
Marry, sir, to bid my old master the Jew

874
00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.830
to sup tonight with my new master the Christian.

875
00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:49.670
Hold, here, take this.

876
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:53.030
Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her.

877
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.200
Speak it privately.

878
00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.630
Go, gentlemen.

879
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:59.770
Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?

880
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.870
I am provided of a torch-bearer.

881
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.570
Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.

882
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.800
And so will I.

883
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.700
Meet me and Gratiano at Gratiano's lodging

884
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.230
some hour hence.

885
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:09.430
'Tis good we do so.

886
00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.470
Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

887
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:14.200
I must needs tell thee all.

888
00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.530
She hath directed

889
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:17.400
how I shall take her from her father's house,

890
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.870
what gold and jewels she is furnished with,

891
00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.470
what page's suit she hath in readiness.

892
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.270
If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,

893
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.470
it will be for his gentle daughter's sake.

894
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:29.470
And never dare misfortune cross her foot,

895
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.130
unless she do it under this excuse,

896
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:34.170
that she is issue to a faithless Jew.

897
00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:35.400
Come, go with me.

898
00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.700
Peruse this as thou goest.

899
00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.800
Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

900
00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:45.030
Well, thou shalt see.

901
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:49.300
Thy eyes shall be thy judge

902
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.130
the difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.

903
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.330
What, Jessica.

904
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:59.570
Thou shalt not gormandize as thou hast done with me.

905
00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:01.530
What, Jessica.

906
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.230
Nor sleep and snore and rend apparel out.

907
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:07.530
Why, Jessica, I say!

908
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.630
Why, Jessica!

909
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:09.830
Who bids thee call?

910
00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.430
I do not bid thee call.

911
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.200
Your worship was wont to tell me

912
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:14.930
I could do nothing without bidding.

913
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:16.170
Call you?

914
00:45:16.170 --> 00:45:17.370
What is your will?

915
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:18.770
I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.

916
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:21.100
There are my keys.

917
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:23.000
But wherefore should I go?

918
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.030
I am not bid for love.

919
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.000
They flatter me.

920
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.330
But yet I'll go in hate to feed upon the prodigal Christian.

921
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:36.970
Jessica, my girl, look to my house.

922
00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:40.300
I am right loath to go.

923
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:45.170
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,

924
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:49.070
for I did dream of moneybags tonight.

925
00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.800
I beseech you, sir, go.

926
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.570
My young master doth expect your reproach.

927
00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.430
So do I his.

928
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.030
An they have conspired together.

929
00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:02.130
I will not say you shall see a masque,

930
00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:04.930
but if you do, then it was not for nothing

931
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.400
that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last

932
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.970
at 6:00 i' the morning, falling out that year

933
00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.470
on Ash Wednesday was four year, in the afternoon.

934
00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:13.600
What, are there masques?

935
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.130
Hear you me, Jessica.

936
00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:16.270
Lock up my doors.

937
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:17.770
And when you hear the drum

938
00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:20.000
and the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife,

939
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.970
clamber not you up to the casements then,

940
00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.770
nor thrust your head into the public street

941
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.900
to gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces,

942
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.630
but stop my house's ears.

943
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.870
I mean my casements.

944
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:37.630
Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter my sober house.

945
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:41.630
By Jacob's staff, I swear,

946
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.630
I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.

947
00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.870
But I will go.

948
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.330
Go you before me, sirrah.

949
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:51.570
Say I will come.

950
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.030
I will go before you, sir.

951
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.170
Mistress, look out the window for all this.

952
00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:59.130
There will come a Christian by, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

953
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:07.470
What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, huh?

954
00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.430
His words were "Farewell mistress."

955
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:11.470
Nothing else.

956
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:16.730
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder.

957
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:20.600
Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day

958
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.770
more than the wildcat.

959
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.800
Drones hive not with me.

960
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.530
Therefore I part with him,

961
00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.830
and part with him to one that I would have him help

962
00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.170
to waste his borrowed purse.

963
00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:31.900
Well, Jessica, go in.

964
00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.600
Perhaps I will return immediately.

965
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.930
Do as I bid you.

966
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.030
Shut doors after you.

967
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:41.770
Fast bind, fast find.

968
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:46.770
A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

969
00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:00.900
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crossed,

970
00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:07.600
I have a father, you a daughter lost.

971
00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.070
This is the penthouse

972
00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.430
under which Lorenzo desired us to make stand.

973
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:29.770
His hour is almost past.

974
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.800
And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,

975
00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.700
for lovers ever run before the clock.

976
00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:36.700
Oh, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly

977
00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.900
to seal love's bonds new-made

978
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.530
than they are wont to keep obliged faith unforfeited.

979
00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:42.900
That ever holds.

980
00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.370
Who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite

981
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:46.730
that he sits down?

982
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.370
Where is the horse that doth untread again

983
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:51.800
his tedious measures with the unbated fire

984
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.770
that he did pace them first?

985
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:58.870
All things that are, are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.

986
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:02.170
How like a younker or a prodigal

987
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:05.430
the scarfed bark puts from her native bay,

988
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.330
hugged and embraced by the strumpet wind.

989
00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:10.430
How like a prodigal doth she return

990
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.400
with over-weathered ribs and ragged sails,

991
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.930
lean, rent and beggared by the strumpet wind.

992
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:18.300
Here comes Lorenzo.

993
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.670
More of this hereafter.

994
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:23.170
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.

995
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:25.900
Not I, but my affairs have made you wait.

996
00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.800
When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,

997
00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:30.500
I'll watch as long for you then.

998
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:35.270
Approach, here dwells my father Jew.

999
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.100
Ho!

1000
00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:41.270
Sshh.

1001
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.230
Who's within?

1002
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.230
Who are you?

1003
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:49.570
Tell me, for more certainty,

1004
00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.630
albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

1005
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.270
Lorenzo, and thy love.

1006
00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:00.800
Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed, for who love I so much?

1007
00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.830
And now who knows but you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

1008
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:07.200
Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

1009
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.870
Here, catch this casket.

1010
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:11.730
It is worth the pains.

1011
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.030
I am glad 'tis night.

1012
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.470
You do not look on me,

1013
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.930
For I am much ashamed of my exchange.

1014
00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.470
But love is blind and lovers cannot see

1015
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.630
the pretty follies that themselves commit,

1016
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:24.330
for if they could, Cupid himself would blush

1017
00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:26.600
to see me thus transformed to a boy.

1018
00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.030
Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

1019
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:32.430
What, must I hold a candle to my shames?

1020
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:34.900
They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.

1021
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.100
Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love.

1022
00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.270
And I should be obscured.

1023
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:40.730
So are you, sweet, even in the lovely garnish of a boy.

1024
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:41.970
But come at once.

1025
00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:44.200
For the close night doth play the runaway,

1026
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:46.500
and we are stayed for at Bassanio's feast.

1027
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.630
I will make fast the doors

1028
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.470
and gild myself with some more ducats

1029
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.500
and be with you straight.

1030
00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:56.830
By my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

1031
00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:00.270
Beshrew me but I love her heartily.

1032
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:02.530
For she is wise, if I can judge of her.

1033
00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:05.130
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.

1034
00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.430
And true she is, as she hath proved herself.

1035
00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.630
And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,

1036
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.700
shall she be placed in my constant soul.

1037
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.030
What, art thou come?

1038
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:17.230
On, gentlemen; away.

1039
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:19.370
Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

1040
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:20.430
Who's there?

1041
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:25.300
Signior Antonio.

1042
00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:26.800
Fie, fie, Gratiano.

1043
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.170
Where are all the rest?

1044
00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:29.430
'Tis nine o'clock.

1045
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:30.730
Our friends all stay for you.

1046
00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:32.030
No masque tonight.

1047
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.270
The wind is come about.

1048
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:35.070
Bassanio presently will go aboard.

1049
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:36.730
I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

1050
00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:38.100
I am glad on't.

1051
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.970
I desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight.

1052
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.330
Go draw aside the curtains

1053
00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:57.730
and discover the several caskets to this noble prince.

1054
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:02.800
Now make your choice.

1055
00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.230
The first, of gold,

1056
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:21.900
who this inscription bears:

1057
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:27.370
"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."

1058
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.770
The second, silver,

1059
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:34.270
which this promise carries:

1060
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:38.870
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

1061
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:46.900
This third, dull lead,

1062
00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.630
with warning all as blunt.

1063
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:52.600
"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath."

1064
00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.270
How shall I know if I do choose the right?

1065
00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:02.230
The one of them contains my picture, prince.

1066
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:05.300
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

1067
00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.900
Some god, direct my judgment.

1068
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.300
Let me see.

1069
00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:21.570
I will survey the inscriptions back again.

1070
00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:24.470
What says the leaden casket?

1071
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:28.070
"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath."

1072
00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:29.770
"Must give"?

1073
00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:31.230
For what?

1074
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:32.700
For lead?

1075
00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.200
Hazard for lead?

1076
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:36.930
This casket threatens.

1077
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:40.530
Men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages.

1078
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:44.470
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross.

1079
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:49.200
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.

1080
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:54.070
What says the silver with her virgin hue?

1081
00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:59.570
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

1082
00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.600
"As much as he deserves"?

1083
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:06.670
Pause there, Morocco, and weigh thy value with an even hand.

1084
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:09.130
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation

1085
00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:11.330
Thou dost deserve enough.

1086
00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:15.230
And yet enough may not extend so far as to the lady.

1087
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:19.230
And yet to be afeard of my deserving

1088
00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:22.270
were but a weak disabling of myself.

1089
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:23.530
"As much as I deserve"?

1090
00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:24.700
Why, that's the lady.

1091
00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.700
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes, in graces,

1092
00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.130
and in qualities of breeding.

1093
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:36.030
But more than these, in love I do deserve.

1094
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:42.430
What if I strayed no farther, but chose here?

1095
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:53.630
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold.

1096
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:57.830
"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."

1097
00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.930
Why, that's the lady.

1098
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:03.130
All the world desires her.

1099
00:55:03.130 --> 00:55:04.630
From the four corners of the earth,

1100
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:08.300
they come to kiss this shrine, this mortal, breathing saint.

1101
00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.400
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds of wide Arabia

1102
00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.830
are as throughfares now for princes to come view fair Portia.

1103
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:17.230
The watery kingdom

1104
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.730
whose ambitious head spits in the face of heaven

1105
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:21.600
is no bar to stop the foreign spirits,

1106
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.030
but they come as o'er a brook to see fair Portia.

1107
00:55:31.770 --> 00:55:36.270
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.

1108
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:40.470
Is it like that lead contains her?

1109
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:43.770
'Twere damnation to think so base a thought.

1110
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:48.470
It were too gross to rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.

1111
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:53.700
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,

1112
00:55:53.700 --> 00:56:02.100
being ten times undervalued to tried gold?

1113
00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:03.900
Oh, sinful thought.

1114
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.070
Never so rich a gem was set in worse than gold.

1115
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.670
They have in England a coin

1116
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:11.930
that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold

1117
00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:14.730
but that's insculped upon.

1118
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:25.830
But here, an angel in a golden bed lies all within.

1119
00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:28.470
Deliver me the key.

1120
00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:32.500
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may.

1121
00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.000
There, take it, prince.

1122
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.130
And if my form lie there, then I am yours.

1123
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:55.900
Oh, hell.

1124
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.470
What have we here?

1125
00:57:00.970 --> 00:57:03.200
A carrion death

1126
00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.700
within whose empty eye there is a written scroll.

1127
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:13.800
I'll read the writing.

1128
00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:18.700
"All that glisters is not gold.

1129
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.130
"Often have you heard that told.

1130
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:26.230
"Many a man his life hath sold, but my outside to behold.

1131
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:31.130
"Gilded tombs do worms enfold.

1132
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:34.300
"Had you been as wise as bold,

1133
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:38.130
"young in limbs, in judgment old,

1134
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:41.000
"your answer had not been inscrolled.

1135
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.400
Fare you well, your suit is cold."

1136
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:57.900
Cold indeed, and labor lost.

1137
00:57:57.900 --> 00:58:03.970
Then farewell, heat, and welcome, frost.

1138
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:10.600
Portia, adieu.

1139
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:14.370
I have too grieved a heart to take a tedious leave.

1140
00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:18.500
Thus losers part.

1141
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:28.900
A gentle riddance.

1142
00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:30.970
Draw the curtains, go.

1143
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:35.430
Let all of his complexion choose me so.

1144
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.930
Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail!

1145
00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:48.970
With him is Gratiano gone along

1146
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:51.000
and in their ship, I am sure Lorenzo is not.

1147
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.370
The villain Jew with outcries raised the Duke,

1148
00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:55.270
who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

1149
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.600
He came too late.

1150
00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.830
The ship was under sail.

1151
00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:00.230
But there the Duke was given to understand

1152
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:02.100
that in a gondola were seen together

1153
00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.270
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.

1154
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:07.100
Besides, Antonio certified the Duke

1155
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:09.070
they were not with Bassanio in his ship.

1156
00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:11.930
I never heard a passion so confused,

1157
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:14.730
so strange, outrageous, and so variable

1158
00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:17.970
as the dog Jew did utter in the streets.

1159
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:19.500
"My daughter.

1160
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.130
"Oh, my ducats.

1161
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.800
"Oh, my daughter fled with a Christian.

1162
00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.030
"Oh, my Christian ducats!

1163
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:32.000
"Justice, the law, my ducats, and my daughter.

1164
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.670
"A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,

1165
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:39.600
"of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter.

1166
00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.570
"And Jewels, oh, two stones, two rich and precious stones

1167
00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.630
"stolen by my daughter.

1168
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:49.070
"Justice, find the girl.

1169
00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.300
She hath the stones upon her and the ducats."

1170
00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:54.570
Why, all the boys in Venice follow him

1171
00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:58.470
crying "his stones, his daughter,

1172
00:59:58.470 --> 01:00:00.470
and his ducats!"

1173
01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.100
Let good Antonio look he keep his day

1174
01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:08.100
or he shall pay for this.

1175
01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.270
Marry, well remembered.

1176
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:12.730
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday

1177
01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:15.500
who told me, in the narrow seas

1178
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.870
that part the French and English

1179
01:00:16.870 --> 01:00:20.300
there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught.

1180
01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.000
I thought upon Antonio when he told me

1181
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
and wished in silence that it were not his.

1182
01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.770
You were best to tell Antonio what you hear,

1183
01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:30.030
yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

1184
01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:34.030
A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.

1185
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.030
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part.

1186
01:00:36.030 --> 01:00:40.030
Bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return.

1187
01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:41.930
He answered, "Do not so.

1188
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.270
"Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,

1189
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:47.730
"but stay the very ripening of the time.

1190
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:50.370
"And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,

1191
01:00:50.370 --> 01:00:52.930
"let it not enter in your mind of love.

1192
01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:57.800
"Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship

1193
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.800
"and such fair ostents of love

1194
01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.700
as shall conveniently become you there."

1195
01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.600
And even there, his eye being big with tears,

1196
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.430
turning his face, he put his hand behind him,

1197
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:11.470
and with affection wondrous sensible,

1198
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:13.730
he wrung Bassanio's hand.

1199
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.600
And so they parted.

1200
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.970
I think he only loves the world for him.

1201
01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:22.130
I pray thee, let us go and find him out

1202
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:24.900
and quicken his embraced heaviness

1203
01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.670
with some delight or other.

1204
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:28.100
Do we so!

1205
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.330
Quick, I pray thee, draw the curtains straight.

1206
01:01:31.330 --> 01:01:33.400
The Prince of Aragon hath ta'en his oath

1207
01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.200
and comes to his election presently.

1208
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.770
Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince.

1209
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:43.870
If you choose that wherein I am contained,

1210
01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:46.600
straight shall our nuptial rights be solemnized.

1211
01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.830
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,

1212
01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:51.730
you must be gone from hence immediately.

1213
01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:57.800
I am enjoined by oath to observe three things:

1214
01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:04.530
first, never to unfold to anyone which casket 'twas I chose;

1215
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:08.830
next, if I fail of the right casket,

1216
01:02:08.830 --> 01:02:13.430
never in my life to woo a maid in way of marriage;

1217
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.730
lastly, if I do fail in fortune of my choice,

1218
01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:20.530
immediately to leave you and be gone.

1219
01:02:20.530 --> 01:02:22.800
To these injunctions everyone doth swear

1220
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:24.930
that comes to hazard for my worthless self.

1221
01:02:24.930 --> 01:02:27.100
And so have I addressed me.

1222
01:02:34.030 --> 01:02:36.730
Fortune now to my heart's hope.

1223
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:45.230
Gold.

1224
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.530
Silver.

1225
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.800
And base lead?

1226
01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:04.700
"Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath."

1227
01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:09.370
You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.

1228
01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:11.530
What says the golden chest, huh?

1229
01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:12.970
Let me see.

1230
01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:20.430
"Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire."

1231
01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:23.230
"What many men desire."

1232
01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:28.200
That "many" may be meant by the fool multitude

1233
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.300
that choose by show,

1234
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:32.970
not learning more than the fond eye doth teach,

1235
01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:34.970
which pries not to the interior,

1236
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:36.630
but like the martlet,

1237
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.930
builds in the weather on the outward wall

1238
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:42.530
even in the force and the road of casualty.

1239
01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:46.930
Hmm, I will not choose what many men desire,

1240
01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:49.200
because I will not jump with common spirits

1241
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.930
and rank me with the barbarous multitudes.

1242
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:56.700
Why then, to thee, thou silver treasure house.

1243
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.000
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.

1244
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.400
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

1245
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:07.670
And well said too.

1246
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:12.630
For who shall go about to cozen fortune

1247
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.900
and be honorable without the stamp of merit?

1248
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.800
Hmm?

1249
01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.330
Let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity.

1250
01:04:23.330 --> 01:04:27.730
Oh, that estates, degrees, and offices

1251
01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.330
were not derived corruptly,

1252
01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:32.370
and that clear honor were purchased

1253
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:35.470
by the merit of the wearer.

1254
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:39.470
How many then should cover that stand bare?

1255
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:42.130
How many be commanded that command?

1256
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:45.570
How much low peasantry

1257
01:04:45.570 --> 01:04:48.930
would then be gleaned from the true seed of honor?

1258
01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:51.400
And how much honor picked from the chaff

1259
01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:54.430
and ruin of the times to be new varnished?

1260
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:02.470
Well, but to my choice.

1261
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:05.600
Uh-huh.

1262
01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.730
Hmm.

1263
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.430
Hmm.

1264
01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:16.030
"Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves."

1265
01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:19.930
I will assume desert.

1266
01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:21.530
Give me a key for this

1267
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:24.300
and instantly unlock my fortunes here.

1268
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:47.830
Too long a pause for that which you find there.

1269
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:50.300
What's here?

1270
01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:55.700
The portrait of a blinking idiot presenting me a schedule?

1271
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:00.800
I will read it.

1272
01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.700
How much unlike art thou to Portia.

1273
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:07.170
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings.

1274
01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.830
"Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves."

1275
01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:11.970
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?

1276
01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:13.300
Is that my prize?

1277
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.000
Are my deserts no better?

1278
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.470
To offend and judge are distinct offices

1279
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:19.270
and of opposed natures.

1280
01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:25.870
What's here?

1281
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.500
"The fire seven times tried this,

1282
01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:35.900
"seven times tried that judgment is that it never choose amiss.

1283
01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.170
"Some there be that shadows kiss.

1284
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:41.800
"Such have but a shadow's bliss.

1285
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:49.500
"There be fools alive, I wis, silvered o'er, and so was this.

1286
01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:53.730
"Take what wife you will to bed.

1287
01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:55.800
"I will ever be your head.

1288
01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.230
So be gone, you are sped."

1289
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:05.300
Still more fool I shall appear by the time I linger here.

1290
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:12.030
With one fool's head I came to woo,

1291
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:16.230
but I go away with two.

1292
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:18.470
Sweet, adieu.

1293
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:27.270
I'll keep my oath, patiently to bear my wroth.

1294
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:31.400
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.

1295
01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.100
Oh, these deliberate fools.

1296
01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.700
When they do choose,

1297
01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.400
they have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

1298
01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.470
The ancient saying is no heresy:

1299
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:05.970
"Hanging and wiving go by destiny."

1300
01:08:05.970 --> 01:08:08.270
Come draw the curtain, Nerissa.

1301
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:09.530
Where is my lady?

1302
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:10.770
Here.

1303
01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:12.030
What would my lord?

1304
01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:15.470
Madam, there is alighted at your gate a young Venetian,

1305
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:19.300
one that comes before to signify the approaching of his lord

1306
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:22.670
from whom he bringeth sensible regreets,

1307
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:26.000
to wit, besides commends and courteous breath,

1308
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.970
gifts of rich value.

1309
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.330
Yet I have not seen so likely an ambassador of love.

1310
01:08:31.330 --> 01:08:33.570
A day in April never came so sweet

1311
01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:36.200
to show how costly summer was at hand

1312
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.130
as this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

1313
01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:39.470
No more, I pray thee.

1314
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:42.300
I'm half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee

1315
01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.470
thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.

1316
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:46.570
Come, come, Nerissa,

1317
01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:49.130
for I long to see quick Cupid's post

1318
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:50.600
that comes so mannerly.

1319
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.170
Bassanio lord, love, if thy will it be.

1320
01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:58.000
Now, what news on the Rialto?

1321
01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.800
Why, yet it lives there unchecked

1322
01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.930
that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading

1323
01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:03.330
wrecked in the narrow seas,

1324
01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:05.800
the Goodwins I think they call the place,

1325
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.770
a very dangerous flat, and fatal,

1326
01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.400
where the carcasses of many a tall ship

1327
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.670
lie buried as they say

1328
01:09:10.670 --> 01:09:13.730
if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word.

1329
01:09:13.730 --> 01:09:15.600
I would she were as lying a gossip in that

1330
01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.600
as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbors believe

1331
01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.330
she wept for the death of a third husband.

1332
01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:25.000
But it is true, without any slips of prolixity

1333
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.530
or crossing the plain highway of talk,

1334
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:31.200
that the good Antonio, the honest Antonio--

1335
01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.500
oh, that I had a title

1336
01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.130
good enough to keep his name company.

1337
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:35.430
Come, the full stop.

1338
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:36.870
Hey, what sayest thou?

1339
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:40.770
Why the end is, he hath lost a ship.

1340
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:43.770
I would it might prove an end to his losses.

1341
01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:45.870
Let me say amen betimes,

1342
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:49.800
lest the devil cross my prayer,

1343
01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.530
for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.

1344
01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:00.600
How now, Shylock?

1345
01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.130
What news among the merchants?

1346
01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:03.430
You knew.

1347
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.230
None so well, none so well as you

1348
01:10:05.230 --> 01:10:06.400
of my daughter's flight.

1349
01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.730
That's certain.

1350
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:10.170
I, for my part, knew the tailor made the wings she flew withal.

1351
01:10:10.170 --> 01:10:12.430
And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was fledged

1352
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:14.170
and that it is the complexion of them all

1353
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:15.600
to leave the dam.

1354
01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.930
She is damned for it.

1355
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:20.830
That's certain, if the devil may be a judge.

1356
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.900
My own flesh and blood to rebel!

1357
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.400
Out upon it, old carrion.

1358
01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.000
Rebels it at these years?

1359
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.170
I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.

1360
01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:34.600
There is more difference between thy flesh and hers

1361
01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.870
than between jet and ivory,

1362
01:10:36.870 --> 01:10:38.300
more between your bloods

1363
01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.930
than there is between red wine and Rhenish.

1364
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:44.470
But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio

1365
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:45.970
have any loss at sea or no?

1366
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:47.330
There I have another bad match.

1367
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:49.000
A bankrupt, a prodigal

1368
01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.870
who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto.

1369
01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:56.030
A beggar that was used to come so smug upon the mart.

1370
01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:58.870
Let him look to his bond.

1371
01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:01.170
He was wont to call me usurer.

1372
01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:02.870
Let him look to his bond.

1373
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:06.430
He was wont to lend out money for a Christian courtesy.

1374
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:09.070
Let him look to his bond.

1375
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:11.500
Why, I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh.

1376
01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.230
What's that good for?

1377
01:11:13.230 --> 01:11:16.370
To bait fish withal.

1378
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:18.870
If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge.

1379
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:22.130
He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million,

1380
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:24.130
laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains,

1381
01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:26.570
scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains,

1382
01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:29.200
cooled my friends, heated mine enemies,

1383
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.800
and what's his reason?

1384
01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.630
I am a Jew.

1385
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:34.670
Ah!

1386
01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:39.100
Hath not a Jew eyes?

1387
01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:44.100
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions,

1388
01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.230
senses, affections, passions,

1389
01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:48.900
fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,

1390
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.630
subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means,

1391
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:55.130
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer

1392
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:56.500
as a Christian is?

1393
01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.700
If you prick us, do we not bleed?

1394
01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:05.030
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

1395
01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:08.370
If you poison us, do we not die?

1396
01:12:08.370 --> 01:12:14.000
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?

1397
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.930
If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that.

1398
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:25.470
If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?

1399
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:27.200
Revenge.

1400
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.130
If a Christian wrong a Jew,

1401
01:12:29.130 --> 01:12:33.200
what should his sufferance be by Christian example?

1402
01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.370
Why, revenge.

1403
01:12:35.370 --> 01:12:39.230
The villainy you teach me I will execute,

1404
01:12:39.230 --> 01:12:40.900
and it shall go hard,

1405
01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:43.070
but I will better the instruction.

1406
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:45.930
Gentlemen.

1407
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:48.330
My master Antonio is at his house

1408
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.870
and has asked to speak with you both.

1409
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:52.400
We have been up and down to seek him.

1410
01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.570
Here comes another of the tribe.

1411
01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:01.600
A third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn Jew.

1412
01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.430
How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa?

1413
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.930
Hast thou found my daughter?

1414
01:13:04.930 --> 01:13:07.530
I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.

1415
01:13:07.530 --> 01:13:08.870
Why there, there, there, there!

1416
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:14.370
A diamond gone cost me 2,000 ducats in Frankfurt.

1417
01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:17.330
The curse never fell upon our nation till now.

1418
01:13:17.330 --> 01:13:19.770
I never felt it till now!

1419
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.330
2,000 ducats in that

1420
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:24.370
and other precious, precious jewels.

1421
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:28.130
I would my daughter were dead at my foot,

1422
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:30.400
and the jewels in her ear.

1423
01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:33.570
Would she were hearsed at my foot and the ducats in her coffin.

1424
01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:34.730
No news of them, huh?

1425
01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:36.000
Why so?

1426
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.370
And I know not what's spent on the search.

1427
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:39.730
Why thou--

1428
01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:40.870
Shh!

1429
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:43.000
Loss upon loss!

1430
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.130
The thief gone with so much, and so much to find the thief.

1431
01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:52.470
And no satisfaction, no revenge,

1432
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:55.270
nor no ill luck stirring

1433
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:57.200
but what lights o'er my shoulders,

1434
01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:01.070
no sighs but o'er my breathing,

1435
01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.600
no tears but o'er my shedding.

1436
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.870
Yes, other men have ill luck too.

1437
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:07.300
Antonio, as I heard in Genoa--

1438
01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:08.500
What, what? what?

1439
01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:10.200
Ill luck, ill luck?

1440
01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.030
Hath an Argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.

1441
01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:16.800
I thank God! I thank God!

1442
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.100
Is it true? Is it true?

1443
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:20.800
I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.

1444
01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.670
I thank thee, good Tubal.

1445
01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:25.100
Good news, good news.

1446
01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.330
Ha!

1447
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:27.930
Heard in Genoa?

1448
01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.870
your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard,

1449
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:31.670
one night, fourscore ducats.

1450
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:36.230
Thou stick'st a dagger in me.

1451
01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:39.430
I shall never see my gold again.

1452
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:42.630
Fourscore ducats at a sitting?

1453
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:45.930
Fourscore ducats!

1454
01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:48.370
There came divers of Antonio's creditors

1455
01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:49.730
in my company to Venice

1456
01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:51.630
that swear he cannot choose but break.

1457
01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:53.000
I am very glad of it.

1458
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.370
I'll plague him.

1459
01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:55.930
I'll torture him.

1460
01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:57.200
I am glad of it.

1461
01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.470
One of them showed me a ring

1462
01:14:58.470 --> 01:15:00.970
he had of your daughter for a monkey.

1463
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.400
Out upon her.

1464
01:15:11.730 --> 01:15:15.000
Thou torturest me, Tubal.

1465
01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.530
It was my turquoise.

1466
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:25.400
I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor.

1467
01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:31.430
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.

1468
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:36.000
But Antonio is certainly undone.

1469
01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.830
Nay, that's true.

1470
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:41.330
That's very true.

1471
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:44.770
Go, Tubal, fee me an officer.

1472
01:15:44.770 --> 01:15:49.230
Bespeak him a fortnight before.

1473
01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:52.230
I will have the heart of him if he forfeit,

1474
01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:54.270
for were he out of Venice,

1475
01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:57.330
I can make what merchandise I will.

1476
01:15:57.330 --> 01:16:01.470
Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue.

1477
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:08.400
Go, good Tubal.

1478
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.730
At our synagogue, Tubal.

1479
01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.130
I pray you, tarry,

1480
01:16:29.130 --> 01:16:32.700
pause a day or two before you hazard,

1481
01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:36.100
for in choosing wrong, I lose your company.

1482
01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:39.400
Therefore, forbear a while.

1483
01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:01.030
There's something tells me-- but it is not love--

1484
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:03.100
I would not lose you.

1485
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.370
And you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality.

1486
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:11.070
But lest you should not understand me well--

1487
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:14.700
and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought--

1488
01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.570
I would detain you here some month or two

1489
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:19.030
before you venture for me.

1490
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:25.130
I could teach you how to choose right,

1491
01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:27.930
but then I am forsworn.

1492
01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:32.200
So will I never be.

1493
01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.530
So may you miss me.

1494
01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.200
but if you do, you'll make me wish a sin

1495
01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:40.030
that I had been forsworn.

1496
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.670
Beshrew your eyes.

1497
01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:47.300
They have o'erlooked me and divided me.

1498
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:53.130
One half of me is yours, the other half, yours.

1499
01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:57.330
Mine own, I would say, but if mine, then yours,

1500
01:17:57.330 --> 01:17:59.370
and so all yours.

1501
01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:03.800
Oh, these naughty times put bars

1502
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.530
between the owners and their rights.

1503
01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:08.370
And so, though yours,

1504
01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:10.530
not yours.

1505
01:18:10.530 --> 01:18:11.770
Prove it so,

1506
01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.870
let fortune go to hell for it, not I.

1507
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:19.070
I speak too long, but 'tis to piece the time,

1508
01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:21.070
to eke it and to draw it out in length

1509
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:22.900
to stay you from election.

1510
01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.570
Let me choose, for as I am, I live upon the rack.

1511
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:28.500
Upon the rack, Bassanio?

1512
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.600
Then confess.

1513
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.530
What treason is there mingled with your love?

1514
01:18:31.530 --> 01:18:34.570
None but that ugly treason of mistrust

1515
01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:37.070
which makes me fear the enjoying of my love.

1516
01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:39.270
There may as well be amity in life

1517
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:42.170
'tween snow and fire as treason and my love.

1518
01:18:42.170 --> 01:18:43.800
Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack

1519
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.730
where men enforced do speak anything.

1520
01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:48.600
Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

1521
01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.700
Well, then, confess and live.

1522
01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:55.130
Confess and love had been the very sum of my confession.

1523
01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.000
Oh, happy torment

1524
01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:00.370
when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance.

1525
01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:03.830
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

1526
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:07.170
Away then.

1527
01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:09.870
I am locked in one of them.

1528
01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.530
If you do love me, you will find me out.

1529
01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:26.570
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.

1530
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:29.070
Let music sound while he doth make his choice,

1531
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:32.830
then if he lose,

1532
01:19:32.830 --> 01:19:36.770
he makes a swan-like end fading in music.

1533
01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:39.900
That the comparison may stand more proper,

1534
01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:43.470
my eye shall be the stream and watery deathbed for him.

1535
01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:48.070
He may win, and what is music then?

1536
01:19:48.070 --> 01:19:51.130
Why then music is even as the flourish

1537
01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:54.370
when new subjects bow to a new-crowned monarch.

1538
01:19:54.370 --> 01:19:57.500
Such it is as are those dulcet sounds at break of day

1539
01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.970
that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear

1540
01:19:59.970 --> 01:20:03.000
and summon him to marriage.

1541
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.870
Now he goes, with no less presence,

1542
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:10.830
but with much more love than young Alcaides

1543
01:20:10.830 --> 01:20:12.470
when he did redeem the virgin tribute

1544
01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:16.270
paid by howling Troy to the sea monster.

1545
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:18.170
I stand for sacrifice.

1546
01:20:18.170 --> 01:20:22.030
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives

1547
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:23.870
with bleared visages

1548
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:26.200
come forth to view the issue of the exploit.

1549
01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:32.500
Go, Hercules.

1550
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:33.770
Live thou; I live.

1551
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:38.000
With much, much more dismay, I view the fight

1552
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.470
than thou that makes the fray.

1553
01:20:42.570 --> 01:20:56.570
Tell me where is fancy bred?

1554
01:20:56.570 --> 01:21:04.400
Or in the heart or in the head?

1555
01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:15.130
How begot, how nourished?

1556
01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:22.400
Reply, reply.

1557
01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:32.330
It is engendered in the eyes

1558
01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:37.570
with gazing fed,

1559
01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:43.970
and fancy dies

1560
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:58.370
in the cradle where it lies.

1561
01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:10.630
Let us all ring fancy's knell.

1562
01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:16.370
I'll begin it.

1563
01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:19.230
Ding, dong, bell.

1564
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.730
Ding, dong, bell.

1565
01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:30.000
Ding, dong, bell.

1566
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:35.170
Ding, dong, bell.

1567
01:22:42.670 --> 01:22:48.130
So may the outward shows be least themselves.

1568
01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:54.030
The world is still deceived with ornament.

1569
01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:58.570
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt

1570
01:22:58.570 --> 01:23:01.530
but being seasoned with a gracious voice

1571
01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:04.070
obscures the show of evil?

1572
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:07.830
In religion, what damned error

1573
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:10.400
but some sober brow will bless it,

1574
01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.870
and approve it with a text,

1575
01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:15.470
hiding the grossness with fair ornament?

1576
01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:16.670
There is no vice so simple

1577
01:23:16.670 --> 01:23:19.200
but assumes some mark of virtue

1578
01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.130
on his outward parts.

1579
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:23.230
How many cowards,

1580
01:23:23.230 --> 01:23:27.600
whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand,

1581
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.630
wear yet upon their chins

1582
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.400
the beards of Hercules and frowning Mars,

1583
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.500
who inward searched, have livers white as milk.

1584
01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.100
And these assume but valor's excrement

1585
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.270
to render them redoubted.

1586
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:46.370
Look on beauty, and you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight

1587
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:48.600
which therein works a miracle in nature,

1588
01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:52.730
making them lightest that wear most of it.

1589
01:23:52.730 --> 01:23:57.070
So are those crisped snaky golden locks

1590
01:23:57.070 --> 01:23:59.570
which make such wanton gambols with the wind

1591
01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:01.100
upon supposed fairness,

1592
01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:05.270
often known to be the dowry of a second head,

1593
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:09.630
the skull that bred them in the sepulchre.

1594
01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:13.430
Thus ornament is but a guiled shore

1595
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:15.100
to a most dangerous sea,

1596
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:18.930
the beauteous scarf veiling an Indian beauty.

1597
01:24:18.930 --> 01:24:22.800
In a word, the seeming truth which cunning times put on

1598
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.330
to entrap the wisest.

1599
01:24:24.330 --> 01:24:30.570
Therefore then, thou gaudy gold, hard food for Midas,

1600
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:32.030
I will none of thee.

1601
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:34.070
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge

1602
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:35.330
'tween man and man.

1603
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:39.000
But thou, thou meagre lead,

1604
01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.170
which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught.

1605
01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:49.770
Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,

1606
01:24:49.770 --> 01:24:53.800
and here choose I.

1607
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:56.230
Joy be the consequence.

1608
01:25:00.170 --> 01:25:02.930
How all other passions fleet to air

1609
01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:07.530
as doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair

1610
01:25:07.530 --> 01:25:10.470
and shudd'ring fear, and green-eyed jealousy.

1611
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:13.030
Oh, love, be moderate.

1612
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:15.100
Allay thy ecstasy.

1613
01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:16.330
In measure rain thy joy.

1614
01:25:16.330 --> 01:25:18.330
Scant this excess.

1615
01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:19.600
I feel too much thy blessing.

1616
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.570
Make it less for fear I surfeit.

1617
01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:28.670
What find I here?

1618
01:25:32.370 --> 01:25:34.830
Fair Portia's counterfeit!

1619
01:25:38.330 --> 01:25:43.630
What demigod hath come so near creation?

1620
01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:46.730
Move these eyes, or whether,

1621
01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:49.330
riding on the balls of mine, seem they in motion?

1622
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:51.800
Here are severed lips, parted with sugar breath

1623
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.100
so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends.

1624
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.770
Here in her hairs, the painter plays the spider

1625
01:25:56.770 --> 01:25:59.630
and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men

1626
01:25:59.630 --> 01:26:01.600
faster than gnats in cobwebs.

1627
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.230
But her eyes,

1628
01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:07.530
how could he see to do them?

1629
01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:09.430
Having made one, methinks it should have power

1630
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:12.630
to steal both his and leave itself unfurnished.

1631
01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:15.030
But look, how far the substance of my praise

1632
01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:18.430
doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it.

1633
01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:24.170
So far this shadow doth limp behind the substance.

1634
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:28.030
Here is the scroll,

1635
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:29.900
the continent, and summary of my fortune.

1636
01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:33.170
"You that choose not by the view

1637
01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:36.330
"chance as fair and choose as true.

1638
01:26:36.330 --> 01:26:40.270
"Since this fortune falls to you, be content and seek no new.

1639
01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:44.300
"If you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss,

1640
01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:49.900
turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss."

1641
01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:53.930
A gentle scroll.

1642
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:58.000
Fair lady, by your leave

1643
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.730
I come by note, to give and to receive,

1644
01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:06.000
like one of two contending in a prize

1645
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.130
that thinks he hath done well in people's eyes

1646
01:27:08.130 --> 01:27:10.500
hearing applause and universal shout,

1647
01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:13.170
giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt

1648
01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:16.130
whether those peals of praise be his or no.

1649
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:20.330
So thrice-fair lady, stand I,

1650
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:23.430
even so as doubtful whether what I see be true

1651
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:28.070
until confirmed, signed, ratified by you.

1652
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:32.070
You see me, lord Bassanio,

1653
01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:34.030
where I stand

1654
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:36.630
such as I am.

1655
01:27:36.630 --> 01:27:39.200
Though for myself alone,

1656
01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.230
I would not be ambitious in my wish

1657
01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:42.800
to wish myself much better,

1658
01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.730
yet for you, I would be trebled twenty times myself,

1659
01:27:46.730 --> 01:27:51.970
a thousand times more rich, ten thousand times more fair

1660
01:27:51.970 --> 01:27:54.330
that only to stand high in your account

1661
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:58.530
I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends exceed account.

1662
01:27:58.530 --> 01:28:01.470
But the full sum of me is sum of something

1663
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:05.370
which, to term in gross, is an unlessoned girl

1664
01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:08.830
unschooled, unpracticed.

1665
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:14.000
Happy in this, she is not yet so old but she may learn.

1666
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.100
Happier than this, she is not bred so dull but she can learn.

1667
01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:22.630
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit

1668
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:25.130
commits itself to yours to be directed

1669
01:28:25.130 --> 01:28:32.800
as from her lord, her governor, her king.

1670
01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:38.430
Myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted.

1671
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:45.670
But now I was the lord of this fair mansion,

1672
01:28:45.670 --> 01:28:49.670
master of my servants, queen o'er myself.

1673
01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:54.830
And even now, but now, this house, these servants,

1674
01:28:54.830 --> 01:29:03.670
and this same myself are yours, my lord.

1675
01:29:03.670 --> 01:29:07.800
I give them with this ring,

1676
01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:13.970
which when you part from, lose, or give away,

1677
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:15.900
let it presage the ruin of your love

1678
01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:19.200
and be my vantage to exclaim on you.

1679
01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.070
Madam, you have bereft me of all words.

1680
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:26.900
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins,

1681
01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:29.830
and there is such confusion in my powers

1682
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:32.900
as, after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince,

1683
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.370
there doth appear among the buzzing, pleased multitude

1684
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:38.400
where every something, being blent together,

1685
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.270
turns to a wild of nothing,

1686
01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:44.400
save of joy expressed and not expressed.

1687
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.570
But when this ring parts from this finger,

1688
01:29:49.570 --> 01:29:51.970
then parts life from hence.

1689
01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:56.630
Oh, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead.

1690
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.300
My lord and lady, it is now our time

1691
01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:23.570
that have stood by and seen our wishes prosper

1692
01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:25.600
to cry "good joy."

1693
01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.670
Good joy, my lord and lady.

1694
01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:29.970
My lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,

1695
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:32.630
I wish you all the joy that you can wish,

1696
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:34.370
for I am sure you can wish none from me.

1697
01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:36.830
And when your honors mean to solemnize

1698
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:38.230
the bargain of your faith,

1699
01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:40.930
I do beseech you, even at that time,

1700
01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:43.130
I may be married too.

1701
01:30:43.130 --> 01:30:44.900
With all my heart,

1702
01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.330
so thou can'st get a wife.

1703
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:49.800
I thank your lordship, you have got me one.

1704
01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:52.900
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours.

1705
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.770
You saw the mistress.

1706
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:57.470
I beheld the maid.

1707
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:59.570
You loved; I loved.

1708
01:30:59.570 --> 01:31:00.970
For intermission,

1709
01:31:00.970 --> 01:31:02.630
no more pertains to me, my lord, than you.

1710
01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:04.570
Your fortune stood upon the caskets there

1711
01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:06.300
and so did mine too, as the matter falls.

1712
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:09.070
For wooing here until I sweat again

1713
01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:11.800
and swearing till my very roof was dry

1714
01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.270
with oaths of love,

1715
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:16.970
at last-- if promise last--

1716
01:31:16.970 --> 01:31:19.670
I got a promise of this fair one here

1717
01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:20.800
to have her love,

1718
01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.330
provided that your fortune achieved her mistress.

1719
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:24.800
Is this true, Nerissa?

1720
01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:25.900
Madam, it is.

1721
01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:28.070
So you stand pleased withal.

1722
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:29.330
And do you, Gratiano,

1723
01:31:29.330 --> 01:31:31.330
mean good faith?

1724
01:31:31.330 --> 01:31:32.600
Yes, faith, my lord.

1725
01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:35.330
Our feast shall be much honored in your marriage.

1726
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:38.330
We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.

1727
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:39.700
What, and stake down?

1728
01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:42.900
No, we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down.

1729
01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:44.870
But who comes here?

1730
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:46.630
Lorenzo and his infidel?

1731
01:31:46.630 --> 01:31:49.500
What, and my old venetian friend, Salerio?

1732
01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.500
Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,

1733
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:55.530
if that the youth of my new interest here

1734
01:31:55.530 --> 01:31:56.970
have power to bid you welcome.

1735
01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:59.630
By your leave, I bid my very friends and countrymen,

1736
01:31:59.630 --> 01:32:01.000
sweet Portia, welcome.

1737
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.200
So do I, my lord.

1738
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.400
They are entirely welcome.

1739
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.670
I thank your honor.

1740
01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:06.000
For my part, my lord,

1741
01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.070
my purpose was not to have seen you here.

1742
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:10.100
But meeting with Salerio by the way,

1743
01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:12.500
he did entreat me, past all saying nay,

1744
01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:13.800
to come with him along.

1745
01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.270
I did, my lord, and I have reason for it.

1746
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:19.000
Signior Antonio commends him to you.

1747
01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Ere I ope his letter, I pray thee tell me

1748
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.700
how my good friend doth.

1749
01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.470
Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind.

1750
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:26.600
Nor well, unless in mind.

1751
01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:28.900
His letter here will show you his estate.

1752
01:32:31.030 --> 01:32:34.700
Nerissa, cheer yond stranger.

1753
01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.400
Bid her welcome.

1754
01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:38.100
Your hand, Salerio.

1755
01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:40.500
What's the news from Venice?

1756
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.800
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?

1757
01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.430
I know he will be glad of our success.

1758
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:46.730
We are the Jasons.

1759
01:32:46.730 --> 01:32:48.000
We have won the fleece.

1760
01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.530
I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.

1761
01:32:50.530 --> 01:32:53.400
There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper

1762
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.400
that steal the color from Bassanio's cheek.

1763
01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:57.430
Some dear friend dead.

1764
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:58.670
Else nothing in the world

1765
01:32:58.670 --> 01:33:00.300
could turn so much the constitution

1766
01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.470
of any constant man.

1767
01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:02.770
What, worse and worse?

1768
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:05.230
With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself,

1769
01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:07.270
and I must freely have the half of anything

1770
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:08.900
that this same paper brings you.

1771
01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:12.130
Oh, sweet Portia, here are a few of the unpleasant'st words

1772
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:13.700
that ever blotted paper.

1773
01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:16.730
Gentle lady, when I did first impart my love to you,

1774
01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:19.130
I freely told you all the wealth I had ran in my veins--

1775
01:33:19.130 --> 01:33:20.430
I was a gentleman--

1776
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:21.830
and then I told you true.

1777
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:23.200
And yet, dear lady,

1778
01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:26.830
rating myself at nothing, you shall see how much I was a braggart.

1779
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:29.970
When I told you my state was nothing,

1780
01:33:29.970 --> 01:33:32.600
I should then have told you that I was worse than nothing,

1781
01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:35.830
for indeed I have engaged myself to a dear friend,

1782
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:41.500
engaged my friend to his mere enemy to feed my means.

1783
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.000
Here is a letter, lady.

1784
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.370
The paper as the body of my friend

1785
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:49.470
and every word in it a gaping wound issuing lifeblood.

1786
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:52.070
But is it true, Salerio?

1787
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:53.530
Have all his ventures failed?

1788
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:54.730
What, not one hit?

1789
01:33:54.730 --> 01:33:57.230
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England?

1790
01:33:57.230 --> 01:34:01.700
From Lisbon, Barbary, and India?

1791
01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:05.870
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch

1792
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:07.170
of merchant-marring rocks?

1793
01:34:07.170 --> 01:34:08.570
Not one, my lord.

1794
01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:09.970
Besides, it should appear that,

1795
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:12.370
if he had the present money to discharge the Jew,

1796
01:34:12.370 --> 01:34:13.630
he would not take it.

1797
01:34:13.630 --> 01:34:16.370
Never did I know a creature that did bear the shape of man

1798
01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:19.430
so keen and greedy to confound a man.

1799
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:21.300
He plies the Duke at morning and at night

1800
01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.100
and doth impeach the freedom of the state

1801
01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.230
if they deny him justice.

1802
01:34:25.230 --> 01:34:28.100
Twenty merchants, the Duke himself,

1803
01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:31.270
and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him.

1804
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:34.130
But none can drive him from the envious plea

1805
01:34:34.130 --> 01:34:38.230
of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.

1806
01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:40.870
When I was with him, I have heard him swear

1807
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:43.300
to Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,

1808
01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.530
that he would rather have Antonio's flesh

1809
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:47.500
than twenty times the value of the sum

1810
01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:48.770
that he did owe him.

1811
01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:51.030
And I know, my lord,

1812
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:54.200
if law, authority, and power deny not,

1813
01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.200
it will go hard with poor Antonio.

1814
01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.570
Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

1815
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:02.670
The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,

1816
01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:06.600
the best-conditioned and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies,

1817
01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:09.170
and one in whom the ancient Roman honor more appears

1818
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.770
than any that draws breath in Italy.

1819
01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:12.330
What sum owes he the Jew?

1820
01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:15.000
For me, 3,000 ducats.

1821
01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.330
What, no more?

1822
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:21.070
Pay him 6,000 and deface the bond.

1823
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:25.770
Double 6,000 and then treble that before a friend of this description

1824
01:35:25.770 --> 01:35:27.730
shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.

1825
01:35:27.730 --> 01:35:33.230
First, go with me to church and call me wife

1826
01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:35.770
and then away to Venice to your friend,

1827
01:35:35.770 --> 01:35:39.970
for never shall you lie by Portia's side with an unquiet soul.

1828
01:35:39.970 --> 01:35:43.730
You shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over.

1829
01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:46.100
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.

1830
01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:50.200
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows.

1831
01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.770
Come, away.

1832
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:54.130
For you must hence upon your wedding day.

1833
01:35:54.130 --> 01:35:55.430
Bid your friends welcome.

1834
01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:56.630
Show a merry cheer.

1835
01:35:56.630 --> 01:36:00.870
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.

1836
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:05.830
But let me hear the letter of your friend.

1837
01:36:09.570 --> 01:36:13.070
"Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all miscarried,

1838
01:36:13.070 --> 01:36:16.530
"my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low,

1839
01:36:16.530 --> 01:36:18.600
"my bond to the Jew is forfeit,

1840
01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.570
"and since in paying it it is impossible I should live,

1841
01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:24.230
"all debts are cleared between you and I

1842
01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:27.400
"if I might but see you at my death.

1843
01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.930
"Notwithstanding, use your pleasure.

1844
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:34.570
If your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter."

1845
01:36:34.570 --> 01:36:38.400
Oh, love, dispatch all business and be gone.

1846
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.630
Since I have your good leave to go away, I will make haste.

1847
01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:43.270
But till I come again,

1848
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:45.370
no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,

1849
01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:48.170
nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

1850
01:36:53.470 --> 01:36:54.970
Jailer, look to him.

1851
01:36:54.970 --> 01:36:57.200
Tell not me of mercy.

1852
01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.400
This is the fool that lent out money gratis.

1853
01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:00.600
Jailer, look to him.

1854
01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:01.730
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

1855
01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:03.030
I'll have my bond!

1856
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:04.170
Speak not against my bond.

1857
01:37:04.170 --> 01:37:07.370
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.

1858
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:10.130
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,

1859
01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:12.900
but since I am a dog, beware my fangs.

1860
01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:16.000
The Duke shall grant me justice.

1861
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.970
I do wonder, thou naughty jailer, that thou art so fond

1862
01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:20.900
to come abroad with him at his request.

1863
01:37:20.900 --> 01:37:22.170
I pray thee, hear me speak.

1864
01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:23.430
I'll have my bond.

1865
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:24.930
I will not hear thee speak.

1866
01:37:24.930 --> 01:37:28.100
I'll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.

1867
01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:31.900
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool

1868
01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:35.000
to shake the head, relent, and sigh,

1869
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.570
and yield to Christian intercessors.

1870
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:37.900
Follow not.

1871
01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:39.530
I'll have no speaking.

1872
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:42.130
I will have my bond.

1873
01:37:42.130 --> 01:37:45.200
It is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with man.

1874
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.000
Let him alone.

1875
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.100
I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.

1876
01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.400
He seeks my life.

1877
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.730
His reason well I know.

1878
01:37:52.730 --> 01:37:54.700
I oft delivered from his forfeitures

1879
01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:57.500
many that have at times made moan to me.

1880
01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.300
Therefore he hates me.

1881
01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:03.470
I am sure the Duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

1882
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:05.200
The Duke cannot deny the course of law.

1883
01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:07.900
For the commodity that strangers have with us in Venice,

1884
01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:09.470
if it be denied, will much impeach

1885
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:12.130
the justice of the state since that the trade and profit

1886
01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:15.930
of the city consisteth of all nations.

1887
01:38:15.930 --> 01:38:19.700
Therefore, go.

1888
01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:23.300
These griefs and losses have so bated me

1889
01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:28.200
that I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor.

1890
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.570
Well, jailer, on.

1891
01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:40.800
Pray God Bassanio come to see me pay his debt.

1892
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:45.800
And then I care not.

1893
01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.500
Madam, although I speak it in your presence,

1894
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:55.630
you have a noble and a true conceit

1895
01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:58.900
of godlike amity, which appears most strongly

1896
01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:01.530
in bearing thus the absence of your lord.

1897
01:39:01.530 --> 01:39:04.070
But if you knew to whom you show this honor,

1898
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:06.470
how true a gentleman you send relief,

1899
01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:08.570
how dear a lover of my lord, your husband,

1900
01:39:08.570 --> 01:39:11.300
I know you would be prouder of the work

1901
01:39:11.300 --> 01:39:13.130
than customary bounty can enforce you.

1902
01:39:13.130 --> 01:39:16.370
I never did repent for doing good, nor shall not now.

1903
01:39:16.370 --> 01:39:20.930
For in companions that do converse and waste the time together

1904
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:23.570
whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,

1905
01:39:23.570 --> 01:39:25.600
there must be needs a like proportion

1906
01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:27.770
of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,

1907
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:31.500
which makes me think that this Antonio, being the bosom lover of my lord,

1908
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.070
must needs be like my lord.

1909
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:36.970
If it be so, how little is the cost I have bestowed

1910
01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.900
in purchasing the semblance of my soul

1911
01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:41.600
from out the state of hellish cruelty.

1912
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:44.200
But this comes too near the praising of myself.

1913
01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.500
Therefore, no more of it.

1914
01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:47.130
Hear other things.

1915
01:39:47.130 --> 01:39:49.670
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands

1916
01:39:49.670 --> 01:39:53.770
the husbandry and manage of my house until my lord's return.

1917
01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:57.800
For mine own part, I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow

1918
01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:02.200
to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by Nerissa here

1919
01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:05.230
until her husband and my lord's return.

1920
01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:08.330
There is a monastery three miles off, and there we will abide.

1921
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:10.870
I do desire you not to deny this imposition,

1922
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:15.000
the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you.

1923
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.970
Madam, with all my heart I shall obey you in all fair commands.

1924
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:19.530
My people do already know my mind

1925
01:40:19.530 --> 01:40:24.170
and will acknowledge you and Jessica in place of lord Bassanio and myself.

1926
01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:26.570
So fare you well till we shall meet again.

1927
01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:30.000
Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you.

1928
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.800
I wish your ladyship all heart's content.

1929
01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:33.100
I thank you for your wish,

1930
01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:36.400
and I'm well pleased to wish it back on you.

1931
01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.130
Fare ye well, Jessica.

1932
01:40:42.530 --> 01:40:47.330
Now, Balthasar, as I have ever found thee honest-true,

1933
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:48.930
so let me find thee still.

1934
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:50.330
Take this same letter,

1935
01:40:50.330 --> 01:40:53.430
and use thou all the endeavor of a man in speed to Padua.

1936
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:56.430
See thou deliver this into my cousin's hand, Dr. Bellario.

1937
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:58.630
And look what notes and garments he doth give thee.

1938
01:40:58.630 --> 01:41:01.230
Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed unto the traject,

1939
01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:02.970
to the common ferry which trades to Venice.

1940
01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:04.200
Waste no time in words.

1941
01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.470
Get thee gone.

1942
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:07.070
I shall be there before thee.

1943
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:10.400
Madam, I go with all convenient speed.

1944
01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:11.830
Come on, Nerissa.

1945
01:41:11.830 --> 01:41:15.070
I have work in hand that you yet know not of.

1946
01:41:15.070 --> 01:41:17.700
We'll see our husbands before they think of us.

1947
01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:18.870
Shall they see us?

1948
01:41:18.870 --> 01:41:20.970
They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit

1949
01:41:20.970 --> 01:41:24.430
that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack.

1950
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:25.730
I'll hold thee any wager

1951
01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:28.430
when we are both accoutered like young men,

1952
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:30.430
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two

1953
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:32.500
and wear my dagger with the braver grace

1954
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:36.230
and speak between the change of man and boy in a reed voice

1955
01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:39.770
and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride

1956
01:41:39.770 --> 01:41:42.900
and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth

1957
01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.370
and tell quaint lies how honorable ladies sought my love,

1958
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:48.370
which I denying, they fell sick and died.

1959
01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:49.670
I could not do withal.

1960
01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:51.730
And then I'll repent and wish, for all that,

1961
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:53.030
that I had not killed them.

1962
01:41:53.030 --> 01:41:55.970
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell that men shall swear

1963
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:58.230
I have discontinued school above a twelvemonth.

1964
01:41:58.230 --> 01:41:59.970
I have, within my mind,

1965
01:41:59.970 --> 01:42:02.470
a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks

1966
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:04.000
which I will practice.

1967
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.430
Why, shall we turn to men?

1968
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:09.030
Fie, what a question's that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter.

1969
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:11.870
But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device

1970
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:14.770
when I'm in my coach, which stays for us at the park gate.

1971
01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:19.130
Therefore haste away, for we must measure twenty miles today.

1972
01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:23.370
Yes, truly, for look you, the sins of the father

1973
01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.200
are to be laid upon the children.

1974
01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.930
Therefore, I promise you, I fear you.

1975
01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.930
I was always plain with you.

1976
01:42:29.930 --> 01:42:32.630
And so now I speak my agitation of the matter.

1977
01:42:32.630 --> 01:42:37.500
Therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you are damned.

1978
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.870
There is but one hope in it that can do you any good

1979
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:43.500
and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither.

1980
01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.830
And what hope is that, I pray thee?

1981
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:49.670
Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you not,

1982
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:52.130
that you are not the Jew's daughter.

1983
01:42:52.130 --> 01:42:54.930
That were a kind of bastard hope indeed.

1984
01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:58.430
So the sins of my mother should be visited upon me.

1985
01:42:58.430 --> 01:43:01.970
Truly then, I fear you are damned

1986
01:43:01.970 --> 01:43:03.700
both by father and mother.

1987
01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:06.530
Thus when I shun Scylla, your father,

1988
01:43:06.530 --> 01:43:08.770
I fall into Charybdis, your mother.

1989
01:43:08.770 --> 01:43:11.530
Well, you are gone both ways.

1990
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:13.400
I shall be saved by my husband.

1991
01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.000
He hath made me a Christian.

1992
01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.400
Truly, the more to blame he.

1993
01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.230
We were Christians enough before

1994
01:43:18.230 --> 01:43:20.470
e'en as many could well live one by another.

1995
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:24.030
This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs.

1996
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:26.570
If we grow all to be pork-eaters,

1997
01:43:26.570 --> 01:43:29.270
we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.

1998
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:32.200
I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say.

1999
01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.070
Here he comes.

2000
01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:43.070
I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot,

2001
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:47.070
if you thus get my wife into corners.

2002
01:43:47.070 --> 01:43:49.200
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo.

2003
01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:51.170
Launcelot and I are out.

2004
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:54.900
He tells me flatly there's no mercy for me in heaven

2005
01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:56.570
because I am a Jew's daughter.

2006
01:43:56.570 --> 01:44:00.130
And he says you are no good member of the commonwealth,

2007
01:44:00.130 --> 01:44:05.330
for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the price of pork.

2008
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:07.370
I shall answer that better to the commonwealth

2009
01:44:07.370 --> 01:44:10.170
than you can the getting up of the negro's belly.

2010
01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:14.130
The moor is with child by you, Launcelot.

2011
01:44:14.130 --> 01:44:19.500
Well, it is much that the moor should be more than reason.

2012
01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.000
But if she be less than an honest woman,

2013
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.430
she is indeed more than I took her for.

2014
01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:27.130
How every fool can play upon the word.

2015
01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:30.570
I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence

2016
01:44:30.570 --> 01:44:34.170
and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots.

2017
01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:35.830
Go in, sirrah.

2018
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:37.030
Bid them prepare for dinner.

2019
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:38.230
That is done, sir.

2020
01:44:38.230 --> 01:44:39.430
They have all stomachs.

2021
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:43.100
Goodly lord, what a wit-snapper are you.

2022
01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:46.270
Then bid them prepare dinner.

2023
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:47.370
Oh, that is done too, sir.

2024
01:44:47.370 --> 01:44:48.570
Only "cover" is the word.

2025
01:44:48.570 --> 01:44:49.770
Will you cover then, sir?

2026
01:44:49.770 --> 01:44:51.170
Not so, neither, sir.

2027
01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:52.270
I know my duty.

2028
01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:55.100
Yet more quarrelling with occasion?

2029
01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.570
Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant?

2030
01:44:57.570 --> 01:45:01.000
I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning.

2031
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.930
Go to thy fellows, bid them cover the table,

2032
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:06.170
serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.

2033
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:09.170
For the table, sir, it shall be served in.

2034
01:45:09.170 --> 01:45:11.670
For the meat, sir, it shall be covered.

2035
01:45:11.670 --> 01:45:13.670
For your coming in to dinner, sir,

2036
01:45:13.670 --> 01:45:17.030
why, let it be as humors and conceits shall govern.

2037
01:45:19.570 --> 01:45:21.670
Oh, dear discretion, how his words are suited.

2038
01:45:21.670 --> 01:45:25.270
The fool hath planted in his memory an army of good words.

2039
01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:27.500
And I do know a many fools that stand in better place

2040
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:32.370
garnished like him, that for a tricksy word defy the matter.

2041
01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:36.500
How cheer'st thou, Jessica?

2042
01:45:43.630 --> 01:45:46.700
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion.

2043
01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:49.930
How dost thou like the lord Bassanio's wife?

2044
01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:52.200
Past all expressing.

2045
01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:56.300
It is very meet the lord Bassanio live an upright life,

2046
01:45:56.300 --> 01:46:00.200
for, having such a blessing in his lady,

2047
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:04.000
he finds the joys of heaven here on earth.

2048
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.400
And if on earth he do not merit it,

2049
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.030
in reason he should never come to heaven.

2050
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:13.570
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match

2051
01:46:13.570 --> 01:46:17.600
and on the wager lay two earthly women and Portia one,

2052
01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:20.730
there must be something else pawned with the other,

2053
01:46:20.730 --> 01:46:23.570
for the poor rude world hath not her fellow.

2054
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:27.300
Even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife.

2055
01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:29.430
Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.

2056
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:31.330
I will anon.

2057
01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:33.330
First, let's go to dinner.

2058
01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:36.130
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.

2059
01:46:36.130 --> 01:46:39.670
No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk,

2060
01:46:39.670 --> 01:46:46.470
then howsome'er thou speak'st mong other things, I shall digest it.

2061
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:48.370
Well, I'll set you forth.

2062
01:47:26.770 --> 01:47:28.430
What, is Antonio here?

2063
01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:31.100
Ready, so please your grace.

2064
01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.430
I am sorry for thee.

2065
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:41.870
Thou art come to answer a stony adversary,

2066
01:47:41.870 --> 01:47:45.470
an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity,

2067
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:49.100
void and empty from any dram of mercy.

2068
01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.230
I have heard your grace hath ta'en great pains

2069
01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:54.130
to qualify his rigorous course.

2070
01:47:54.130 --> 01:47:56.900
But since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means

2071
01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:59.500
can carry me out of his envy's reach,

2072
01:47:59.500 --> 01:48:01.900
I do oppose my patience to his fury

2073
01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:05.230
and am armed to suffer with a quietness of spirit

2074
01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:07.230
the very tyranny and rage of his.

2075
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:17.630
Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

2076
01:48:17.630 --> 01:48:19.130
He is ready at the door.

2077
01:48:19.130 --> 01:48:20.670
He comes, my lord.

2078
01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:24.730
Make room,

2079
01:48:24.730 --> 01:48:27.730
and let him stand before our face.

2080
01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.170
Shylock,

2081
01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:56.270
the world thinks--

2082
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:58.230
and I think so too--

2083
01:48:58.230 --> 01:49:01.930
that thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice

2084
01:49:01.930 --> 01:49:04.670
to the last hour of act,

2085
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:07.000
and then 'tis thought,

2086
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.330
thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange

2087
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:14.030
than is thy strange apparent cruelty.

2088
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:17.200
And where thou now exacts the penalty,

2089
01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:20.430
which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,

2090
01:49:20.430 --> 01:49:23.630
thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,

2091
01:49:23.630 --> 01:49:27.870
but touched with human gentleness and love,

2092
01:49:27.870 --> 01:49:30.330
forgive a moiety of the principal,

2093
01:49:30.330 --> 01:49:32.800
glancing an eye of pity on his losses

2094
01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:36.870
which have of late so huddled on his back.

2095
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:39.370
Enow to press a royal merchant down

2096
01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:42.200
and pluck commiseration of his state

2097
01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.830
from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,

2098
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:49.030
from stubborn Turks and Tartars

2099
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:52.130
never trained to offices of tender courtesy.

2100
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:59.770
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

2101
01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:07.370
I have possessed your grace of what I purpose,

2102
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:10.400
and by our holy Sabbath have I sworn

2103
01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.630
to have the due and forfeit of my bond.

2104
01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:16.170
If you deny it,

2105
01:50:16.170 --> 01:50:19.500
let the danger light upon your charter

2106
01:50:19.500 --> 01:50:21.400
and your city's freedom.

2107
01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.200
You'll ask me why I rather choose to have

2108
01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:27.300
a weight of carrion flesh than to receive 3,000 ducats.

2109
01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:28.400
I'll not answer that.

2110
01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:31.600
But say it is my humor, is it answered?

2111
01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:37.230
What if my house be troubled with a rat,

2112
01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:42.700
and I be pleased to give 10,000 ducats to have it baned?

2113
01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.070
Are you answered yet?

2114
01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.900
Some men there are love not a gaping pig,

2115
01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:53.730
some that are mad when they behold a cat,

2116
01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:55.870
and others, when the bagpipe sings i'th'nose,

2117
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:58.430
cannot contain their urine.

2118
01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:03.430
For affection,

2119
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:04.830
master of passion,

2120
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:07.530
sways it to the mood of what it likes or loathes.

2121
01:51:07.530 --> 01:51:08.870
Now, for your answer:

2122
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:10.770
As there is no firm reason to be rendered

2123
01:51:10.770 --> 01:51:12.430
why he cannot abide a gaping pig,

2124
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:14.600
why he a harmless necessary cat,

2125
01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:17.130
why he a woollen bagpipe,

2126
01:51:17.130 --> 01:51:20.630
but of force must yield to such inevitable shame

2127
01:51:20.630 --> 01:51:22.800
as to offend, himself being offended,

2128
01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:27.800
so can I give no reason, nor I will not

2129
01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:31.370
more than a lodged hate and a certain loathing

2130
01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:32.830
I bear Antonio

2131
01:51:32.830 --> 01:51:35.630
that I follow thus a losing suit against him.

2132
01:51:35.630 --> 01:51:36.900
Are you answered?

2133
01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:40.200
This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,

2134
01:51:40.200 --> 01:51:42.030
to excuse the current of thy cruelty.

2135
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:45.070
I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

2136
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:47.630
Do all men kill the thing they do not love?

2137
01:51:47.630 --> 01:51:49.830
Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

2138
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:52.370
Every offense is not a hate at first.

2139
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:55.370
What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

2140
01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:57.700
I pray you think you question with the Jew.

2141
01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:59.870
You may as well go stand upon the beach

2142
01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:02.070
and bid the main flood bate his usual height.

2143
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:04.030
You may as well use question with the wolf

2144
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:06.930
why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb.

2145
01:52:06.930 --> 01:52:08.930
You may as well forbid the mountain pines

2146
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:11.500
to wag their high tops and to make no noise

2147
01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:13.530
when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven.

2148
01:52:13.530 --> 01:52:15.830
You may as well do anything most hard

2149
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:19.400
as seek to soften that-- than which what's harder--

2150
01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:21.470
his Jewish heart.

2151
01:52:21.470 --> 01:52:25.070
Therefore, I do beseech you,

2152
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:27.100
make no more offers, use no farther means,

2153
01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:29.100
but with all brief and plain conveniency,

2154
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:31.930
let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

2155
01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:35.200
For thy 3,000 ducats, here is 6.

2156
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:37.930
If every ducat in 6,000 ducats

2157
01:52:37.930 --> 01:52:42.170
were in 6 parts and every part a ducat,

2158
01:52:42.170 --> 01:52:44.170
I would not draw them.

2159
01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:45.800
I would have my bond.

2160
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:50.530
How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

2161
01:52:50.530 --> 01:52:52.530
What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?

2162
01:52:52.530 --> 01:52:53.830
No wrong!

2163
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:58.900
You have amongst you many a purchased slave,

2164
01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:01.830
which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,

2165
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:04.900
you use in abject and in slavish parts

2166
01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:06.530
because you bought them.

2167
01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:08.000
Shall I say to you, "Let them be free.

2168
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.900
"Marry them to your heirs.

2169
01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.870
"Why sweat they under burdens?

2170
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:13.830
"Let their beds be made as soft as yours.

2171
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:17.030
Let their palates be seasoned with such viands?"

2172
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:20.600
You will answer, "The slaves are ours."

2173
01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.900
So do I answer you.

2174
01:53:21.900 --> 01:53:28.670
The pound of flesh which I demand of him is dearly bought.

2175
01:53:28.670 --> 01:53:32.600
'Tis mine, and I will have it.

2176
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:37.300
If you deny me, fie upon your law.

2177
01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:41.070
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.

2178
01:53:41.070 --> 01:53:44.630
I stand for judgment.

2179
01:53:44.630 --> 01:53:47.000
Answer!

2180
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:48.630
Shall I have it?

2181
01:53:48.630 --> 01:53:53.170
Upon my power, I may dismiss this court,

2182
01:53:53.170 --> 01:53:56.200
unless Bellario, a learned doctor

2183
01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:58.270
whom I have sent for to determine this,

2184
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:59.870
come here today.

2185
01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:01.530
My lord, here stays without

2186
01:54:01.530 --> 01:54:03.270
a messenger with letters from the doctor,

2187
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:04.530
new come from Padua.

2188
01:54:04.530 --> 01:54:05.770
Bring us the letters.

2189
01:54:05.770 --> 01:54:07.130
Call the messenger.

2190
01:54:07.130 --> 01:54:09.130
Good cheer, Antonio.

2191
01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:10.630
What, man, courage yet.

2192
01:54:10.630 --> 01:54:13.430
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,

2193
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:16.570
ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

2194
01:54:16.570 --> 01:54:19.530
I am a tainted wether of the flock, meetest for death.

2195
01:54:19.530 --> 01:54:22.430
The weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground,

2196
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:24.170
and so let me.

2197
01:54:24.170 --> 01:54:25.900
You cannot better be employed, Bessanio,

2198
01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:29.030
than to live still, and write mine epitaph.

2199
01:54:40.730 --> 01:54:44.030
Come you from Padua, from Bellario?

2200
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:45.670
From both, my lord.

2201
01:54:45.670 --> 01:54:47.830
Bellario greets your grace.

2202
01:54:54.230 --> 01:54:56.630
Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

2203
01:54:56.630 --> 01:55:00.600
To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

2204
01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:05.130
Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,

2205
01:55:05.130 --> 01:55:06.970
thou mak'st thy knife keen.

2206
01:55:06.970 --> 01:55:09.530
But no metal can-- no, not the hangman's axe--

2207
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:12.270
bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy.

2208
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:14.730
Can no prayers pierce thee?

2209
01:55:14.730 --> 01:55:18.500
No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

2210
01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:21.430
Oh, be thou damned, inexecrable dog.

2211
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:26.300
And for thy life, let justice be accused.

2212
01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:28.130
Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith

2213
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:30.070
to hold opinion with Pythagoras

2214
01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:32.170
that souls of animals infuse themselves

2215
01:55:32.170 --> 01:55:33.730
into the trunks of men.

2216
01:55:33.730 --> 01:55:38.830
Thy currish spirit governed a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,

2217
01:55:38.830 --> 01:55:41.470
even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,

2218
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:43.600
and while thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,

2219
01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.270
infused itself in thee.

2220
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:50.070
For thy desires are wolvish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.

2221
01:55:50.070 --> 01:55:55.100
Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,

2222
01:55:55.100 --> 01:55:57.870
thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud.

2223
01:55:57.870 --> 01:56:00.230
Repair thy wit, good youth,

2224
01:56:00.230 --> 01:56:02.300
or it will fall to cureless ruin.

2225
01:56:02.300 --> 01:56:04.400
I stand here for law.

2226
01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.970
This letter from Bellario doth commend

2227
01:56:06.970 --> 01:56:09.070
a young and learned doctor to our court.

2228
01:56:09.070 --> 01:56:10.470
Where is he?

2229
01:56:10.470 --> 01:56:11.800
He attendeth here hard by

2230
01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:13.700
to know your answer whether you'll admit him.

2231
01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.670
With all my heart.

2232
01:56:15.670 --> 01:56:17.230
Some three or four of you

2233
01:56:17.230 --> 01:56:19.530
go give him courteous conduct to this place.

2234
01:56:19.530 --> 01:56:22.370
Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

2235
01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:24.900
"Your grace shall understand

2236
01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:27.370
"that at the receipt of your letter, I am very sick,

2237
01:56:27.370 --> 01:56:31.330
"but in the instant that your messenger came,

2238
01:56:31.330 --> 01:56:34.430
"in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome.

2239
01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:36.270
"His name is Balthasar.

2240
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:39.400
"I acquainted him with the cause in controversy

2241
01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:41.800
"between the Jew and Antonio the merchant.

2242
01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:44.070
"We turned o'er many books together.

2243
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:45.930
"He is furnished with my opinion,

2244
01:56:45.930 --> 01:56:48.530
"which, bettered with his own learning--

2245
01:56:48.530 --> 01:56:51.270
"the greatness whereof I cannot enough commend--

2246
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:53.430
"comes with him at my importunity

2247
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:56.630
"to fill up your grace's request in my stead.

2248
01:56:56.630 --> 01:57:00.600
"I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment

2249
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.330
"to let him lack a reverend estimation,

2250
01:57:03.330 --> 01:57:08.770
"for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.

2251
01:57:08.770 --> 01:57:10.470
"I leave him to your gracious acceptance,

2252
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:13.600
whose trial shall better publish his commendation."

2253
01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:17.570
You hear the learned Bellario what he writes.

2254
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:20.730
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

2255
01:57:23.170 --> 01:57:24.630
Give me your hand.

2256
01:57:26.770 --> 01:57:28.800
Came you from old Bellario?

2257
01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:29.970
I did, my lord.

2258
01:57:29.970 --> 01:57:33.400
You are welcome; take your place.

2259
01:57:38.030 --> 01:57:41.670
Are you acquainted with the difference

2260
01:57:41.670 --> 01:57:44.000
that holds the present question in the court?

2261
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.600
I am informed throughly of the cause.

2262
01:57:50.370 --> 01:57:53.370
Which is the merchant here and which the Jew?

2263
01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:56.230
Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

2264
01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:01.070
Is your name Shylock?

2265
01:58:01.070 --> 01:58:02.930
Shylock is my name.

2266
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:06.630
Of a strange nature is that suit you follow,

2267
01:58:06.630 --> 01:58:10.000
yet in such rule that the Venetian law

2268
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.430
cannot impugn you as you do proceed.

2269
01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:15.300
You stand within his danger, do you not?

2270
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:17.830
Ay, so he says.

2271
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:19.700
Do you confess the bond?

2272
01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:21.870
I do.

2273
01:58:21.870 --> 01:58:23.600
Then must the Jew be merciful.

2274
01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:24.930
On what compulsion must I?

2275
01:58:24.930 --> 01:58:26.370
Tell me that.

2276
01:58:27.630 --> 01:58:30.770
The quality of mercy is not strained.

2277
01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:33.530
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

2278
01:58:33.530 --> 01:58:35.070
upon the place beneath.

2279
01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:39.000
It is twice blest.

2280
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.170
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.

2281
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:45.100
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest.

2282
01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:47.770
It becomes the throned monarch better than his crown.

2283
01:58:47.770 --> 01:58:51.200
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,

2284
01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:53.930
the attribute to awe and majesty,

2285
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:56.930
wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings.

2286
01:58:56.930 --> 01:59:00.230
But mercy is above this sceptred sway.

2287
01:59:00.230 --> 01:59:03.800
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings.

2288
01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:07.200
It is an attribute to God himself.

2289
01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:11.030
And earthly power doth then show likest God's

2290
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:14.030
when mercy seasons justice.

2291
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:18.000
Therefore, Jew, though justice be thy plea,

2292
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:21.630
consider this that, in the course of justice,

2293
01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:25.470
none of us should see salvation.

2294
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:27.200
We do pray for mercy,

2295
01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.200
and that same prayer doth teach us all

2296
01:59:30.200 --> 01:59:33.600
to render the deeds of mercy.

2297
01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:37.670
I have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea.

2298
01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:40.100
Which, if thou follow, this strict court of Venice

2299
01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:43.200
must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

2300
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:47.900
My deeds upon my head.

2301
01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:53.830
I crave the law, the penalty and forfeit of my bond.

2302
01:59:57.670 --> 02:00:00.430
Is he not able to discharge the money?

2303
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:02.170
Yes, here.

2304
02:00:02.170 --> 02:00:03.900
I tender it for him in the court.

2305
02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:05.700
Yea, twice the sum.

2306
02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:09.570
If that will not suffice, I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er

2307
02:00:09.570 --> 02:00:11.800
on forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.

2308
02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:13.530
If this will not suffice,

2309
02:00:13.530 --> 02:00:17.100
it must appear that malice bears down truth.

2310
02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:19.130
And I beseech you,

2311
02:00:19.130 --> 02:00:21.630
wrest once the law to your authority

2312
02:00:21.630 --> 02:00:24.270
to do a great right, do a little wrong,

2313
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:26.570
and curb this cruel devil of his will.

2314
02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:28.130
It must not be.

2315
02:00:28.130 --> 02:00:31.570
There is no power in Venice can alter a decree established.

2316
02:00:31.570 --> 02:00:34.000
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,

2317
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.800
and many an error by the same example will rush into the state.

2318
02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:38.000
It cannot be.

2319
02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.300
A Daniel come to judgment.

2320
02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:41.870
Yea, a Daniel.

2321
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:46.270
Oh, wise young judge, how I do honor thee.

2322
02:00:46.270 --> 02:00:48.200
I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

2323
02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:50.600
Here 'tis, most reverend doctor.

2324
02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:52.330
Here it is.

2325
02:00:52.330 --> 02:00:53.630
Shylock,

2326
02:00:53.630 --> 02:00:57.800
there's thrice thy money offered thee.

2327
02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:02.670
An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven.

2328
02:01:02.670 --> 02:01:05.700
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?

2329
02:01:05.700 --> 02:01:07.930
No, not for Venice.

2330
02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:12.130
Why, this bond is forfeit,

2331
02:01:12.130 --> 02:01:15.470
and lawfully by this,

2332
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:17.670
the Jew may claim a pound of flesh

2333
02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:21.870
to be by him cut off nearest the merchant's heart.

2334
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:23.100
Be merciful.

2335
02:01:23.100 --> 02:01:24.330
Take thrice thy money.

2336
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:26.000
Bid me tear the bond.

2337
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.400
When it is paid according to the tenor.

2338
02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:31.930
It doth appear you are a worthy judge.

2339
02:01:31.930 --> 02:01:33.570
You know the law.

2340
02:01:33.570 --> 02:01:36.670
Your exposition hath been most sound.

2341
02:01:36.670 --> 02:01:38.870
I charge you, by the law,

2342
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:41.200
whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,

2343
02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:43.330
proceed to judgment.

2344
02:01:43.330 --> 02:01:47.400
By my soul, I swear there is no power in the tongue of man to alter me.

2345
02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.000
I stay here on my bond.

2346
02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.970
Most heartily, I do beseech the court to give the judgment.

2347
02:01:51.970 --> 02:01:55.270
Why then, thus it is.

2348
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:57.700
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

2349
02:01:57.700 --> 02:01:59.730
Oh, noble judge.

2350
02:01:59.730 --> 02:02:01.700
Oh, excellent young man.

2351
02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:04.870
For the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty

2352
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:06.470
which here appeareth due upon the bond.

2353
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:07.600
'Tis very true.

2354
02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:11.000
Oh, wise and upright judge.

2355
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.900
How much more elder art thou than thy looks.

2356
02:02:12.900 --> 02:02:14.970
Therefore, lay bare your bosom.

2357
02:02:14.970 --> 02:02:17.070
Ay, his breast.

2358
02:02:17.070 --> 02:02:18.970
So says the bond.

2359
02:02:18.970 --> 02:02:20.330
Doth it not, noble judge?

2360
02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:21.900
Nearest his heart.

2361
02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:23.000
Those are the very words.

2362
02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:24.170
It is so.

2363
02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:26.200
Are there balance here to weigh the flesh?

2364
02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:27.600
I have them ready.

2365
02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:30.170
Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,

2366
02:02:30.170 --> 02:02:33.830
to stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death?

2367
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:35.500
Is it so nominated in the bond?

2368
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:38.000
It is not so expressed, but what of that?

2369
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.400
'Twere good you do so much for charity.

2370
02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:43.100
I cannot find it.

2371
02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:45.430
'Tis not in the bond.

2372
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:48.970
You, merchant, have you anything to say?

2373
02:02:48.970 --> 02:02:50.470
But little.

2374
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:53.570
I am armed and well prepared.

2375
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:57.030
Give me your hand, Bassanio.

2376
02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:01.500
Fare you well.

2377
02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:07.300
Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you,

2378
02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:12.430
for herein, fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom.

2379
02:03:12.430 --> 02:03:16.070
It is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth

2380
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:17.970
to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow

2381
02:03:17.970 --> 02:03:20.700
an age of poverty from which lingering penance

2382
02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:22.470
of such misery doth she cut me off.

2383
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:26.570
Commend me to your honorable wife.

2384
02:03:26.570 --> 02:03:29.700
Tell her the process of Antonio's end.

2385
02:03:29.700 --> 02:03:33.070
Say how I loved you.

2386
02:03:33.070 --> 02:03:36.070
Speak me fair in death.

2387
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:37.900
And when the tale is told,

2388
02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:41.470
bid her be judge whether Bassanio had not once a love.

2389
02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:43.770
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,

2390
02:03:43.770 --> 02:03:46.630
and he repents not that he pays your debt.

2391
02:03:46.630 --> 02:03:48.800
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,

2392
02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:51.500
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.

2393
02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:56.370
Antonio, I am married to a wife which is as dear to me as life itself,

2394
02:03:56.370 --> 02:03:58.730
but life itself, my wife, and all the world

2395
02:03:58.730 --> 02:04:01.470
are not with me esteemed above thy life.

2396
02:04:01.470 --> 02:04:03.470
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all

2397
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:06.270
here to this devil, to deliver you.

2398
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:08.300
Your wife would give you little thanks for that

2399
02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:10.200
if she were by to hear you make the offer.

2400
02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:12.730
I have a wife who I protest I love.

2401
02:04:12.730 --> 02:04:14.070
I would she were in heaven,

2402
02:04:14.070 --> 02:04:18.330
so she could entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

2403
02:04:18.330 --> 02:04:20.170
'Tis well you offer it behind her back.

2404
02:04:20.170 --> 02:04:23.070
The wish would make else an unquiet house.

2405
02:04:23.070 --> 02:04:26.130
These be the Christian husbands?

2406
02:04:27.770 --> 02:04:31.900
I have a daughter.

2407
02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:34.430
Would any of the stock of Barabbas

2408
02:04:34.430 --> 02:04:37.930
had been her husband rather than a Christian.

2409
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:44.600
We trifle time.

2410
02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:47.570
I pray thee, pursue sentence.

2411
02:04:52.330 --> 02:04:56.700
A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine.

2412
02:04:56.700 --> 02:05:01.170
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

2413
02:05:01.170 --> 02:05:04.070
Most rightful judge.

2414
02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:06.230
And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.

2415
02:05:06.230 --> 02:05:10.170
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

2416
02:05:10.170 --> 02:05:12.470
Most learned judge.

2417
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.300
A sentence!

2418
02:05:28.500 --> 02:05:29.800
Come...

2419
02:05:32.370 --> 02:05:34.400
prepare.

2420
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:54.030
Tarry a little; there is something else.

2421
02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:58.800
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.

2422
02:05:59.070 --> 02:06:02.970
The words expressly are "a pound of flesh."

2423
02:06:02.970 --> 02:06:05.170
Take then thy bond.

2424
02:06:05.170 --> 02:06:08.130
Take thou thy pound of flesh.

2425
02:06:08.130 --> 02:06:11.570
But in the cutting of it if thou dost shed one drop of Christian blood,

2426
02:06:11.570 --> 02:06:15.400
thy lands and goods are, by the laws of Venice,

2427
02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:17.370
confiscate unto the state of Venice.

2428
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:18.600
Oh, upright judge!

2429
02:06:18.600 --> 02:06:19.900
Mark, Jew.

2430
02:06:19.900 --> 02:06:20.970
Oh, learned judge.

2431
02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:27.070
Is that the law?

2432
02:06:27.070 --> 02:06:28.330
Thyself shall see the act.

2433
02:06:28.330 --> 02:06:30.700
For, as thou urgest justice,

2434
02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:33.630
be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.

2435
02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:34.930
Oh, learned judge.

2436
02:06:34.930 --> 02:06:36.730
Mark, Jew, a learned judge.

2437
02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:45.030
I take this offer then.

2438
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:47.870
Pay the bond thrice and let the Christian go.

2439
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:49.130
Here is the money.

2440
02:06:49.130 --> 02:06:51.100
Soft, the Jew shall have all justice.

2441
02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.330
Soft, no haste.

2442
02:06:52.330 --> 02:06:54.070
He shall have nothing but the penalty.

2443
02:06:54.070 --> 02:06:56.130
Oh, Jew, an upright judge.

2444
02:06:56.130 --> 02:06:57.570
A learned judge.

2445
02:06:57.570 --> 02:07:01.600
Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.

2446
02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:02.830
Shed thou no blood,

2447
02:07:02.830 --> 02:07:07.600
nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh.

2448
02:07:07.600 --> 02:07:10.370
If thou tak'st more or less than just a pound,

2449
02:07:10.370 --> 02:07:14.170
be it so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance

2450
02:07:14.170 --> 02:07:17.600
or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple,

2451
02:07:17.600 --> 02:07:21.230
nay, if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair,

2452
02:07:21.230 --> 02:07:25.470
thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.

2453
02:07:25.470 --> 02:07:26.770
A second Daniel.

2454
02:07:26.770 --> 02:07:27.930
A Daniel, Jew.

2455
02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:32.170
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

2456
02:07:32.170 --> 02:07:34.100
Why doth the Jew pause?

2457
02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:35.500
Take thy forfeiture.

2458
02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.830
Give me my principal and let me go.

2459
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:57.070
I have it ready for thee.

2460
02:07:57.070 --> 02:07:58.230
Here it is.

2461
02:07:58.230 --> 02:07:59.770
He hath refused it in the open court.

2462
02:07:59.770 --> 02:08:01.530
He shall have merely justice and his bond.

2463
02:08:01.530 --> 02:08:04.430
A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel.

2464
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:06.500
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

2465
02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:09.330
Shall I not have barely my principal?

2466
02:08:09.330 --> 02:08:11.170
Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture

2467
02:08:11.170 --> 02:08:15.070
to be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

2468
02:08:18.770 --> 02:08:23.030
Why then, the devil give him good of it.

2469
02:08:26.370 --> 02:08:29.200
I'll stay no longer question.

2470
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:33.430
Tarry, Jew, the law hath yet another hold on you.

2471
02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:38.470
It is enacted in the laws of Venice

2472
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:41.700
if it be proved against an alien

2473
02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:44.070
that by direct or indirect attempts

2474
02:08:44.070 --> 02:08:46.270
he seek the life of any citizen,

2475
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:49.230
the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive

2476
02:08:49.230 --> 02:08:51.400
shall seize one half his goods.

2477
02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.670
The other half comes to the privy coffer of the state.

2478
02:08:55.670 --> 02:09:00.500
And the offender's life lies in the mercy of the Duke only

2479
02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:02.830
'gainst all other voice.

2480
02:09:05.070 --> 02:09:06.970
In which predicament I say thou stand'st,

2481
02:09:06.970 --> 02:09:10.870
for it appears by manifest proceedings

2482
02:09:10.870 --> 02:09:13.730
that indirectly, and directly too,

2483
02:09:13.730 --> 02:09:16.670
thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant,

2484
02:09:16.670 --> 02:09:21.670
and thou hast incurred the danger formerly by me rehearsed.

2485
02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:24.970
Down therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.

2486
02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:34.730
Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself.

2487
02:09:34.730 --> 02:09:37.230
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,

2488
02:09:37.230 --> 02:09:40.330
thou hast not left the value of a cord.

2489
02:09:40.330 --> 02:09:45.400
Therefore, thou must be hanged at the state's charge.

2490
02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:47.500
That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit,

2491
02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:50.030
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.

2492
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:54.800
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's.

2493
02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:57.070
The other half comes to the general state

2494
02:09:57.070 --> 02:10:01.370
which humbleness may drive into a fine.

2495
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:03.630
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.

2496
02:10:03.630 --> 02:10:07.030
Nay, take my life and all.

2497
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:09.670
Pardon not that.

2498
02:10:09.670 --> 02:10:13.300
You take my house when you do take the prop

2499
02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:15.300
that doth sustain my house.

2500
02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:19.200
You take my life when you do take the means whereby I live.

2501
02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:21.330
What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

2502
02:10:21.330 --> 02:10:22.630
A halter gratis.

2503
02:10:22.630 --> 02:10:24.030
Nothing else, for God's sake.

2504
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:30.300
So please, my lord, the Duke, and all the court,

2505
02:10:30.300 --> 02:10:32.730
to quit the fine for one half of his goods,

2506
02:10:32.730 --> 02:10:34.070
I am content.

2507
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:37.530
So he will let me have the other half in use,

2508
02:10:37.530 --> 02:10:41.300
to render it upon his death unto the gentleman

2509
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:42.830
that lately stole his daughter.

2510
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:45.500
Two things provided more:

2511
02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:49.930
that for this favor, he presently become a Christian.

2512
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:53.330
The other, that he do record a gift

2513
02:10:53.330 --> 02:10:56.070
here in the court of all he dies possessed

2514
02:10:56.070 --> 02:10:59.000
unto his son, Lorenzo, and his daughter.

2515
02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:02.800
He shall do this, or else I do recant

2516
02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:06.300
the pardon I late pronounced here.

2517
02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:07.470
Art thou contented, Jew?

2518
02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:08.600
What dost thou say?

2519
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:19.800
I am content.

2520
02:11:22.930 --> 02:11:25.530
Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

2521
02:11:56.730 --> 02:12:02.770
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence.

2522
02:12:07.970 --> 02:12:09.730
I am not well.

2523
02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:15.400
Send the deed after me, and I will sign it.

2524
02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:19.530
Get thee gone, but do it.

2525
02:12:31.330 --> 02:12:35.030
In christening, thou shalt have two godfathers.

2526
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:37.000
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more

2527
02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.500
to bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.

2528
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:50.300
Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

2529
02:12:50.300 --> 02:12:52.730
I humbly do desire your grace of pardon.

2530
02:12:52.730 --> 02:12:55.430
I must away this night toward Padua,

2531
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:57.530
and it is meet I presently set forth.

2532
02:12:57.530 --> 02:13:00.770
I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.

2533
02:13:03.170 --> 02:13:09.570
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,

2534
02:13:09.570 --> 02:13:14.570
for in my mind, you are much bound to him.

2535
02:13:20.270 --> 02:13:24.870
Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend have, by your wisdom,

2536
02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:27.500
been this day acquitted of grievous penalties.

2537
02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:30.970
in lieu whereof 3,000 ducats, due unto the Jew,

2538
02:13:30.970 --> 02:13:33.600
we freely cope your courteous pains withal.

2539
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:35.700
And stand indebted, over and above,

2540
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:38.330
in love and service to you evermore.

2541
02:13:38.330 --> 02:13:40.530
He is well paid that is well satisfied.

2542
02:13:40.530 --> 02:13:43.230
And I, delivering you, am satisfied

2543
02:13:43.230 --> 02:13:45.030
and therein do account myself well paid.

2544
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:46.870
My mind was never yet more mercenary.

2545
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:49.930
I pray you know me when we meet again.

2546
02:13:49.930 --> 02:13:51.600
I wish you well, so I take my leave.

2547
02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:54.670
Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further.

2548
02:13:54.670 --> 02:13:58.230
Take some remembrance of us as a tribute, not as fee.

2549
02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:00.100
Grant me two things, I pray:

2550
02:14:00.100 --> 02:14:02.800
not to deny me, and to pardon me.

2551
02:14:02.800 --> 02:14:06.700
You press me far, and therefore I will yield.

2552
02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:07.970
Give me your gloves.

2553
02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:09.970
I'll wear them for your sake.

2554
02:14:09.970 --> 02:14:13.800
And for your love, I'll take this ring from you.

2555
02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:15.230
Do not draw back your hand.

2556
02:14:15.230 --> 02:14:18.100
I'll take no more, and you, in love, cannot deny me this.

2557
02:14:18.100 --> 02:14:20.370
This ring, good sir?

2558
02:14:20.370 --> 02:14:21.870
Alack, it is a trifle.

2559
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:23.730
I will not shame myself to give you this.

2560
02:14:23.730 --> 02:14:25.430
I will have nothing else but only this.

2561
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:27.130
And now methinks I have a mind to it.

2562
02:14:27.130 --> 02:14:29.330
There's more depends on this than on the value.

2563
02:14:29.330 --> 02:14:32.500
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you

2564
02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:34.230
and find it out by proclamation.

2565
02:14:34.230 --> 02:14:36.870
Only for this, I pray you pardon me.

2566
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:38.530
I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.

2567
02:14:38.530 --> 02:14:41.400
You taught me first to beg, and now methinks you teach me

2568
02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:42.830
how a beggar should be answered.

2569
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:46.170
This ring, good sir, was given me by my wife.

2570
02:14:46.170 --> 02:14:48.600
And when she put it on, she made me vow

2571
02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:52.630
I should neither sell nor lose nor give it.

2572
02:14:52.630 --> 02:14:55.670
That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts,

2573
02:14:55.670 --> 02:14:57.500
and if your wife be not a madwoman

2574
02:14:57.500 --> 02:14:59.770
and know how well I have deserved this ring,

2575
02:14:59.770 --> 02:15:03.930
she would not hold out enemy forever for giving it to me.

2576
02:15:03.930 --> 02:15:05.930
Well, peace be with you.

2577
02:15:07.700 --> 02:15:10.700
My lord, Bassanio, let him have the ring.

2578
02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:12.470
Let his deserving, and my love withal

2579
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:15.030
be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment.

2580
02:15:34.570 --> 02:15:37.770
Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him.

2581
02:15:37.770 --> 02:15:39.070
Give him the ring.

2582
02:15:39.070 --> 02:15:41.170
Bring him, if thou canst, unto Antonio's house.

2583
02:15:41.170 --> 02:15:43.900
Away, make haste.

2584
02:15:45.730 --> 02:15:49.200
Come, you and I will thither presently,

2585
02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.500
and in the morning early, we will both fly toward Belmont.

2586
02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:55.930
Come, Antonio.

2587
02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.300
Inquire the Jew's house out.

2588
02:16:08.300 --> 02:16:10.400
Give him this deed; let him sign it.

2589
02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:13.070
We'll away tonight and be a day before our husbands home.

2590
02:16:13.070 --> 02:16:15.330
This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.

2591
02:16:15.330 --> 02:16:16.400
Fair sir!

2592
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:19.900
You are well o'erta'en.

2593
02:16:19.900 --> 02:16:22.570
My lord, Bassanio, upon more advice,

2594
02:16:22.570 --> 02:16:24.530
hath sent you here this ring

2595
02:16:24.530 --> 02:16:26.700
and doth entreat your company at dinner.

2596
02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:28.630
That cannot be.

2597
02:16:28.630 --> 02:16:32.970
His ring I do accept most thankfully, and so I pray you tell him.

2598
02:16:32.970 --> 02:16:35.670
Furthermore, I pray you show my youth old Shylock's house.

2599
02:16:35.670 --> 02:16:37.170
That will I do.

2600
02:16:37.170 --> 02:16:40.470
Sir, I would speak with you.

2601
02:16:40.470 --> 02:16:43.270
I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,

2602
02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:45.470
which I did make him swear to keep forever.

2603
02:16:45.470 --> 02:16:46.870
Thou mayst, I warrant.

2604
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:49.200
We shall have old swearing

2605
02:16:49.200 --> 02:16:51.230
that they did give the rings away to men.

2606
02:16:51.230 --> 02:16:53.230
But we'll outface them and outswear them too.

2607
02:16:53.230 --> 02:16:55.230
Away, make haste.

2608
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:58.270
Thou know'st where I will tarry.

2609
02:16:58.270 --> 02:17:00.770
Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

2610
02:17:08.630 --> 02:17:10.530
The moon shines bright.

2611
02:17:18.170 --> 02:17:19.700
In such a night as this,

2612
02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:24.100
when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees

2613
02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:25.730
and they did make no noise,

2614
02:17:25.730 --> 02:17:27.670
in such a night,

2615
02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:30.470
Troilus methinks mounted the Trojan walls

2616
02:17:30.470 --> 02:17:33.600
and sighed his soul towards the Grecian tents

2617
02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:35.470
where Cressid lay that night.

2618
02:17:35.470 --> 02:17:42.970
In such a night did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew

2619
02:17:42.970 --> 02:17:46.400
and saw the lion's shadow ere himself

2620
02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:49.400
and ran dismayed away.

2621
02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:54.100
In such a night stood Dido with a willow in her hand

2622
02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:55.770
upon the wild sea-banks

2623
02:17:55.770 --> 02:17:59.330
and waft her love to come again to Carthage.

2624
02:17:59.330 --> 02:18:03.730
In such a night, Medea gathered

2625
02:18:03.730 --> 02:18:10.930
the enchanted herbs that did renew old Aeson.

2626
02:18:10.930 --> 02:18:16.030
In such a night did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,

2627
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:18.600
and with an unthrift love,

2628
02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:22.000
did run from Venice as far as Belmont.

2629
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:23.800
In such a night

2630
02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:26.670
did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,

2631
02:18:26.670 --> 02:18:29.870
stealing her soul with many vows of faith

2632
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:32.300
and ne'er a true one.

2633
02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:38.170
In such a night did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,

2634
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:44.070
slander her love, and he forgave it her.

2635
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:46.870
I would out-night you, did nobody come.

2636
02:18:46.870 --> 02:18:49.930
But hark, I hear the footing of a man.

2637
02:18:49.930 --> 02:18:51.800
Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

2638
02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:53.070
A friend.

2639
02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:54.270
A friend?

2640
02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:55.470
What friend?

2641
02:18:55.470 --> 02:18:57.430
Your name, I pray you, friend.

2642
02:18:57.430 --> 02:18:58.870
Stephano is my name,

2643
02:18:58.870 --> 02:19:00.870
and I bring word that my mistress will,

2644
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:03.230
before the break of day, be here at Belmont.

2645
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:05.470
She doth stray about by holy crosses

2646
02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.600
where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours.

2647
02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:09.030
Who comes with her?

2648
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:11.200
None but a holy hermit and her maid.

2649
02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:13.300
I pray you, is my master yet returned?

2650
02:19:13.300 --> 02:19:15.500
He is not yet, nor we have not heard from him.

2651
02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:17.670
But go we in.

2652
02:19:17.670 --> 02:19:19.300
I pray thee, Jessica,

2653
02:19:19.300 --> 02:19:22.870
and ceremoniously let us prepare

2654
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:24.870
some welcome for the mistress of the house.

2655
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:26.500
Sola, sola!

2656
02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:27.700
Wo ha, hoo.

2657
02:19:27.700 --> 02:19:28.900
Sola! Sola!

2658
02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:30.070
Who calls?

2659
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:31.170
Sola!

2660
02:19:31.170 --> 02:19:32.730
Did you see master Lorenzo?

2661
02:19:32.730 --> 02:19:34.600
Master Lorenzo-oo?

2662
02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:35.800
Sola! Sola!

2663
02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:36.970
Leave holloaing, man, here.

2664
02:19:36.970 --> 02:19:38.070
Sola!

2665
02:19:38.070 --> 02:19:39.230
Where?

2666
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:40.330
Here!

2667
02:19:40.330 --> 02:19:42.970
Tell him there's a post come from my master

2668
02:19:42.970 --> 02:19:45.530
with his horn full of good news.

2669
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:48.330
My master will be here ere morning.

2670
02:19:55.930 --> 02:19:59.100
Sweet soul, let's in and there expect their coming.

2671
02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:01.270
And yet no matter.

2672
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:03.130
Why should we go in?

2673
02:20:03.130 --> 02:20:05.070
My friend, Stephano, signify, I pray you,

2674
02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:06.230
within the house--

2675
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:07.530
your mistress is at hand--

2676
02:20:07.530 --> 02:20:11.600
and bring your music forth into the air.

2677
02:20:15.930 --> 02:20:19.500
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank.

2678
02:20:19.500 --> 02:20:20.770
Here will we sit

2679
02:20:20.770 --> 02:20:26.170
and let the sounds of music creep in our ears.

2680
02:20:26.170 --> 02:20:29.630
Soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony.

2681
02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:31.870
Sit, Jessica.

2682
02:20:39.500 --> 02:20:41.670
Look how the floor of heaven

2683
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:44.800
is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.

2684
02:20:47.330 --> 02:20:49.730
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st

2685
02:20:49.730 --> 02:20:52.630
but in his motion like an angel sings

2686
02:20:52.630 --> 02:20:57.430
still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins.

2687
02:20:57.430 --> 02:21:01.130
Such harmony is in immortal souls.

2688
02:21:01.130 --> 02:21:04.230
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay

2689
02:21:04.230 --> 02:21:09.100
doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

2690
02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:15.770
Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn.

2691
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:19.730
With sweetest touches, pierce your mistress' ear

2692
02:21:19.730 --> 02:21:22.270
and draw her home with music.

2693
02:21:30.730 --> 02:21:34.100
I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

2694
02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:39.670
The reason is your spirits are attentive.

2695
02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:44.330
For do but note a wild and wanton herd

2696
02:21:44.330 --> 02:21:46.930
or race of youthful and unhandled colts

2697
02:21:46.930 --> 02:21:50.370
fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,

2698
02:21:50.370 --> 02:21:53.670
which is the hot condition of their blood.

2699
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:56.330
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound

2700
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:59.630
or any air of music touch their ears,

2701
02:21:59.630 --> 02:22:02.030
you shall perceive them make a mutual stand,

2702
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:05.700
their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze

2703
02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:08.500
by the sweet power of music.

2704
02:22:08.500 --> 02:22:10.830
Therefore the poet did feign

2705
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:13.570
that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods,

2706
02:22:13.570 --> 02:22:16.930
since naught so stockish, hard, and full of rage,

2707
02:22:16.930 --> 02:22:20.700
but music for the time doth change his nature.

2708
02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:26.570
The man that hath no music in himself,

2709
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:30.800
nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,

2710
02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:34.000
is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.

2711
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.100
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,

2712
02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:40.800
and his affections dark as Erebus.

2713
02:22:40.800 --> 02:22:44.230
Let no such man be trusted.

2714
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:50.370
Mark the music.

2715
02:23:23.830 --> 02:23:25.830
That light we see is burning in my hall.

2716
02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:30.430
How far that little candle throws his beams.

2717
02:23:30.430 --> 02:23:34.530
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

2718
02:23:34.530 --> 02:23:37.100
When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

2719
02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:40.530
So doth the greater glory dim the less.

2720
02:23:40.530 --> 02:23:43.270
A substitute shines brightly as a king

2721
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:44.500
until a king be by,

2722
02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:46.900
and then his state empties itself

2723
02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:49.170
as doth an inland brook into the main of waters.

2724
02:23:49.170 --> 02:23:52.430
Music, hark.

2725
02:23:52.430 --> 02:23:55.470
It is your music, madam, of the house.

2726
02:23:55.470 --> 02:23:59.030
Nothing is good, I see, without respect.

2727
02:23:59.030 --> 02:24:01.170
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

2728
02:24:01.170 --> 02:24:04.730
Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

2729
02:24:04.730 --> 02:24:06.370
The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark

2730
02:24:06.370 --> 02:24:07.770
when neither is attended,

2731
02:24:07.770 --> 02:24:11.200
and I think the nightingale, if she should sing by day

2732
02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:12.500
when every goose is cackling,

2733
02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:16.130
would be thought no better a musician than the wren.

2734
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:19.400
How many things by season seasoned

2735
02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:22.130
are to their right praise and true perfection.

2736
02:24:22.130 --> 02:24:26.070
Peace, ho.

2737
02:24:26.070 --> 02:24:29.400
The moon sleeps with Endymion and would not be awaked.

2738
02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:34.430
That is the voice, or I am much deceived, of Portia.

2739
02:24:34.430 --> 02:24:36.670
He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo

2740
02:24:36.670 --> 02:24:37.970
by the bad voice.

2741
02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:42.630
Dear lady, welcome home.

2742
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:45.170
We have been praying for our husbands' welfare,

2743
02:24:45.170 --> 02:24:48.070
which speed, we hope, the better for our words.

2744
02:24:48.070 --> 02:24:49.670
Are they returned?

2745
02:24:49.670 --> 02:24:51.170
Madam, they are not yet,

2746
02:24:51.170 --> 02:24:53.130
but there has come a messenger before

2747
02:24:53.130 --> 02:24:54.500
to signify their coming.

2748
02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:56.770
Go in, Nerissa, give order to my servants

2749
02:24:56.770 --> 02:24:59.100
that they take no note at all of our being absent hence.

2750
02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:01.800
Nor you, Lorenzo-- Jessica, nor you.

2751
02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:03.430
Your husband is at hand.

2752
02:25:03.430 --> 02:25:04.600
I hear his trumpet.

2753
02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:06.770
We are no telltales, madam.

2754
02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:08.070
Fear you not.

2755
02:25:08.070 --> 02:25:10.570
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.

2756
02:25:10.570 --> 02:25:11.900
It looks a little paler.

2757
02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:16.100
'Tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid.

2758
02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:18.170
We should hold day with the antipodes

2759
02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:20.570
if you would walk in absence of the sun.

2760
02:25:20.570 --> 02:25:23.070
Let me give light, but let me not be light,

2761
02:25:23.070 --> 02:25:25.400
for a light wife doth make a heavy husband,

2762
02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:27.470
and never be Bassanio so for me.

2763
02:25:27.470 --> 02:25:29.470
But God sort all.

2764
02:25:29.470 --> 02:25:31.600
You are welcome home, my lord.

2765
02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:33.570
I thank you, madam.

2766
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:39.870
Give welcome to my friend.

2767
02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:41.700
This is the man.

2768
02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.670
This is Antonio,

2769
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:45.800
to whom I am so infinitely bound.

2770
02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:47.830
You should in all sense be much bound to him,

2771
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:50.670
for, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

2772
02:25:50.670 --> 02:25:52.600
No more than I am well acquitted of.

2773
02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:54.830
Sir, you are very welcome to our house.

2774
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:56.800
It must appear in other ways than words.

2775
02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.230
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

2776
02:25:59.230 --> 02:26:02.130
By yonder moon, I swear you do me wrong.

2777
02:26:02.130 --> 02:26:04.400
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk.

2778
02:26:04.400 --> 02:26:06.530
Would he were gelt that had it for my part

2779
02:26:06.530 --> 02:26:08.270
since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

2780
02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:09.370
A quarrel?

2781
02:26:09.370 --> 02:26:10.530
Ho, already?

2782
02:26:10.530 --> 02:26:11.730
What's the matter?

2783
02:26:11.730 --> 02:26:14.100
About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring that she did give me

2784
02:26:14.100 --> 02:26:17.570
whose posy was, for all the world, like cutler's poetry upon a knife.

2785
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:19.900
"Love me, and leave me not."

2786
02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:22.230
What talk you of the posy or the value?

2787
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:24.770
You swore to me when I did give it to you

2788
02:26:24.770 --> 02:26:26.870
that you would wear it till your hour of death

2789
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:29.970
and that it should lie with you in your grave.

2790
02:26:29.970 --> 02:26:32.930
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,

2791
02:26:32.930 --> 02:26:35.500
you should have been respective and kept it.

2792
02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:37.430
Gave it a judge's clerk.

2793
02:26:37.430 --> 02:26:40.100
No, God's my judge, the clerk will ne'er wear hair

2794
02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:41.600
on's face that had it.

2795
02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:43.100
He will, an if he live to be a man.

2796
02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:44.630
Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

2797
02:26:44.630 --> 02:26:46.700
Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,

2798
02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:48.730
a kind of boy,

2799
02:26:48.730 --> 02:26:52.670
a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself,

2800
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:56.530
the judge's clerk, a prating boy that begged it as a fee.

2801
02:26:56.530 --> 02:26:58.530
I could not for my heart deny it him.

2802
02:26:58.530 --> 02:26:59.730
You were to blame.

2803
02:26:59.730 --> 02:27:01.630
I must be plain with you.

2804
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:04.600
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift,

2805
02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:07.600
a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger

2806
02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:10.100
and so riveted with faith unto your flesh.

2807
02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:15.030
I gave my love a ring, and here he stands.

2808
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:18.270
I dare be sworn for him, he would not leave it

2809
02:27:18.270 --> 02:27:19.800
nor pluck it from his finger

2810
02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:22.170
for the wealth that the world masters.

2811
02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:23.470
Now in faith, Gratiano,

2812
02:27:23.470 --> 02:27:25.900
you gave your wife too unkind a cause of grief.

2813
02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:27.630
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

2814
02:27:27.630 --> 02:27:29.530
Why, I were best to cut my left hand off

2815
02:27:29.530 --> 02:27:31.470
and swear I lost the ring defending it.

2816
02:27:31.470 --> 02:27:33.870
My lord, Bassanio, gave his ring away

2817
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:36.330
unto the judge that begged it, and indeed deserved it too.

2818
02:27:36.330 --> 02:27:39.630
And then the boy, his clerk, that took some pains in writing,

2819
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:42.000
he begged mine, and neither man nor master

2820
02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.230
would take aught but the two rings.

2821
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:46.330
What ring gave you, my lord?

2822
02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:50.930
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

2823
02:27:50.930 --> 02:27:56.470
If I could add a lie unto a fault, I would deny it.

2824
02:27:56.470 --> 02:27:59.170
But you see my finger hath not the ring upon it.

2825
02:27:59.170 --> 02:28:01.170
It is gone.

2826
02:28:01.170 --> 02:28:05.830
Even so void is your false heart of truth.

2827
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:11.470
By heaven, I shall ne'er come in your bed until I see the ring.

2828
02:28:11.470 --> 02:28:13.970
Nor I in yours till I again see mine.

2829
02:28:13.970 --> 02:28:15.300
Sweet Portia,

2830
02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:18.300
if you did know to whom I gave the ring,

2831
02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:20.730
if you did know for whom I gave the ring,

2832
02:28:20.730 --> 02:28:23.330
and would conceive for what I gave the ring

2833
02:28:23.330 --> 02:28:25.500
and how unwillingly I left the ring

2834
02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:27.400
when naught would be accepted but the ring,

2835
02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:29.670
you would abate the strength of your displeasure.

2836
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:31.870
If you had known the virtue of the ring,

2837
02:28:31.870 --> 02:28:34.700
or half her worthiness that gave the ring,

2838
02:28:34.700 --> 02:28:37.470
or your own honor to contain the ring,

2839
02:28:37.470 --> 02:28:40.030
you would not then have parted with the ring.

2840
02:28:40.030 --> 02:28:43.070
What man is there so much unreasonable,

2841
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:46.830
if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal,

2842
02:28:46.830 --> 02:28:50.570
wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony?

2843
02:28:50.570 --> 02:28:52.770
Nerissa teaches me what to believe.

2844
02:28:52.770 --> 02:28:55.330
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

2845
02:28:55.330 --> 02:28:59.170
No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,

2846
02:28:59.170 --> 02:29:01.130
no woman had it,

2847
02:29:01.130 --> 02:29:05.300
but a civil doctor which did refuse 3,000 ducats of me

2848
02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:07.800
and begged the ring, the which I did deny him

2849
02:29:07.800 --> 02:29:10.630
and suffered him to go displeased away,

2850
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:15.330
even he that had held up the very life of my dear friend.

2851
02:29:15.330 --> 02:29:18.170
What should I say, sweet lady?

2852
02:29:18.170 --> 02:29:20.400
I was enforced to send it after him.

2853
02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:23.070
I was beset with shame and courtesy.

2854
02:29:23.070 --> 02:29:27.530
My honour would not let ingratitude so much besmear it.

2855
02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:30.170
Pardon me, good lady.

2856
02:29:30.170 --> 02:29:32.100
For by these blessed candles of the night

2857
02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:33.430
had you been there,

2858
02:29:33.430 --> 02:29:35.670
I think you would have begged the ring of me

2859
02:29:35.670 --> 02:29:36.930
to give the worthy doctor.

2860
02:29:36.930 --> 02:29:39.800
Let not that doctor e'er come near my house.

2861
02:29:39.800 --> 02:29:42.300
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved

2862
02:29:42.300 --> 02:29:44.830
and that which you did swear to keep for me,

2863
02:29:44.830 --> 02:29:46.870
I will become as liberal as you.

2864
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:49.170
I'll not deny him anything I have.

2865
02:29:49.170 --> 02:29:52.030
No, not my body nor my husband's bed.

2866
02:29:52.030 --> 02:29:54.370
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.

2867
02:29:54.370 --> 02:29:56.430
Lie not a night from home.

2868
02:29:56.430 --> 02:29:57.770
Watch me like Argus.

2869
02:29:57.770 --> 02:30:00.030
If you do not, if I am left alone,

2870
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:02.470
now by mine honour, which is yet mine own,

2871
02:30:02.470 --> 02:30:04.670
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

2872
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:05.970
And I his clerk.

2873
02:30:05.970 --> 02:30:07.870
Therefore, be well advised

2874
02:30:07.870 --> 02:30:09.930
how you do leave me to mine own protection.

2875
02:30:09.930 --> 02:30:11.330
Well, do you so.

2876
02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:13.070
Let not me take him then.

2877
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:16.000
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

2878
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.900
I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

2879
02:30:18.900 --> 02:30:21.430
Sir, grieve not you, you are welcome notwithstanding.

2880
02:30:21.430 --> 02:30:26.200
Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong,

2881
02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:28.100
and in the hearing of these many friends,

2882
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:31.930
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes

2883
02:30:31.930 --> 02:30:33.130
wherein I see myself--

2884
02:30:33.130 --> 02:30:34.830
Mark you but that!

2885
02:30:34.830 --> 02:30:37.570
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,

2886
02:30:37.570 --> 02:30:38.800
in each eye one.

2887
02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:41.670
Swear by your double self, and there's an oath of credit.

2888
02:30:41.670 --> 02:30:43.770
Nay, but hear me.

2889
02:30:43.770 --> 02:30:47.930
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear,

2890
02:30:47.930 --> 02:30:51.070
I never more will break an oath with thee.

2891
02:30:51.070 --> 02:30:53.430
I once did lend my body for his wealth,

2892
02:30:53.430 --> 02:30:55.970
which but for him that had your husband's ring,

2893
02:30:55.970 --> 02:30:57.800
had quite miscarried.

2894
02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:00.370
I dare be bound again, my soul upon the forfeit,

2895
02:31:00.370 --> 02:31:02.900
that your lord will never more break faith advisedly.

2896
02:31:02.900 --> 02:31:06.600
Then you shall be his surety.

2897
02:31:08.270 --> 02:31:09.530
Give him this,

2898
02:31:09.530 --> 02:31:13.030
and bid him keep it better than the other.

2899
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:15.770
Here, lord Bassanio,

2900
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:17.670
swear to keep this ring.

2901
02:31:22.270 --> 02:31:26.270
By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor.

2902
02:31:26.270 --> 02:31:28.570
I had it of him.

2903
02:31:28.570 --> 02:31:30.730
Pardon me, Bassanio,

2904
02:31:30.730 --> 02:31:33.730
for by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

2905
02:31:33.730 --> 02:31:36.170
And pardon me, my gentle Graciano,

2906
02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:40.170
for that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,

2907
02:31:40.170 --> 02:31:43.670
in lieu of this last night did lie with me.

2908
02:31:46.130 --> 02:31:48.600
Why, this is like the mending of highways in summer

2909
02:31:48.600 --> 02:31:50.330
where the ways are fair enough.

2910
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:52.970
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?

2911
02:31:52.970 --> 02:31:55.230
Speak not so grossly.

2912
02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:00.430
You are all amazed.

2913
02:32:00.430 --> 02:32:02.970
Here is a letter.

2914
02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:06.070
Read it at your leisure.

2915
02:32:06.070 --> 02:32:08.470
It comes from Padua from Bellario.

2916
02:32:08.470 --> 02:32:12.470
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,

2917
02:32:12.470 --> 02:32:15.100
Nerissa there her clerk.

2918
02:32:15.100 --> 02:32:17.970
Lorenzo here shall witness I set forth as soon as you

2919
02:32:17.970 --> 02:32:19.230
and but now returned.

2920
02:32:19.230 --> 02:32:23.230
I have not yet entered my house.

2921
02:32:23.230 --> 02:32:26.070
Antonio, you are welcome,

2922
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:29.130
and I have better news in store for you than you expect.

2923
02:32:29.130 --> 02:32:31.930
Unseal this letter soon.

2924
02:32:31.930 --> 02:32:34.600
There you shall find that three of your argosies

2925
02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:36.630
are richly come to harbour suddenly.

2926
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:39.370
You shall not know by what strange accident

2927
02:32:39.370 --> 02:32:41.170
I chanced on this letter.

2928
02:32:43.700 --> 02:32:45.270
I am dumb.

2929
02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:50.730
Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?

2930
02:32:50.730 --> 02:32:53.400
Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

2931
02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:56.000
Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it

2932
02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.770
unless he live until he be a man.

2933
02:32:58.770 --> 02:33:01.430
Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.

2934
02:33:01.430 --> 02:33:04.770
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

2935
02:33:07.930 --> 02:33:09.400
Sweet lady,

2936
02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:12.070
you have given me life and living,

2937
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:16.600
for here I read for certain that my ships are safely come to road.

2938
02:33:17.670 --> 02:33:19.600
How now, Lorenzo?

2939
02:33:19.600 --> 02:33:24.870
My clerk hath some good comforts, too, for you.

2940
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:28.170
Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.

2941
02:33:28.170 --> 02:33:32.270
There do I give to you and Jessica from the rich Jew

2942
02:33:32.270 --> 02:33:33.700
a special deed of gift

2943
02:33:33.700 --> 02:33:36.430
after his death of all he dies possessed of.

2944
02:33:36.430 --> 02:33:40.170
Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way of starved people.

2945
02:33:40.170 --> 02:33:43.330
It is almost morning,

2946
02:33:43.330 --> 02:33:45.970
and yet I am sure you are not satisfied

2947
02:33:45.970 --> 02:33:48.100
of these events at full.

2948
02:33:48.100 --> 02:33:53.400
Let us go in, and charge us there upon inter'gatories,

2949
02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:56.530
and we will answer all things faithfully.

2950
02:33:56.530 --> 02:33:58.200
Let it be so.

2951
02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:02.870
The first inter'gatory that my Nerissa shall be sworn on is

2952
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:05.730
whether till the next night she had rather stay

2953
02:34:05.730 --> 02:34:07.970
or go to bed now, being two hours to day.

2954
02:34:07.970 --> 02:34:11.630
But were the day come, I should wish it dark

2955
02:34:11.630 --> 02:34:15.400
till I were couching with the doctor's clerk.

2956
02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:19.900
Well, while I live, I'll fear no other thing

2957
02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:24.770
so sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

2958
02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:05.770
