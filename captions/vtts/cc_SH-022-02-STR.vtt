00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.130


2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.370
Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.230
I saw not better sport these seven years' day:

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.130
But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.430
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
To see how God in all his creatures works!

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.200
Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.570
No marvel, an it like your majesty,

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.900
My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.830
They know their master loves to be aloft,

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.900
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.770
My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind

13
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.800
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.700
I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.730
Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?

16
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.330
Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
The treasury of everlasting joy.

18
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.030
Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.870
Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;

20
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.770
Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,

21
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.430
That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!

22
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.100
Churchmen so hot? Good uncle, can you do it?

23
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.330
To hide such malice with such holiness?

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.800
No malice, sir; no more than well becomes

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.530
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.

26
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.370
As who, my lord?

27
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.030
Why, as yourself, my lord,

28
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.330
An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.

29
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.500
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.770
And thy ambition, Gloucester.

31
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.700
I prithee, peace, good queen,

32
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.270
And whet not on these furious peers;

33
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.630
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.

34
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.500
Let me be blessed for the peace I make,

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.900
Against this proud protector, with my sword!

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.970
Faith, holy uncle,

37
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.230
would 'twere come to that!

38
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.100
Marry, when thou darest.

39
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.070
Dare? Until thee priest,

40
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.330
plantagenets could never brook the dare.

41
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.470
I am plantagenet as well as thou.

42
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.930
And son to John of Gaunt.

43
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.200
In bastardy.

44
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.430
I scorn thy words.

45
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.330
Make up no factious numbers for the matter;

46
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.930
In thine own person answer thy abuse.

47
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.970
Ay, where thou darest not peep:

48
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.270
an if thou darest,

49
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.770
This evening, on the east side of the grove.

50
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.530
How now, my lords!

51
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.530
Believe me, cousin Gloucester,

52
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.930
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,

53
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.470
We had had more sport.

54
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.470
Come with thy two-hand sword.

55
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.900
True, uncle.

56
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.230
Are ye well advised?

57
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.630
The east side of the grove?

58
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.770
I am with you.

59
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.630
Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!

60
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.330
Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.

61
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.670
Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,

62
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.970
Protector, see to't well, protect thyself.

63
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.230
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.

64
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.570
How irksome is this music to my heart!

65
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.830
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?

66
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.130
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.

67
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.330
(commotion in background)

68
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.270
What noise is this?

69
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.530
Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?

70
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.600
A miracle! a miracle!

71
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.100
Come to the king and tell him what miracle.

72
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.230
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,

73
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.670
Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;

74
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.300
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.

75
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.100
Now, God be praised, that to believing souls

76
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.800
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!

77
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.170
(crowd chanting)

78
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.730
Here comes the townsmen on procession,

79
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.270
To present your highness with the man.

80
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.400
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,

81
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.270
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.

82
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.630
(men singing) A miracle! A miracle!

83
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.500
Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;

84
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.300
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.

85
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.770
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,

86
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.070
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.

87
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.530
What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?

88
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.970
Born blind, an't please your grace.

89
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.970
Ay, indeed, was he.

90
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.030
What woman is this?

91
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.770
His wife, an't like your worship.

92
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.430
Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have better told.

93
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.830
Where wert thou born?

94
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.700
At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.

95
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.270
Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:

96
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.970
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,

97
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.370
But still remember what the Lord hath done.

98
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.970
Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,

99
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.130
Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?

100
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.570
God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd

101
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.770
A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,

102
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.370
By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Saunder, come,

103
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.600
Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'

104
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.700
Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft

105
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.500
Myself have heard a voice to call him so.

106
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.870
What, art thou lame?

107
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.270
Ay, God Almighty help me!

108
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.730
How camest thou so?

109
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.300
A fall off of a tree.

110
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.270
A plum-tree, master.

111
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.370
How long hast thou been blind?

112
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.970
Born so, master.

113
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.230
What, and wouldst climb a tree?

114
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.930
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.

115
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.670
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.

116
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.000
Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst venture so.

117
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.070
Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,

118
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.600
And made me climb, with danger of my life.

119
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.070
A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.

120
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:43.800
Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:

121
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.330
In my opinion yet thou seest not well.

122
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.730
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and Saint Alban.

123
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.900
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?

124
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.570
Red, master; red as blood.

125
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.730
Why, that's well said. What colour is this gown of?

126
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.530
Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.

127
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.630
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?

128
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.800
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.

129
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.070
But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.

130
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.600
Never, before this day, in all his life.

131
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.330
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?

132
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.970
Alas, master, I know not.

133
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.070
What's his name?

134
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.930
I know not.

135
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.970
Nor his?

136
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.800
No, indeed, master.

137
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.200
What's thine own name?

138
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.030
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.

139
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.000
Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in Christendom.

140
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.870
If thou hadst been born blind,

141
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.900
thou mightest as well have known all our names as thus to

142
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.030
name the several colours we do wear.

143
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.900
Sight may distinguish of colours,

144
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.070
but suddenly to nominate them all, it is impossible.

145
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.500
Saint Alban here hath done a miracle;

146
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.970
and might ye not think his cunning to be great,

147
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.300
that could restore this cripple to his legs?

148
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.230
O master, that you could!

149
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.570
My masters of Saint Alban's,

150
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.770
have you not a beadle in your town, and things called whips?

151
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.070
Yes, my lord.

152
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.400
Send for one presently.

153
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.870
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.

154
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.400
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,

155
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.470
if you mean to save yourself from whipping,

156
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.600
leap me over this stool and run.

157
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.700
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:

158
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.800
You go about to torture me in vain.

159
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.900
Well we must have you find your legs.

160
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.330
Whip him till he leap over that same stool.

161
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.700
Come on, sirrah; off with your doublet quickly.

162
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.200
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.

163
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.930
(Man screams. Crowd chants) A miracle!!

164
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.430
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?

165
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.300
It made me laugh to see the villain run.

166
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.200
Follow the knave; and take this drab away.

167
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.170
Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.

168
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.600
Let them be whipped through every market-town,

169
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.470
till they come to Berwick, from whence they came.

170
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.230
Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.

171
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.470
True; made the lame to leap and fly away.

172
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.000
But you have done more miracles than I;

173
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.570
You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.

174
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.270
What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?

175
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.770
Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.

176
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.200
A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,

177
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.230
Under the countenance and confederacy of Lady Eleanor,

178
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.170
the protector's wife,

179
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.130
The ringleader and head of all this rout,

180
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.930
Have practised dangerously against your state,

181
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.170
Dealing with witches and with conjurers:

182
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.630
Whom we have apprehended in the fact;

183
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.270
Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,

184
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.730
Demanding of King Henry's life and death,

185
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.100
And other of your highness' privy-council;

186
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.070
As more at large your grace shall understand.

187
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.300
O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,

188
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.100
Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!

189
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.100
Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.

190
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.600
And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.

191
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.600
Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,

192
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.500
How I have loved my king and commonweal:

193
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:27.970
And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;

194
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.830
Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:

195
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.100
Noble she is, but if she have forgot

196
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.600
Honour and virtue and conversed with such

197
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.200
As, like to pitch, defile nobility,

198
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.730
I banish her my bed and company

199
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.800
And give her as a prey to law and shame,

200
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:59.200
That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.

201
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.530
Well, for this night we will repose us here:

202
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.030
To-morrow toward London back again,

203
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.400
To look into this business thoroughly

204
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.830
And call these foul offenders to their answers

205
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.570
And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,

206
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.600
Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.

207
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.430
Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,

208
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.770
Our simple supper ended, give me leave

209
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.670
In this close walk to satisfy myself,

210
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.070
In craving your opinion of my title,

211
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.830
Which is infallible, to England's crown.

212
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.170
My lord, I long to hear it at full.

213
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.600
Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,

214
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.530
The Nevils are thy subjects to command.

215
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.530
Then thus:

216
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.070
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:

217
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.730
The first, the Black Prince died before his father

218
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.600
and left behind him, Richard, his only son.

219
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.000
Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;

220
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.500
Till Henry Bolingbroke, The son and heir of John of Gaunt,

221
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.630
the fourth of Edward's sons

222
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.070
Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,

223
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.730
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,

224
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.870
And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,

225
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.370
Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.

226
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.030
Father, the duke of York hath told the truth:

227
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.530
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.

228
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.670
Which now they hold by force and not by right;

229
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.170
For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,

230
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.470
The issue of the next son should have reign'd.

231
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.230
But William of Hatfield died without an heir.

232
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.230
The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line

233
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.400
I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,

234
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.370
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:

235
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.470
Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;

236
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.600
Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.

237
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.070
This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,

238
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.130
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;

239
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:42.370
And therefore was kept captive til he died

240
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.030
But to the rest.

241
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.470
His eldest sister, Anne,

242
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.700
My mother, being heir unto the crown

243
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.530
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge;

244
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.900
who was son to Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.

245
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.870
By her I claim the kingdom:

246
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.300
she was heir To Roger Earl of March, who was the son

247
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.500
Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,

248
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.000
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:

249
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.730
So, if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger,

250
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.400
I am king.

251
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.200
What plain proceeding is more plain than this?

252
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.000
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,

253
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.700
The fourth son; York claims it from the third.

254
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.670
Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:

255
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.170
It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee

256
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.470
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.

257
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.500
Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;

258
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.630
And in this private plot be we the first

259
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.770
That shall salute our rightful sovereign

260
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.430
With honour of his birthright to the crown.

261
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.430
Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!

262
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:15.430
We thank you, lords. But I am not your king

263
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.930
Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd

264
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.770
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;

265
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.800
And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,

266
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.370
But with advice and silent secrecy.

267
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.170
Do you as I do in these dangerous days:

268
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.730
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,

269
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.270
At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,

270
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.500
At Buckingham and all the crew of them,

271
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.570
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,

272
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.730
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:

273
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.370
'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that

274
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.270
Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.

275
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:02.770
My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.

276
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.570
My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick

277
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:13.330
Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.

278
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.330
And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:

279
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.570
Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick

280
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.770
The greatest man in England but the king.

281
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.070
Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:

282
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.830
In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:

283
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.730
Receive the sentence of the law for sins

284
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.200
Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.

285
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.800
You four, from hence to prison back again;

286
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.130
From thence unto the place of execution:

287
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.230
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,

288
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.500
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.

289
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.930
You, madam, for you are more nobly born,

290
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.930
Despoiled of your honour in your life,

291
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.670
Shall, after three days' open penance done,

292
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.470
Live in your country here in banishment,

293
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.470
With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.

294
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:38.430
Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.

295
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:44.530
Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:

296
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.200
I cannot justify whom the law condemns.

297
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.500
(old woman laughs)

298
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.670
I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;

299
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.730
Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.

300
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.030
Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,

301
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:34.930
Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself protector be;

302
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.970
and God shall be my hope,

303
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.400
My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:

304
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.870
And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved

305
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.130
Than when thou wert protector to thy King.

306
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.400
I see no reason why a king of years

307
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.870
Should be to be protected like a child.

308
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.670
God and King Henry govern England's realm.

309
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.870
Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.

310
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:07.670
My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:

311
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.530
As willingly do I the same resign

312
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.130
As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;

313
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:20.630
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it

314
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:26.770
As others would ambitiously receive it.

315
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:32.070
Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,

316
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.670
May honourable peace attend thy throne!

317
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:59.770
Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;

318
00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.000
And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,

319
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.470
That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;

320
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.600
His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.

321
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:21.700
This staff of honour raught, there let it stand

322
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.900
Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.

323
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.000
Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;

324
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.

325
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty,

326
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.600
This is the day appointed for the combat;

327
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.130
And ready are the appellant and defendant,

328
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.230
The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,

329
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.570
So please your highness to behold the fight.

330
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.670
Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore

331
00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.170
Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.

332
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.900
O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:

333
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.470
Here let them end it; and God defend the right!

334
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.300
Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of sack:

335
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.830
and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.

336
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:38.100
And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.

337
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.570
And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour:

338
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.130
drink, and fear not your man.

339
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:56.130
Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all;

340
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.600
and a fig for Peter!

341
00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.870
First 'Prentice Here, Peter, I drink to thee:

342
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.400
and be not afraid.

343
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.300
Second 'Prentice Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master:

344
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.630
fight for credit of the 'prentices.

345
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.570
I thank you all: drink, and pray for me, I pray you;

346
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.670
for I think I have taken my last draught in this world.

347
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:20.570
Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee my apron:

348
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.800
and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer:

349
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.200
and here, Tom, take all the money that I have.

350
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.700
O Lord bless me! I pray God! for I am never able to deal

351
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.130
with my master, he hath learnt me so much fence already.

352
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.030
Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows.

353
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.630
Sirrah, what's thy name?

354
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.030
Peter, forsooth.

355
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.270
Peter! what more?

356
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.400
Thump.

357
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.200
Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.

358
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:56.930
Masters, I am come hither, as it were,

359
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.400
at my man's instigation,

360
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.330
to prove him a knave and myself an honest man:

361
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.970
and touching the Duke of York,

362
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.730
I will take my death, I never meant him any ill,

363
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:18.300
nor the king, nor the queen: and therefore,

364
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.570
Peter, have at thee with a downright blow!

365
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:25.070
Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.

366
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.370
Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!

367
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.900
(trumpets sound)

368
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.330
Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.

369
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:32.700
Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God,

370
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:42.000
Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God,

371
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.930
and the good wine in thy master's way.

372
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:59.400
O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?

373
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:07.200
O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!

374
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.570
Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;

375
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.830
For by his death we do perceive his guilt:

376
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.770
And God in justice hath revealed to us

377
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.430
The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,

378
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.670
Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.

379
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.070
Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.

380
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.400
Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;

381
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.830
And after summer evermore succeeds barren winter,

382
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.970
with his wrathful nipping cold:

383
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:55.900
So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.

384
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.730
Sirs, what's o'clock?

385
00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.300
Ten, my lord.

386
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.430
Ten is the hour that was appointed me

387
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.570
To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:

388
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.130
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,

389
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.570
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.

390
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:21.530
Soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare

391
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.730
My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.

392
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.630
So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.

393
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.670
No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.

394
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:40.600
Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?

395
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.900
Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!

396
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.100
See how the giddy multitude do point,

397
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.100
And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!

398
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.330
Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,

399
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.630
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,

400
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.000
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!

401
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.770
Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.

402
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.000
Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!

403
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.430
Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,

404
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.300
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?

405
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.770
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;

406
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.900
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.

407
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.370
Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,

408
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.530
And he a prince and ruler of the land:

409
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.770
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was

410
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.630
As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,

411
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.670
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock

412
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.100
To every idle rascal follower.

413
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.500
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,

414
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.630
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death

415
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.470
Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;

416
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.370
For Suffolk, he that can do all in all

417
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.870
With her that hateth thee and hates us all,

418
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.130
And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,

419
00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.430
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,

420
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:06.130
And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:

421
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.800
But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,

422
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.700
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.

423
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.200
Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;

424
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.230
I must offend before I be attainted;

425
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.900
And had I twenty times so many foes,

426
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.870
And each of them had twenty times their power,

427
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.170
All these could not procure me any scathe,

428
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.630
So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.

429
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.900
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?

430
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.270
Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away

431
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.970
But I in danger for the breach of law.

432
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:57.300
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:

433
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.700
I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;

434
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.600
These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.

435
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.800
I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,

436
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.370
Holden at Bury the first of this next month.

437
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:18.070
And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!

438
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:26.700
This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.

439
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:38.570
My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,

440
00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.700
Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.

441
00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.000
An't please your grace, here my commission stays,

442
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.830
And Sir John Stanley is appointed now

443
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.530
To take her with him to the Isle of Man.

444
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.930
Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?

445
00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.100
So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.

446
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:04.370
Entreat her not the worse in that I pray you use her well:

447
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.430
the world may laugh again;

448
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.870
And I may live to do you kindness if you do it her:

449
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.030
and so, Sir John, farewell!

450
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.800
What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!

451
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.530
Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.

452
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:36.170
Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!

453
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:43.570
For none abides with me: my joy is death;

454
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.070
Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,

455
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:50.400
Because I wish'd this world's eternity.

456
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.830
Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;

457
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.170
I care not whither, for I beg no favour,

458
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.370
Only convey me where thou art commanded.

459
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:03.770
Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,

460
00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.900
Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.

461
00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.600
It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.

462
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.070
Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.

463
00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.170
Come, Stanley, shall we go?

464
00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:23.370
Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,

465
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:26.500
And go we to attire you for our journey.

466
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:30.270
My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:

467
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.370
No, it will hang upon my richest robes

468
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:38.170
And show itself, attire me how I can.

469
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:44.970
Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.

470
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.100
