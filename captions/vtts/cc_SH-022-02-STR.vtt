2
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.370
Believe me, lords, forflying at the brook,

3
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.230
I saw not better sportthese seven years' day:

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.130
But what a point, my lord,your falcon made,

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.430
And what a pitch she flewabove the rest!

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
To see how God in all hiscreatures works!

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.200
Yea, man and birds arefain of climbing high.

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.570
No marvel, an it like yourmajesty,

9
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.900
My lord protector's hawksdo tower so well;

10
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.830
They know their masterloves to be aloft,

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.900
And bears his thoughtsabove his falcon's pitch.

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.770
My lord, 'tis but a baseignoble mind

13
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.800
That mounts no higher thana bird can soar.

14
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.700
I thought as much; hewould be above the clouds.

15
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.730
Ay, my lord cardinal? howthink you by that?

16
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.330
Were it not good yourgrace could fly to heaven?

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
The treasury ofeverlasting joy.

18
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.030
Thy heaven is on earth;thine eyes and thoughts

19
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.870
Beat on a crown, thetreasure of thy heart;

20
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.770
Pernicious protector,dangerous peer,

21
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.430
That smooth'st it so withking and commonweal!

22
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.100
Churchmen so hot? Gooduncle, can you do it?

23
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.330
To hide such malice withsuch holiness?

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.800
No malice, sir; no morethan well becomes

25
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.530
So good a quarrel and sobad a peer.

26
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.370
As who, my lord?

27
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.030
Why, as yourself, my lord,

28
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.330
An't like your lordlylord-protectorship.

29
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.500
Why, Suffolk, Englandknows thine insolence.

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.770
And thy ambition,Gloucester.

31
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.700
I prithee, peace, goodqueen,

32
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.270
And whet not on thesefurious peers;

33
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.630
For blessed are thepeacemakers on earth.

34
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.500
Let me be blessed for thepeace I make,

35
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.900
Against this proudprotector, with my sword!

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.970
Faith, holy uncle,

37
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.230
would 'twere come to that!

38
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.100
Marry, when thou darest.

39
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.070
Dare? Until thee priest,

40
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.330
plantagenets couldnever brook the dare.

41
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.470
I am plantagenet as well asthou.

42
00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.930
And son to John of Gaunt.

43
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.200
In bastardy.

44
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.430
I scorn thy words.

45
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.330
Make up no factiousnumbers for the matter;

46
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.930
In thine own person answerthy abuse.

47
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:09.970
Ay, where thou darest not peep:

48
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.270
an if thou darest,

49
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.770
This evening, on theeast side of the grove.

50
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.530
How now, my lords!

51
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.530
Believe me, cousinGloucester,

52
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.930
Had not your man put upthe fowl so suddenly,

53
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.470
We had had more sport.

54
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.470
Come with thy two-handsword.

55
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.900
True, uncle.

56
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.230
Are ye well advised?

57
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.630
The east side of the grove?

58
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.770
I am with you.

59
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.630
Why, how now, uncleGloucester!

60
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.330
Talking of hawking;nothing else, my lord.

61
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.670
Now, by God's mother, priest,I'll shave your crown for this,

62
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.970
Protector, see to't well,protect thyself.

63
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.230
The winds grow high; so doyour stomachs, lords.

64
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.570
How irksome is this musicto my heart!

65
00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.830
When such strings jar,what hope of harmony?

66
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.130
I pray, my lords, let mecompound this strife.

67
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.330
(commotion in background)

68
00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.270
What noise is this?

69
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.530
Fellow, what miracle dostthou proclaim?

70
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.600
A miracle! a miracle!

71
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.100
Come to the king and tellhim what miracle.

72
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.230
Forsooth, a blind man atSaint Alban's shrine,

73
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.670
Within this half-hour,hath received his sight;

74
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.300
A man that ne'er saw inhis life before.

75
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.100
Now, God be praised, thatto believing souls

76
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.800
Gives light in darkness,comfort in despair!

77
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.170
(crowd chanting)

78
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.730
Here comes the townsmen onprocession,

79
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.270
To present your highnesswith the man.

80
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.400
Great is his comfort inthis earthly vale,

81
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.270
Although by his sight hissin be multiplied.

82
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:47.630
(men singing) A miracle! Amiracle!

83
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.500
Stand by, my masters:bring him near the king;

84
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.300
His highness' pleasure isto talk with him.

85
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.770
Good fellow, tell us herethe circumstance,

86
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.070
That we for thee mayglorify the Lord.

87
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.530
What, hast thou been longblind and now restored?

88
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.970
Born blind, an't pleaseyour grace.

89
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.970
Ay, indeed, was he.

90
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.030
What woman is this?

91
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.770
His wife, an't like yourworship.

92
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.430
Hadst thou been his mother,thou couldst have better told.

93
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.830
Where wert thou born?

94
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.700
At Berwick in the north,an't like your grace.

95
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.270
Poor soul, God's goodnesshath been great to thee:

96
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.970
Let never day nor nightunhallow'd pass,

97
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.370
But still remember whatthe Lord hath done.

98
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.970
Tell me, good fellow,camest thou here by chance,

99
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.130
Or of devotion, to thisholy shrine?

100
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.570
God knows, of puredevotion; being call'd

101
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.770
A hundred times andoftener, in my sleep,

102
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.370
By good Saint Alban; whosaid, 'Saunder, come,

103
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.600
Come, offer at my shrine,and I will help thee.'

104
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.700
Most true, forsooth; andmany time and oft

105
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.500
Myself have heard a voiceto call him so.

106
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.870
What, art thou lame?

107
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.270
Ay, God Almighty help me!

108
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.730
How camest thou so?

109
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.300
A fall off of a tree.

110
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.270
A plum-tree, master.

111
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.370
How long hast thou beenblind?

112
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.970
Born so, master.

113
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.230
What, and wouldst climb atree?

114
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.930
But that in all my life,when I was a youth.

115
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.670
Too true; and bought hisclimbing very dear.

116
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.000
Mass, thou lovedst plums well,that wouldst venture so.

117
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.070
Alas, good master, my wifedesired some damsons,

118
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.600
And made me climb, withdanger of my life.

119
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.070
A subtle knave! but yet itshall not serve.

120
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:43.800
Let me see thine eyes:wink now: now open them:

121
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.330
In my opinion yet thouseest not well.

122
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.730
Yes, master, clear as day, Ithank God and Saint Alban.

123
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.900
Say'st thou me so? Whatcolour is this cloak of?

124
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.570
Red, master; red as blood.

125
00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.730
Why, that's well said.What colour is this gown of?

126
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.530
Black, forsooth:coal-black as jet.

127
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.630
Why, then, thou know'stwhat colour jet is of?

128
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.800
And yet, I think, jet didhe never see.

129
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.070
But cloaks and gowns,before this day, a many.

130
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.600
Never, before this day, inall his life.

131
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.330
Tell me, sirrah, what's myname?

132
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.970
Alas, master, I know not.

133
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:24.070
What's his name?

134
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.930
I know not.

135
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.970
Nor his?

136
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:26.800
No, indeed, master.

137
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.200
What's thine own name?

138
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.030
Saunder Simpcox, an if itplease you, master.

139
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.000
Then, Saunder, sit there, thelyingest knave in Christendom.

140
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.870
If thou hadst been born blind,

141
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:39.900
thou mightest as well haveknown all our names as thus to

142
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.030
name the severalcolours we do wear.

143
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.900
Sight may distinguishof colours,

144
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.070
but suddenly to nominatethem all, it is impossible.

145
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.500
Saint Alban here hathdone a miracle;

146
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.970
and might ye not thinkhis cunning to be great,

147
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.300
that could restore thiscripple to his legs?

148
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.230
O master, that you could!

149
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.570
My masters of Saint Alban's,

150
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.770
have you not a beadle in yourtown, and things called whips?

151
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.070
Yes, my lord.

152
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:05.400
Send for onepresently.

153
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.870
Sirrah, go fetch thebeadle hither straight.

154
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.400
Now fetch me a stool hitherby and by. Now, sirrah,

155
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.470
if you mean to saveyourself from whipping,

156
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.600
leap me over thisstool and run.

157
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.700
Alas, master, I am notable to stand alone:

158
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.800
You go about to torture mein vain.

159
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.900
Well we must haveyou find your legs.

160
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.330
Whip him till heleap over that same stool.

161
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.700
Come on, sirrah; off withyour doublet quickly.

162
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.200
Alas, master, what shall Ido? I am not able to stand.

163
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.930
(Man screams. Crowd chants) Amiracle!!

164
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.430
O God, seest Thou this,and bearest so long?

165
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.300
It made me laugh to seethe villain run.

166
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:57.200
Follow the knave; and takethis drab away.

167
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.170
Alas, sir, we did it forpure need.

168
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.600
Let them be whipped throughevery market-town,

169
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.470
till they come to Berwick,from whence they came.

170
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.230
Duke Humphrey has done amiracle to-day.

171
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.470
True; made the lame toleap and fly away.

172
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.000
But you have done moremiracles than I;

173
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.570
You made in a day, mylord, whole towns to fly.

174
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:26.270
What tidings with ourcousin Buckingham?

175
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.770
Such as my heart dothtremble to unfold.

176
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.200
A sort of naughty persons,lewdly bent,

177
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.230
Under the countenance andconfederacy of Lady Eleanor,

178
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.170
the protector's wife,

179
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.130
The ringleader and head ofall this rout,

180
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.930
Have practised dangerouslyagainst your state,

181
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.170
Dealing with witches andwith conjurers:

182
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.630
Whom we have apprehendedin the fact;

183
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.270
Raising up wicked spiritsfrom under ground,

184
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.730
Demanding of King Henry'slife and death,

185
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.100
And other of yourhighness' privy-council;

186
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.070
As more at large yourgrace shall understand.

187
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.300
O God, what mischiefs workthe wicked ones,

188
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.100
Heaping confusion on theirown heads thereby!

189
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.100
Gloucester, see here thetainture of thy nest.

190
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:12.600
And look thyself befaultless, thou wert best.

191
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.600
Madam, for myself, toheaven I do appeal,

192
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.500
How I have loved my kingand commonweal:

193
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:27.970
And, for my wife, I knownot how it stands;

194
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:31.830
Sorry I am to hear what Ihave heard:

195
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.100
Noble she is, but if shehave forgot

196
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.600
Honour and virtue andconversed with such

197
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.200
As, like to pitch, defilenobility,

198
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.730
I banish her my bed andcompany

199
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.800
And give her as a prey tolaw and shame,

200
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:59.200
That hath dishonour'dGloucester's honest name.

201
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.530
Well, for this night wewill repose us here:

202
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.030
To-morrow toward Londonback again,

203
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.400
To look into this businessthoroughly

204
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.830
And call these fouloffenders to their answers

205
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.570
And poise the cause injustice' equal scales,

206
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.600
Whose beam stands sure, whoserightful cause prevails.

207
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.430
Now, my good Lords ofSalisbury and Warwick,

208
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.770
Our simple supper ended,give me leave

209
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.670
In this close walk tosatisfy myself,

210
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.070
In craving your opinion ofmy title,

211
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.830
Which is infallible, toEngland's crown.

212
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.170
My lord, I long to hear itat full.

213
00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.600
Sweet York, begin: and ifthy claim be good,

214
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.530
The Nevils are thysubjects to command.

215
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.530
Then thus:

216
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.070
Edward the Third, mylords, had seven sons:

217
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:22.730
The first, the Black Princedied before his father

218
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.600
and left behind him,Richard, his only son.

219
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.000
Who after Edward the Third'sdeath reign'd as king;

220
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.500
Till Henry Bolingbroke, The sonand heir of John of Gaunt,

221
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.630
the fourth of Edward's sons

222
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.070
Seized on the realm,deposed the rightful king,

223
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.730
Sent his poor queen toFrance, from whence she came,

224
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.870
And him to Pomfret; where,as all you know,

225
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.370
Harmless Richard wasmurder'd traitorously.

226
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:53.030
Father, the duke of York hathtold the truth:

227
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.530
Thus got the house ofLancaster the crown.

228
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.670
Which now they hold byforce and not by right;

229
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:07.170
For Richard, the firstson's heir, being dead,

230
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.470
The issue of the next sonshould have reign'd.

231
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.230
But William of Hatfielddied without an heir.

232
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.230
The third son, Duke ofClarence, from whose line

233
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.400
I claimed the crown, hadissue, Philippe, a daughter,

234
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.370
Who married EdmundMortimer, Earl of March:

235
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.470
Edmund had issue, RogerEarl of March;

236
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.600
Roger had issue, Edmund,Anne and Eleanor.

237
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.070
This Edmund, in the reignof Bolingbroke,

238
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.130
As I have read, laid claimunto the crown;

239
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:42.370
And therefore was kept captivetil he died

240
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.030
But to the rest.

241
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.470
His eldest sister, Anne,

242
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.700
My mother, being heir untothe crown

243
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.530
Married RichardEarl of Cambridge;

244
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.900
who was son to Edmund Langley,Edward the Third's fifth son.

245
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.870
By her I claim the kingdom:

246
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.300
she was heir To Roger Earlof March, who was the son

247
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.500
Of Edmund Mortimer, whomarried Philippe,

248
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.000
Sole daughter unto LionelDuke of Clarence:

249
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.730
So, if the issue of the elderson succeed before the younger,

250
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.400
I am king.

251
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.200
What plain proceeding ismore plain than this?

252
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.000
Henry doth claim the crownfrom John of Gaunt,

253
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.700
The fourth son; Yorkclaims it from the third.

254
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.670
Till Lionel's issue fails,his should not reign:

255
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.170
It fails not yet, butflourishes in thee

256
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:39.470
And in thy sons, fairslips of such a stock.

257
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.500
Then, father Salisbury,kneel we together;

258
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.630
And in this private plotbe we the first

259
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.770
That shall salute ourrightful sovereign

260
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.430
With honour of hisbirthright to the crown.

261
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.430
Long live our sovereignRichard, England's king!

262
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:15.430
We thank you, lords. But Iam not your king

263
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.930
Till I be crown'd and thatmy sword be stain'd

264
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.770
With heart-blood of thehouse of Lancaster;

265
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:24.800
And that's not suddenly tobe perform'd,

266
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.370
But with advice and silentsecrecy.

267
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.170
Do you as I do in thesedangerous days:

268
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.730
Wink at the Duke ofSuffolk's insolence,

269
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:41.270
At Beaufort's pride, atSomerset's ambition,

270
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.500
At Buckingham and all thecrew of them,

271
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.570
Till they have snared theshepherd of the flock,

272
00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.730
That virtuous prince, thegood Duke Humphrey:

273
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.370
'Tis that they seek, andthey in seeking that

274
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:57.270
Shall find their deaths,if York can prophesy.

275
00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:02.770
My lord, break we off; weknow your mind at full.

276
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.570
My heart assures me thatthe Earl of Warwick

277
00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:13.330
Shall one day make theDuke of York a king.

278
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.330
And, Nevil, this I doassure myself:

279
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.570
Richard shall live to makethe Earl of Warwick

280
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.770
The greatest man inEngland but the king.

281
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.070
Stand forth, Dame EleanorCobham, Gloucester's wife:

282
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:03.830
In sight of God and us,your guilt is great:

283
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.730
Receive the sentence ofthe law for sins

284
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:09.200
Such as by God's book areadjudged to death.

285
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.800
You four, from hence toprison back again;

286
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.130
From thence unto the placeof execution:

287
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.230
The witch in Smithfieldshall be burn'd to ashes,

288
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.500
And you three shall bestrangled on the gallows.

289
00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.930
You, madam, for you aremore nobly born,

290
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.930
Despoiled of your honourin your life,

291
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.670
Shall, after three days'open penance done,

292
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.470
Live in your country herein banishment,

293
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.470
With Sir John Stanley, inthe Isle of Man.

294
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:38.430
Welcome is banishment;welcome were my death.

295
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:44.530
Eleanor, the law, thousee'st, hath judged thee:

296
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:49.200
I cannot justify whom thelaw condemns.

297
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.500
(old woman laughs)

298
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.670
I beseech your majesty,give me leave to go;

299
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.730
Sorrow would solace andmine age would ease.

300
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.030
Stay, Humphrey Duke ofGloucester: ere thou go,

301
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:34.930
Give up thy staff: Henry willto himself protector be;

302
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:35.970
and God shall be my hope,

303
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.400
My stay, my guide andlantern to my feet:

304
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.870
And go in peace, Humphrey,no less beloved

305
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.130
Than when thou wertprotector to thy King.

306
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.400
I see no reason why a kingof years

307
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.870
Should be to be protectedlike a child.

308
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:54.670
God and King Henry governEngland's realm.

309
00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.870
Give up your staff, sir,and the king his realm.

310
00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:07.670
My staff? here, nobleHenry, is my staff:

311
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.530
As willingly do I the sameresign

312
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.130
As e'er thy father Henrymade it mine;

313
00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:20.630
And even as willingly atthy feet I leave it

314
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:26.770
As others wouldambitiously receive it.

315
00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:32.070
Farewell, good king: whenI am dead and gone,

316
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.670
May honourable peaceattend thy throne!

317
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:59.770
Why, now is Henry king,and Margaret queen;

318
00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.000
And Humphrey Duke ofGloucester scarce himself,

319
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.470
That bears so shrewd amaim; two pulls at once;

320
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.600
His lady banish'd, and alimb lopp'd off.

321
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:21.700
This staff of honourraught, there let it stand

322
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:26.900
Where it best fits to be,in Henry's hand.

323
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.000
Thus droops this loftypine and hangs his sprays;

324
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Thus Eleanor's pride diesin her youngest days.

325
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Lords, let him go. Pleaseit your majesty,

326
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.600
This is the day appointedfor the combat;

327
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.130
And ready are theappellant and defendant,

328
00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:50.230
The armourer and his man,to enter the lists,

329
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.570
So please your highness tobehold the fight.

330
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.670
Ay, good my lord; forpurposely therefore

331
00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:00.170
Left I the court, to seethis quarrel tried.

332
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.900
O God's name, see thelists and all things fit:

333
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.470
Here let them end it; andGod defend the right!

334
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.300
Here, neighbour Horner, I drinkto you in a cup of sack:

335
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:31.830
and fear not, neighbour,you shall do well enough.

336
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:38.100
And here, neighbour,here's a cup of charneco.

337
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.570
And here's a pot of gooddouble beer, neighbour:

338
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.130
drink, and fear not yourman.

339
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:56.130
Let it come, i' faith,and I'll pledge you all;

340
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:58.600
and a fig for Peter!

341
00:20:58.600 --> 00:20:59.870
First 'Prentice Here,Peter, I drink to thee:

342
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:01.400
and be not afraid.

343
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.300
Second 'Prentice Be merry,Peter, and fear not thy master:

344
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.630
fight for credit ofthe 'prentices.

345
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:12.570
I thank you all: drink, andpray for me, I pray you;

346
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:14.670
for I think I have taken mylast draught in this world.

347
00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:20.570
Here, Robin, an if I die,I give thee my apron:

348
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.800
and, Will, thou shalthave my hammer:

349
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.200
and here, Tom, take allthe money that I have.

350
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.700
O Lord bless me! I pray God!for I am never able to deal

351
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.130
with my master, he hath learntme so much fence already.

352
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.030
Come, leave your drinking,and fall to blows.

353
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.630
Sirrah, what's thy name?

354
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.030
Peter, forsooth.

355
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.270
Peter! what more?

356
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.400
Thump.

357
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.200
Thump! then see thou thumpthy master well.

358
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:56.930
Masters, I am comehither, as it were,

359
00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.400
at my man's instigation,

360
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.330
to prove him a knave andmyself an honest man:

361
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.970
and touching the Duke of York,

362
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.730
I will take my death, Inever meant him any ill,

363
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:18.300
nor the king, nor thequeen: and therefore,

364
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.570
Peter, have at theewith a downright blow!

365
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:25.070
Dispatch: this knave'stongue begins to double.

366
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.370
Sound, trumpets, alarum tothe combatants!

367
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.900
(trumpets sound)

368
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.330
Hold, Peter, hold! Iconfess, I confess treason.

369
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:32.700
Take away his weapon.Fellow, thank God,

370
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:42.000
Take away his weapon.Fellow, thank God,

371
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.930
and the good wine inthy master's way.

372
00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:59.400
O God, have I overcome mineenemy in this presence?

373
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:07.200
O Peter, thou hastprevailed in right!

374
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.570
Go, take hence thattraitor from our sight;

375
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.830
For by his death we doperceive his guilt:

376
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.770
And God in justice hathrevealed to us

377
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.430
The truth and innocence ofthis poor fellow,

378
00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.670
Which he had thought tohave murder'd wrongfully.

379
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.070
Come, fellow, follow usfor thy reward.

380
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.400
Thus sometimes hath thebrightest day a cloud;

381
00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.830
And after summer evermoresucceeds barren winter,

382
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.970
with his wrathful nipping cold:

383
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:55.900
So cares and joys abound,as seasons fleet.

384
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.730
Sirs, what's o'clock?

385
00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.300
Ten, my lord.

386
00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.430
Ten is the hour that wasappointed me

387
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:05.570
To watch the coming of mypunish'd duchess:

388
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:11.130
Uneath may she endure theflinty streets,

389
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:14.570
To tread them with hertender-feeling feet.

390
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:21.530
Soft! I think shecomes; and I'll prepare

391
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.730
My tear-stain'd eyes tosee her miseries.

392
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.630
So please your grace, we'lltake her from the sheriff.

393
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:35.670
No, stir not, for yourlives; let her pass by.

394
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:40.600
Come you, my lord, to seemy open shame?

395
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.900
Now thou dost penance too.Look how they gaze!

396
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.100
See how the giddymultitude do point,

397
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.100
And nod their heads, andthrow their eyes on thee!

398
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.330
Ah, Gloucester, hide theefrom their hateful looks,

399
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:55.630
And, in thy closet pentup, rue my shame,

400
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.000
And ban thine enemies,both mine and thine!

401
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.770
Be patient, gentle Nell;forget this grief.

402
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.000
Ah, Gloucester, teach meto forget myself!

403
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.430
Trow'st thou that e'erI'll look upon the world,

404
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.300
Or count them happy thatenjoy the sun?

405
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.770
No; dark shall be my lightand night my day;

406
00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.900
To think upon my pompshall be my hell.

407
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.370
Sometime I'll say, I amDuke Humphrey's wife,

408
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.530
And he a prince and rulerof the land:

409
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.770
Yet so he ruled and such aprince he was

410
00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.630
As he stood by whilst I,his forlorn duchess,

411
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.670
Was made a wonder and apointing-stock

412
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.100
To every idle rascalfollower.

413
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.500
But be thou mild and blushnot at my shame,

414
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.630
Nor stir at nothing tillthe axe of death

415
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.470
Hang over thee, as, sure,it shortly will;

416
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.370
For Suffolk, he that cando all in all

417
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.870
With her that hateth theeand hates us all,

418
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.130
And York and impiousBeaufort, that false priest,

419
00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.430
Have all limed bushes tobetray thy wings,

420
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:06.130
And, fly thou how thoucanst, they'll tangle thee:

421
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.800
But fear not thou, untilthy foot be snared,

422
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.700
Nor never seek preventionof thy foes.

423
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.200
Ah, Nell, forbear! thouaimest all awry;

424
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.230
I must offend before I beattainted;

425
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.900
And had I twenty times somany foes,

426
00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.870
And each of them hadtwenty times their power,

427
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:29.170
All these could notprocure me any scathe,

428
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.630
So long as I am loyal,true and crimeless.

429
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.900
Wouldst have me rescuethee from this reproach?

430
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.270
Why, yet thy scandal werenot wiped away

431
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.970
But I in danger for thebreach of law.

432
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:57.300
Thy greatest help isquiet, gentle Nell:

433
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.700
I pray thee, sort thyheart to patience;

434
00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.600
These few days' wonderwill be quickly worn.

435
00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.800
I summon your grace to hismajesty's parliament,

436
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.370

And my consent ne'er ask'dherein before!

438
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:26.700
This is close dealing.Well, I will be there.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:38.570
My Nell, I take my leave:and, master sheriff,

440

An't please your grace,here my commission stays,

And Sir John Stanley isappointed now

To take her with him tothe Isle of Man.

444
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.930
Must you, Sir John,protect my lady here?

So am I given in charge,may't please your grace.

446
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:04.370
Entreat her not the worse inthat I pray you use her well:

447
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:05.430

448
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.870
And I may live to do youkindness if you do it her:

449
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.030

Witness my tears, I cannotstay to speak.

452

Art thou gone too? allcomfort go with thee!

453
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:43.570
For none abides with me:my joy is death;

454
00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.070
Death, at whose name I ofthave been afear'd,

455
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:50.400
Because I wish'd thisworld's eternity.

456
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.830
Stanley, I prithee, go,and take me hence;

457
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.170
I care not whither, for Ibeg no favour,

458
00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:58.370
Only convey me where thouart commanded.

459
00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:03.770
Sheriff, farewell, andbetter than I fare,

460
00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.900
Although thou hast beenconduct of my shame.

It is my office; and,madam, pardon me.

Ay, ay, farewell; thyoffice is discharged.

463

Come, Stanley, shall wego?

And go we to attire youfor our journey.

My shame will not beshifted with my sheet:

467
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.370
No, it will hang upon myrichest robes

468
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:38.170
And show itself, attire mehow I can.

469
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:44.970
Go, lead the way; I longto see my prison.

470
