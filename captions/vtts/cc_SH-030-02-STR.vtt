00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.630


2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:06.530
Here have you seena mighty King,

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.170
His child, I wis, toincest bring;

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.870
A better prince and benignlord,

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.430
That will prove awful bothin deed and word.

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.130
Be quiet then as menshould be,

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.230
Till he hath pass'dnecessity.

8
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.070
I'll show you those introubles reign,

9
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.000
Losing a mite, a mountaingain.

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.300
The good in conversation,

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.570
To whom I give my benison,

12
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.400
Is still at Tarsus, whereeach man

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.030
Thinks all is writ hespoken can;

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.430
And, to remember what hedoes,

15
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.100
Build his statue to makehim glorious:

16
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.900
But tidings to thecontrary

17
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.170
Are brought your eyes;what need speak I?

18
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.470
Good Helicane, hath stay'dat home,

19
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.300
Not to eat honey like adrone

20
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.730
From others' labours; forthough he strive

21
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.630
To killen bad, keep goodalive;

22
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.470
And to fulfil his prince'desire,

23
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.970
Sends word of all thathaps in Tyre:

24
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.600
How Thaliard came fullbent with sin

25
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.470
And had intent to murderhim;

26
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.800
And that in Tarsus was notbest

27
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.630
Longer for him to make hisrest.

28
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.630
He, doing so, put forth toseas,

29
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.600
Where when men been,there's seldom ease;

30
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200
For now the wind begins toblow;

31
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.230
Thunder above and deepsbelow

32
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.670
Make such unquiet, thatthe ship

33
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.470
Should house him safe iswreck'd and split;

34
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.130
And he, good prince,having all lost,

35
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.730
By waves from coast tocoast is tost:

36
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.930
All perishen of man, ofpelf,

37
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.830
Ne aught escapen buthimself;

38
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.000
Till fortune, tired withdoing bad,

39
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.770
Threw him ashore, to givehim glad:

40
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.930
And here he comes. Whatshall be next,

41
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.430
Pardon old Gower,--thislongs the text.

42
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.270
Yet cease your ire, youangry stars of heaven!

43
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.870
Wind, rain, and thunder,remember, earthly man

44
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.500
Is but a substance thatmust yield to you;

45
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.800
And I, as fits my nature,do obey you:

46
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.800
Alas, the sea hath cast meon the rocks,

47
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.930
Wash'd me from shore toshore, and left me breath

48
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.330
Nothing to think on butensuing death:

49
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.230
Let it suffice thegreatness of your powers

50
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.100
To have bereft a prince ofall his fortunes;

51
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.170
And having thrown him fromyour watery grave,

52
00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.630
Here to have death inpeace is all he'll crave.

53
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.400
What, ho, Pilch!

54
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.300
Ha, come and bring awaythe nets!

55
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.400
What, Patch-breech, I say!

56
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.270
What say you, master?

57
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.400
Look how thou stirrestnow! come away, or I'll

58
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.870
fetch thee with a wanion.

59
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.800
Faith, master, I am thinkingof the poor men that

60
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.670
were cast away before useven now.

61
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.170
Alas, poor souls, it grievedmy heart to hear what

62
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.500
pitiful cries they made tous to help them, when,

63
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.900
well-a-day, we couldscarce help ourselves.

64
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.530
Nay, master, said not I asmuch when I saw the

65
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.770
porpus how he bounced andtumbled? they say

66
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.270
they're half fish, halfflesh: a plague on them,

67
00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.170
they ne'er come but I lookto be washed. Master, I

68
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.700
marvel how the fishes livein the sea.

69
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.970
Why, as men do a-land; thegreat ones eat up the

70
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.100
little ones: I can compareyour rich misers to

71
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.530
nothing so fitly as to awhale; a' plays and

72
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.970
tumbles, driving the poorfry before him, and at

73
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.170
last devours them all at amouthful: such whales

74
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.100
have I heard on o' the land,who never leave gaping

75
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.530
till they've swallowed thewhole parish, church,

76
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.570
steeple, bells, and all.

77
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.100
A pretty moral.

78
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.330
But, master, if I hadbeen the sexton,

79
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.830
I would have been thatday in the belfry.

80
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.200
Why, man?

81
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.000
Because he should haveswallowed me too: and when I

82
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.370
had been in his belly, Iwould have kept such a

83
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.770
jangling of the bells, thathe should never have left,

84
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.030
till he cast bells,steeple, church,

85
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.200
and parish up again. But ifthe good King Simonides

86
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.130
were of my mind,--

87
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.200
Simonides!

88
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.330
We would purge the land ofthese drones, that rob

89
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.530
the bee of her honey.

90
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.230
How from the finnysubject of the sea

91
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.200
These fishers tell theinfirmities of men;

92
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.630
And from their wateryempire recollect

93
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.770
All that may men approveor men detect!

94
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.100
Peace be at your labour,honest fishermen.

95
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.700
Honest! good fellow, what'sthat? If it be a day fits you,

96
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.630
search out of the calendar,and nobody look after it.

97
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.800
May see the sea hath castupon your coast.

98
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.300
What a drunken knave was thesea to cast thee in our way!

99
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.000
A man whom both thewaters and the wind,

100
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.570
In that vast tennis-court,have made the ball

101
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:50.930
For them to play upon,entreats you pity him:

102
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.300
He asks of you, that neverused to beg.

103
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.670
No, friend, cannot youbeg? Here's them in our

104
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.400
land of Greece getsmore with begging

105
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.900
than we can get with working.

106
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.230
Canst thou catch anyfishes, then?

107
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.930
I never practised it.

108
00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.130
Nay, then thou wilt starve,sure; for here's nothing

109
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.700
to be got now-a-days, unlessthou canst fish for't.

110
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.170
What I have been I haveforgot to know;

111
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:25.370
But what I am, wantteaches me to think on:

112
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:31.870
A man throng'd up withcold: my veins are chill,

113
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.670
And have no more of lifethan may suffice

114
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.600
To give my tongue thatheat to ask your help;

115
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.670
Which if you shall refuse,when I am dead,

116
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.730
For that I am a man, praysee me buried.

117
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.470
Die quoth-a? Now godsforbid! I have a coat here;

118
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.630
come, put it on; keep theewarm. Now, afore me,

119
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.530
a handsome fellow! Come,thou shalt go home,

120
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.270
and we'll have fleshfor holidays,

121
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.330
fish for fasting-days,and moreo'er puddings

122
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.970
and flap-jacks, andthou shalt be welcome.

123
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.970
I thank you, sir.

124
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.100
Hark you, my friend; yousaid you could not beg.

125
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.430
I did but crave.

126
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.000
But crave! Then I'll turncraver too, and so I

127
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.700
shall 'scape whipping.

128
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.370
Why, are all your beggarswhipped, then?

129
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.670
O, not all, my friend, notall; for if all your

130
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.470
beggars were whipped, Iwould wish no better office

131
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:31.030
than to be beadle. But, master,I'll go draw up the net.

132
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.430
How well this honest mirthbecomes their labour!

133
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.970
Hark you, friend, do you knowwhere ye are?

134
00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.130
Not well.

135
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:49.030
Why, I'll tell thee: thisis called Pentapolis,

136
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.400
and our king thegood Simonides.

137
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.130
The good Simonides,do you call him.

138
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.300
Ay, sir; and he deservesso to be called for his

139
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.930
peaceable reign and goodgovernment.

140
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.170
He is a happy king, sincehe gains from his subjects

141
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.100
the name of good by hisgovernment. How far is his

142
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.570
court distant from thisshore?

143
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:13.500
Marry, sir, halfa day's journey:

144
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.000
and I'll tell thee, hehath a fair daughter,

145
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.400
and to-morrow is her birth-day;and there be knights

146
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.370
and princes come from allparts of the world to just

147
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:24.830
and tourney for her love.

148
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.100
Were my fortunesequal to my desires,

149
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.400
I could wish to make one there.

150
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.800
O, sir, things must be asthey may; and what a man

151
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.530
may not get, he may lawfullydeal for--his wife's soul.

152
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.330
Help, master, help! here'sa fish hangs in the net,

153
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:50.000
like a poor man's right in thelaw; 'twill hardly come out.

154
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.030
Ha! bots on't, 'tiscome at last,

155
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.400
and 'tis turned toa rusty armour.

156
00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:05.370
An armour, friends! I prayyou, let me see it.

157
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.770
Thanks, fortune, yet, that,after all my crosses,

158
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.030
Thou givest me somewhat torepair myself;

159
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.470
And though it was mineown, part of my heritage,

160
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.870
Which my dead father didbequeath to me.

161
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.100
With this strict charge,even as he left his life,

162
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.500
'Keep it, my Pericles; ithath been a shield

163
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.170
Twixt me and death;'--andpointed to this brace;--

164
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.870
'For that it saved me, keepit; in like necessity--

165
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.570
The which the godsprotect thee from!--

166
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.430
may defend thee.'

167
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.970
It kept where I kept, I sodearly loved it;

168
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.000
Till the rough seas, thatspare not any man,

169
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.570
Took it in rage, thoughcalm'd have given't again:

170
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:52.500
I thank thee for't: myshipwreck now's no ill,

171
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.200
Since I have here myfather's gift in's will.

172
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.870
What mean you, sir?

173
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.600
To beg of you, kind friends,this coat of worth,

174
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.500
For it was sometime targetto a king;

175
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.570
I know it by this mark. Heloved me dearly,

176
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.000
And for his sake I wishthe having of it;

177
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.730
And that you'ld guide meto your sovereign's court,

178
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.200
Where with it I may appeara gentleman;

179
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.170
And if that ever my lowfortune's better,

180
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.000
I'll pay your bounties;till then rest your debtor.

181
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.470
Why, wilt thou tourney forthe lady?

182
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.300
I'll show the virtue Ihave borne in arms.

183
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.530
Why, do 'e take it, and thegods give thee good on't!

184
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:33.370
Ay, but hark you, my friend;'twas we that made up

185
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.300
this garment through therough seams of the waters:

186
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.470
there are certaincondolements, certain vails.

187
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.700
I hope, sir, if you thrive,you'll remember from

188
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.730
whence you had it.

189
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.030
Believe 't, I will.

190
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.830
By your furtherance I amclothed in steel;

191
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.300
And, spite of all therapture of the sea,

192
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.030
This jewel holds hisbuilding on my arm:

193
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.470
Unto thy value I willmount myself

194
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.430
Upon a courser, whosedelightful steps

195
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.270
Shall make the gazer joyto see him tread.

196
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.100
Only, my friend, I yet amunprovided

197
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.500
Of a pair of bases.

198
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.430
We'll sure provide: thoushalt have my best gown to

199
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.030
make thee a pair; and I'llbring thee to the court myself.

200
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.230
Then honour be but equalto my will,

201
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:18.630
This day I'll rise, orelse add ill to ill.

202
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.070
(♪ music)

203
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.570
Are the knights ready tobegin the triumph?

204
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.830
They are, my liege;

205
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.970
And stay your coming topresent themselves.

206
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.730
Return them, we are ready;and our daughter,

207
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.900
In honour of whose birththese triumphs are,

208
00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.100
Sits here, like beauty'schild, whom nature gat

209
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.870
For men to see, and seeingwonder at.

210
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.800
It pleaseth you, my royalfather, to express

211
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.430
My commendations great,whose merit's less.

212
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.130
It's fit it should be so;for princes are

213
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.470
A model which heaven makeslike to itself:

214
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.500
As jewels lose their gloryif neglected,

215
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.630
So princes their renownsif not respected.

216
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.170
'Tis now your honour,daughter, to entertain

217
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.100
The labour of each knightin his device.

218
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.200
Which, to preserve minehonour, I'll perform.

219
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.500
Who is the first that dothprefer himself?

220
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.830
A knight of Sparta, myrenowned father;

221
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.030
And the device he bearsupon his shield

222
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.530
Is a black Ethiopereaching at the sun

223
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.300
The word, 'Lux tua vitamihi.'

224
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.730
He loves you well thatholds his life of you.

225
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.370
Who is the second thatpresents himself?

226
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.730
A prince of Macedon, myroyal father;

227
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.670
And the device he bearsupon his shield

228
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.500
Is an arm'd knight that'sconquer'd by a lady;

229
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.470
The motto thus, in Spanish,

230
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:19.130
'Piu por dulzuraque por fuerza.'

231
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:27.630
Ah, May gentleness, not force,win me the day.

232
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.870
And what's the third?

233
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.530
The third of Antioch;

234
00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.270
And his device, a wreathof chivalry;

235
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.900
The word, 'Me pompaeprovexit apex.'

236
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.300
Desire to gain renoun hath setme on

237
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.870
This is the fourth.

238
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.830
A burning torch that'sturned upside down;

239
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.370
The word, 'Quod me alit,me extinguit.'

240
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.400
Which shows that beautyhath his power and will,

241
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.530
It can as well inflameas it can kill.

242
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.130
The fifth, an handenvironed with clouds,

243
00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.670
Holding out gold that's bythe touchstone tried;

244
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:19.470
The motto thus, 'Sicspectanda fides.'

245
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.200
Thus can you try unlastingfaithfulness.

246
00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.000
And what's the sixth and last,

247
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.270
the which the knight himself

248
00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:00.200
With such a gracefulcourtesy deliver'd?

249
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.370
He seems to be a stranger;but his present is

250
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:09.270
A wither'd branch, that'sonly green at top;

251
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:16.130
The motto, 'In hac spevivo.'

252
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.300
A pretty moral;

253
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.370
In this hope, I live.

254
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.400
From the dejected statewherein he is,

255
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.300
He hopes by you hisfortunes yet may flourish.

256
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.300
He had need mean betterthan his outward show

257
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.700
Can any way speak in hisjust commend;

258
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.670
For by his rusty outsidehe appears

259
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.700
To have practised more thewhipstock than the lance.

260
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.230
He well may be a stranger,for he comes

261
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.030
To an honour'd triumphstrangely furnished.

262
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.070
And on set purpose let hisarmour rust

263
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.700
Until this day, to scourit in the dust.

264
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.400
Opinion's but a fool, thatmakes us scan

265
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.930
The outward habit by theinward man.

266
00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.730
But stay, the knights arecoming: we will withdraw

267
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:58.830
Into the gallery.

268
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:10.370
(♪ music and the sound of a crowd)

269
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.370
(horses hooves and chantingcrowds)

270
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.470


271
00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.030
Knights,

272
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.270
To say you're welcome weresuperfluous.

273
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.730
To place upon the volumeof your deeds,

274
00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.230
As in a title-page, yourworth in arms,

275
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.930
Were more than you expect,or more than's fit,

276
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.870
Since every worth in showcommends itself.

277
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:57.470
Prepare for mirth, formirth becomes a feast:

278
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:04.430
You are princes and myguests.

279
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.300
But you, my knight andguest;

280
00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.830
To whom this wreath ofvictory I give,

281
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.400
And crown you king of thisday's happiness.

282
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.370
'Tis more by fortune,lady, than by merit.

283
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.570
Call it by what you will,the day is yours;

284
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.030
And here, I hope, is nonethat envies it.

285
00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.300
In framing an artist, arthath thus decreed,

286
00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.500
To make some good, butothers to exceed;

287
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.200
And you are herlabour'd scholar.

288
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.530
Come, queen o' the feast,--

289
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:39.230
For, daughter, so you are,--

290
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.630
here take your place:

291
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.100
Marshal the rest, as theydeserve their grace.

292
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.900
We are honour'd much bygood Simonides.

293
00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.470
Your presence glads ourdays: honour we love;

294
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.900
For who hates honour hatesthe gods above.

295
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.370
Sir, yonder is your place.

296
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.830
Some other is more fit.

297
00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.530
Contend not, sir; for weare gentlemen

298
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.330
That neither in our heartsnor outward eyes

299
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.330
Envy the great nor do thelow despise.

300
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:28.670
You are right courteousknights.

301
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.500
Sit, sir, sit.

302
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.730
By Jove, I wonder, that isking of thoughts,

303
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.330
These cates resist me, hebut thought upon.

304
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.430
By Juno, that is queen ofmarriage,

305
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.170
All viands that I eat doseem unsavoury.

306
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:09.170
Wishing him my meat. Sure,he's a gallant gentleman.

307
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.830
He's but a countrygentleman;

308
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.630
Has done no more thanother knights have done;

309
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.430
Has broken a staff or so;so let it pass.

310
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.270
To me he seems likediamond to glass.

311
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.930
Yon king's to me like tomy father's picture,

312
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:28.570
Which tells me in thatglory once he was;

313
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.370
Had princes sit, likestars, about his throne,

314
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.070
And he the sun, for themto reverence;

315
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.400
None that beheld him, but,like lesser lights,

316
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.470
Did vail their crowns tohis supremacy:

317
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.870
Where now his son's like aglow-worm in the night,

318
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.070
The which hath fire indarkness, none in light:

319
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.900
Whereby I see that Time'sthe king of men,

320
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.700
He's both their parent,and he is their grave,

321
00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.700
And gives them what hewill, not what they crave.

322
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.400
What, are you merry,knights?

323
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.730
Who can be other in thisroyal presence?

324
00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.830
Here, with a cup that'sstored unto the brim,--

325
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:20.230
As you do love, fill toyour mistress' lips,--

326
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.300
We drink this health toyou.

327
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.030
We thank your grace.

328
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.000
Yet pause awhile:

329
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.400
Yon knight doth sit toomelancholy,

330
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.670
As if the entertainment inour court

331
00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:48.070
Had not a show mightcountervail his worth.

332
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.670
Note it not you, Thaisa?

333
00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:52.470
What is't to me, my father?

334
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:53.470
O, attend, my daughter:

335
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.030
Princes in this shouldlive like gods above,

336
00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.400
Who freely give to everyone that comes

337
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.330
To honour them:

338
00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.700
Therefore to make hisentertain more sweet,

339
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.300
Here, say we drink thisstanding-bowl of wine to him.

340
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:16.330
Alas, my father, it befitsnot me

341
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.870
Unto a stranger knight tobe so bold:

342
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.570
He may my proffer take foran offence,

343
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:25.300
Since men take women'sgifts for impudence.

344
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.270
How!

345
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.970
Do as I bid you, or you'llmove me else.

346
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.370
Now, by the gods, he couldnot please me better.

347
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:38.400
And furthermore tell him,we desire to know

348
00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.930
Of whence he is, his nameand parentage.

349
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.700
The king my father, sir,has drunk to you.

350
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.530
I thank him.

351
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:01.400
Wishing it so much bloodunto your life.

352
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.330
I thank both him and you,and pledge him freely.

353
00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.600
And further he desires toknow of you,

354
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.630
Of whence you are, yourname and parentage.

355
00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.470
A gentleman of Tyre; myname, Pericles;

356
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:19.070
My education been in artsand arms;

357
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:20.400
Who, looking foradventures in the world,

358
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.070
Was by the rough seas reftof ships and men,

359
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.700
And after shipwreck drivenupon this shore.

360
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.930
He thanks your grace;names himself Pericles,

361
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:49.930
A gentleman of Tyre,

362
00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.500
Who only by misfortune ofthe seas

363
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.100
Bereft of ships and men,cast on this shore.

364
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.570
Now, by the gods, I pityhis misfortune,

365
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.030
And will awake him fromhis melancholy.

366
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.430
Come, gentlemen, we sittoo long on trifles,

367
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.470
And waste the time, whichlooks for other revels.

368
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:12.400
(laughing)

369
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.370
Even in your armours, asyou are address'd,

370
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.900
Will very well become asoldier's dance.

371
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.230
I will not have excuse,with saying this

372
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.270
Loud music is too harshfor ladies' heads,

373
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.070
Since they love men inarms as well as beds.

374
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:42.370
(♪ music)

375
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.670
So, this was well ask'd,'twasso well perform'd.

376
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.830
Come, sir;

377
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.700
Here is a lady that wantsbreathing too:

378
00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.170
And I have heard, youknights of Tyre

379
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.530
Are excellent in makingladies trip;

380
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.400
And that their measuresare as excellent.

381
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.200
In those that practisethem they are, my lord.

382
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.630
O, that's as much as youwould be denied

383
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:35.000
Of your fair courtesy.

384
00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.600
Unclasp, unclasp:

385
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:49.870
Thanks, gentlemen, to all;all have done well.

386
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.700
But you the best.Pages and lights,

387
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.700
To conduct these knights untotheir several lodgings!

388
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.670
Yours, sir, We have givenorder to be next our own.

389
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.370
I am at your grace'spleasure.

390
00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.630
Princes, it is too late totalk of love;

391
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.300
And that's the mark I knowyou level at:

392
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.730
Therefore each one betakehim to his rest;

393
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:14.330
To-morrow all for speedingdo their best.

394
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.770
No, Escanes, know this ofme,

395
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:52.130
Antiochus from incestlived not free:

396
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.270
For which, the most highgods not minding longer

397
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.200
To withhold the vengeancethat they had in store,

398
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.630
Due to this heinouscapital offence,

399
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.930
Even in the height andpride of all his glory,

400
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.330
When he was seated in achariot

401
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.170
Of an inestimable value,and his daughter with him,

402
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.930
A fire from heaven cameand shrivell'd up

403
00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:15.230
Their bodies, even toloathing; for they so stunk,

404
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:18.430
That all those eyes adoredthem ere their fall

405
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.800
Scorn now their handshould give them burial.

406
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.270
'Twas very strange.

407
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:26.400
And yet but justice;

408
00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.900
for though this king were great,his greatness was no guard

409
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:36.230
To bar heaven's shaft, butsin had his reward.

410
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.000
'Tis very true.

411
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.530
See, not a man in privateconference

412
00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.570
Or council has respectwith him but he.

413
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.800
It shall no longer grievewithout reproof.

414
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.400
And cursed be he that willnot second it.

415
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.270
Follow me, then.

416
00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.870
Lord Helicane, a word.

417
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:06.030
With me? and welcome:happy day, my lords.

418
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.700
Know that our griefs arerisen to the top,

419
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.930
And now at length theyoverflow their banks.

420
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:16.130
Your griefs! for what? wrongnot your prince you love.

421
00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.070
Wrong not yourself, then,noble Helicane;

422
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.200
But if the prince do live,let us salute him,

423
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.570
Or know what ground's madehappy by his breath.

424
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:29.500
If in the world he live,we'll seek him out;

425
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.900
If in his grave he rest,we'll find him there;

426
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.270
And be resolved he livesto govern us,

427
00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.970
Or dead, give's cause tomourn his funeral,

428
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:41.500
And leave us to our freeelection.

429
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.030
Whose death indeed's thestrongest in our censure:

430
00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.700
And knowing this kingdomis without a head,--

431
00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.330
Like goodly buildings leftwithout a roof

432
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.900
Soon fall to ruin,--yournoble self,

433
00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.030
That best know how to ruleand how to reign,

434
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.500
We thus submit unto,--oursovereign.

435
00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:01.370
Live, noble Helicane!

436
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:04.630
By honour's cause,forbear your suffrages:

437
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:08.570
If that you love PrincePericles, forbear.

438
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.270
Take I your wish, I leapinto the seas,

439
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.230
Where's hourly trouble fora minute's ease.

440
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.630
A twelvemonth longer, letme entreat you

441
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.230
Further to bear the absence ofyour king:

442
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.630
If in which time expired,he not return,

443
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.970
I shall with aged patiencebear your yoke.

444
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:38.570
But if I cannot win you tothis love,

445
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:44.630
Go search like nobles,like noble subjects,

446
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:48.730
And in your search spendyour adventurous worth;

447
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.970
Whom if you find, and winunto return,

448
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.330
You shall like diamondssit about his crown.

449
00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.030
To wisdom he's a fool thatwill not yield;

450
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.700
And since Lord Helicaneenjoineth us,

451
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.030
We with our travels willendeavour it.

452
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:12.330
Then you love us, we you,and we'll clasp hands:

453
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:21.730
When peers thus knit, akingdom ever stands.

454
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.800
Good morrow to the goodSimonides.

455
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.000
Knights, from my daughterthis I let you know,

456
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.300
That for this twelvemonthshe'll not undertake

457
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.900
A married life.

458
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.600
Her reason to herself isonly known,

459
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.730
Which from her by nomeans can I get.

460
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.270
May we not get access toher, my lord?

461
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:52.900
'Faith, by no means; shehas so strictly tied

462
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:58.330
Her to her chamber, that'tis impossible.

463
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.670
One twelve moons moreshe'll wear Diana's livery;

464
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:02.800
This by the eye of Cynthiahath she vow'd

465
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.100
And on her virgin honourwill not break it.

466
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:19.870
Loath to bid farewell, wetake our leaves.

467
00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:24.000
So, They are well dispatch'd;now to my daughter's letter:

468
00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:32.100
She tells me here, she'dwed the stranger knight,

469
00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.370
Or never more to view norday nor light.

470
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.930
'Tis well, mistress; yourchoice agrees with mine;

471
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:43.070
I like that well: nay, howabsolute she's in't,

472
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:48.200
Not minding whether Idislike or no!

473
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.000
Well, I do commend herchoice;

474
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.630
And will no longer have itbe delay'd.

475
00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.430
Soft! here he comes: Imust dissemble it.

476
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.370
All fortune to the goodSimonides!

477
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.800
To you as much, sir! I ambeholding to you

478
00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.600
For your sweet musicthis last night:

479
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.600
I do protest my earswere never better fed

480
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.470
With such delightfulpleasing harmony.

481
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:15.970
It is your grace'spleasure to commend;

482
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:17.130
Not my desert.

483
00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:18.830
Sir, you are music'smaster.

484
00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.130
The worst of all herscholars, my good lord.

485
00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:22.870
Let me ask you one thing:

486
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:26.100
What do you think of mydaughter, sir?

487
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.030
A most virtuous princess.

488
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:30.230
And she is fair too, isshe not?

489
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.100
As a fair day in summer,wondrous fair.

490
00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.600
Sir, my daughter thinksvery well of you;

491
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.330
Ay, so well, that you mustbe her master,

492
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:40.200
And she will be your scholar:therefore look to it.

493
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.330
I am unworthy for herschoolmaster.

494
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:50.670
She thinks not so; perusethis writing else.

495
00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.800
What's here?

496
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.230
A letter, that she lovesthe knight of Tyre!

497
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.730
'Tis the king's subtletyto have my life.

498
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.530
O, seek not to entrap me,gracious lord,

499
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.430
A stranger and distressedgentleman,

500
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.800
That never aim'd so highto love your daughter,

501
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.470
But bent all offices tohonour her.

502
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.130
Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter,and thou art a villain.

503
00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:23.400
By the gods, I have not:

504
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.900
Never did thought of minelevy offence;

505
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.800
Nor never did my actionsyet commence

506
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.630
A deed might gain her loveor your displeasure.

507
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:31.930
Traitor, thou liest.

508
00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:32.830
Traitor!

509
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:33.770
Ay, traitor.

510
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.670
Even in his throat--unlessit be the king--

511
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.170
That calls me traitor, Ireturn the lie.

512
00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.600
Now, by the gods, I doapplaud his courage.

513
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.470
My actions are as noble asmy thoughts,

514
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.100
That never relish'd of abase descent.

515
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.000
I came unto your court forhonour's cause,

516
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.230
And not to be a rebel toher state;

517
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.730
And he that otherwiseaccounts of me,

518
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:57.970
This sword shall provehe's honour's enemy.

519
00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.670
No?

520
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:03.400
Here comes my daughter,she can witness it.

521
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.630
Then, as you are asvirtuous as fair,

522
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.600
Resolve your angry father,if my tongue

523
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.600
Did ere solicit, or myhand subscribe

524
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.700
To any syllable that madelove to you.

525
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.500
Why, sir, say if you had,

526
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.770
Who takes offence at thatwould make me glad?

527
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.130
Yea, mistress, are you soperemptory?

I'll tame you; I'll bringyou in subjection.

Will you, not having myconsent,

Bestow your love and youraffections

532
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:35.100
Upon a stranger?

533
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.700
who, for aught I know,

534
00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.030
May be, nor can I thinkthe contrary,

535
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.700
As great in blood as Imyself.--

536
00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.330
Therefore hear you,mistress; either frame

537
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:48.900
Your will to mine,--andyou, sir, hear you,

538

Either be ruled by me, orI will make you--

539
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:55.000
Man and wife:

540
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.600
Nay, come, your hands andlips must seal it too:

541
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.200
And being join'd, I'llthus your hopes destroy;

542
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:06.030
And for a furthergrief,--God give you joy!--

Even as my life, or bloodthat fosters it.
