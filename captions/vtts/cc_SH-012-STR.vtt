00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:11.600


2
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.400
Boatswain!

3
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.830
Here, master!

4
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.900
What cheer?

5
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.730
Good, speak to the mariners:

6
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.370
fall to't, yarely, or we run ourselves aground:

7
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.770
bestir, bestir!

8
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530
Heigh, my hearts!

9
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.630
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!

10
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.530
Yare, yare!

11
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.600
Take in the topsail.

12
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.730
Tend to the master's whistle.

13
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.400
Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!

14
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.600
Good boatswain, have care.

15
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.870
Where's the master?

16
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.000
Play the men.

17
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.800
I pray now, keep below!

18
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.870
Where is the master, boatswain?

19
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.400
Do you not hear him?

20
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.730
You mar our labour: keep to your cabins:

21
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.900
you do assist the storm.

22
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.500
Nay, good, be patient.

23
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.670
When the sea is.

24
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.770
Hence!

25
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.900
What cares these roarers for the name of king?

26
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.330
To cabin: silence!

27
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.470
Trouble us not.

28
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.430
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

29
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.270
None that I more love than myself.

30
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.470
You are a counsellor;

31
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.600
if you can command these elements to silence,

32
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.200
and work the peace of the present,

33
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.430
we will not hand a rope more; use your authority:

34
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.730
if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long,

35
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.500
and make yourself ready in your cabin

36
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.470
for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.

37
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.900
Cheerly, good hearts!

38
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.800
Out of our way, I say!

39
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.070
I have great comfort from this fellow:

40
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.700
methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him;

41
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.900
his complexion is perfect gallows.

42
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.470
Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:

43
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.770
make the rope of his destiny our cable,

44
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.230
for our own doth little advantage.

45
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.000
If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

46
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.530
Down with the topmast!

47
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.630
Yare!

48
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.170
Lower, lower!

49
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.770
Bring her to try with main-course.

50
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.070
A plague upon this howling!

51
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.600
They are louder than the weather or our office.

52
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.470
Yet again!

53
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.900
What do you here?

54
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.370
Shall we give o'er and drown?

55
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.470
Have you a mind to sink?

56
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.570
A pox o' your throat,

57
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.770
you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!

58
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.870
Work you then.

59
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.970
Hang, cur!

60
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.000
Hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!

61
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.130
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art!

62
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.600
I'll warrant him for drowning;

63
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.100
though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell

64
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.300
and as leaky as an unstanched wench.

65
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.770
Lay her a-hold, a-hold!

66
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.630
Set her two courses off to sea again;

67
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.870
lay her off!

68
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.370
To prayers, to prayers!

69
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.730
What, must our mouths be cold?

70
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.270
The king and prince at prayers!

71
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.730
Let's assist them, For our case is as theirs.

72
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.130
I'm out of patience.

73
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.000
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:

74
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.530
This wide-chapp'd rascal-- would thou mightst lie drowning

75
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.170
The washing of ten tides!

76
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.700
He'll be hang'd yet,

77
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.030
Though every drop of water swear against it

78
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.770
And gape at widest to glut him.

79
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.570
Let's all sink with the king!

80
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.700
Let's take leave of him.

81
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.970
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea

82
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.300
for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze,

83
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.470
any thing.

84
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.230
The wills above be done.

85
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.770
But I would fain die a dry death.

86
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.070
If by your art, my dearest father, you have

87
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.630
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.

88
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.830
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,

89
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.130
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,

90
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.230
Dashes the fire out.

91
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.700
O, I have suffered

92
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.500
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,

93
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.830
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,

94
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.070
Dash'd all to pieces.

95
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.430
O, the cry did knock

96
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.000
Against my very heart.

97
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.130
Poor souls, they perish'd.

98
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.830
Had I been any god of power, I would

99
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.700
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere

100
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.770
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and

101
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.530
The fraughting souls within her.

102
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.970
Be collected:

103
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.130
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart

104
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.230
There's no harm done.

105
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.530
O, woe the day.

106
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.800
No harm.

107
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.370
I have done nothing but in care of thee,

108
00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.300
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who

109
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.000
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing

110
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.070
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better

111
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.870
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,

112
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.800
And thy no greater father.

113
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.900
More to know

114
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.870
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

115
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.800
'Tis time I should inform thee farther.

116
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.770
Lend thy hand,

117
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.030
And pluck my magic garment from me.

118
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:38.030
So: Lie there, my art.

119
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.930
Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.

120
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.800
The direful spectacle of the wreck, that touch'd

121
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.770
The very virtue of compassion in thee,

122
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.570
I have with such provision in mine art

123
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.300
So safely ordered that there is no soul--

124
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.070
No, not so much perdition as an hair

125
00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.370
Betid to any creature in the vessel

126
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.930
That thou heard'st cry, that thou saw'st sink.

127
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.900
Sit down;

128
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.370
For thou must now know farther.

129
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.430
You have often

130
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.930
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd

131
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.070
And left me to a bootless inquisition,

132
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.700
Concluding "Stay: not yet."

133
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.330
The hour's now come;

134
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.670
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;

135
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.400
Obey and be attentive.

136
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.670
Canst thou remember

137
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.670
A time before we came unto this cell?

138
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.900
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not

139
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.000
Out three years old.

140
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.500
Certainly, sir, I can.

141
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.130
By what?

142
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.930
By any other house or person?

143
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.770
Of any thing the image tell me that

144
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.530
Hath kept with thy remembrance.

145
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.000
'Tis far off

146
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.300
And rather like a dream than an assurance

147
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.070
That my remembrance warrants.

148
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.630
Had I not

149
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.600
Four or five women once that tended me?

150
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.570
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda.

151
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.770
But how is it

152
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.300
That this lives in thy mind?

153
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.430
What seest thou else

154
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.770
In the dark backward and abysm of time?

155
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.200
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,

156
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.100
How thou camest here thou mayst.

157
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:07.970
But that I do not.

158
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:17.130
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,

159
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.430
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and

160
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.830
A prince of power.

161
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.100
Sir, are not you my father?

162
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.100
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and

163
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.100
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father

164
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.800
Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir

165
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.470
And princess no worse issued.

166
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.730
O the heavens.

167
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:42.070
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?

168
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.170
Or blessed was't that we did?

169
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.670
Both, both, my girl:

170
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.430
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,

171
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.930
But blessedly holp hither.

172
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.270
O, my heart bleeds

173
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.400
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,

174
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.800
Which is from my remembrance.

175
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.300
Please you, farther.

176
00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:09.900
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--

177
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.130
I pray thee, mark me-- that a brother should

178
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.830
Be so perfidious.

179
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.430
He whom next thyself

180
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.500
Of all the world I loved and to him put

181
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.330
The manage of my state; which at that time

182
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.330
Through all the signories it was the first

183
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:26.130
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed

184
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.770
In dignity, and for the liberal arts

185
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.770
Without a parallel; those being all my study,

186
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.300
The government I cast upon my brother

187
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.600
And to my state grew stranger, being transported

188
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.330
And rapt in secret studies.

189
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.530
Thy false uncle-- Dost thou attend me?

190
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:47.670
Sir, most heedfully.

191
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.970
Being once perfected how to grant suits,

192
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.170
How to deny them, who to advance, who

193
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.730
To trash for over-topping, new created

194
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.500
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,

195
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.170
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key

196
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.030
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state

197
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.870
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was

198
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.430
The ivy that had hid my princely trunk,

199
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.330
And suck'd my verdure out on't.

200
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.630
Thou attend'st not.

201
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.770
O, good sir, I do.

202
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.370
I pray thee, mark me.

203
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.730
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated

204
00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.600
To closeness and the bettering of my mind

205
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.870
in my false brother

206
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.130
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,

207
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.200
Like a good parent, did beget of him

208
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.100
A falsehood in its contrary as great

209
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.070
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,

210
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.270
A confidence sans bound.

211
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.300
He being thus lorded,

212
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.130
Not only with what my revenue yielded,

213
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.800
But what my power might else exact,

214
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.030
he did believe

215
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.470
He was indeed the duke; hence his ambition growing--

216
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.600
Dost thou hear?

217
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.370
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

218
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.430
To have no screen between this part he play'd

219
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.470
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan.

220
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.930
Me, poor man, my library

221
00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.330
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties

222
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.270
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--

223
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.170
So dry he was for sway-- wi' the King of Naples

224
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.300
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,

225
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.700
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend

226
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:17.700
The dukedom yet unbow'd-- alas, poor Milan--

227
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.470
To most ignoble stooping.

228
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:21.830
O the heavens.

229
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.870
Mark his condition and the event; and then tell me

230
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.930
If this might be a brother.

231
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.030
I should sin

232
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.300
To think but nobly of my grandmother:

233
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.670
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

234
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.600
Now the condition.

235
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.270
This King of Naples, being an enemy

236
00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:40.300
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;

237
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.530
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises

238
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.670
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,

239
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.870
Should presently extirpate me and mine

240
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.900
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan

241
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.900
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,

242
00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.430
A treacherous army levied, one midnight

243
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.530
Fated for the purpose did Antonio open

244
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.900
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,

245
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.570
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence

246
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:08.970
Me and thy crying self.

247
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.770
Alack, for pity.

248
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.300
I, not remembering how I cried out then,

249
00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.400
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint

250
00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.900
That wrings mine eyes to't.

251
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.070
Hear a little further

252
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.370
And then I'll bring thee to this present business

253
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.600
That now's upon's; without the which this story

254
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.730
Were most impertinent.

255
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.930
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?

256
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.500
Well demanded, wench: My tale provokes that question.

257
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.630
Dear, they durst not,

258
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.930
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set

259
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.530
A mark so bloody on the business, but

260
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.070
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.

261
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.770
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,

262
00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:49.930
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared

263
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:53.430
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,

264
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.670
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats

265
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:01.000
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,

266
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.200
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh

267
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.070
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,

268
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.270
Did us but loving wrong.

269
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.130
Alas, what trouble

270
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.500
Was I then to you.

271
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.400
O, a cherubim

272
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.070
Thou wast that did preserve me.

273
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.400
Thou didst smile.

274
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.930
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,

275
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.270
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,

276
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.000
Under my burden groan'd; that raised in me

277
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.600
An undergoing stomach, to bear up

278
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.900
Against what should ensue.

279
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.570
How came we ashore?

280
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.170
By Providence divine.

281
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.100
Some food we had and some fresh water that

282
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.070
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,

283
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.830
Out of his charity who, being then appointed

284
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.170
Master of this design, did give us, with

285
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.770
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,

286
00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.700
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,

287
00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:05.330
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me

288
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.930
From mine own library with volumes that I prize

289
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.970
above my dukedom.

290
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.170
Would I might

291
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.930
But ever see that man.

292
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.030
Now I arise:

293
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:26.300
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.

294
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.230
Here in this island we arrived; and here

295
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.430
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit

296
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.570
Than other princesses can that have more time

297
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.430
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

298
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:43.400
Heavens thank you for't.

299
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.170
And now, I pray you, sir,

300
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.470
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason

301
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.200
For raising this sea-storm?

302
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.170
Know thus far forth.

303
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:57.870
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,

304
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.830
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies

305
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.900
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience

306
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.470
I find my zenith doth depend upon

307
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.670
A most auspicious star, whose influence

308
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.670
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes

309
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.530
Will ever after droop.

310
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.130
Here cease more questions:

311
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.130
Thou art inclined to sleep.

312
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.100
'Tis a good dullness.

313
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.330
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.

314
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.770
Come away, servant, come.

315
00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:48.970
I am ready now.

316
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:54.130
Approach, my Ariel, come.

317
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.200
All hail, great master!

318
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.370
Grave sir, hail!

319
00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.500
I come

320
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.030
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,

321
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.430
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride

322
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:08.070
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task

323
00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.900
Ariel and all his quality.

324
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.170
Hast thou, spirit,

325
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.230
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

326
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.770
To every article.

327
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.730
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,

328
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.700
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,

329
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.570
I flamed amazement: sometime I'd divide,

330
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.330
And burn in many places; the topmast,

331
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.070
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,

332
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.370
Then meet and join.

333
00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:31.570
Jove's lightning, the precursors

334
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.100
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary

335
00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.630
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks

336
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.300
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune

337
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.630
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,

338
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.700
Yea, his dread trident shake.

339
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.400
My brave spirit.

340
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.970
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil

341
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.330
Would not infect his reason?

342
00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:52.430
Not a soul

343
00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.170
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd

344
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.530
Some tricks of desperation.

345
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.830
All but mariners

346
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.300
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,

347
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:06.470
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,

348
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.600
With hair up-staring-- then like reeds, not hair--

349
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.630
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, "Hell is empty

350
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.970
And all the devils are here."

351
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.270
Why that's my spirit!

352
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.000
But was not this nigh shore?

353
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.170
Close by, my master.

354
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:22.870
But are they, Ariel, safe?

355
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:24.030
Not a hair perish'd;

356
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.300
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,

357
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.030
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,

358
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.430
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.

359
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.830
The king's son have I landed by himself;

360
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.300
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs

361
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.100
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,

362
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.570
His arms in this sad knot.

363
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.770
Of the king's ship

364
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.630
The mariners say how thou hast disposed

365
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.370
And all the rest o' the fleet.

366
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.570
Safely in harbour

367
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.770
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once

368
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.800
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew

369
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.200
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:

370
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.200
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;

371
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.600
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,

372
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.570
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet

373
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.300
Which I dispersed, they have all met again

374
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.670
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,

375
00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.030
Bound sadly home for Naples,

376
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.400
Supposing they saw the king's ship wreck'd

377
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.430
And his great person perish.

378
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:22.670
Ariel, thy charge

379
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:24.930
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.

380
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.300
What is the time o' the day?

381
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.900
Past the mid season.

382
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.230
At least two glasses.

383
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.870
The time 'twixt six and now

384
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.200
Must by us both be spent most preciously.

385
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.030
Is there more toil?

386
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.430
Since thou dost give me pains,

387
00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:38.570
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,

388
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.970
Which is not yet perform'd me.

389
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:41.070
How now? Moody?

390
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:42.430
What is't thou canst demand?

391
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.870
My liberty.

392
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.300
Before the time be out?

393
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.430
No more!

394
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.530
I prithee,

395
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.500
Remember I have done thee worthy service;

396
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.830
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served

397
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.270
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise

398
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.100
To bate me a full year.

399
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.430
Dost thou forget

400
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.970
From what a torment I did free thee?

401
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.270
No.

402
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.900
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze

403
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.100
Of the salt deep,

404
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.970
To run upon the sharp winds of the north,

405
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.900
To do me business in the veins o' the earth

406
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.200
When it is baked with frost.

407
00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.300
I do not, sir.

408
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:18.200
Thou liest, malignant thing.

409
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.630
Hast thou forgot

410
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.870
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy

411
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.030
Was grown into a hoop?

412
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.130
Hast thou forgot her?

413
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.230
No.

414
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.070
Thou hast.

415
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.970
Where was she born?

416
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:41.130
Speak; tell me.

417
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.130
Sir, in Argier.

418
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.770
O, was she so?

419
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:46.870
I must

420
00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.900
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,

421
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.200
Which thou forget'st.

422
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.800
This damn'd witch Sycorax,

423
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.070
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible

424
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.830
To enter human hearing, from Argier,

425
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.130
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did

426
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.500
They would not take her life.

427
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.600
Is not this true?

428
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.900
Ay, sir.

429
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.670
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child

430
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:08.630
And here was left by the sailors.

431
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.670
Thou, my slave,

432
00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:17.900
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;

433
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.170
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate

434
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.070
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,

435
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.400
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,

436
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.700
By help of her more potent ministers

437
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.830
And in a most unmitigable rage,

438
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:36.200
Into a cloven pine; within which rift

439
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.300
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain

440
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.600
A dozen years; within which space she died

441
00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.370
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans

442
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.800
As fast as mill-wheels strike.

443
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.000
Then was this island--

444
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.330
Save for the son that she did litter here,

445
00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.530
A freckled whelp hag-born-- not honour'd with

446
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:57.630
A human shape.

447
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.730
Yes, Caliban her son.

448
00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.630
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban

449
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.100
Whom now I keep in service.

450
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.830
Thou best know'st

451
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.800
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans

452
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.130
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts

453
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.930
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment

454
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:18.670
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax

455
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:22.230
Could not again undo: it was mine art,

456
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.370
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape

457
00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.430
The pine and let thee out.

458
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.630
I thank thee, master.

459
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:38.600
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak

460
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:42.530
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till

461
00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.300
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

462
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:51.100
Pardon, master; I will be correspondent to command

463
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.630
And do my spiriting gently.

464
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:04.170
Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee.

465
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.530
That's my noble master!

466
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.930
What shall I do?

467
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.030
Say what; what shall I do?

468
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:16.930
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject

469
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.700
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible

470
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:21.430
To every eyeball else.

471
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.730
Go take this shape

472
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:25.170
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence.

473
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:36.530
Awake, dear heart, awake.

474
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.570
Thou hast slept well; Awake.

475
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.600
The strangeness of your story has put

476
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.070
Heaviness in me.

477
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:47.400
Shake it off.

478
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.600
Come on;

479
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.930
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never

480
00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.200
Yields us kind answer.

481
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.230
'Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on.

482
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:57.330
But, as 'tis,

483
00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.270
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,

484
00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:01.230
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices

485
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.330
That profit us.

486
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.430
What, ho!

487
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.600
Slave. Caliban.

488
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.730
Thou earth, thou.

489
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:08.030
Speak!

490
00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.430
There's wood enough within!

491
00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.700
Come forth, I say!

492
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.370
There's other business for thee.

493
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.330
Come, thou tortoise!

494
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:17.830
When?

495
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:18.930
Fine apparition.

496
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:20.030
My quaint Ariel,

497
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.370
Hark in thine ear.

498
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.800
My lord it shall be done.

499
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.170
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself

500
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.300
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

501
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.630
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd

502
00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:40.670
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen

503
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.030
Drop on you both!

504
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.930
A south-west blow on ye

505
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.270
And blister you all o'er!

506
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:48.870
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,

507
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.530
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins

508
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:54.770
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,

509
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.070
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd

510
00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.530
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging

511
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:02.100
Than bees that made 'em.

512
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.730
I must eat my dinner!

513
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.770
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,

514
00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.400
Which thou takest from me.

515
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.100
When thou camest first,

516
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.930
Thou strokedst me and made much of me, wouldst give me

517
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:19.670
Water with berries in't, and teach me how

518
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:21.700
To name the bigger light, and how the less,

519
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:26.300
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee

520
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.700
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,

521
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.200
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:

522
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.670
Cursed be I that did so!

523
00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:37.930
All the charms

524
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.570
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!

525
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.970
For I am all the subjects that you have,

526
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.000
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me

527
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.700
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me

528
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.100
The rest o' the island.

529
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.270
Thou most lying slave,

530
00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.630
Whom stripes may move, not kindness.

531
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:00.130
I have used thee,

532
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:03.830
Filth as thou art, with human care, lodged thee

533
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.070
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate

534
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.430
The honour of my child.

535
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.700
O ho, O ho!

536
00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.570
Would't had been done!

537
00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:16.930
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else

538
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.900
This isle with Calibans.

539
00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.200
Abhorred slave,

540
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.300
Which any print of goodness will not take,

541
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.670
Being capable of all ill.

542
00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.930
I pitied thee,

543
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.800
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour

544
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.030
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,

545
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.270
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like

546
00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.730
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes

547
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:40.930
With words which made them known.

548
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.570
But thy vile race,

549
00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.600
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures

550
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.800
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou

551
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.570
Deservedly confined into this rock,

552
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.400
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

553
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.870
You taught me language; and my profit on't

554
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.200
Is, I know how to curse.

555
00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.930
The red plague rid you

556
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.570
For learning me your language!

557
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.170
Hag-seed, hence!

558
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:06.930
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,

559
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.270
To answer other business.

560
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.170
Shrug'st thou, malice?

561
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:17.570
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly

562
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:23.500
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,

563
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:28.170
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar

564
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.270
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

565
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.430
No, pray thee!

566
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:39.100
I must obey: his art is of such power,

567
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.430
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,

568
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:42.830
and make a vassal of him.

569
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.900
So, slave; hence!

570
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.630
Come unto these yellow sands,

571
00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.270
And then take hands:

572
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:05.200
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd

573
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.130
The wild waves whist,

574
00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:14.100
Foot it featly here and there;

575
00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.230
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.

576
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.430
Hark, hark.

577
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:26.330
The watch-dogs bark.

578
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.330
Hark, hark, hark.

579
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:30.930
I hear

580
00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:35.630
The strain of strutting chanticleer

581
00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:40.570
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow!

582
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:46.570
Where should this music be?

583
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.400
I' the air or the earth?

584
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:54.300
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon

585
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.800
Some god o' the island.

586
00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:00.670
Sitting on a bank,

587
00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.870
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,

588
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:07.070
This music crept by me upon the waters,

589
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.730
Allaying both their fury and my passion

590
00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:14.030
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,

591
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.200
Or it hath drawn me rather.

592
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.500
But 'tis gone.

593
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.170
No, it begins again.

594
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:31.530
Full fathom five thy father lies;

595
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:37.970
Of his bones are coral made;

596
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:43.930
Those are pearls that were his eyes:

597
00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:49.930
Nothing of him that doth fade

598
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.870
But doth suffer a sea-change

599
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:59.100
Into something rich and strange.

600
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:04.000
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.

601
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.430
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

602
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:10.830
Hark.

603
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.230
Now I hear them.

604
00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:21.730
Ding-dong, bell.

605
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:27.400
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.

606
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.370
This is no mortal business, nor no sound

607
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.030
That the earth owes.

608
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.170
I hear it now above me.

609
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.130
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance

610
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.170
And say what thou seest yond.

611
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.070
What is it?

612
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:45.030
A spirit?

613
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.330
Lord, how it looks about!

614
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:49.070
Believe me, sir,

615
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.370
It carries a brave form.

616
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.370
But 'tis a spirit.

617
00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:57.730
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses

618
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.200
As we have, such.

619
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.570
This gallant that thou seest

620
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.470
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd

621
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:07.970
With grief that's beauty's canker,

622
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.170
thou mightst call him

623
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.670
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows

624
00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:13.430
And strays about to find them.

625
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.630
I might call him

626
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.630
A thing divine, for nothing natural

627
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:19.770
I ever saw so noble.

628
00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:20.870
It goes on, I see,

629
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:22.070
As my soul prompts it.

630
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.200
Spirit, fine spirit.

631
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.300
I'll free thee

632
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.630
Within two days for this.

633
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.030
Most sure, the goddess

634
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.700
On whom these airs attend.

635
00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.130
Vouchsafe my prayer

636
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.430
May know if you remain upon this island;

637
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:35.500
And that you will some good instruction give

638
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.770
How I may bear me here: my prime request,

639
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:40.170
Which I do last pronounce, is,

640
00:30:40.170 --> 00:30:42.530
O you wonder.

641
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:43.930
If you be maid or no?

642
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.630
No wonder, sir;

643
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:46.900
But certainly a maid.

644
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.100
My language. Heavens.

645
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.530
I am the best of them that speak this speech,

646
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:53.370
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

647
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:55.270
How? The best?

648
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:58.300
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

649
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.500
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders

650
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.470
To hear thee speak of Naples.

651
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.000
He does hear me;

652
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.330
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,

653
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:09.630
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld

654
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.400
The king my father wreck'd.

655
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.730
Alack, for mercy.

656
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.930
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan

657
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.770
And his brave son being twain.

658
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.930
The Duke of Milan

659
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.230
And his more braver daughter could control thee,

660
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.630
If now 'twere fit to do't.

661
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.600
At the first sight

662
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.570
They have changed eyes.

663
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.500
Delicate Ariel, I'll set thee free for this.

664
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.000
A word, good sir;

665
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.800
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

666
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.870
Why speaks my father so ungently?

667
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.570
This is the third man that e'er I saw, the first

668
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.670
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father

669
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.130
To be inclined my way.

670
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.670
O, if a virgin,

671
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.470
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you

672
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:51.670
The queen of Naples.

673
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:52.770
Soft, sir.

674
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:54.570
One word more.

675
00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.370
They are both in either's powers;

676
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.330
but this swift business

677
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:01.700
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning

678
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.470
Make the prize light.

679
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.500
One word more; I charge thee

680
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.430
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp

681
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.630
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself

682
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:11.570
Upon this island as a spy, to win it

683
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:12.700
From me, the lord on't.

684
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.000
No, as I am a man.

685
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.500
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:

686
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:18.700
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,

687
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.630
Good things will strive to dwell with't.

688
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:21.730
Follow me.

689
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:23.500
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor.

690
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.700
Come; I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:

691
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.830
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be

692
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:30.230
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks

693
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:31.530
Wherein the acorn cradled.

694
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:32.630
Follow.

695
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.600
No; I will resist such entertainment till

696
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.730
Mine enemy has more power.

697
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.070
O dear father,

698
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.730
Make not too rash a trial of him, for

699
00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.100
He's gentle and not fearful.

700
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.300
What?

701
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.500
I say, My foot my tutor?

702
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.800
Put thy sword up, traitor;

703
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.370
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience

704
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:51.830
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,

705
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:56.970
For I can here disarm thee with this stick

706
00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.800
And make thy weapon drop.

707
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.300
Beseech you, father.

708
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.800
Hence! Hang not on my garments.

709
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.700
Sir, have pity; I'll be his surety.

710
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.830
Silence!

711
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.100
One word more

712
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.130
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.

713
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.130
What! An advocate for an imposter?

714
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.630
Hush.

715
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.130
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,

716
00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:26.400
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench.

717
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.370
To the most of men this is a Caliban

718
00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:33.200
And they to him are angels.

719
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.530
My affections

720
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:36.670
Are then most humble; I have no ambition

721
00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.930
To see a goodlier man.

722
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:40.830
Come on; obey:

723
00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.670
Thy nerves are in their infancy again

724
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.470
And have no vigour in them.

725
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.470
So they are;

726
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:53.330
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.

727
00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.800
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,

728
00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.470
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,

729
00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:09.400
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,

730
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.600
Might I but through my prison once a day

731
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.970
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth

732
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:17.970
Let liberty make use of; space enough

733
00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:20.530
Have I in such a prison.

734
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.200
It works.

735
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.900
Come on!

736
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.930
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel.

737
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.400
Hark what thou else shalt do me.

738
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.630
Be of comfort;

739
00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.700
My father's of a better nature, sir,

740
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.270
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted

741
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:35.400
Which now came from him.

742
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.670
Thou shalt be free

743
00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:40.000
As mountain winds: but then exactly do

744
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.400
All points of my command.

745
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.570
To the syllable.

746
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.930
Come, follow.

747
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:46.800
Speak not for him.

748
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.900
Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,

749
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.000
So have we all, of joy; for our escape

750
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.270
Is much beyond our loss.

751
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.630
Our hint of woe

752
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.070
Is common; every day some sailor's wife,

753
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:20.570
The masters of some merchant and the merchant

754
00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:24.570
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,

755
00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.170
I mean our preservation, few in millions

756
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:32.130
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh

757
00:35:32.130 --> 00:35:33.830
Our sorrow with our comfort.

758
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:34.930
Prithee, peace.

759
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:36.870
He receives comfort like cold porridge.

760
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.630
The visitor will not give him o'er so.

761
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.570
Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;

762
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.130
by and by it will strike.

763
00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:43.230
Sir--

764
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.400
One: tell.

765
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.270
When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,

766
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.570
Comes to the entertainer--

767
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:49.670
A dollar.

768
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.300
Dolour comes to him, indeed:

769
00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:54.700
you have spoken truer than you purposed.

770
00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:57.030
You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

771
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.670
Therefore, my lord--

772
00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:01.100
Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue.

773
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.800
I prithee, spare.

774
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.030
Well, I have done: but yet--

775
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.370
He will be talking.

776
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.830
Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager,

777
00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:11.930
first begins to crow?

778
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.400
-The old cock. -The cockerel.

779
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:14.500
Done.

780
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.730
-The wager? -A laughter.

781
00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:16.830
A match.

782
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.670
Though this island seem to be desert--

783
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.770
Ha, ha, ha!

784
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:20.870
So, you're paid.

785
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.970
Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible--

786
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.070
Yet...

787
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:25.170
Yet--

788
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.470
He could not miss't.

789
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:29.030
It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate temperance.

790
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.600
Temperance was a delicate wench.

791
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.900
Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

792
00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.170
The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

793
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:37.000
As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

794
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.870
Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

795
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:43.030
Here is everything advantageous to life.

796
00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.130
True; save means to live.

797
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.630
Of that there's none, or little.

798
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:48.900
How lush and lusty the grass looks.

799
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.100
How green.

800
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.400
The ground indeed is tawny.

801
00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.600
With an eye of green in't.

802
00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.700
He misses not much.

803
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.670
No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

804
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.400
But the rarity of it is,

805
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.430
which is indeed almost beyond credit--

806
00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:01.130
As many vouched rarities are.

807
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:03.500
That our garments, being, as they were,

808
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:04.970
drenched in the sea,

809
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.770
hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses,

810
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.670
being rather new-dyed than stained with salt water.

811
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.900
Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it?

812
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.670
At Tunis at the marriage of your daughter,

813
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:20.830
who is now queen.

814
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.270
You cram these words into my ears against

815
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.770
The stomach of my sense.

816
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.470
Would I had never

817
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.100
Married my daughter there!

818
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.600
For, coming thence,

819
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.270
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,

820
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:38.030
Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her.

821
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.330
O thou mine heir

822
00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:44.230
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish

823
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.300
Hath made his meal on thee?

824
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:54.800
Sir, he may live: I saw him beat the surges under him,

825
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.470
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,

826
00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:00.130
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted

827
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.970
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head

828
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.200
'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd

829
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.500
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke

830
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.700
To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,

831
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.670
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt

832
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.800
He came alive to land.

833
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.400
No, no, he's gone.

834
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.630
Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,

835
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.030
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,

836
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:24.630
But rather lose her to an African;

837
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.700
Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,

838
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.430
Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

839
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.530
Prithee, peace!

840
00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.670
You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise

841
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:33.430
By all of us, and the fair soul herself

842
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.570
Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at

843
00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:37.130
Which end o' the beam should bow.

844
00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.670
We have lost your son,

845
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:41.670
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have

846
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.730
More widows in them of this business' making

847
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:45.470
Than we bring men to comfort them:

848
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:46.670
The fault's your own!

849
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:48.330
So is the dear'st o' the loss!

850
00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:49.830
My lord Sebastian,

851
00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.130
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness

852
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.770
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,

853
00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.300
When you should bring the plaster.

854
00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.400
Very well.

855
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.970
And most chirurgeonly.

856
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:07.400
It is foul weather in us all, good sir,

857
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.230
When you are cloudy.

858
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:10.330
Foul weather?

859
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.830
Very fowl.

860
00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:15.800
Had I plantation of this isle, my lord--

861
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.270
He'd sow't with nettle-seed.

862
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.400
Or docks, or mallows.

863
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.200
And were the king on't, what would I do?

864
00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.000
'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

865
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:29.170
I' the commonwealth I would by contraries

866
00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:33.400
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic

867
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:36.930
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;

868
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:41.200
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,

869
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.800
And use of service, none; contract, succession,

870
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.300
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;

871
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.700
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;

872
00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:59.270
No occupation; all men idle, all;

873
00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.700
And women too, but innocent and pure;

874
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.170
No sovereignty--

875
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.500
Yet he would be king on't.

876
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.330
The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.

877
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.700
All things in common nature should produce

878
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:15.900
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,

879
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.730
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,

880
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:23.630
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,

881
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:28.030
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,

882
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.600
To feed my innocent people.

883
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.100
No marrying 'mong his subjects?

884
00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.970
None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

885
00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.370
I would with such perfection govern, sir,

886
00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:39.630
To excel the golden age.

887
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:41.300
Save his majesty!

888
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.500
Long live Gonzalo!

889
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.130
And--do you mark me, sir?

890
00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:50.870
Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

891
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.170
I do well believe your highness;

892
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.530
and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,

893
00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:00.270
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs

894
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:03.500
that they always use to laugh at nothing.

895
00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.700
'Twas you we laughed at.

896
00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.570
Who in this kind of merry fooling

897
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.300
am nothing to you:

898
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.770
so you may continue and laugh at nothing still.

899
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.370
Oh, what a blow was there given.

900
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.300
An it had not fallen flat-long.

901
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.730
You are gentlemen of brave metal;

902
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.570
you would lift the moon out of her sphere,

903
00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.670
if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.

904
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.670
We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

905
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.470
Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

906
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:29.930
No, I warrant you;

907
00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:33.100
I will not adventure my discretion so weakly.

908
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:43.170
Will you laugh me asleep, for I am very heavy?

909
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:46.130
Go sleep, and hear us.

910
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.430
What, all so soon asleep.

911
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.030
I wish my eyes

912
00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:02.000
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find

913
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.600
They are inclined to do so.

914
00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.800
Please you, sir,

915
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:07.530
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:

916
00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:09.370
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,

917
00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:10.470
It is a comforter.

918
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.630
We two, my lord,

919
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.870
Will guard your person while you take your rest,

920
00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:14.970
And watch your safety.

921
00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:16.270
Thank you.

922
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.430
Wondrous heavy.

923
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.730
What a strange drowsiness possesses them.

924
00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.470
It is the quality o' the climate.

925
00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:30.300
Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink?

926
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.400
I find not

927
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.070
Myself disposed to sleep.

928
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:36.730
Nor I; my spirits are nimble.

929
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:41.630
They fell together all, as by consent;

930
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.730
They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke.

931
00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.170
What might, Worthy Sebastian?

932
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:53.600
O, what might?

933
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.730
No more:

934
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.400
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,

935
00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.230
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and

936
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.400
My strong imagination sees a crown

937
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.000
Dropping upon thy head.

938
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.700
What, art thou waking?

939
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.000
Do you not hear me speak?

940
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.100
I do; and surely

941
00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.030
It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st

942
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:12.130
Out of thy sleep.

943
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.400
What is it thou didst say?

944
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.200
This is a strange repose, to be asleep

945
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.130
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,

946
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.670
And yet so fast asleep.

947
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.470
Noble Sebastian,

948
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:27.070
Thou let'st thy fortune sleep-- die, rather; wink'st

949
00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:28.530
Whiles thou art waking.

950
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:32.670
Thou dost snore distinctly; There's meaning in thy snores.

951
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.430
I am more serious than my custom: you

952
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.570
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do

953
00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:38.930
Trebles thee o'er.

954
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.170
Well, I am standing water.

955
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.200
I'll teach you how to flow.

956
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.030
Do so: to ebb

957
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.830
Hereditary sloth instructs me.

958
00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:49.970
O, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish

959
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.500
Whiles thus you mock it.

960
00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.670
How, in stripping it,

961
00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.070
You more invest it.

962
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.270
Ebbing men, indeed,

963
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:57.430
Most often do so near the bottom run

964
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.630
By their own fear or sloth.

965
00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.200
Prithee, say on:

966
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.330
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaims

967
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.100
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed

968
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.770
Which throes thee much to yield.

969
00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:10.330
Thus, sir:

970
00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.000
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,

971
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.470
Who shall be of as little memory

972
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:17.200
When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuaded--

973
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.070
For he's a spirit of persuasion, only

974
00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.700
Professes to persuade-- the king his son's alive,

975
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.570
'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd

976
00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:25.970
As he that sleeps here swims.

977
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:27.070
I have no hope

978
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:28.230
That he's undrown'd.

979
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.270
O, out of that "no hope"

980
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:31.830
What great hope have you.

981
00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:33.200
No hope that way is

982
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.630
Another way so high a hope that even

983
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.600
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,

984
00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.370
But doubt discovery there.

985
00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.470
Will you grant with me

986
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.170
That Ferdinand is drown'd?

987
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.830
He's gone.

988
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.270
Then, tell me,

989
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:48.730
Who's the next heir of Naples?

990
00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.570
Claribel.

991
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:54.970
She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells

992
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:58.100
Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples

993
00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.470
Can have no note, unless the sun were post--

994
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:03.370
The man i' the moon's too slow-- till new-born chins

995
00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:06.770
Be rough and razorable; she that from whom

996
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:10.470
We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,

997
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.200
And by that destiny to perform an act

998
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.330
Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come

999
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.000
In yours and my discharge.

1000
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.100
What stuff is this.

1001
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.330
How say you?

1002
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:20.600
'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;

1003
00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.730
So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions

1004
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.030
There is some space.

1005
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.800
A space whose every cubit

1006
00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.230
Seems to cry out, "How shall that Claribel

1007
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:29.900
"Measure us back to Naples?

1008
00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:31.070
"Keep in Tunis,

1009
00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.100
And let Sebastian wake."

1010
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.270
Say, this were death

1011
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:45.770
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse

1012
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:46.970
Than now they are.

1013
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:48.700
There be that can rule Naples

1014
00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.970
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate

1015
00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.430
As amply and unnecessarily

1016
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:55.170
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make

1017
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.630
A chough of as deep chat.

1018
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.000
O, that you bore

1019
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.170
A mind that I do.

1020
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.270
What a sleep were this

1021
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:02.500
For your advancement.

1022
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.770
Do you understand me?

1023
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:04.870
Methinks I do.

1024
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:06.070
And how does your content

1025
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.470
Tender your own good fortune?

1026
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:10.600
I remember you did supplant your brother Prospero.

1027
00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.370
True: And look how well my garments sit upon me;

1028
00:46:15.370 --> 00:46:18.370
Much feater than before: my brother's servants

1029
00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:21.830
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.

1030
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:25.470
But, for your conscience?

1031
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:27.200
Ay, sir; where lies that?

1032
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.830
If 'twere a kibe,

1033
00:46:28.830 --> 00:46:31.600
'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not

1034
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.330
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,

1035
00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:36.530
That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they

1036
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.500
And melt ere they molest.

1037
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.200
Here lies your brother,

1038
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.030
No better than the earth he lies upon,

1039
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.270
If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;

1040
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:47.400
Whom I, with this obedient steel,

1041
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.330
three inches of it,

1042
00:46:49.330 --> 00:46:52.870
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,

1043
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.770
To the perpetual wink for aye might put

1044
00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.830
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who

1045
00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:58.900
Should not upbraid our course.

1046
00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:00.130
For all the rest,

1047
00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.530
They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;

1048
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.830
They'll tell the clock to any business that

1049
00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:06.670
We say befits the hour.

1050
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:08.030
Thy case, dear friend,

1051
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.100
Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,

1052
00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:11.430
I'll come by Naples.

1053
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:13.330
Draw thy sword: one stroke

1054
00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.800
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;

1055
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.100
And I the king shall love thee.

1056
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:20.700
Draw together;

1057
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.530
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,

1058
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:23.770
To fall it on Gonzalo.

1059
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.370
O, but one word.

1060
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.400
My master through his art foresees the danger

1061
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.000
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--

1062
00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.030
For else his project dies-- to keep them living.

1063
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:37.100
While you here do snoring lie,

1064
00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:39.370
Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take.

1065
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.070
If of life you keep a care,

1066
00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:43.130
Shake off slumber, and beware:

1067
00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:45.730
Awake, awake!

1068
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:47.200
Let us both be sudden.

1069
00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.300
Now, good angels

1070
00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.400
Preserve the king.

1071
00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.500
Why, how now?

1072
00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:51.600
Ho, awake!

1073
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.800
Why are you drawn?

1074
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.830
Wherefore this ghastly looking?

1075
00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:56.070
What's the matter?

1076
00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:58.930
Whiles we stood here securing your repose,

1077
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:01.300
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing

1078
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:05.600
Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?

1079
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.200
It struck mine ear most terribly.

1080
00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.470
I heard nothing.

1081
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.330
O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,

1082
00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:11.430
To make an earthquake.

1083
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.530
Sure, it was the roar

1084
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:13.700
Of a whole herd of lions.

1085
00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.900
Heard you this, Gonzalo?

1086
00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.100
Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,

1087
00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.130
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:

1088
00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:24.130
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,

1089
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.700
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,

1090
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:28.870
That's verily.

1091
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.170
'Tis best we stand upon our guard,

1092
00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:34.970
Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.

1093
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:39.300
Lead off this ground; and let's make further search

1094
00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.970
For my poor son.

1095
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:42.770
Heavens keep him from these beasts.

1096
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.530
For he is, sure, i' the island.

1097
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:45.700
Lead away.

1098
00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.300
Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:

1099
00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:05.630
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.

1100
00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.430
All the infections that the sun sucks up

1101
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:18.700
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him

1102
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:21.670
By inch-meal a disease!

1103
00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.400
His spirits hear me

1104
00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.200
And yet I needs must curse.

1105
00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:39.930
But they'll nor pinch,

1106
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:43.070
Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i' the mire,

1107
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:46.200
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark

1108
00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.370
Out of my way, unless he bid 'em;

1109
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:55.400
but for every trifle are they set upon me;

1110
00:49:55.400 --> 00:50:00.500
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me

1111
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:05.130
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which

1112
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:08.700
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount

1113
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:15.170
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I

1114
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:18.730
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues

1115
00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:21.330
Do hiss me into madness.

1116
00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.130
Lo, now, lo!

1117
00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.330
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me

1118
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:27.830
For bringing wood in slowly.

1119
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.000
I'll fall flat;

1120
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.930
Perchance he will not mind me.

1121
00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.730
Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all,

1122
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.270
and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i' the wind:

1123
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.800
yond same black cloud, yond huge one,

1124
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.970
looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor.

1125
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:47.330
If it should thunder as it did before,

1126
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.100
I know not where to hide my head:

1127
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.430
yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls.

1128
00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.630
What have we here?

1129
00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:59.800
A man or a fish?

1130
00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.500
Dead or alive?

1131
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.830
A fish: he smells like a fish;

1132
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:08.370
a very ancient and fish-like smell;

1133
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.730
a kind of not of the newest Poor-John.

1134
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.730
A strange fish.

1135
00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:23.570
Were I in England now, as once I was,

1136
00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.630
and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there

1137
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:28.430
but would give a piece of silver:

1138
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.700
there would this monster make a man;

1139
00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:32.730
any strange beast there makes a man:

1140
00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:35.230
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar,

1141
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:38.100
they'll lay out ten to see a dead Indian.

1142
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:41.670
Legged like a man.

1143
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:48.370
His fins like arms.

1144
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.530
Warm o' my troth.

1145
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:53.370
I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer:

1146
00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:55.730
this is no fish, but an islander,

1147
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.770
that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt.

1148
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.900
Oh, alas, the storm is come again.

1149
00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.600
My best way is to creep under his gaberdine;

1150
00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.230
there's no other shelter hereabout:

1151
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:11.700
misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows.

1152
00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.200
I will here shroud

1153
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.500
till the dregs of the storm be past.

1154
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.130
I shall no more to sea, to sea,

1155
00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.230
Here shall I die ashore--

1156
00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.470
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's funeral:

1157
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:31.470
well, here's my comfort.

1158
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:36.270
The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,

1159
00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:40.230
The gunner and his mate Loved Mall,

1160
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.670
Meg and Marian and Margery,

1161
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:46.070
But none of us cared for Kate;

1162
00:52:46.070 --> 00:52:51.200
For she had a tongue with a tang,

1163
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:56.370
Would cry to a sailor, "Go hang!"

1164
00:52:56.370 --> 00:53:00.170
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,

1165
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:04.370
Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:

1166
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:12.470
Then to sea, boys, to sea, boys, to see

1167
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:13.900
and let her go hang.

1168
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.570
This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.

1169
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:20.970
Do not torment me: Oh!

1170
00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:22.870
What's the matter?

1171
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:24.200
Have we devils here?

1172
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.700
Do you put tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind?

1173
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.470
Ha.

1174
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:34.170
I have not 'scaped drowning to be afeard now

1175
00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:39.470
of your four legs; for it hath been said,

1176
00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:42.070
As proper a man as ever went on four legs

1177
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:46.170
cannot make him give ground; it shall be said so again

1178
00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:48.100
while Stephano breathes at's nostrils.

1179
00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.400
The spirit torments me; Oh!

1180
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.270
This is some monster of the isle with four legs,

1181
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.530
who hath, as I take it, an ague.

1182
00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.930
Where the devil should he learn our language?

1183
00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:03.430
I will give him some relief, if it be but for that.

1184
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:07.700
If I can recover him and keep him tame

1185
00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.830
and get to Naples with him, he's a present for any emperor

1186
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.370
that ever trod on neat's leather.

1187
00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:18.130
Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.

1188
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.400
He's in his fit now

1189
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.700
and does not talk after the wisest.

1190
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.700
He shall taste of my bottle:

1191
00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.870
if he have never drunk wine afore,

1192
00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:28.600
it will go near to remove his fit.

1193
00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:31.470
If I can recover him and keep him tame,

1194
00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.800
I will not take too much for him;

1195
00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.400
he shall pay for him that hath him,

1196
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.770
and that soundly.

1197
00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:38.830
Thou dost me yet but little hurt;

1198
00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.600
thou wilt anon, I know it by thy trembling:

1199
00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.200
now Prosper works upon thee.

1200
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.330
Come on your ways; open your mouth;

1201
00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:50.070
here is that which will give language to you, cat:

1202
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:54.930
open your mouth; this will shake your shaking,

1203
00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.600
I can tell you, and that soundly:

1204
00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.670
you cannot tell who's your friend:

1205
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.030
open your chaps again.

1206
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.800
I should know that voice: it should be--

1207
00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.670
but he is drowned; and these are devils:

1208
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:08.900
O defend me!

1209
00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.000
Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster.

1210
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.300
His forward voice is to speak well of his friend;

1211
00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.670
his backward voice is to utter foul speeches

1212
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.030
and to detract.

1213
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:20.430
If all the wine in my bottle will recover him,

1214
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:21.670
I will help his ague.

1215
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:22.770
Come.

1216
00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:24.130
Amen.

1217
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:25.900
I will pour some in thy other mouth.

1218
00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.370
Stephano!

1219
00:55:29.730 --> 00:55:32.830
Doth thy other mouth call me?

1220
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.970
Mercy, mercy.

1221
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:39.030
This is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him;

1222
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.430
I have no long spoon.

1223
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:44.000
If thou beest Stephano, touch me and speak to me:

1224
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.830
for I am Trinculo, thy good friend Trinculo!

1225
00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.530
If thou beest Trinculo, come forth:

1226
00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:56.570
I will pull thee by the lesser legs:

1227
00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:01.270
if any be Trinculo's legs, these are they.

1228
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:05.970
Thou art very Trinculo indeed!

1229
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:09.330
How camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf?

1230
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.300
Can he vent Trinculos?

1231
00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.230
I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.

1232
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:17.100
But art thou not drowned, Stephano?

1233
00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:20.500
I hope now thou art not drowned.

1234
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:24.470
Is the storm overblown?

1235
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:26.900
I hid me under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine

1236
00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.270
for fear of the storm.

1237
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:31.170
And art thou living, Stephano?

1238
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:36.830
O Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!

1239
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:43.370
Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.

1240
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:47.830
These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.

1241
00:56:47.830 --> 00:56:50.830
That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.

1242
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:52.770
I will kneel to him.

1243
00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:53.900
How didst thou 'scape?

1244
00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.330
How camest thou hither?

1245
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:58.330
Swear by this bottle how thou camest hither.

1246
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.270
I escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors

1247
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:04.130
heaved o'erboard, by this bottle;

1248
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.500
which I made of the bark of a tree

1249
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.600
with my own hands since I was cast ashore.

1250
00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.870
I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;

1251
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:14.770
for the liquor is not earthly.

1252
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:16.600
Here; swear how thou escapedst.

1253
00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.800
Swum ashore, man, like a duck:

1254
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.800
I can swim like a duck, I'll be sworn.

1255
00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.900
Here, kiss the book.

1256
00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.570
Though thou canst swim like a duck,

1257
00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:24.900
thou art made like a goose.

1258
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:26.130
O Stephano.

1259
00:57:26.130 --> 00:57:27.330
Hast any more of this?

1260
00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:29.770
The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock

1261
00:57:29.770 --> 00:57:32.200
by the sea-side where my wine is hid.

1262
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.430
How now, moon-calf.

1263
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:36.730
How does thine ague?

1264
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:40.370
Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

1265
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:43.530
Out o' the moon, I do assure thee:

1266
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:47.000
I was the man i' the moon when time was.

1267
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.630
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:

1268
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:54.670
My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

1269
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:56.330
Come, swear to that; kiss the book:

1270
00:57:56.330 --> 00:58:00.730
I'll furnish it anon with new contents, swear.

1271
00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:03.830
By this good light, this is a very shallow monster.

1272
00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:05.370
I afeard of him?

1273
00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:06.900
A very weak monster.

1274
00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:08.870
The man i' the moon.

1275
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:10.900
A most poor credulous monster.

1276
00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.900
Well drawn, monster, in good sooth.

1277
00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.300
I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;

1278
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.130
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

1279
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:23.670
By this light, this is a most perfidious drunken monster.

1280
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:25.700
When 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.

1281
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:28.870
I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

1282
00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:31.800
Come on then; down, and swear.

1283
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.570
I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster.

1284
00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:36.830
A most scurvy monster.

1285
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:38.700
I could find in my heart to beat him...

1286
00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:39.870
Come, kiss.

1287
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:42.500
But that the poor monster's in drink:

1288
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.200
abominable monster.

1289
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.970
I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;

1290
00:58:46.970 --> 00:58:49.730
I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.

1291
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:53.400
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!

1292
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.300
I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,

1293
00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.300
Thou wondrous man.

1294
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:02.600
A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a poor drunkard.

1295
00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:05.800
I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;

1296
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.670
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;

1297
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:13.070
Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how

1298
00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:15.970
To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee

1299
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:20.170
To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee

1300
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:22.000
Young scamels from the rock.

1301
00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.830
Wilt thou go with me?

1302
00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:26.330
I prithee now, lead the way without any more talking.

1303
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.400
Trinculo, the king and all our company else being drowned,

1304
00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:31.930
we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle:

1305
00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:34.400
fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by and by again.

1306
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:38.900
Farewell master; farewell, farewell!

1307
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.530
A howling, drunken monster.

1308
00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:44.270
No more dams I'll make for fish

1309
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:49.900
Nor fetch in firing At requiring;

1310
00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:53.370
Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish

1311
00:59:53.370 --> 00:59:57.900
'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban

1312
00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:01.800
Has a new master: get a new man.

1313
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.000
Freedom, hey-day!

1314
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.770
Hey-day, freedom!

1315
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:11.030
Freedom, hey-day, freedom!

1316
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.230
O brave monster!

1317
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.770
Lead the way.

1318
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.600
There be some sports are painful, and their labour

1319
01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:41.100
Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness

1320
01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:44.330
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters

1321
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.830
Point to rich ends.

1322
01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:48.270
This my mean task

1323
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.230
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but

1324
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.200
The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead

1325
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.130
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is

1326
01:00:57.130 --> 01:01:00.530
Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,

1327
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.600
And he's composed of harshness.

1328
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:03.800
I must remove

1329
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.930
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,

1330
01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:09.530
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress

1331
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:12.630
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness

1332
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:15.200
Had never like executor.

1333
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.700
I forget:

1334
01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.030
But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,

1335
01:01:20.030 --> 01:01:22.670
Most busy lest, when I do it.

1336
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.070
Alas, now, pray you,

1337
01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:26.630
Work not so hard: I would the lightning had

1338
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:29.030
Burnt up these logs that you are enjoin'd to pile.

1339
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:34.100
Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,

1340
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.200
'Twill weep for having wearied you.

1341
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.630
My father

1342
01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:40.100
Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;

1343
01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.770
He's safe these three hours.

1344
01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:43.330
O most dear mistress,

1345
01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:45.630
The sun will set before I shall discharge

1346
01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.170
What I must strive to do.

1347
01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:48.400
If you'll sit down,

1348
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.700
I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;

1349
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.970
I'll carry it to the pile.

1350
01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:53.230
No, precious creature;

1351
01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:55.270
I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,

1352
01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:57.200
Than you should such dishonour undergo,

1353
01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.300
While I sit lazy by.

1354
01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.400
It would become me

1355
01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.470
As well as it does you: and I should do it

1356
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:03.600
With much more ease; for my good will is to it,

1357
01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.070
And yours it is against.

1358
01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.630
Poor worm, thou art infected.

1359
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.300
This visitation shows it.

1360
01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.570
You look wearily.

1361
01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:13.430
No, noble mistress; 'tis fresh morning with me

1362
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.500
When you are by at night.

1363
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.830
I do beseech you--

1364
01:02:16.830 --> 01:02:19.430
Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--

1365
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:20.870
What is your name?

1366
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:22.170
Miranda--

1367
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:24.970
O my father, I have broke your hest to say so.

1368
01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:26.830
Admired Miranda.

1369
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.670
Indeed the top of admiration.

1370
01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:31.170
Worth what's dearest to the world.

1371
01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:35.370
Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard and many a time

1372
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:37.670
The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage

1373
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:40.070
Brought my too diligent ear:

1374
01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:45.270
for several virtues

1375
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:47.570
Have I liked several women; never any

1376
01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:50.100
With so full soul, but some defect in her

1377
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.170
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed

1378
01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:58.030
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,

1379
01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.470
So perfect and so peerless, are created

1380
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.470
Of every creature's best.

1381
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:04.400
I do not know

1382
01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.630
One of my sex; no woman's face remember,

1383
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.430
Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen

1384
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.970
More that I may call men than you, good friend,

1385
01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:16.200
And my dear father: how features are abroad,

1386
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:19.430
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,

1387
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.930
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish

1388
01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.330
Any companion in the world but you,

1389
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:26.670
Nor can imagination form a shape,

1390
01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.800
Besides yourself, to like of.

1391
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:30.830
But I prattle

1392
01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:33.030
Something too wildly and my father's precepts

1393
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:34.300
I therein do forget.

1394
01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.470
I am in my condition

1395
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:39.370
A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;

1396
01:03:39.370 --> 01:03:41.900
I would, not so-- and would no more endure

1397
01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:43.630
This wooden slavery than to suffer

1398
01:03:43.630 --> 01:03:46.030
The flesh-fly blow my mouth.

1399
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.130
Hear my soul speak:

1400
01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:49.830
The very instant that I saw you, did

1401
01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.270
My heart fly to your service; there resides,

1402
01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:55.230
To make me slave to it; and for your sake

1403
01:03:55.230 --> 01:03:57.800
Am I this patient log-man.

1404
01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.700
Do you love me?

1405
01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.970
O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound

1406
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:05.430
And crown what I profess with kind event

1407
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:07.130
If I speak true.

1408
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:09.170
If hollowly, invert

1409
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.270
What best is boded me to mischief.

1410
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:14.300
I beyond all limit of what else i' the world

1411
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:18.700
Do love, prize, honour you.

1412
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:22.900
Oh.

1413
01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:24.130
I am a fool

1414
01:04:24.130 --> 01:04:25.830
To weep at what I am glad of.

1415
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:27.070
Fair encounter

1416
01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:29.730
Of two most rare affections.

1417
01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:31.230
Heavens rain grace

1418
01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:33.000
On that which breeds between 'em.

1419
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.900
Wherefore weep you?

1420
01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:37.530
At my unworthiness that dare not offer

1421
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:39.600
What I desire to give, and much less take

1422
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.800
What I shall die to want.

1423
01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.900
But this is trifling;

1424
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.770
And all the more it seeks to hide itself,

1425
01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:47.730
The bigger bulk it shows.

1426
01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:49.470
Hence, bashful cunning.

1427
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:52.000
And prompt me, plain and holy innocence.

1428
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:56.700
I am your wife, if you will marry me;

1429
01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:02.930
If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow

1430
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:05.300
You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,

1431
01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.000
Whether you will or no.

1432
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.800
My mistress, dearest;

1433
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.270
And I thus humble ever.

1434
01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:11.470
My husband, then?

1435
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.570
Ay, with a heart as willing

1436
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:16.630
As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

1437
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:17.900
And mine, with my heart in't;

1438
01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:24.730
and now farewell Till half an hour hence.

1439
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:27.230
A thousand thousand.

1440
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.470
So glad of this as they I cannot be,

1441
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:58.530
Who are surprised withal; my rejoicing

1442
01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:01.300
At nothing can be more.

1443
01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.570
I'll to my book,

1444
01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.500
For yet ere supper-time must I perform

1445
01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.400
Much business appertaining.

1446
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:18.630
Tell not me; when the butt is out,

1447
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.400
we will drink water; not a drop before:

1448
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.630
therefore bear up, and board 'em.

1449
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.600
Servant-monster, drink to me.

1450
01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.900
Servant-monster.

1451
01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.030
The folly of this island.

1452
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.530
They say there's but five upon this isle:

1453
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:35.970
we are three of them; if th' other two

1454
01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:38.530
be brained like us, the state totters.

1455
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.500
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee:

1456
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:45.200
thy eyes are almost set in thy head.

1457
01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.900
Where should they be set else?

1458
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.100
He were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.

1459
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:53.170
My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:

1460
01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:56.900
for my part, the sea cannot drown me;

1461
01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.870
I swam, ere I could recover the shore,

1462
01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:01.830
five and thirty leagues...

1463
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:02.930
Ha!

1464
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:04.800
Off and on.

1465
01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.200
By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster,

1466
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.530
or my standard.

1467
01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:12.030
Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.

1468
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.400
We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.

1469
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.100
Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs

1470
01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.870
and yet say nothing neither.

1471
01:07:18.870 --> 01:07:22.600
Moon-calf, speak once in thy life,

1472
01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.500
if thou beest a good moon-calf.

1473
01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.170
How does thy honour?

1474
01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:31.100
Let me lick thy shoe.

1475
01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.200
I'll not serve him; he is not valiant.

1476
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.270
Thou liest, most ignorant monster:

1477
01:07:37.270 --> 01:07:40.770
I am in case to justle a constable.

1478
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:45.400
Why, thou deboshed fish thou, was there ever man a coward

1479
01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:48.670
that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day?

1480
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.370
Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,

1481
01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:53.270
being but half a fish and half a monster?

1482
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:55.730
Lo, how he mocks me!

1483
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.470
Wilt thou let him, my lord?

1484
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:59.100
"Lord" quoth he.

1485
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.900
That a monster should be such a natural.

1486
01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.400
Lo, lo, again!

1487
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.870
Bite him to death, I prithee.

1488
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:06.830
Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head:

1489
01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:09.300
if you prove a mutineer, the next tree.

1490
01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:11.730
The poor monster's my subject

1491
01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:14.770
and he shall not suffer indignity.

1492
01:08:14.770 --> 01:08:16.870
I thank my noble lord.

1493
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:19.970
Wilt thou be pleased to hearken

1494
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.700
to the suit I made to thee?

1495
01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.370
Marry, will I; kneel and repeat it;

1496
01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:27.700
I will stand, and so shall Trinculo.

1497
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:34.970
As I told thee before,

1498
01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:38.330
I am subject to a tyrant, a sorcerer,

1499
01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:41.770
that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

1500
01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:43.500
Thou liest.

1501
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.130
Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou:

1502
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:48.500
I would my valiant master would destroy thee!

1503
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.770
I do not lie!

1504
01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:53.070
Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale,

1505
01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:56.130
by this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.

1506
01:08:57.730 --> 01:08:59.300
Well, I said nothing.

1507
01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.670
Mum, then, and no more.

1508
01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:03.300
Proceed.

1509
01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:07.630
I say, by sorcery he got this isle;

1510
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:09.170
From me he got it.

1511
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:10.630
If thy greatness will

1512
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:13.100
Revenge it on him-- for I know thou darest,

1513
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.700
But this thing dare not.

1514
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.830
That's most certain.

1515
01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:20.970
Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.

1516
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:26.030
How now shall this be compassed?

1517
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:28.600
Canst thou bring me to the party?

1518
01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.500
Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,

1519
01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.600
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his head.

1520
01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.500
Thou liest; thou canst not.

1521
01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.330
What a pied ninny's this!

1522
01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:42.700
Thou scurvy patch!

1523
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.000
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows

1524
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.400
And take his bottle from him: when that's gone

1525
01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.230
He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him

1526
01:09:50.230 --> 01:09:52.030
Where the quick freshes are.

1527
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:54.170
Trinculo, run into no further danger:

1528
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.430
interrupt the monster one word further,

1529
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:59.200
and, by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors

1530
01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:00.730
and make a stock-fish of thee.

1531
01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:01.930
Why, what did I?

1532
01:10:01.930 --> 01:10:03.030
I did nothing.

1533
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:05.330
I'll go farther off.

1534
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:06.700
Didst thou not say he lied?

1535
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.800
Thou liest.

1536
01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.570
Do I so?

1537
01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:10.970
Take thou that.

1538
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:13.100
As you like this, give me the lie another time.

1539
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.800
I did not give the lie.

1540
01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:18.530
Out o' your wits and hearing too?

1541
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:20.070
A pox o' your bottle!

1542
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:23.070
This can sack and drinking do.

1543
01:10:23.070 --> 01:10:26.330
A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers!

1544
01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:30.100
Now, forward with your tale.

1545
01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.130
Prithee, stand farther off.

1546
01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:33.370
Beat him enough:

1547
01:10:33.370 --> 01:10:36.800
after a little time I'll beat him too.

1548
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.070
Stand farther.

1549
01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:44.630
Come, proceed.

1550
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:48.370
Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,

1551
01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:52.170
I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,

1552
01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:55.470
Having first seized his books, or with a log

1553
01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:59.330
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,

1554
01:10:59.330 --> 01:11:01.330
Or cut his wezand with thy knife.

1555
01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:04.970
Remember first to possess his books; for without them

1556
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:08.570
He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not

1557
01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:11.630
One spirit to command: they all do hate him

1558
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:13.700
As rootedly as I.

1559
01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:15.530
Burn but his books.

1560
01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:19.600
He has brave utensils-- for so he calls them--

1561
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.770
Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal

1562
01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:30.030
And that most deeply to consider is

1563
01:11:30.030 --> 01:11:33.700
The beauty of his daughter; he himself

1564
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:38.730
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,

1565
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:42.630
But only Sycorax my dam and she;

1566
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:46.700
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax

1567
01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:49.730
As great'st does least.

1568
01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:51.770
Is it so brave a lass?

1569
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:55.930
Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.

1570
01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:58.370
And bring thee forth brave brood.

1571
01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.600
Monster, I will kill this man:

1572
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.500
his daughter and I will be king and queen--

1573
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.900
save our graces--

1574
01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:08.970
and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys.

1575
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:11.770
Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo?

1576
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:15.200
Excellent.

1577
01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:20.400
Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee;

1578
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:25.230
but, while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.

1579
01:12:25.230 --> 01:12:28.030
Within this half hour will he be asleep:

1580
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:30.100
Wilt thou destroy him then?

1581
01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:33.370
Ay, on mine honour.

1582
01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:35.570
This will I tell my master.

1583
01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:39.670
Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:

1584
01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:43.330
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch

1585
01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:45.030
You taught me but while-ere?

1586
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:50.030
At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any reason.

1587
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:52.300
Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.

1588
01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:55.300
Flout 'em and scout 'em

1589
01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.130
And scout 'em and flout 'em.

1590
01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:59.230
Thought is free.

1591
01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:01.930
That's not the tune!

1592
01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.800
What is this same?

1593
01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.230
Shh!

1594
01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:13.030
This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody.

1595
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:17.270
If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:

1596
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:23.070
if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.

1597
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:24.870
O, forgive me my sins!

1598
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:28.370
He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee!

1599
01:13:30.170 --> 01:13:32.370
Mercy upon us.

1600
01:13:33.370 --> 01:13:34.930
Art thou afeard?

1601
01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:39.770
No, monster, not I.

1602
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:43.830
Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,

1603
01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:47.870
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.

1604
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:51.200
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments

1605
01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.100
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices

1606
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:57.630
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,

1607
01:13:57.630 --> 01:14:02.430
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,

1608
01:14:02.430 --> 01:14:06.430
The clouds methought would open and show riches

1609
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:10.670
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,

1610
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:13.600
I cried to dream again.

1611
01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.700
This will prove a brave kingdom to me,

1612
01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:19.930
where I shall have my music for nothing.

1613
01:14:19.930 --> 01:14:22.730
When Prospero is destroyed.

1614
01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:28.200
That shall be by and by: I remember the story.

1615
01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.870
The sound is going away;

1616
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:32.200
let's follow it, and after do our work.

1617
01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.830
Lead, monster; we'll follow.

1618
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:40.670
I would I could see this tabourer; he lays it on.

1619
01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:42.300
Wilt come?

1620
01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.970
I'll follow, Stephano.

1621
01:15:06.170 --> 01:15:09.500
By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;

1622
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:14.600
My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed

1623
01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.330
Through forth-rights and meanders.

1624
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:20.870
By your patience, I needs must rest me.

1625
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:22.570
Old lord, I cannot blame thee,

1626
01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:24.800
Who am myself attach'd with weariness,

1627
01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:28.330
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.

1628
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.870
Even here will I put off my hope and keep it

1629
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:35.970
No longer for my flatterer.

1630
01:15:42.230 --> 01:15:44.130
He is drown'd

1631
01:15:44.130 --> 01:15:48.130
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks

1632
01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:51.170
Our frustrate search on land.

1633
01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:56.170
Well, let him go.

1634
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:58.730
I am right glad that he's so out of hope.

1635
01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:01.470
Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose

1636
01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:02.970
You resolved to effect.

1637
01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:05.230
The next advantage will we take throughly.

1638
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:06.330
Let it be to-night;

1639
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:08.470
For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they

1640
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:10.400
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance

1641
01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.870
As when they are fresh.

1642
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:14.100
I say, to-night: no more.

1643
01:16:17.370 --> 01:16:19.770
What harmony is this?

1644
01:16:19.770 --> 01:16:22.100
My good friends, hark.

1645
01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.170
Marvellous sweet music.

1646
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:14.670
Give us kind keepers, heavens.

1647
01:17:14.670 --> 01:17:16.370
What were these?

1648
01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:19.930
A living drollery.

1649
01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:21.170
Now I will believe

1650
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.430
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia

1651
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:26.200
There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix

1652
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.000
At this hour reigning there.

1653
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.200
I'll believe both;

1654
01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.230
And what does else want credit, come to me,

1655
01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:34.470
And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did lie,

1656
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:36.370
Though fools at home condemn 'em.

1657
01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:38.530
If in Naples I should report this now,

1658
01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:40.000
would they believe me?

1659
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.100
If I should say, I saw such islanders--

1660
01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.500
For, certes, these are people of the island--

1661
01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:47.470
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,

1662
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:49.770
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of

1663
01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:51.900
Our human generation you shall find

1664
01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.100
Many, nay, almost any.

1665
01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.400
Honest lord,

1666
01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:57.930
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present

1667
01:17:57.930 --> 01:17:59.870
Are worse than devils.

1668
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:01.730
I cannot too much muse

1669
01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:06.330
Such shapes, such gesture and such sounds, expressing,

1670
01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:09.630
Although they want the use of tongue, a kind

1671
01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.730
Of excellent dumb discourse.

1672
01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:13.300
Praise in departing.

1673
01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.770
They vanish'd strangely.

1674
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:16.870
No matter, since

1675
01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:18.600
They have left their viands behind;

1676
01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.700
for we have stomachs.

1677
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.930
Will't please you taste of what is here?

1678
01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:23.030
Not I.

1679
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:24.630
Faith, sir, you need not fear.

1680
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:25.800
When we were boys,

1681
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.030
Who would believe that there were mountaineers

1682
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:31.470
Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em

1683
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:32.870
Wallets of flesh?

1684
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:34.170
Or that there were such men

1685
01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:36.030
Whose heads stood in their breasts?

1686
01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:37.230
Which now we find

1687
01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:39.570
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us

1688
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:40.770
Good warrant of.

1689
01:18:40.770 --> 01:18:42.200
I will stand to and feed,

1690
01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:44.630
Although my last: no matter, since I feel

1691
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:48.030
The best is past.

1692
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:49.970
Brother, my lord the duke,

1693
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:51.600
Stand to and do as we.

1694
01:19:00.730 --> 01:19:03.800
You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,

1695
01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.730
That hath to instrument this lower world

1696
01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:07.870
And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea

1697
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:11.070
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island

1698
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:13.700
Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men

1699
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.170
Being most unfit to live.

1700
01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.870
I have made you mad;

1701
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:22.000
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown

1702
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.600
Their proper selves.

1703
01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.030
You fools!

1704
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:26.370
I and my fellows

1705
01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:28.230
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,

1706
01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.330
Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well

1707
01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:33.200
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs

1708
01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.300
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish

1709
01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:39.800
One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers

1710
01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:42.530
Are like invulnerable.

1711
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:43.800
If you could hurt,

1712
01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.030
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths

1713
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:47.900
And will not be uplifted.

1714
01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.600
But remember--

1715
01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:52.500
For that's my business to you-- that you three

1716
01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.230
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;

1717
01:19:55.230 --> 01:19:58.030
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,

1718
01:19:58.030 --> 01:20:01.400
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed

1719
01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:05.430
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have

1720
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:09.270
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,

1721
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:11.100
Against your peace!

1722
01:20:11.100 --> 01:20:12.970
Thee of thy son, Alonso,

1723
01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:16.870
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:

1724
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:20.470
Lingering perdition, worse than any death

1725
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:24.130
Can be at once, shall step by step attend

1726
01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:28.970
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--

1727
01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:32.500
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls

1728
01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:37.970
Upon your heads-- is nothing but heart-sorrow

1729
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:41.570
And a clear life ensuing.

1730
01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.870
I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you

1731
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:36.530
In this strange stare?

1732
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:38.470
O, it is monstrous, monstrous:

1733
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:40.700
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;

1734
01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:43.330
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,

1735
01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:46.330
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced

1736
01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:50.800
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.

1737
01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.970
Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded,

1738
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:57.700
and I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded

1739
01:21:57.700 --> 01:22:00.870
And with him there lie mudded.

1740
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:03.830
But one fiend at a time, I'll fight their legions o'er.

1741
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:05.300
I'll be thy second.

1742
01:22:06.570 --> 01:22:10.370
All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,

1743
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:13.300
Like poison given to work a great time after,

1744
01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:16.370
Now 'gins to bite the spirits.

1745
01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:17.670
I do beseech you

1746
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:20.200
That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly

1747
01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.770
And hinder them from what this ecstasy

1748
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:24.530
May now provoke them to.

1749
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:26.230
Follow, I pray you.

1750
01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.170
Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou

1751
01:22:30.170 --> 01:22:34.370
Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:

1752
01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:37.100
Of my instructions hast thou nothing bated

1753
01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:41.130
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life

1754
01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:43.900
And observation strange, my meaner ministers

1755
01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:45.870
Their several kinds have done.

1756
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:47.970
My high charms work

1757
01:22:47.970 --> 01:22:50.530
And these mine enemies are all knit up

1758
01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:58.030
In their distractions; they now are in my power.

1759
01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:05.300
If I have too austerely punish'd you,

1760
01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:10.030
Your compensation makes amends, for I

1761
01:23:10.030 --> 01:23:13.130
Have given you here a third of my own life,

1762
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:15.830
Or that for which I live;

1763
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:20.600
who once again I tender to thy hands: all thy vexations

1764
01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:26.270
Were but my trials of thy love and thou hast strangely stood the test.

1765
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:34.270
Here afore Heaven, I ratify this my rich gift.

1766
01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:35.400
O Ferdinand,

1767
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.370
Do not smile at me that I boast here of,

1768
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:40.130
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise

1769
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:43.030
And make it halt behind her.

1770
01:23:43.030 --> 01:23:45.330
I do believe it against an oracle.

1771
01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:50.630
Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition

1772
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:57.930
Worthily purchased, take my daughter.

1773
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:06.570
But if thou dost break her virgin-knot before

1774
01:24:06.570 --> 01:24:08.230
All sanctimonious ceremonies may

1775
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:10.500
With full and holy rite be minister'd,

1776
01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:13.070
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall

1777
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:16.930
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,

1778
01:24:16.930 --> 01:24:20.000
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew

1779
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.730
The union of your bed with weeds so loathly

1780
01:24:23.730 --> 01:24:27.200
That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,

1781
01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:30.800
As Hymen's lamps shall light you.

1782
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:33.670
As I hope

1783
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:36.700
For quiet days, fair issue and long life,

1784
01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:39.830
With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,

1785
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:42.500
The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion,

1786
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.000
Our worser genius can, shall never melt

1787
01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.830
Mine honour into lust, to take away

1788
01:24:46.830 --> 01:24:48.930
The edge of that day's celebration

1789
01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:51.870
When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,

1790
01:24:51.870 --> 01:24:54.430
Or Night kept chain'd below.

1791
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:56.300
Fairly spoke.

1792
01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.500
Sit then.

1793
01:25:01.470 --> 01:25:03.370
And talk with her;

1794
01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:09.130
she is thine own.

1795
01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:10.300
What, Ariel.

1796
01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.800
My industrious servant, Ariel.

1797
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:13.630
What would my potent master? Here I am.

1798
01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:15.770
Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service

1799
01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:17.700
Did worthily perform; but I must use you

1800
01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:18.800
In such another trick.

1801
01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:19.900
Go bring the rabble,

1802
01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:22.100
O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:

1803
01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:23.930
Incite them to quick motion; for I must

1804
01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:26.800
Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple

1805
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.200
Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,

1806
01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.530
And they expect it from me.

1807
01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:33.030
-Presently? -Ay, with a twink.

1808
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:34.700
Before you can say "come" and "go,"

1809
01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:36.470
And breathe twice and cry "so, so,"

1810
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:38.300
Each one, tripping on his toe,

1811
01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.030
Will be here with mop and mow.

1812
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:44.530
Do you love me, master?

1813
01:25:45.430 --> 01:25:47.070
No?

1814
01:25:47.070 --> 01:25:50.200
Dearly my delicate Ariel.

1815
01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:51.330
Do not approach

1816
01:25:51.330 --> 01:25:52.970
Till thou dost hear me call.

1817
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:55.930
Well, I conceive.

1818
01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:04.670
Look thou be true; do not give dalliance

1819
01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:08.930
Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw

1820
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.500
To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,

1821
01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:14.930
Or else, good night your vow.

1822
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:16.130
I warrant you sir;

1823
01:26:16.130 --> 01:26:18.000
The white cold virgin snow upon my heart

1824
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.800
Abates the ardour of my liver.

1825
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:23.000
Well.

1826
01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:28.270
Now come, my Ariel, bring a corollary,

1827
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:30.870
Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly.

1828
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:32.030
No tongue.

1829
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:33.330
All eyes.

1830
01:26:33.330 --> 01:26:35.100
Be silent.

1831
01:26:52.270 --> 01:27:00.470
Honour, riches,

1832
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:07.030
marriage-blessing,

1833
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:16.330
Long continuance, and increasing,

1834
01:27:16.330 --> 01:27:19.470
Hourly joys

1835
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:24.930
be still upon you!

1836
01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:32.430
Juno sings her blessings on you.

1837
01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:43.470
Juno sings her blessings on you.

1838
01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:51.300
Earth's increase, foison plenty,

1839
01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:55.870
Barns and garners never empty,

1840
01:27:55.870 --> 01:28:00.700
Vines with clustering bunches growing,

1841
01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:06.000
Plants with goodly burden bowing;

1842
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.030
Spring come to you at the farthest

1843
01:28:11.030 --> 01:28:16.530
In the very end of harvest.

1844
01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:21.800
Scarcity and want shall shun you;

1845
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:28.000
Ceres' blessing so is on you.

1846
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:37.630
Ceres' blessing so is on you.

1847
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:44.030
This is a most majestic vision, and

1848
01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:46.270
Harmonious charmingly.

1849
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:47.630
May I be bold

1850
01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:49.370
To think these spirits?

1851
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:51.230
Spirits, which by mine art

1852
01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:53.830
I have from their confines call'd to enact

1853
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:55.470
My present fancies.

1854
01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:57.330
Let me live here ever;

1855
01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:59.730
So rare a wonder'd father and a wise

1856
01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:02.100
Makes this place Paradise.

1857
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.300
Sweet, now, silence.

1858
01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.100
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;

1859
01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:08.330
There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,

1860
01:29:08.330 --> 01:29:11.530
Or else our spell is marr'd.

1861
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:22.830
You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,

1862
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:32.270
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,

1863
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:38.330
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land

1864
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:49.700
Answer your summons; Juno does command:

1865
01:29:52.770 --> 01:29:59.970
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate

1866
01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:09.130
A contract of true love; be not too late.

1867
01:30:09.130 --> 01:30:17.500
You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,

1868
01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:25.130
Come hither from the furrow and be merry:

1869
01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:31.700
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on

1870
01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:40.870
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one

1871
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:46.570
In country footing.

1872
01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.200
I had forgot that foul conspiracy

1873
01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.170
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates

1874
01:32:29.170 --> 01:32:31.130
Against my life: the minute of their plot

1875
01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:32.230
Is almost come.

1876
01:32:32.230 --> 01:32:33.330
Well done!

1877
01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:36.130
Avoid; no more!

1878
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:44.570
This is strange: your father's in some passion

1879
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:45.900
That works him strongly.

1880
01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.070
Never till this day

1881
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:49.130
Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.

1882
01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:51.670
You do look, my son, in a moved sort,

1883
01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:53.630
As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.

1884
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:55.730
Our revels now are ended.

1885
01:32:55.730 --> 01:32:56.870
These our actors,

1886
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:58.700
As I foretold you, were all spirits and

1887
01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:02.230
Are melted into air, into thin air:

1888
01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.400
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,

1889
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.830
The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,

1890
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:13.200
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,

1891
01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.670
Yea all which it inherit, shall dissolve

1892
01:33:16.670 --> 01:33:20.200
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,

1893
01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.430
Leave not a rack behind.

1894
01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.070
We are such stuff

1895
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:33.830
As dreams are made on, and our little life

1896
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:36.070
Is rounded with a sleep.

1897
01:33:36.070 --> 01:33:37.900
Sir, I am vex'd;

1898
01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:41.330
Bear with my weakness; my old brain is troubled:

1899
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:43.170
Be not disturb'd by my infirmity:

1900
01:33:43.170 --> 01:33:44.930
If you be pleased, retire into my cell

1901
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:46.870
And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,

1902
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:48.170
To still my beating mind.

1903
01:33:48.170 --> 01:33:49.330
We wish your peace.

1904
01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:51.470
Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.

1905
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:52.670
Thy thoughts I cleave to.

1906
01:33:52.670 --> 01:33:53.870
What's thy pleasure?

1907
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:56.000
Spirit, we must prepare to meet with Caliban.

1908
01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.970
Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,

1909
01:33:57.970 --> 01:34:00.100
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd

1910
01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:01.300
Lest I might anger thee.

1911
01:34:01.300 --> 01:34:03.600
Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?

1912
01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.270
I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;

1913
01:34:06.270 --> 01:34:08.930
So full of valour that they smote the air

1914
01:34:08.930 --> 01:34:11.330
For breathing of their faces; beat the ground

1915
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:14.300
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending

1916
01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.030
Towards their project.

1917
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:17.830
Then I beat my tabour;

1918
01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:21.100
At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd their ears,

1919
01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.900
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses

1920
01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:27.670
As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears

1921
01:34:27.670 --> 01:34:30.330
That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through

1922
01:34:30.330 --> 01:34:34.430
Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,

1923
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:37.930
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them

1924
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:40.600
I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,

1925
01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:43.670
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake

1926
01:34:43.670 --> 01:34:45.600
O'erstunk their feet.

1927
01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.970
This was well done, my bird.

1928
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:49.700
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:

1929
01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:52.330
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,

1930
01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:55.130
For stale to catch these thieves.

1931
01:34:55.130 --> 01:34:56.830
I go, I go.

1932
01:34:58.370 --> 01:35:03.370
A devil, a born devil, on whose nature

1933
01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:07.830
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,

1934
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:11.630
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;

1935
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:14.300
And as with age his body uglier grows,

1936
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.830
So his mind cankers.

1937
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:17.730
I will plague them all,

1938
01:35:17.730 --> 01:35:18.830
Even to roaring.

1939
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:20.400
Hang them upon this line.

1940
01:35:31.330 --> 01:35:33.930
Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not

1941
01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:37.130
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

1942
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:38.870
Monster, your fairy,

1943
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:41.000
which you say is a harmless fairy,

1944
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.430
hath done little better than played the Jack with us.

1945
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:47.170
Monster, I do smell all horse-piss;

1946
01:35:47.170 --> 01:35:49.670
at which my nose is in great indignation.

1947
01:35:49.670 --> 01:35:50.870
So is mine.

1948
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:52.200
Do you hear, monster?

1949
01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.770
If I should take a displeasure against you, look you--

1950
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:56.630
Thou wert but a lost monster.

1951
01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:59.570
Good my lord, give me thy favour still.

1952
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:02.570
Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to

1953
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:06.730
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.

1954
01:36:06.730 --> 01:36:09.200
All's hush'd as midnight yet.

1955
01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:11.830
Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool.

1956
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:14.800
There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster,

1957
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.930
but an infinite loss.

1958
01:36:16.930 --> 01:36:18.800
That's more to me than my wetting:

1959
01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.800
yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.

1960
01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:23.270
I will fetch off my bottle,

1961
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:25.570
though I be o'er ears for my labour.

1962
01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:27.430
Prithee, my king, be quiet.

1963
01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.800
Seest thou here,

1964
01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:35.300
This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.

1965
01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:38.400
Do that good mischief which may make this island

1966
01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:41.400
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,

1967
01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:43.330
For aye thy foot-licker.

1968
01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.070
Give me thy hand.

1969
01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.570
I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

1970
01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:52.270
O king Stephano!

1971
01:36:52.270 --> 01:36:53.500
O peer!

1972
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.070
O worthy Stephano!

1973
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:57.170
Look what a wardrobe here is for thee!

1974
01:36:57.170 --> 01:36:59.700
Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

1975
01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:01.000
Monster!

1976
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.870
We know what belongs to a frippery.

1977
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:05.000
O king Stephano!

1978
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.930
Put off that gown, Trinculo;

1979
01:37:06.930 --> 01:37:08.900
by this hand, I'll have that gown.

1980
01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:10.330
Thy grace shall have it.

1981
01:37:10.330 --> 01:37:13.400
The dropsy drown this fool; what do you mean

1982
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.930
To dote thus on such luggage?

1983
01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:16.100
Let alone

1984
01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:18.370
And do the murder first: if he awake,

1985
01:37:18.370 --> 01:37:21.630
From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,

1986
01:37:21.630 --> 01:37:23.400
Make us strange stuff.

1987
01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:24.900
Be you quiet, monster.

1988
01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:28.830
Mistress line, is not this my jerkin?

1989
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:33.400
Now is the jerkin under the line:

1990
01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.670
now, jerkin, you are like to lose your hair

1991
01:37:35.670 --> 01:37:38.200
and prove a bald jerkin.

1992
01:37:39.870 --> 01:37:45.070
Do, do: we steal by line and level,

1993
01:37:45.070 --> 01:37:46.530
an't like your grace.

1994
01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:53.530
I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:

1995
01:37:53.530 --> 01:37:58.270
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.

1996
01:37:58.270 --> 01:38:04.270
"Steal by line and level" is an excellent pass of pate;

1997
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:05.870
there's another garment for't.

1998
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:11.400
Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,

1999
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.170
and away with the rest.

2000
01:38:13.170 --> 01:38:17.030
I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,

2001
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:19.900
And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes

2002
01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.900
With foreheads villanous low.

2003
01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:24.030
Monster, lay-to your fingers:

2004
01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:27.970
help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is,

2005
01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:30.430
or I'll turn you out of my kingdom:

2006
01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:33.370
go to, carry this.

2007
01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:34.570
And this.

2008
01:38:34.570 --> 01:38:36.400
Ay, and this.

2009
01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:52.930
Hey, Mountain, hey!

2010
01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:56.170
Silver, there it goes, Silver!

2011
01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.630
Fury, Fury!

2012
01:38:58.630 --> 01:38:59.670
There, Tyrant!

2013
01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.730
Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints

2014
01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:09.300
With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews

2015
01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.100
With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them

2016
01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:14.000
Than pard or cat o' mountain.

2017
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.200
Hark, they roar.

2018
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.800
Let them be hunted soundly.

2019
01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:22.130
At this hour

2020
01:39:22.130 --> 01:39:28.100
Lies at my mercy all mine enemies:

2021
01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.000
Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou

2022
01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.970
Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little

2023
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:34.430
Follow, and do me service.

2024
01:39:44.730 --> 01:39:46.470
Now does my project gather to a head:

2025
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:48.600
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time

2026
01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.100
Goes upright with his carriage.

2027
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.200
How's the day?

2028
01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.130
On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,

2029
01:39:53.130 --> 01:39:54.600
You said our work should cease.

2030
01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.800
I did say so,

2031
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:57.300
When first I raised the tempest.

2032
01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.400
Say, spirit,

2033
01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.230
How fares the king and's followers?

2034
01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:03.430
Confined together

2035
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:05.370
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,

2036
01:40:05.370 --> 01:40:07.330
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,

2037
01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:09.670
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;

2038
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:11.430
They cannot budge till your release.

2039
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:12.630
The king,

2040
01:40:12.630 --> 01:40:15.030
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted,

2041
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:17.000
The remainder mourning over them,

2042
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.600
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly

2043
01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:24.270
Him you term'd, sir, "The good old lord Gonzalo;"

2044
01:40:24.270 --> 01:40:27.630
His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops

2045
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:29.500
From eaves of reeds.

2046
01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:32.200
Your charm so strongly works 'em

2047
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.500
That if you now beheld them, your affections

2048
01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.300
Would become tender.

2049
01:40:38.570 --> 01:40:40.800
Dost thou think so, spirit?

2050
01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.970
Mine would, sir, were I human.

2051
01:40:46.930 --> 01:40:49.530
And mine shall.

2052
01:40:49.530 --> 01:40:54.570
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling

2053
01:40:54.570 --> 01:40:57.530
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,

2054
01:40:57.530 --> 01:41:01.170
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,

2055
01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:06.530
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?

2056
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:11.130
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,

2057
01:41:11.130 --> 01:41:16.670
Yet with my nobler reason 'gainst my fury

2058
01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:22.270
Do I take part: the rarer action is

2059
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:26.770
In virtue than in vengeance:

2060
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:31.670
they being penitent,

2061
01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:33.630
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend

2062
01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:36.100
Not a frown further.

2063
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.370
Go release them, Ariel:

2064
01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:42.430
My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,

2065
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:46.700
And they shall be themselves.

2066
01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:48.500
I'll fetch them, sir.

2067
01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:01.130
Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,

2068
01:42:01.130 --> 01:42:04.700
And ye that on the sands with printless foot

2069
01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:07.500
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him

2070
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:11.670
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that

2071
01:42:11.670 --> 01:42:14.870
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,

2072
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:19.130
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime

2073
01:42:19.130 --> 01:42:21.870
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice

2074
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:26.600
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,

2075
01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:34.030
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd

2076
01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:40.630
The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,

2077
01:42:40.630 --> 01:42:43.170
And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault

2078
01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:47.870
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder

2079
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:52.700
Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak

2080
01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.430
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory

2081
01:42:56.430 --> 01:43:00.500
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up

2082
01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:06.500
The pine and cedar: graves at my command

2083
01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:12.000
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth

2084
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:15.670
By my so potent art.

2085
01:43:18.970 --> 01:43:24.270
But this rough magic

2086
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:27.870
I here abjure,

2087
01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.270
and, when I have required

2088
01:43:33.270 --> 01:43:37.630
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,

2089
01:43:37.630 --> 01:43:39.470
To work mine end upon their senses that

2090
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:45.170
This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,

2091
01:43:45.170 --> 01:43:48.430
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,

2092
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:53.700
And deeper than did ever plummet sound

2093
01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:56.500
I'll drown my book.

2094
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:03.500
A solemn air and the best comforter

2095
01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.870
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brain,

2096
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:08.700
Now useless, boil'd within thy skull.

2097
01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:10.570
There stand,

2098
01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:17.070
For you are spell-stopp'd.

2099
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:23.670
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,

2100
01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:27.270
Mine eyes, even sociable to a show of thine,

2101
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:30.030
Fall fellowly drops.

2102
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:31.430
The charm dissolves apace,

2103
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:33.370
And as the morning steals upon the night,

2104
01:44:33.370 --> 01:44:35.630
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses

2105
01:44:35.630 --> 01:44:37.930
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle

2106
01:44:37.930 --> 01:44:39.570
Their clearer reason.

2107
01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:42.000
O good Gonzalo,

2108
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.870
My true preserver, and a loyal sir

2109
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:47.100
To him thou follow'st.

2110
01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:48.530
I will pay thy graces

2111
01:44:48.530 --> 01:44:50.700
Home both in word and deed.

2112
01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.870
Most cruelly

2113
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:59.870
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:

2114
01:45:01.330 --> 01:45:03.870
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.

2115
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:06.100
Thou art pinch'd for't now, Sebastian.

2116
01:45:07.030 --> 01:45:10.700
Flesh and blood,

2117
01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:16.400
You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,

2118
01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:19.900
Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,

2119
01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:22.230
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,

2120
01:45:22.230 --> 01:45:25.500
Would here have kill'd your king;

2121
01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:33.900
I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art.

2122
01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:35.830
Their understanding

2123
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.230
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide

2124
01:45:38.230 --> 01:45:40.100
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore

2125
01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:42.130
That now lies foul and muddy.

2126
01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:43.470
Not one of them

2127
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:46.130
That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel.

2128
01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:48.970
I will discase me, and myself present

2129
01:45:48.970 --> 01:45:52.100
As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;

2130
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:57.800
Thou shalt ere long be free.

2131
01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:00.800
Where the bee sucks, there suck I:

2132
01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:03.300
In a cowslip's bell I lie;

2133
01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:06.100
There I couch when owls do cry.

2134
01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:08.870
On the bat's back I do fly

2135
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:11.430
After summer merrily.

2136
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:15.900
Merrily, merrily shall I live now

2137
01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:24.700
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

2138
01:46:25.570 --> 01:46:27.870
Why, that's my dainty Ariel.

2139
01:46:27.870 --> 01:46:29.230
I shall miss thee:

2140
01:46:29.230 --> 01:46:32.870
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.

2141
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:34.930
To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:

2142
01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:36.900
There thou shalt find the mariners asleep

2143
01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:39.130
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain

2144
01:46:39.130 --> 01:46:41.130
Being awake, enforce them to this place,

2145
01:46:41.130 --> 01:46:42.370
And presently, I prithee.

2146
01:46:42.370 --> 01:46:44.100
I drink the air before me, and return

2147
01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.670
Or ere your pulse twice beat.

2148
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:53.400
All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement

2149
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:57.330
Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us

2150
01:46:57.330 --> 01:46:59.670
Out of this fearful country.

2151
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:03.270
Behold, sir king,

2152
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:09.330
The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:

2153
01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.470
For more assurance that a living prince

2154
01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:16.530
Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;

2155
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:18.270
And to thee and thy company I bid

2156
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:20.470
A hearty welcome.

2157
01:47:21.930 --> 01:47:24.230
Whether thou be'st he or no,

2158
01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:27.000
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,

2159
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.800
As late I have been, I not know:

2160
01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.570
Thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,

2161
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:39.300
The affliction of my mind amends,

2162
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:41.700
with which, I fear, a madness held me:

2163
01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:43.430
this must crave,

2164
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:46.600
An if this be at all, a most strange story.

2165
01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.530
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat

2166
01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:53.000
Thou pardon me my wrongs.

2167
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.330
But how should Prospero

2168
01:47:55.330 --> 01:47:57.370
Be living and be here?

2169
01:47:57.370 --> 01:48:00.430
First, noble friend,

2170
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:04.500
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot

2171
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:06.400
Be measured or confined.

2172
01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:07.500
Whether this be

2173
01:48:07.500 --> 01:48:09.770
Or be not, I'll not swear.

2174
01:48:09.770 --> 01:48:11.100
You do yet taste

2175
01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:13.630
Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you

2176
01:48:13.630 --> 01:48:16.430
Believe things certain.

2177
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:20.570
Welcome, my friends all.

2178
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:26.570
But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,

2179
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:28.870
I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you

2180
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:32.930
And justify you traitors: at this time

2181
01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:35.600
I will tell no tales.

2182
01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.130
The devil speaks in him.

2183
01:48:37.130 --> 01:48:38.600
No.

2184
01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:44.870
For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother

2185
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:48.770
Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive

2186
01:48:48.770 --> 01:48:53.530
Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require

2187
01:48:53.530 --> 01:48:55.630
My dukedom of thee, which I know perforce

2188
01:48:55.630 --> 01:48:56.970
Thou must restore.

2189
01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.400
If thou be'st Prospero,

2190
01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:08.300
Give us particulars of thy preservation;

2191
01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:11.100
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since

2192
01:49:11.100 --> 01:49:15.600
Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--

2193
01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:19.900
How sharp the point of this remembrance is--

2194
01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:22.270
My dear son Ferdinand.

2195
01:49:22.270 --> 01:49:25.500
I am woe for't, sir.

2196
01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:27.630
Irreparable is the loss, and patience

2197
01:49:27.630 --> 01:49:29.630
Says it is past her cure.

2198
01:49:29.630 --> 01:49:31.070
I rather think

2199
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:33.800
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace

2200
01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.930
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid

2201
01:49:36.930 --> 01:49:38.670
And rest myself content.

2202
01:49:38.670 --> 01:49:40.630
You the like loss?

2203
01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:44.170
As great to me as late; for I

2204
01:49:44.170 --> 01:49:46.730
Have lost my daughter.

2205
01:49:46.730 --> 01:49:48.430
A daughter?

2206
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:52.230
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,

2207
01:49:52.230 --> 01:49:55.930
The king and queen there; that they were, I wish

2208
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:58.930
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed

2209
01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:00.570
Where my son lies.

2210
01:50:00.570 --> 01:50:02.100
When did you lose your daughter?

2211
01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:05.470
In this last tempest.

2212
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:09.770
I perceive these lords

2213
01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:11.430
At this encounter do so much admire

2214
01:50:11.430 --> 01:50:13.830
That they devour their reason and scarce think

2215
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:15.870
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words

2216
01:50:15.870 --> 01:50:19.130
Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have

2217
01:50:19.130 --> 01:50:23.570
Been justled from your senses, know for certain

2218
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:25.600
That I am Prospero and that very duke

2219
01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.930
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely

2220
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:32.500
Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,

2221
01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:33.770
To be the lord on't.

2222
01:50:33.770 --> 01:50:34.970
But no more yet of this;

2223
01:50:34.970 --> 01:50:36.570
For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,

2224
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:38.130
Not a relation for a breakfast or

2225
01:50:38.130 --> 01:50:39.630
Befitting this first meeting.

2226
01:50:39.630 --> 01:50:41.330
Welcome, sir.

2227
01:50:43.730 --> 01:50:48.070
This cell's my court: here have I few attendants

2228
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:54.700
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.

2229
01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:56.630
My dukedom since you have given me again,

2230
01:50:56.630 --> 01:50:58.970
I will requite you with as good a thing;

2231
01:50:58.970 --> 01:51:02.270
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye

2232
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:04.870
As much as me my dukedom.

2233
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:10.870
Sweet lord, you play me false.

2234
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:13.230
No, my dear'st love, I would not for the world.

2235
01:51:13.230 --> 01:51:15.870
Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,

2236
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:18.830
And I would call it fair play.

2237
01:51:26.230 --> 01:51:27.530
If this prove

2238
01:51:27.530 --> 01:51:31.530
A vision of the Island, one dear son

2239
01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:33.430
Shall I twice lose.

2240
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:35.930
A most high miracle.

2241
01:51:35.930 --> 01:51:38.870
Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;

2242
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:42.370
I have cursed them without cause.

2243
01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:47.430
Now all the blessings

2244
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:50.030
Of a glad father compass thee about.

2245
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:52.770
Arise, and say how thou camest hither.

2246
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:56.000
O, wonder!

2247
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.970
How many goodly creatures are there here.

2248
01:51:58.970 --> 01:52:02.530
How beauteous mankind is.

2249
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:06.100
O brave new world,

2250
01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:08.670
That has such people in't.

2251
01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:11.830
'Tis new to thee.

2252
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:13.930
What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?

2253
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:16.230
Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:

2254
01:52:16.230 --> 01:52:19.400
Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,

2255
01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.930
And brought us thus together?

2256
01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:22.070
Sir, she is mortal;

2257
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:24.300
But by immortal Providence she's mine:

2258
01:52:24.300 --> 01:52:26.570
I chose her when I could not ask my father

2259
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:28.570
For his advice, nor thought I had one.

2260
01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:31.930
She is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,

2261
01:52:31.930 --> 01:52:33.900
Of whom so often I have heard renown,

2262
01:52:33.900 --> 01:52:36.300
But never saw before; of whom I have

2263
01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:38.930
Received a second life; and second father

2264
01:52:38.930 --> 01:52:40.870
This lady makes him to me.

2265
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:43.800
I am hers:

2266
01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:46.870
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I

2267
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:49.100
Must ask my child forgiveness.

2268
01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:50.670
There, sir, stop:

2269
01:52:50.670 --> 01:52:52.930
Let us not burden our remembrance with

2270
01:52:52.930 --> 01:52:54.700
A heaviness that's gone.

2271
01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:56.730
I have inly wept,

2272
01:52:56.730 --> 01:52:58.700
Or should have spoke ere this.

2273
01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.000
Look down, you gods,

2274
01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.330
And on this couple drop a blessed crown.

2275
01:53:04.330 --> 01:53:07.500
For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way

2276
01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:08.730
Which brought us hither.

2277
01:53:08.730 --> 01:53:11.170
I say, Amen, Gonzalo.

2278
01:53:11.170 --> 01:53:14.330
Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue

2279
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:16.930
Should become kings of Naples?

2280
01:53:16.930 --> 01:53:18.400
O, rejoice

2281
01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.500
Beyond a common joy, and set it down

2282
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:25.670
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage

2283
01:53:25.670 --> 01:53:29.370
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,

2284
01:53:29.370 --> 01:53:32.330
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife

2285
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:36.770
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom

2286
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:41.830
In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves

2287
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:46.500
When no man was his own.

2288
01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:48.200
Give me your hands:

2289
01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:54.100
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart

2290
01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:56.230
That does not wish you joy.

2291
01:53:56.230 --> 01:53:57.430
Be it so.

2292
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:58.700
Amen.

2293
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:04.630
O, look, sir, look, sir; here is more of us:

2294
01:54:04.630 --> 01:54:07.770
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,

2295
01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:10.270
This fellow could not drown.

2296
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:12.330
Now, blasphemy,

2297
01:54:12.330 --> 01:54:16.470
That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?

2298
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:18.670
Hast thou no mouth by land?

2299
01:54:18.670 --> 01:54:20.230
What is the news?

2300
01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:23.830
The best news is, that we have safely found

2301
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:28.900
Our king and company; the next, our ship--

2302
01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.300
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--

2303
01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:33.370
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when

2304
01:54:33.370 --> 01:54:34.500
We first put out to sea.

2305
01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.200
Sir, all this service

2306
01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:37.470
Have I done since I went.

2307
01:54:37.470 --> 01:54:38.570
My tricksy spirit.

2308
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:40.770
These are not natural events; they strengthen

2309
01:54:40.770 --> 01:54:42.430
From strange to stranger.

2310
01:54:42.430 --> 01:54:44.500
Say, how came you hither?

2311
01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.270
If I did think, sir, I were well awake,

2312
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:47.630
I'd strive to tell you.

2313
01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:49.570
We were dead of sleep,

2314
01:54:49.570 --> 01:54:52.470
And--how I know not-- all clapp'd under hatches;

2315
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:55.570
Where but even now with strange and several noises

2316
01:54:55.570 --> 01:54:59.270
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,

2317
01:54:59.270 --> 01:55:01.400
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,

2318
01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:04.300
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;

2319
01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:06.330
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld

2320
01:55:06.330 --> 01:55:09.430
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master

2321
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:12.370
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,

2322
01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:14.900
Even in a dream, were we divided from them

2323
01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:16.830
And were brought moping hither.

2324
01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:18.400
Was't well done?

2325
01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:19.900
Bravely, my diligence.

2326
01:55:19.900 --> 01:55:21.730
Thou shalt be free.

2327
01:55:21.730 --> 01:55:24.700
This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod

2328
01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:28.000
And there is in this business more than nature

2329
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.870
Was ever conduct of: some oracle

2330
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:33.430
Must rectify our knowledge.

2331
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:34.670
Sir, my liege,

2332
01:55:34.670 --> 01:55:36.500
Do not infest your mind with beating on

2333
01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.100
The strangeness of this business;

2334
01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:39.270
at pick'd leisure

2335
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:41.570
Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,

2336
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:43.530
Which to you shall seem probable, of every

2337
01:55:43.530 --> 01:55:46.070
These happen'd accidents; till then, be cheerful

2338
01:55:46.070 --> 01:55:49.630
And think of each thing well.

2339
01:55:49.630 --> 01:55:51.230
Come hither, spirit:

2340
01:55:51.230 --> 01:55:53.230
Set Caliban and his companions free;

2341
01:55:53.230 --> 01:55:55.430
Untie the spell.

2342
01:55:58.070 --> 01:56:00.100
How fares my gracious sir?

2343
01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:02.670
There are yet missing of your company

2344
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:06.370
Some few odd lads that you remember not.

2345
01:56:06.370 --> 01:56:08.830
Every man shift for all the rest,

2346
01:56:08.830 --> 01:56:11.000
and let no man take care for himself;

2347
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.070
for all is but fortune.

2348
01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:16.100
Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

2349
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:19.930
If these be true spies which I wear in my head,

2350
01:56:19.930 --> 01:56:21.870
here's a goodly sight.

2351
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:26.930
O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!

2352
01:56:26.930 --> 01:56:30.330
How fine my master is.

2353
01:56:30.330 --> 01:56:31.600
I am afraid

2354
01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.370
He will chastise me.

2355
01:56:33.370 --> 01:56:35.270
What things are these, my lord Antonio?

2356
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:36.370
Will money buy 'em?

2357
01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:37.530
Very like; one of them

2358
01:56:37.530 --> 01:56:39.570
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

2359
01:56:39.570 --> 01:56:42.270
Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,

2360
01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:44.170
Then say if they be true.

2361
01:56:44.170 --> 01:56:47.370
This mis-shapen knave,

2362
01:56:47.370 --> 01:56:50.200
His mother was a witch, and one so strong

2363
01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:53.570
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,

2364
01:56:53.570 --> 01:56:56.170
And deal in her command without her power.

2365
01:56:56.170 --> 01:57:01.800
These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--

2366
01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:04.300
For he's a bastard one-- hath plotted with them

2367
01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:05.600
To take my life.

2368
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:09.500
Two of these fellows you

2369
01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:14.330
Must know and own; this thing of darkness,

2370
01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:16.470
I acknowledge mine.

2371
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:18.700
I shall be pinch'd to death.

2372
01:57:18.700 --> 01:57:21.530
Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

2373
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:23.870
He is drunk now: where had he wine?

2374
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:26.830
And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they

2375
01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:29.830
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?

2376
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:32.400
How camest thou in this pickle?

2377
01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:36.000
I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that,

2378
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.770
I fear me, will never out of my bones:

2379
01:57:38.770 --> 01:57:41.100
I shall not fear fly-blowing.

2380
01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:42.600
Why, how now, Stephano.

2381
01:57:42.600 --> 01:57:47.930
O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

2382
01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:50.470
You'd be king o' the isle, sirrah?

2383
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:53.600
I should have been a sore one then.

2384
01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:57.230
This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.

2385
01:57:57.230 --> 01:57:59.170
He is as disproportion'd in his manners

2386
01:57:59.170 --> 01:58:00.630
As in his shape.

2387
01:58:00.630 --> 01:58:03.770
Go, sirrah, to my cell;

2388
01:58:03.770 --> 01:58:08.230
Take with you your companion; and as you look

2389
01:58:08.230 --> 01:58:13.400
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

2390
01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:20.630
Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter

2391
01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:22.570
And seek for grace.

2392
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:27.200
What a thrice-double ass

2393
01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:30.930
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god

2394
01:58:30.930 --> 01:58:33.370
And worship this dull fool!

2395
01:58:33.370 --> 01:58:36.900
Go to; away.

2396
01:58:36.900 --> 01:58:43.070
Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

2397
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:45.230
Or stole it, rather.

2398
01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:54.300
Sir, I invite your highness and your train

2399
01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:57.170
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest

2400
01:58:57.170 --> 01:58:59.770
For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste

2401
01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:02.100
With such discourse as, I not doubt, will make it

2402
01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:04.800
Go quick away; the story of my life

2403
01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:06.870
And the particular accidents gone by

2404
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:11.930
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn

2405
01:59:11.930 --> 01:59:15.900
I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,

2406
01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:19.270
Where I have hope to see the nuptial

2407
01:59:19.270 --> 01:59:23.430
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;

2408
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:27.100
And thence retire me to my Milan, where

2409
01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:30.800
Every third thought shall be my grave.

2410
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.130
I long

2411
01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:35.530
To hear the story of your life, which must

2412
01:59:35.530 --> 01:59:39.300
Take the ear strangely.

2413
01:59:39.300 --> 01:59:41.370
I'll deliver all;

2414
01:59:41.370 --> 01:59:45.670
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales

2415
01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:48.230
And sail so expeditious that shall catch

2416
01:59:48.230 --> 01:59:52.670
Your royal fleet far off.

2417
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:20.600
My Ariel, chick,

2418
02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:25.930
That is thy charge: then to the elements

2419
02:00:25.930 --> 02:00:30.730
Be free, and fare thou well.

2420
02:00:50.930 --> 02:00:53.800
Please you, draw near.

2421
02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:59.370
Now my charms are all o'erthrown,

2422
02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:02.000
And what strength I have's mine own,

2423
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:05.470
Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,

2424
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:08.930
I must be here confined by you,

2425
02:01:08.930 --> 02:01:10.930
Or sent to Naples.

2426
02:01:10.930 --> 02:01:14.230
Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got

2427
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:16.800
And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell

2428
02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:22.370
In this bare island by your spell;

2429
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:24.370
But release me from my bands

2430
02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:27.470
With the help of your good hands:

2431
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:30.400
Gentle breath of yours my sails

2432
02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:34.270
Must fill, or else my project fails,

2433
02:01:34.270 --> 02:01:36.670
Which was to please.

2434
02:01:36.670 --> 02:01:39.670
Now I want

2435
02:01:39.670 --> 02:01:43.930
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,

2436
02:01:43.930 --> 02:01:50.270
And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer,

2437
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:53.300
Which pierces so that it assaults

2438
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:58.130
Mercy itself and frees all faults.

2439
02:01:58.130 --> 02:02:04.500
As you from crimes would pardon'd be,

2440
02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:10.030
Let your indulgence set me free.

2441
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:33.870
