00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:34.930



00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.320

        The all-powerful businessman
        contemplated his work.
      

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.080

        The market had expanded his
        empire to encompass the Earth.
      

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.880

        Resources were being exploited
        as never before.
      

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:56.170



00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.440

        However, many riches still
        eluded him, riches that a few
      

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.090

        dreamers naively attempted to
        withhold from the market in
      

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.000

        the name of the common good.


00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.800

        For the businessman, this notion
        of the common good had
      

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.110

        become the single obstacle
        standing between him and his
      

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.060

        ultimate goal, to transform
        the entire planet into a
      

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.460

        commodity and declare
        the total market.
      

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.670

        So he set off on a business
        trip that would change the
      

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.920

        face of the Earth.


00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:54.990



00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.090

        Since the beginning of time,
        the amount of water on the
      

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.280

        Earth had remained unchanged.


00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.060

        The same could not be said,
        however, for its quality.
      

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.040

        The businessman, a master at
        exploiting scarcity, believed
      

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.010

        there was no longer a choice.


00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.450

        It was time to make water a
        commodity and let the market's
      

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.570

        invisible hand regulate
        its trade.
      

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:28.570



00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.790

        Looking at the water situation
        around the world, we very fast
      

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.730

        begin to realize that there was
        a shortage of water all
      

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.990

        over the planet.


00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.330

        And with this lake here, I mean,
        it's a very unique lake,
      

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.600

        very good quality of water.


00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.130

        And we just got the idea of
        looking to do something with
      

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.270

        it, to get it out and
        to market the water.
      

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.470

        Like the flow from Gisborne
        Lake, of course, it's 100
      

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.290

        million cubic meters a year.


00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.510

        So we were looking at taking
        25 million, which is
      

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.870

        one-quarter of the flow
        from the lake.
      

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.180

        If you try to stockpile it,
        where's it going to go?
      

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.230

        Can't be done.


00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.700

        It's going to go anyway.


00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.190

        I think that if you say there's
        an excess of water,
      

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.310

        that you're taking a
        very narrow view
      

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.160

        of what water does.


00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.170

        Really, what that freshwater
        does, when it reaches the
      

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.170

        ocean, is it floats on top
        of the salt water.
      

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.890

        And as it moves out, it mixes
        up the nutrients and
      

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.390

        everything that is in the salty
        water down below and
      

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.270

        makes the places where rivers
        flow in, those estuaries,
      

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.430

        very, very productive.


00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.190

        I had to do two-and-a-half
        or three-year
      

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.040

        environmental-impact study.


00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.450

        And anybody else that want to
        take water from Newfoundland
      

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.020

        or anywhere else are going to
        have to do the same studies.
      

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.730

        This all has to be done.


00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.420

        And then, if there's available
        water, if it's a surplus of
      

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.430

        water, then we should sell it.


00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.330

        It should go.


00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.550

        We should do it.


00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.900

        Any province that starts to
        export bulk water for
      

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.630

        commercial purposes basically
        triggers the North American
      

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.020

        Free Trade Agreement.


00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.310

        Therefore, water will become a
        tradable commodity just like
      

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.320

        anything else, cars, or widgets,
        or whatever else.
      

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.130

        That means that you
        can't favor your
      

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.220

        domestic private sector.


00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.380

        You'll have to allow American
        corporations in.
      

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.100

        That means you can't just say
        one province can export it,
      

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.030

        but others can't.


00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.510

        That means that once the tap
        is turned on to the United
      

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.090

        States or other NAFTA
        countries, we
      

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.250

        can't turn it off.


00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.150

        We can't diminish it.


00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.690

        We can only allow it
        to become greater.
      

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.930

        And we can place no
        environmental restrictions on
      

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.660

        that, because that's a good
        between the two countries.
      

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.510



00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.360

        Today, of course, the
        moratorium is on.
      

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.180

        But the federal government seems
        to be not so hard to
      

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.240

        stand on bulk water anymore.


00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.370

        I think they're beginning to
        realize that we have a
      

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.950

        resource here that's
        worth some money.
      

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.610

        And I think it's a good thing.


00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.930

        It's almost like saying that
        you're not going to sell your
      

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.840

        water is almost like saying
        Saudi Arabia saying, look,
      

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.820

        we're not going to
        sell our oil.
      

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.070

        It's the same thing.


00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.450



00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.030

        We speak of these things
        as resources.
      

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.640

        And we do the same thing with
        iron, and copper, and nickel,
      

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.300

        and things like this.


00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.920

        But in all of these sorts of
        things, you have a choice.
      

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.990

        If you don't use the iron, well,
        maybe the nickel would
      

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.240

        do as well.


00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.310

        Or if you don't use the oil,
        well maybe gas or something
      

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.530

        would do as well.


00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.310

        But water, water is very, very
        different from this, because
      

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.530

        there is no alternative.


00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.050

        There is only water.


00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.480

        It is the essential ingredient
        of life.
      

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.920

        If you don't have water,
        you don't have life.

        When there was more water, once
        it subsided, people would
      

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.590

        plant squash, melons, corn.

        more fish since the river

        like alfalfa, and
      

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.180

        wheat, and many livestock.


00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.970

        It's a huge landscape
        of agribusiness.
      

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:01.480

        It's not agriculture.


00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.310

        It's agribusiness, on top of the
        former desert ecosystem.
      

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.260

        There is no living with
        the ecosystem.
      

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.900

        This is a place where resources
        are exploited, and
      

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.280

        the goods are taken elsewhere
        for market.
      

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.530

        So it's not a question of
        people needing water.
      

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.320

        It's a question of big business
        needing water.
      

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.800



00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.280

        Water belongs to the ecosystem
        from which it comes.
      

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.170

        That's the only way to look at
        water if we are to balance
      

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.840

        conservation of the ecosystem
        with use.
      

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.850

        Instead, people, especially in
        the United States, look upon
      

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.560

        water only as a commodity, only


00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.960

        something to use for profit.


00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.950

        And when that mentality is held
        up so high, you lose all
      

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.550

        other values.


00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.670

        I think it's time that we had
        a little drink of Gisborne
      

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.400

        Lake, very clear, cool water.


00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.670



00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.250

        That's a very good water.


00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.760

        There's no doubt.


00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.910

        I would recommend
        it to anybody.
      

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:08.640

        We do have to ask ourselves what
        we owe as a water-rich
      

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.200

        country to the rest
        of the world.
      

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.290

        We have to have that debate
        within the framework of water
      

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.000

        as part of the commons.


00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.210

        Should it be priced?


00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:16.660

        I don't know.


00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.890

        Let's talk about it, but not
        if it's going to some
      

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.170

        bottom-line investor to
        make a profit from.
      

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:23.890

        Should it be sold and traded?


00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.830

        No.


00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:25.940

        Should it be shared?


00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.000

        Maybe, but it should be shared
        on humanitarian grounds.
      

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.080

        What these corporations are
        talking about, what these

        businessmen are talking about,
        what the trade agreements are
      

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.240

        talking about, is taking water
        as a common good, to making it
      

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.100

        a private commodity and then
        controlling it and selling it
      

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:42.960

        for profit.


00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.850

        This means that that water

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.410

        corporations, or those cities,

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:07.680

        They've been denied the right
        to water as well.
      

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.550

        The little water that makes it
        this far is barely enough to
      

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.300

        with respect anymore.
      

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.190

        For us, water was something
        that is sacred.

        that it was good for
        the shareholders.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.290

        Often during his travels, the
        businessman would become very
      

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.120

        annoyed by the bothersome
        ability

        of plants to reproduce.


00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.060

        Then, an extraordinarily
        bold idea came to him.
      

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.810

        To put an end to this wasteful
        situation, the businessman
      

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:14.890

        decreed that from that time
        forward, seeds and all they
      

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.420

        begat would become

        It's all over again,
        the same as 1997.
      

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:33.080

        Look at all the canola plants
        that are growing here.
      

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.620

        One plant like this will produce
        from four to 10,000
      

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.850

        So this field, if I don't
        cultivate it or use some
      

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.340

        special chemical, it will
        be totally polluted with

        Ready canola.
      

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.970

        Monsanto can come out with a
        genetic-altered canola plant,
      

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.550

        put it into the environmental,
        damage and destroy my seed,
      

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.100

        and then get a lawsuit against
        because you're letting it grow
      

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.230

        on your land.


00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.230

        Because they ruled, it
        doesn't matter how it
      

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.180

        gets on your land.


00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.980

        pollinates, or falls off of

        give the seed and
      

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.450

        the plant to Monsanto.


00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.970

        How can I give millions and
        millions of plants in
      

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.870

        get the plants out
      

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.730

        and give it to Monsanto?


00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.980

        It's impossible.


00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:42.040

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.170

        permission to get a patent
        on a life-giving form?
      

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:55.500

        If we plant the seed the first
        time, when it reproduces, the
      

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.640

        second time, they should no
        longer have a claim to that.
      

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.430

        Because they didn't
        reproduce it.
      

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.010

        The farmer reproduced it.


00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.990

        And the farmer really
        didn't produce it.
      

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.170

        It was nature.


00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:13.810

        It was the sun, the soil, and
        basically an act of God.
      

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:17.040

        I can't make a seed grow.


00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.450

        Monsanto can't make
        a seed grow.
      

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.410

        Only nature can make
        a seed grow.
      

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.960



00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.630

        Whether or not you can invent
        life is a different question
      

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:32.520

        from whether or not you
        can invent a new seed.
      

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.480

        In order to be patentable, the
        subject matter, a new seed,
      

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:40.180

        must be new, it must be
        useful, and it must be
      

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.520

        non-obvious.


00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.370

        And it is certainly possible
        to develop innovations in
      

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.360

        seeds through a variety of
        techniques, including
      

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.190

        recombinant DNA and
        biotechnology, but
      

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:53.980

        not limited to those.


00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.700

        And if you want to increase
        innovation of that sort,
      

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.350

        patents are a very effective
        way of doing so.
      

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.680

        The multinational companies
        like Monsanto do not want
      

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.020

        farmers to use their own seed.


00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.540

        They want a farmer to
        come back and buy
      

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.380

        their seed every year.


00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.020

        Then you have to buy
        their chemicals.
      

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.540

        You've got to pay $15-an-acre
        technology charge.
      

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.270

        You got to sign an agreement
        that you never
      

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:16.920

        use your own seed.

        choose one seed over another.

        the freedom to choose.

        replant it more valuable to
        him or her, then the added
      

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.480

        value that he or she will get
        from planting seed that they

        purchase every year from a
        company which holds a patent,
      

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.790

        then they're free to do so.


00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:36.030

        They destroyed 53 years'
        work of seed

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.670

        And my seed was resistant to
        some of the diseases that we
      

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.530

        have here on the prairies
        in canola.
      

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.780

        All that is destroyed.

        the last three weeks.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.050

        And they laughed at me.


00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.880

        They said there is
        no such thing.
      

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.220

        They will not guarantee it.


00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:09.620

        The companies have succeeded
        in contaminating all the

        canola supplies in Canada.


00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.690

        So there is no such
        thing as choice.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.830

        Well, the idea that farmers have
        a choice under a system
      

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.740

        controlled by corporations
        is totally false.
      

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.260

        Because the corporations
        first ensure that
      

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.840

        farmers lose their seed.


00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.210

        They go into regions and buy
        up all the traditional
      

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:45.020

        varieties, then sell
        their own seed.
      

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.950

        They deliberately create
        a seed famine.
      

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:49.660

        And I have witnessed it, in
        regions where the corporations
      

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.350

        have entered in India, the
        creation of a seed famine
      

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:54.730

        crop is available.
      

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.940

        And the farmers have
        nothing left.
      

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.210

        In that condition, to say the
        farmers have a choice is as
      

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.930

        false as it is to tell a bonded
        laborer that they have
      

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.360

        a choice to go and
        work anywhere.

        self-sufficiency, go in

        nonetheless, carried this
      

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.940

        burden without understanding
        why.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.870

        By taking the test, I came away
        with answers about my
      

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.740

        family situation.


00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.280

        But I also hope it will
        contribute to the research
      

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.520

        being done in this area, the
        area of predictive medicine.

        Once you have the other
        blood sample--
      

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:13.430

        I was part of a Cancer Genetics
        Network, which is a
      

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:18.410

        grant-funded operation for eight
        cancer centers in the
      

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.670

        United States.


00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:22.310

        It's funded by National
        Cancer Institute.
      

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:26.420

        And my involvement in that
        project was to set up a core
      

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.660

        lab so that we can offer genetic
        testing for all the
      

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.790

        cancer sequencing of the genes
        for all the research projects
      

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.720

        that will go through this
        Cancer Genetics Network.
      

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.480

        And that definitely included
        BRCA1 and 2 testing also.
      

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.180

        But a year later, we got a
        letter from the company,
      

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.700

        Myriad Genetics, which has
        the patent on BRCA1 gene.
      

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.290

        They sent us this letter and
        saying that we are infringing
      

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:57.030

        on their patent,
        so we stopped.
      

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:01.730

        If you can come up with a method
        which is as good as
      

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:06.160

        sequencing but less expensive,
        there needs to be research
      

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.520

        that goes to develop
        such techniques.
      

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.590

        But at the moment, even if you
        come up with such a technique,
      

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.620

        you cannot use it.


00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.510

        Because you'll be stopped
        because of the patent.
      

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.630

        [SPEAKING FRENCH]


00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.220

        I think that a new and important
        debate is coming.
      

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.280

        This time it will be about
        using the sequence for

        prevention and treatment.

        perfects a drug that allows

        for the prevention of breast
        cancers, and specifically,
      

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.090

        cancers linked to an alteration
        of the BRCA1 gene,
      

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:45.250

        then Myriad would have rights
        over that invention.
      

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.290

        This patent has raised the
        entire issue of the patent

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:08.250

        To produce this drug at the end
        of this effort is about
      

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:09.980

        $500 million.

        involved in identifying the

        At the turn of the last century
        when the chemists were
      

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.050

        isolating the chemical elements
        in the periodic
      

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:33.800

        table, they and their companies
        put a lot of time
      

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.270

        and research into it.


00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.860

        But we didn't allow them to
        claim patents on the actual
      

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.010

        products in the periodic
        table.

        We allowed them process
        patents.
      

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:44.710

        Those are patents on the

        in nature.
      

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.740

        allowing a patent on

        helium, oxygen, aluminum,
        hydrogen, titan--

        Simply stated, these are
        discoveries of nature.

        The genes are exactly
        analogous.

        imagination can a biotech
      

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.620

        company say they invented a
        gene that's the result of
      

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.370

        millions of years
        of evolution?

        cystic fibrosis gene, the

        of money they put into
      

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.260

        it, it's not an invention.

        patient chooses to participate
        in that.
      

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.170

        It's their genetic material that
        the researchers study to
      

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:40.090

        find out what's the defect,
        what causes the disease.
      

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:44.380

        Now, if the patient is told at
        that point that, yes, today
      

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.560

        your blood will be used
        to find a gene

        corporations.


00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.010

        That's capitalist
        logic, right?
      

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:50.080

        So to a certain extent, we're
        trying to shatter this logic,
      

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:53.060

        because we know that it can't
        guarantee the well-being of
      

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:54.740

        the population in
        every respect.
      

00:44:54.740 --> 00:45:20.780



00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.770

        [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]


00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:29.240

        You can't consider drugs as
        simply consumer products.
      

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:33.540

        What we're trying to emphasize
        is that the prices, and
      

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:35.990

        particularly the profits
        of these big
      

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:39.110

        corporations, are overblown.


00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.530

        They have nothing at all to do
        with the real value of the
      

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:47.360

        product, even when profits and
        future investments are taken
      

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:48.750

        into account.


00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.850

        It's all out of proportion, and
        that's the real question.
      

00:45:51.850 --> 00:46:01.970



00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:05.840

        The businessman was becoming
        very irritated.
      

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.690

        Comments like these would be
        of serious concern to the
      

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:10.940

        shareholders.


00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:20.720



00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.720

        The time for rest had
        not yet come.
      

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:26.940

        The businessman knew he would
        have to do something to thwart
      

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.190

        the political institutions.


00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.980

        On the weekend, he held
        a great summit.
      

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:37.880

        Fearful of being left
        out, all the heads
      

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.120

        of state came running.


00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.390

        The meeting agenda, kept secret
        from the people, could
      

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.030

        not have been clearer.


00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:48.320

        Abolish all national regulations
        that might stand
      

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:49.910

        in the way of business.


00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.220

        And above all, force countries
        to surrender the
      

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:57.750

        responsibility for the common
        good to market forces, or face
      

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:00.860

        severe sanctions.


00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.840

        The Canadian government has
        agreed to pay $13 million in
      

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.830

        damages to the American company,
        Ethyl Corporation.
      

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:09.470

        Ethyl produces a gasoline
        additive that Canada has
      

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.600

        judged to be harmful
        to health.
      

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.050

        The American government will
        apply sanctions to the
      

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.990

        European Union following the
        ban on European imports of
      

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:19.680

        hormone-treated beef.


00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.080

        Courier UPS has accused Canada
        Post of unfair competition,
      

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:26.690

        and is suing the Canadian
        Government for $140 million.
      

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.820

        A UPS victory could impact
        the scope of all
      

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:31.080

        Canadian social programs.


00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.140

        The NAFTA Tribunal has ordered
        the Mexican Government to pay
      

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:38.680

        $16.5 million to Metalclad, an
        American company specializing
      

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.560

        in the burial of toxic waste.


00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.360

        What's happening with these
        trade agreements, and
      

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.860

        particularly these Chapter 11
        of NAFTA, where corporations
      

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.270

        can, for the first time, sue
        governments of another
      

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.810

        country, what's happening
        is it has created a
      

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:55.530

        constitutional body of law that
        overrides domestic law,
      

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.560

        including environmental, health,
        and safety laws.
      

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.090

        So governments are basically
        relinquishing their
      

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:06.320

        sovereignty and their right to
        establish regulations and
      

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.110

        standards, to provide social
        programs for their people, to
      

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:13.510

        transnational corporations
        and international trade
      

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.340

        agreements.


00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:16.130

        And basically, they can
        say, well, poor us.
      

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:17.030

        It wasn't our fault.


00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.650

        Of course, we got elected
        promising to keep public
      

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:20.120

        health care.


00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.400

        But alas, we had to lose
        it through these trade
      

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.650

        agreements.


00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:35.800



00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:39.250

        If we continue to enclose all
        of the great ecological
      

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:43.070

        comments into property owned
        by a few companies, we risk
      

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:45.760

        increasing geopolitical
        tensions, increasing
      

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.940

        possibilities of war, increasing
        reduction of the
      

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.050

        Earth to utility and just
        to resource management.
      

00:48:53.050 --> 00:48:54.370

        What I'm saying here,
        I want to be
      

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:56.870

        clear, is we need balance.


00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.720

        I believe we have to
        have commerce.
      

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.860

        I believe that we need
        to have a market.
      

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.200

        But it can't be the sole arbiter
        for how we relate to
      

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:08.350

        each other, our common nature,
        and the Earth we live in.
      

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.600

        When commerce becomes a sole
        arbiter, then we end up to be
      

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.690

        just a crass, commercial,
        utilitarian-based
      

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:15.780

        civilization.


00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.160

        We lose our humanity.


00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.430

        We lose our intimacy.


00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.090

        We lose our empathy.


00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:21.580

        We lose what makes
        life important.
      

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:29.490



00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:33.010

        If good is not common, if
        there's no common good, and
      

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.110

        there's only private good, that
        private good is hurting
      

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.110

        someone somewhere
        on this planet,
      

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:39.670

        some species somewhere.


00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:43.820

        When humanity works and does
        agriculture as if it's the
      

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:47.110

        only community that has to be
        fed, and works against the
      

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.690

        common good of other species,
        we get non-sustainable
      

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:50.480

        agriculture.


00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:53.150

        We eventually undermine
        our own food security.
      

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:55.200

        Common good is the result
        of give and take.
      

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.160

        It's a result of reciprocity.


00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:59.160

        It's a result of mutuality.


00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.470

        Forgetting the common
        good is a result of
      

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:04.090

        grabbing, piracy, and theft.


00:50:04.090 --> 00:50:05.670

        And of course, some
        people prosper.
      

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.980

        But they prosper at the cost of
        others, and they prosper at
      

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.160

        the cost of the planet.


00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.050

        That kind of prosperity
        is not prosperity.
      

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:17.150



00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.590

        I believe that if we do not
        maintain the concept of a
      

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:24.140

        commons, that our collective
        interests are served through
      

00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.180

        institutions that see us as
        more than our individual
      

00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:31.380

        selves but as a sum of something
        larger, if we don't
      

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.490

        see natural resources in nature
        as something that
      

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:38.110

        belongs to the Earth and all
        humanity, if we don't see that
      

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.710

        we have certain fundamental
        rights as human beings and
      

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:44.220

        citizens to have social
        services, social programs, if
      

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.630

        we lose that notion of the
        commons, I think we're going
      

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:50.510

        to find a world in which
        nothing is valued
      

00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:51.820

        except if it has money.


00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.750

        And in that kind of
        world, many, many,
      

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:54.750

        many people will die.


00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.980

        Many people are dying, because
        only those who can afford to
      

00:50:57.980 --> 00:50:59.220

        live in that system--


00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:02.950

        can buy a clean environment, can
        buy clean water, can buy
      

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:05.580

        the kind of food that the rest
        of the world doesn't have--
      

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.500

        only those people will live.


00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.660

        So the keeping of the commons is
        not only a keeping of a set
      

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:14.970

        of values and of a heritage, but
        without a commons, without
      

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:16.490

        the notion of a commons,
        we won't survive.
      

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:25.970



00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:30.570

        That day, the invisible hand
        of the market showed itself
      

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:31.820
