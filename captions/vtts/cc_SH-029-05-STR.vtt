00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100


2
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.570
I'll disrobe me

3
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.570
Of these Italian weedsand suit myself

4
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.670
As does a Briton peasant:so I'll fight

5
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.770
Against the part I comewith; so I'll die

6
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.270
For thee, O Imogen, evenfor whom my life

7
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.830
Is every breath a death;and thus, unknown,

8
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.800
Pitied nor hated, to theface of peril

9
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.200
Myself I'll dedicate.

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.530
Let me make men know

11
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.400
More valour in me than myhabits show.

12
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.030
Gods, put the strength o'the Leonati in me!

13
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.400
To shame the guise o' theworld, I will begin

14
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.970
The fashion, less withoutand more within.

15
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.230
The noise is roundabout us.

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.270
Let us from it.

17
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.500
What pleasure, sir, find wein life, to lock it

18
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.930
From action and adventure?

19
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.500
Nay, what hope

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.700
Have we in hiding us?

21
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.330
We'll higher to themountains; there secure us.

22
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.900
To the king's party there'sno going:

23
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.230
This is, sir, a doubt

24
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.670
In such a time nothing becomingyou,

25
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.030
Nor satisfying us.

26
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.830
It is not likely

27
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.130
That when they hear the Romanhorses neigh,

28
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.470
Behold their quarter'd fires,have both their eyes

29
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.970
And ears so cloy'd importantlyas now,

30
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.270
That they will waste their timeupon our note,

31
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.170
To know from whence we are.

32
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.100
O, I am known

33
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.030
Of many in the army:many years,

34
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.830
Though Cloten then but young,you see, not wore him

35
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.700
From my remembrance.

36
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.600
Pray, sir, to the army:

37
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.430
I and my brother arenot known; yourself

38
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.470
So out of thought, andthereto so o'ergrown,

39
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.970
Cannot be question'd.

40
00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.100
By this sun that shines,

41
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.670
I'll thither: what thing is itthat I never

42
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.670
Did see man die! scarce everlook'd on blood,

43
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.030
But that of coward hares, hotgoats, and venison!

44
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.170
Never bestrid a horse,save one that had

45
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.670
A rider like myself, who ne'erwore rowel

46
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.330
Nor iron on his heel! I amashamed

47
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.930
To look upon the holy sun,to have

48
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.530
The benefit of his blestbeams, remaining

49
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.400
So long a poor unknown.

50
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.200
By heavens, I'll go:

51
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.170
If you will bless me, sir, andgive me leave,

52
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.070
I'll take the better care, butif you will not,

53
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.970
The hazard thereforedue fall on me

54
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.800
by the hands of Romans!

55
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.500
So say I amen.

56
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730
No reason I, since of your livesyou set

57
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.930
So slight a valuation, shouldreserve

58
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.570
My crack'd one to more care.Have with you, boys!

59
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.870
If in your country wars youchance to die,

60
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.470
That is my bed too, lads, anthere I'll lie:

61
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.670
Camest thou from wherethey made the stand?

62
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.000
I did.

63
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.770
Though you, it seems, comefrom the fliers.

64
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.500
I did.

65
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.870
No blame be to you, sir;for all was lost,

66
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.430
But that the heavensfought: the king himself

67
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.600
Of his wings destitute,the army broken,

68
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.970
And but the backs ofBritons seen, all flying

69
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.500
Through a straight lane;the enemy full-hearted,

70
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.100
Lolling the tongue withslaughtering, having work

71
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.670
More plentiful than toolsto do't, struck down

72
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.900
Some mortally, some slightlytouch'd, some falling

73
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.600
Merely through fear; thatthe straight pass was damm'd

74
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.970
With dead men hurt behind,and cowards living

75
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.270
To die with lengthen'dshame.

76
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.930
Where was this lane?

77
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.630
Close by the battle, ditch'd,and wall'd with turf;

78
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.070
Which gave advantage to anancient soldier,

79
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.870
An honest one, I warrant;who deserved

80
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.470
So long a breeding as hiswhite beard came to,

81
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.800
In doing this for'scountry: athwart the lane,

82
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.670
He, with two striplings-ladsmore like to run

83
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.100
The country base than tocommit such slaughter

84
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.070
With faces fit for masks,or rather fairer

85
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.700
Than those for preservationcased, or shame--

86
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.630
Made good the passage;cried to those that fled,

87
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.000
'Our Britain s harts dieflying, not our men:

88
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.900
To darkness fleet soulsthat fly backwards. Stand;

89
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.000
Or we are Romans and willgive you that

90
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.270
Like beasts which you shunbeastly, and may save,

91
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.230
But to look back in frown:stand, stand.'

92
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.870
These three,

93
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.530
Three thousand confident,in act as many--

94
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.470
For three performers arethe file when all

95
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.030
The rest do nothing--withthis word 'Stand, stand,'

96
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.730
Accommodated by the place,more charming

97
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.570
With their own nobleness,which could have turn'd

98
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.100
A distaff to a lance,gilded pale looks,

99
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.830
Part shame, part spiritrenew'd; that some,

100
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:47.600
turn'd coward

101
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.300
But by example--O, a sinin war,

102
00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.600
Damn'd in the firstbeginners!--gan to look

103
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.970
The way that they did, andto grin like lions

104
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.300
Upon the pikes o' thehunters.

105
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.100
This was strange chance

106
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.430
A narrow lane, an old man,and two boys.

107
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.330
Nay, do not wonder at it:you are made

108
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.670
Rather to wonder at thethings you hear

109
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.300
Than to work any. Will yourhyme upon't,

110
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.200
And vent it for a mockery?Here is one:

111
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.600
'Two boys, an old mantwice a boy, a lane,

112
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.230
Preserved the Britons, wasthe Romans' bane.'

113
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.630
Nay, be not angry, sir.

114
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.800
'Lack, to what end?

115
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.370
Who dares not stand hisfoe, I'll be his friend;

116
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.130
For if he'll do as he ismade to do,

117
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.000
I know he'll quickly flymy friendship too.

118
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.670
You have put me intorhyme.

119
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.970
Farewell; you're angry.

120
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.230
Still going?

121
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.470
This is a lord! O noblemisery,

122
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.370
To be i' the field, andask 'what news?' of me!

123
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.270
To-day how many would havegiven their honours

124
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.930
To have saved theircarcasses! took heel to do't,

125
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:21.330
And yet died too! I, inmine own woe charm'd,

126
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.130
Could not find death whereI did hear him groan,

127
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.700
Nor feel him where hestruck:

128
00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.670
being an ugly monster,

129
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:39.600
'Tis strange he hides himin fresh cups, soft beds,

130
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.530
Sweet words; or hath moreministers than we

131
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.270
That draw his knives i'the war.

132
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.900
Well, I will find him

133
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.070
For being now a favourerto the Briton,

134
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.530
No more a Briton, I haveresumed again

135
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.970
The part I came in: fightI will no more,

136
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.770
But yield me to theveriest hind that shall

137
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.900
Once touch my shoulder.

138
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.300
Great the slaughter is

139
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.100
Here made by the Roman;great the answer be

140
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:19.630
Britons must take. For me,my ransom's death;

141
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.770
On either side I come tospend my breath;

142
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.230
Which neither here I'llkeep nor bear again,

143
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.970
But end it by some meansfor Imogen.

144
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.030
Stand! who's there?

145
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.230
A Roman,

146
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.930
Lay hands on him; a dog!

147
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.970
You shall not now bestol'n,

148
00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.900
you have locks upon you;

149
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:03.100
Most welcome, bondage! forthou art away,

150
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:09.700
I think, to liberty: yet amI better

151
00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.170
Than one that's sick o'the gout;

152
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.030
since he had rather

153
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.800
Groan so in perpetuitythan be cured

154
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.100
By the sure physician,death, who is the key

155
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.070
To unbar these locks.

156
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.300
My conscience, thou artfetter'd

157
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.170
More than my shanks andwrists:

158
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.800
you good gods, give me

159
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.030
The penitent instrument topick that bolt,

160
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:44.030
Then, free for ever! Is'tenough I am sorry?

161
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.670
So children temporalfathers do appease;

162
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:55.630
Gods are more full ofmercy. Must I repent?

163
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.270
I cannot do it better thanin gyves,

164
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:03.170
Desired more thanconstrain'd: to satisfy,

165
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:06.200
If of my freedom 'tis themain part, take

166
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.570
No stricter render of methan my all.

167
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.200
I know you are moreclement than vile men,

168
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.200
Who of their brokendebtors take a third,

169
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.800
A sixth, a tenth, lettingthem thrive again

170
00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:21.670
On their abatement: that'snot my desire:

171
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:30.900
For Imogen's dear lifetake mine; and though

172
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:37.170
'Tis not so dear, yet 'tisa life; you coin'd it:

173
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.830
'Tween man and man theyweigh not every stamp;

174
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.500
Though light, take piecesfor the figure's sake:

175
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.730
You rather mine, beingyours: and so, great powers,

176
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.570
If you will take thisaudit, take this life,

177
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.570
And cancel these coldbonds.

178
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.130
O Imogen!

179
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.100
I'll speak to thee insilence.

180
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.070
No more, thouthunder-master, show

181
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.670
Thy spite on mortal flies:

182
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.230
With Mars fall out, withJuno chide,

183
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.070
That thy adulteries

184
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.530
Rates and revenges.

185
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:37.400
Hath my poor boy doneaught but well,

186
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.400
Whose face I never saw?

187
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.930
I died whilst in the wombhe stay'd

188
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.270
Attending nature's law:

189
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.030
Lucina lent not me heraid,

190
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.570
But took me in my throes;

191
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.300
That from me was Posthumusript,

192
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:57.030
Came crying 'mongst hisfoes,

193
00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.330
A thing of pity!

194
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:04.900
With marriage whereforewas he mock'd,

195
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.300
To be exiled, and thrown

196
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.230
From Leonati seat, andcast

197
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:10.130
From her his dearest one,

198
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.000
Sweet Imogen?

199
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.770
Why did you sufferIachimo,

200
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.930
Slight thing of Italy,

201
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.230
To taint his nobler heartand brain

202
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.200
With needless jealosy;

203
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.570
And to become the geck andscorn

204
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.600
O' th' other's villany?

205
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.800
Since, Jupiter, our son isgood,

206
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.670
Take off his miseries.

207
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:36.070
Peep through thy marblemansion; help;

208
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.470
Or we poor ghosts will cry

209
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.930
To the shining synod ofthe rest

210
00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:43.670
Against thy deity.

211
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.270
Help, Jupiter; or weappeal,

212
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.300
And from thy justice fly.

213
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.870
No more, you petty spiritsof region low,

214
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:59.930
Offend our hearing; hush!How dare you ghosts

215
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.570
Accuse the thunderer,whose bolt, you know,

216
00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:10.070
Sky-planted batters allrebelling coasts?

217
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.930
Poor shadows of Elysium,hence, and rest

218
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.530
Upon your never-witheringbanks of flowers:

219
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.630
Be not with mortalaccidents opprest;

220
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:25.070
No care of yours it is;you know 'tis ours.

221
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.970
Whom best I love I cross;to make my gift,

222
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:36.630
The more delay'd,delighted. Be content;

223
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.270
Your low-laid son ourgodhead will uplift:

224
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.770
His comforts thrive, histrials well are spent.

225
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.370
Our Jovial star reign'd athis birth, and in

226
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:55.470
Our temple was he married.Rise, and fade.

227
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.770
He shall be lord of ladyImogen,

228
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:02.530
And happier much by hisaffliction made.

229
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:09.630
This tablet lay upon hisbreast, wherein

230
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.930
Our pleasure his fullfortune doth confine:

231
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:18.030
and so, away: no furtherwith your din

232
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.770
Express impatience, lestyou stir up mine.

233
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:31.130
Sleep, thou hast been agrandsire, and begot

234
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.230
A father to me; and thouhast created

235
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:38.070
A mother and two brothers:

236
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.330
but, O scorn!

237
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.030
Gone! they went hence sosoon as they were born:

238
00:13:55.030 --> 00:14:01.570
And so I am awake. Poorwretches that depend

239
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.530
On greatness' favour dreamas I have done,

240
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.730
Wake and find nothing.But, alas, I swerve:

241
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.330
Many dream not to find,neither deserve,

242
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:15.600
And yet are steep'd infavours: so am I,

243
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:20.170
That have this goldenchance and know not why.

244
00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:36.030
What fairies haunt thisground? A book? O rare one!

245
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.830
Be not, as is our fangledworld, a garment

246
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.030
Nobler than that itcovers: let thy effects

247
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.900
So follow, to be mostunlike our courtiers,

248
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.870
As good as promise.

249
00:14:55.500 --> 00:15:02.630
'When as a lion's whelpshall, to himself unknown,

250
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:07.330
without seeking find, andbe embraced by a piece of

251
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:13.100
tender air; and when froma stately cedar shall be

252
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.670
lopped branches, which,being dead many years,

253
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.330
shall after revive, bejointed to the old stock

254
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:29.300
and freshly grow; then shallPosthumus end his miseries,

255
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:35.430
Britain be fortunate andflourish in peace and plenty.'

256
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.870
'Tis still a dream, orelse such stuff as madmen

257
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:46.300
Tongue and brain not;either both or nothing;

258
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:50.000
Or senseless speaking or aspeaking such

259
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.930
As sense cannot untie. Bewhat it is,

260
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:02.000
The action of mylife is like it,

261
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:07.270
which I'll keep, ifbut for sympathy.

262
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.930
Come, sir, are you readyfor death?

263
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:13.730
Over-roasted rather; readylong ago.

264
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.270
Hanging is the word, sir:

265
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.900
if you be ready for that,you are well cooked.

266
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.700
So, if I prove a goodrepast to the spectators,

267
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.930
the dish pays the shot.

268
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.030
A heavy reckoning for you,sir. But the comfort is,

269
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.530
you shall be calledto no more payments,

270
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.370
fear no more tavern-bills;which are often the sadness

271
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.600
of parting, as theprocuring of mirth:

272
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.030
of this contradictionyou shall now be quit.

273
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.130
O, the charity of a pennycord!

274
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.870
Knock off his manacles;

275
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.230
bring your prisoner tothe king.

276
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:53.700
Thou bring'st good news; Iam called to be made free.

277
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.200
I'll be hang'd then.

278
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:59.330
Stand by my side, you whomthe gods have made

279
00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:03.670
Preservers of my throne.Woe is my heart

280
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.000
That the poor soldier thatso richly fought,

281
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.570
Whose rags shamed gildedarms, whose naked breast

282
00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:17.070
Stepp'd before larges ofproof, cannot be found:

283
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.800
He shall be happy that canfind him, if

284
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.300
Our grace can make him so.

285
00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.100
I never saw

286
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.200
Such noble fury in so poora thing;

287
00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.600
Such precious deeds in onethat promises nought

288
00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.900
But beggary and poorlooks.

289
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.670
No tidings of him?

290
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:33.900
He hath been search'damong the dead and living,

291
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.930
But no trace of him.

292
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.930
To my grief, I am

293
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.230
The heir of his reward;

294
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:42.570
which I will add

295
00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.370
To you, the liver, heartand brain of Britain,

296
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:51.270
By whom I grant she lives.'Tis now the time

297
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.970
To ask of whence you are.Report it.

298
00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:55.830
Sir,

299
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:58.370
In Cambria are we born,and gentlemen:

300
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:01.500
Further to boast wereneither true nor modest,

301
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.830
Unless I add, we arehonest.

302
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:06.470
Bow your knees.

303
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:17.030
Arise my knights o' thebattle: I create you

304
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.470
Companions to our personand will fit you

305
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:25.000
With dignities becomingyour estates.

306
00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:33.600
There's business in thesefaces. Why so sadly

307
00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.170
Greet you our victory? youlook like Romans,

308
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.530
And not o' the court ofBritain.

309
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:39.830
Hail, great king!

310
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.930
To sour your happiness, Imust report

311
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.030
The queen is dead.

312
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.300
Who worse than a physician

313
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:59.170
Would this report become?But I consider,

314
00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.130
By medicine life may beprolong'd, yet death

315
00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:11.000
Will seize the doctor too.How ended she?

316
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.170
With horror, madly dying,like her life,

317
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.530
Which, being cruel to theworld, concluded

318
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.730
Most cruel to herself.What she confess'd

319
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:22.370
I will report, so pleaseyou: these her women

320
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.900
Can trip me, if I err; whowith wet cheeks

321
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.430
Were present when shefinish'd.

322
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.230
Prithee, say.

323
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.270
First, she confess'd shenever loved you, only

324
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.600
Affected greatness got byyou, not you:

325
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.500
Married your royalty, waswife to your place;

326
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.470
Abhorr'd your person.

327
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.600
She alone knew this;

328
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.300
And, but she spoke itdying, I would not

329
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:53.030
Believe her lips inopening it. Proceed.

330
00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:55.630
Your daughter, whom shebore in hand to love

331
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:58.070
With such integrity, shedid confess

332
00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.830
Was as a scorpion to hersight; whose life,

333
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.270
But that her flightprevented it, she had

334
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.200
Ta'en off by poison.

335
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.200
O most delicate fiend!

336
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:17.070
Who is 't can read awoman? Is there more?

337
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.500
More, sir, and worse. Shedid confess she had

338
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.800
For you a mortal mineral;which, being took,

339
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.830
Should by the minute feedon life and lingering

340
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.430
By inches waste you: inwhich time she purposed,

341
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.770
By watching, weeping,tendance, kissing, to

342
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.770
O'ercome you with hershow, and in time,

343
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.470
When she had fitted youwith her craft, to work

344
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.200
Her son into the adoptionof the crown:

345
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.930
Heard you all this, herwomen?

346
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.300
We did, so please yourhighness.

347
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:56.500
Mine eyes

348
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.730
Were not in fault, for shewas beautiful;

349
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:12.230
Mine ears, that heard herflattery; nor my heart,

350
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.700
That thought herlike her seeming;

351
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.600
it had been vicious

352
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:26.830
To have mistrusted her:yet, O my daughter!

353
00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:30.400
That it was folly in me,thou mayst say,

354
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:40.170
And prove it in thyfeeling. Heaven mend all!

355
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.430
Thou comest not, Caius,now for tribute

356
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:00.100
Consider, sir, the chanceof war: the day

357
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:04.970
Was yours by accident; hadit gone with us,

358
00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:07.000
We should not, when theblood was cool,

359
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.070
have threaten'd

360
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.970
Our prisoners with thesword. But since the gods

361
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.330
Will have it thus, thatnothing but our lives

362
00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.670
May be call'd ransom, letit come: sufficeth

363
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.400
A Roman with a Roman'sheart can suffer:

364
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.600
Augustus lives to thinkon't: and so much

365
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.600
For my peculiar care.

366
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:30.600
This one thing only

367
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.930
I will entreat; my boy, aBriton born,

368
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.930
Let him be ransom'd:

369
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.100
never master had a page sokind, so duteous, diligent,

370
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.570
So tender over hisoccasions, true,

371
00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:53.430
So feat, so nurse-like:let his virtue join

372
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.030
With my request, which Imake bold your highness

373
00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.470
Cannot deny; he hath doneno Briton harm,

374
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.070
Though he have served aRoman: save him, sir,

375
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.430
And spare no blood beside.

376
00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.470
I have surely seen him:

377
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.530
His favour is familiarto me.

378
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:20.000
Boy, Thou hast look'dthyself into my grace,

379
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.700
And art mine own. I knownot why, wherefore,

380
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:30.670
To say 'live, boy:' ne'erthank thy master; live:

381
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.770
And ask of Cymbeline whatboon thou wilt,

382
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:37.030
Fitting my bounty and thystate, I'll give it;

383
00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.070
Yea, though thou do demanda prisoner,

384
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.930
The noblest ta'en.

385
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.470
I humbly thank yourhighness.

386
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.230
I do not bid thee beg mylife, good lad;

387
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.300
And yet I know thou wilt.

388
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.070
No, no: alack,

389
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.830
There's other work inhand: I see a thing

390
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:50.330
Bitter to me as death:your life, good master,

391
00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:51.900
Must shuffle for itself.

392
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:53.230
The boy disdains me,

393
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.670
He leaves me, scorns me:briefly die their joys

394
00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.470
That place them on thetruth of girls and boys.

395
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:04.630
What wouldst thou, boy?Speak.

396
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.200
Know'st him thou look'ston?

397
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.070
Is he thy kin? thy friend?

398
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.930
He is a Roman; no more kinto me

399
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.930
Than I to your highness;who, being born your vassal,

400
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.570
Am something nearer.

401
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.430
Wherefore eyest him so?

402
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.830
I'll tell you, sir, inprivate, if you please

403
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.430
To give me hearing.

404
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:21.470
Ay, with all my heart,

405
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.400
And lend my best attention.What's thy name?

406
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.900
Fidele, sir.

407
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.100
Thou'rt my good youth, mypage;

408
00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.470
I'll be thy master: walkwith me; speak freely.

409
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.900
Is not this boy revivedfrom death?

410
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:37.770
One sand another

411
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:39.430
Not more resembles thatsweet rosy lad

412
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.470
Who died, and was Fidele.What think you?

413
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.700
The same dead thing alive.

414
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.100
Peace, peace! see further;he eyes us not; forbear;

415
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.630
It is my mistress:

416
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:52.370
Since she is living, letthe time run on

417
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.000
To good or bad.

418
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.200
Stand thou by ourside;

419
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.570
Make thy demand aloud.

420
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.230
Sir, step you forth;

421
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.870
Give answer to this boy,and do it freely;

422
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.900
Or, by our greatness andthe grace of it,

423
00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:16.070
Which is our honour,bitter torture shall

424
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.130
Winnow the truthfrom falsehood.

425
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.870
On, speak to him.

426
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:24.900
My boon is, that thisgentleman may render

427
00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.970
Of whom he had this ring.

428
00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:28.170
What's that to him?

429
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:30.670
That diamond upon yourfinger, say

430
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.530
How came it yours?

431
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.530
Thou'lt torture me toleave unspoken that

432
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.430
Which, to be spoke, wouldtorture thee.

433
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.100
How! me?

434
00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.500
I am glad to beconstrain'd to utter that

435
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.230
Which torments me toconceal.

436
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:52.930
By villany I got this ring:'twas Leonatus' jewel;

437
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.070
Whom thou didst banish;

438
00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.470
and--which moremay grieve thee,

439
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.630
As it doth me--a noblersir ne'er lived

440
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.900
'Twixt sky and ground. Wiltthou hear more, my lord?

441
00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.030
All that belongs to this.

442
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.870
That paragon, thydaughter,--

443
00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.430
For whom my heart dropsblood, and my false spirits

444
00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:21.370
Quail to remember--Give meleave; I faint.

445
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.200
My daughter! what of her?Renew thy strength:

446
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.870
I had rather thou shouldstlive while nature will

447
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:30.430
Than die ere I hear more:strive, man, and speak.

448
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:34.670
Upon a time,--unhappy wasthe clock

449
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:38.570
That struck the hour!--itwas in Rome,--accursed

450
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:43.900
The mansion where!--'twasat a feast,--O, would

451
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.600
Our viands had beenpoison'd, or at least

452
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.370
Those which I heaved tohead!

453
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:50.570
--the good Posthumus--

454
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:56.370
What should I say? he wastoo good to be

455
00:26:56.370 --> 00:27:00.400
Where ill men were; andwas the best of all

456
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.000
Amongst the rarest of goodones,--sitting sadly,

457
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.700
Hearing us praise ourloves of Italy

458
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.470
For beauty that madebarren the swell'd boast

459
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.670
Of him that best couldspeak, for feature, laming

460
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.930
The shrine of Venus, orstraight-pight Minerva.

461
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.300
Postures beyond briefnature, for condition,

462
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.830
A shop of all thequalities that man

463
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.830
Loves woman for, besidesthat hook of wiving,

464
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.270
Fairness which strikes theeye--

465
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.500
I stand on fire:

466
00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.970
Come to the matter.

467
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.500
All too soon I shall,

468
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.270
Unless thou wouldst grievequickly.

469
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.170
This Posthumus,

470
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:37.730
Most like a noble lord inlove and one

471
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.030
That had a royal lover,took his hint;

472
00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.530
And, not dispraising whomwe praised,--therein

473
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.300
He was as calm asvirtue--he began

474
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.030
His mistress' picture;which by his tongue

475
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:47.970
being made,

476
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:51.070
And then a mind put in't,either our brags

477
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:52.370
Were crack'd ofkitchen-trolls,

478
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.000
or his description Provedus unspeaking sots.

479
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.200
Nay, nay, to the purpose.

480
00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.400
Your daughter'schastity--there it begins.

481
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.170
He spake of her, as Dianhad hot dreams,

482
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:11.800
And she alone were cold:whereat I, wretch,

483
00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800
Made scruple of his praise;and wager'd with him

484
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:17.670
Pieces of gold 'gainstthis which then he wore

485
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:19.400
Upon his honour'd finger,to attain

486
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.700
In suit the place of's bedand win this ring

487
00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.600
By hers and mine adultery.

488
00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.970
He, true knight,

489
00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.470
No lesser of her honourconfident

490
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.170
Than I did truly find her,stakes this ring;

491
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.770
And would so, had it beena carbuncle

492
00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.400
Of Phoebus' wheel, andmight so safely, had it

493
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.200
Been all the worth of'scar.

494
00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:40.700
Away to Britain

495
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.070
Post I in this design:well may you, sir,

496
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.000
Remember me at court;where I was taught

497
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.430
Of your chaste daughterthe wide difference

498
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.000
'Twixt amorous andvillanous.

499
00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.200
Being thus quench'd

500
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.830
Of hope, not longing, mineItalian brain

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:09.130
and be villany lessthan 'twas!

533
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:12.000
O Imogen!

534
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.430
My queen, my life, mywife! O Imogen,

535
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:24.670
Imogen, Imogen!

536
00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:32.000
Peace, my lord; hear,hear--

537
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.430
Shall's have a play ofthis? Thou scornful page,

538
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.430
There lie thy part.

539
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.200
O, gentlemen, help!

540
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.670
Mine and your mistress! O,my lord Posthumus!

541
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.870
You ne'er kill'd Imogentil now. Help, help!

542
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:48.200
Mine honour'd lady!

543
00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.830
Does the world go round?

544
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:52.170
How come these staggers onme?

545
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.670
Wake, my mistress!

546
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.700
If this be so, the gods domean to strike me

547
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.130
To death with mortal joy.

548
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.800
How fares thy mistress?

549
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.370
O, get thee from my sight;

550
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:07.530
Thou gavest me poison:dangerous fellow, hence!

551
00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.270
Breathe not where princesare.

552
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:10.330
The tune of Imogen!

553
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.470
Lady,

554
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.400
The gods throw stonesof sulphur on me,

555
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.970
if that box I gave youwas not thought by me

556
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.800
A precious thing: I had itfrom the queen.

557
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.300
It poison'd me.

558
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.530
O gods!

559
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.300
I left out one thing whichthe queen confess'd.

560
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.830
Which must approve theehonest: 'If Pisanio

561
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.200
Have,' said she, 'given hismistress that confection

562
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.670
Which I gave him forcordial, she is served

563
00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.030
As I would serve a rat.'

564
00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.400
Have you ta'en of it?

565
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.400
Most like I did, for I wasdead.

566
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.370
My boys, There was ourerror.

567
00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:41.900
This is, sure, Fidele.

568
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.070
Why did you throw yourwedded lady from you?

569
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.530
Think that you are upon arock;

570
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:50.800
and now throw me again.

571
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.230
Hang there like a fruit,my soul,

572
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.500
Till the tree die!

573
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.870
How now, my flesh, mychild!

574
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:04.270
What, makest thou me adullard in this act?

575
00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:06.470
Wilt thou not speak to me?

576
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.630
Your blessing, sir.

577
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.830
My tears that fall

578
00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.730
Prove holy water on thee!

579
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.230
Imogen, Thy mother's dead.

580
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.100
I am sorry for't, my lord.

581
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.570
O, she was nought; andlong of her it was

582
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:31.400
That we meet here sostrangely: but her son

583
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.570
Is gone, we know not hownor where.

584
00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.000
My lord,

585
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.200
Now fear is from me, I'llspeak troth. Lord Cloten,

586
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.770
Upon my lady's missing,came to me

587
00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.130
With his sword drawn; foam'dat the mouth, and swore,

588
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.800
If I discover'd not whichway she was gone,

589
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.270
It was my instant death.

590
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.270
By accident, had a feignedletter of my master's

591
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.600
Then in my pocket; whichdirected him

592
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.900
To seek her on themountains near to Milford;

593
00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.470
Where, in a frenzy, in mymaster's garments,

594
00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.430
Which he enforced from me,away he posts

595
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:06.330
With unchaste purpose andwith oath to violate

596
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.900
My lady's honour: whatbecame of him

597
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.200
I further know not.

598
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.230
Let me end the story:

599
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.800
I slew him there.

600
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.670
Marry, the gods forfend!

601
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:19.270
I would not thy good deedsshould from my lips

602
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:22.430
Pluck a bard sentence:prithee, valiant youth,

603
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:23.430
Deny't again.

604
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.030
I have spoke it, and Idid it.

605
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:26.000
He was a prince.

606
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.400
A most incivil one: thewrongs he did me

607
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.170
Were nothing prince-like;for he did provoke me

608
00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.430
With language that wouldmake me spurn the sea,

609
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:38.900
If it could so roar to me:I cut off's head;

610
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.800
And am right glad he isnot standing here

611
00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.400
To tell this tale of mine.

612
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.330
I am sorry for thee:

613
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.330
By thine own tonguethou art condemn'd,

614
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.470
and must endure ourlaw.

615
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:47.370
Bind the offender,

616
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.730
And take him from ourpresence.

617
00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.530
Stay, sir king:

618
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.770
This man is better thanthe man he slew,

619
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.330
As well descended asthyself; and hath

620
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.730
More of thee merited thana band of Clotens

621
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.900
Had ever scar for.

622
00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:00.530
Let his arms alone;

623
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.230
They were not born forbondage.

624
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.430
Why, old soldier,

625
00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:10.200
Wilt thou undo the worththou art unpaid for,

626
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.430
By tasting of our wrath?

627
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.970
How of descent as goodas we?

628
00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:16.470
In that he spake too far.

629
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.030
And thou shalt die for't.

630
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.870
We will die all three:

631
00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.900
But I will prove that twoon's are as good

632
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:26.070
As I have given out him.

633
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:29.000
My sons, I must,

634
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.200
For mine own part, unfolda dangerous speech,

635
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.900
Though, haply, well foryou.

636
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.770
Your danger's ours.

637
00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.770
And our good his.

638
00:35:37.770 --> 00:35:39.800
Have at it then, by leave.

639
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:44.700
Thou hadst, great king, asubject who

640
00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.730
Was call'd Belarius.

641
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:47.970
What of him?

642
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.600
He is a banish'd traitor.

643
00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.670
He it is that hath

644
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.100
Assumed this age; indeed abanish'd man;

645
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.630
I know not how a traitor.

646
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:57.900
Take him hence:

647
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.270
The whole world shall notsave him.

648
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.700
Not too hot:

649
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.630
First pay me for thenursing of thy sons;

650
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:09.100
And let it be confiscateall, so soon

651
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.000
As I have received it.

652
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Nursing of my sons!

653
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:22.230
I am too blunt and saucy:here's my knee:

654
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:26.370
Ere I arise, I will prefermy sons;

655
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:32.730
Then spare not the oldfather. Mighty sir,

656
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:37.500
These two young gentlemen,that call me father

657
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.830
And think they are mysons, are none of mine;

658
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.330
They are the issue of yourloins, my liege,

659
00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.900
And blood of yourbegetting.

660
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.630
How! my issue!

661
00:36:54.630 --> 00:37:00.530
So sure as you yourfather's. I, old Morgan,

662
00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:05.470
Am that Belarius whom yousometime banish'd:

663
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:07.170
These gentle princes--

664
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:11.700
For such and so theyare--these twenty years

665
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.370
Have I train'd up: thosearts they have as I

666
00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:19.270
Could put into them; mybreeding was, sir, as

667
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:24.700
Your highness knows. Theirnurse, Euriphile,

668
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.030
Whom for the theft Iwedded,

669
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:30.000
stole these children

670
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.430
Upon my banishment: Imoved her to't,

671
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.530
Having received thepunishment before,

672
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:42.000
For that which I did then:beaten for loyalty

673
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.700
Excited me to treason:their dear loss,

674
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.700
The more of you 'twasfelt, the more it shaped

675
00:37:51.700 --> 00:38:01.730
Unto my end of stealingthem. But, gracious sir,

676
00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:07.300
Here are your sons again;and I must lose

677
00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.830
Two of the sweet'stcompanions in the world.

678
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.130
The benediction of thesecovering heavens

679
00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.500
Fall on their heads likedew! for they are worthy

680
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.900
To inlay heaven withstars.

681
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:33.930
Thou weep'st, andspeak'st.

682
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.870
The service that you threehave done is more

683
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:45.270
Unlike than this thoutell'st. I lost my children:

684
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:47.670
If these be they, I knownot how to wish

685
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.930
A pair of worthier sons.

686
00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.470
Be pleased awhile.

687
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:59.800
This gentleman, whom Icall Polydore,

688
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:07.970
Most worthy prince, asyours, is true Guiderius:

689
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:14.730
This gentleman, my Cadwal,Arviragus,

690
00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:19.900
Your younger princely son;he, sir, was lapp'd

691
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.100
In a most curious mantle,wrought by the hand

692
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:27.170
Of his queen mother, whichfor more probation

693
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.270
I can with ease produce.

694
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.300
Guiderius had

695
00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:37.500
Upon his neck a mole, asanguine star;

696
00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.300
It was a mark of wonder.

697
00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.370
This is he;

698
00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.870
Who hath upon him stillthat natural stamp:

699
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.100
It was wise nature's endin the donation,

700
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:51.600
To be his evidence now.

701
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.570
O, what, am I

702
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:58.430
A mother to the birth ofthree? Ne'er mother

703
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:03.070
Rejoiced deliverance more.Blest pray you be,

704
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:05.970
That, after this strangestarting from your orbs,

705
00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.270
may reign in them now!

706
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.870
O Imogen, thou hast lostby this a kingdom.

707
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:13.670
No, my lord;

708
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:20.930
I have got two worlds by't. O my gentle brothers,

709
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:25.030
Have we thus met? O, neversay hereafter

710
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:27.730
But I am truest speakeryou call'd me brother,

711
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:34.100
When I was but yoursister; I you brothers,

712
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.270
When ye were so indeed.

713
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:36.530
Did you e'er meet?

714
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:37.730
Ay, my good lord.

715
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.370
And at first meetingloved;

716
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.200
O rare instinct!

717
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:47.600
See, Posthumusanchors upon Imogen,

718
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.700
And she, like harmlesslightning, throws her eye

719
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:58.070
On him, her brothers,me, her master,

720
00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.870
hitting each object witha joy:

721
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:03.030
Let's quit this ground,

722
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.900
And smoke the temple withour sacrifices.

723
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.130
Thou art my brother; sowe'll hold thee ever.

724
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.930
My good master,

725
00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:15.030
I will yet do you service.

726
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.830
Happy be you!

727
00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:20.570
The forlorn soldier, thatso nobly fought,

728
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.200
He would have well becomedthis place, and graced

729
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.670
The thankings of a king.

730
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:26.400
I am, sir,

731
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.030
The soldier that didcompany these three

732
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.770
In poor beseeming; 'twas afitment for

733
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:36.570
The purpose I thenfollow'd. That I was he,

734
00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.770
Speak, Iachimo: I had youdown and might

735
00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.270
Have made you finish.

736
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.730
I am down again:

737
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.800
But now my heavyconscience sinks my knee,

738
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:59.670
As then your force did. Takethat life, beseech you,

739
00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:10.100
Which I so often owe: butyour ring first;

740
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.330
And here the bracelet ofthe truest princess

741
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:13.600
That ever swore her faith.

742
00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.670
Kneel not to me:

743
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.100
The power that I have onyou is, to spare you;

744
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:29.130
The malice towardsyou to forgive you:

745
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:37.470
Live, and deal withothers better.

746
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.070
Nobly doom'd!

747
00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:54.770
We'll learn our freenessof a son-in-law;

748
00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.430
Pardon's the word to all.

749
00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:00.770
You holp us, sir,

750
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.970
As you did mean indeed tobe our brother;

751
00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:04.800
Joy'd are we that you are.

752
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:09.600
Your servant, princes.Good my lord of Rome,

753
00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:12.600
Call forth yoursoothsayer:

754
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.100
as I slept, methought

755
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:18.100
Great Jupiter, upon hiseagle back'd,

756
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:21.170
Appear'd to me, with otherspritely shows

757
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.700
Of mine own kindred: whenI waked, I found

758
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.570
This label on my bosom;whose containing

759
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.630
Is so from sense inhardness, that I can

760
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:33.630
Make no collection of it:

761
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.700
let her show her skillin the construction.

762
00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.670
Read, and declare themeaning.

763
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.200
'When as a lion's whelpshall, to himself

764
00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:50.370
unknown, without seekingfind, and be embraced by a

765
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:55.070
piece of tender air; andwhen from a stately cedar

766
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.270
shall be lopped branches,which, being dead

767
00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.230
many years, shall afterrevive,

768
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:05.070
be jointed to the oldstock, and freshly grow;

769
00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:09.330
then shall Posthumusend his miseries,

770
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:14.130
Britain be fortunate andflourish in peace and plenty.'

771
00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.630
Thou, Leonatus, art thelion's whelp;

772
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:22.070
The fit and aptconstruction of thy name,

773
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:26.670
Being Leonatus, dothimport so much.

774
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:32.930
The piece of tender air,thy virtuous daughter,

775
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:35.470
Which we call 'mollisaer;' and 'mollis aer'

776
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:38.300
We term it 'mulier:' which'mulier' I divine

777
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.100
Is this most constantwife; who, even now,

778
00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.930
Answering the letter ofthe oracle,

779
00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:47.530
Unknown to you, unsought,were clipp'd about

780
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.000
With this most tender air.

781
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.800
This hath some seeming.

782
00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.700
The lofty cedar, royalCymbeline,

783
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.930
Personates thee: and thylopp'd branches point

784
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.700
Thy two sons forth; who,by Belarius stol'n,

785
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.330
For many years thoughtdead, are now revived,

786
00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:04.570
To the majestic cedarjoin'd, whose issue

787
00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:08.030
Promises Britain peace andplenty.

788
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.970
Well

789
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:14.600
My peace we will begin.

790
00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:17.170
And, Caius Lucius,

791
00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:21.400
Although the victor, wesubmit to Caesar,

792
00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.700
And to the Roman empire;promising

793
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.000
To pay our wonted tribute,from the which

794
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.130
We were dissuaded by ourwicked queen;

795
00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:33.000
Whom heavens, in justice,both on her and hers,

796
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.470
Have laid most heavy hand.

797
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:38.830
The fingers of the powersabove do tune

798
00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.930
The harmony of this peace.The vision

799
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.630
Which I made known toLucius, ere the stroke

800
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.570
Of this yet scarce-coldbattle, at this instant

801
00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:53.070
Is full accomplish'd; forthe Roman eagle,

802
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:57.570
From south to west on wingsoaring aloft,

803
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:02.070
Lessen'd herself, and inthe beams o' the sun

804
00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:08.130
So vanish'd: which foreshow'dour princely eagle,

805
00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:11.700
The imperial Caesar,should again unite

806
00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.170
His favour with theradiant Cymbeline,

807
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:17.570
Which shines here in thewest.

808
00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.900
Laud we the gods;

809
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.770
And let our crooked smokesclimb to their nostrils

810
00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.270
From our blest altars.

811
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:35.970
