        Terry Williams:
        I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
	TO ALSO REMEMBER
      

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:31.010

        THAT THE COLLECTIVE MOVEMENT
        OR THIS COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR
      

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.210

        ARE OFTENTIMES
        SPEARHEADED BY
      

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:38.250

        INDIVIDUAL COURAGE
        AND INDIVIDUAL BRAVERY.

        IN OTHER WORDS,


00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.090

        THESE MOVEMENTS ARE NOT
        SIMPLY STARTED SPONTANEOUSLY.
      

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.360

        THEY START BY THE EFFORTS
        OF USUALLY AN INDIVIDUAL
      

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:54.300

        WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT
        OF COURAGE.
      

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.430

        IN THE CASE
	OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT,
      

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.740

        THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS ROSA PARKS,


00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:04.740

        A SEAMSTRESS
        IN MONTGOMERY, ALABAMA.
      

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.750

        Parker Palmer:
        DECEMBER 1955,
      

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.850

        SHE SITS DOWN
        AT THE FRONT OF THE BUS
      

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.820

        IN A HISTORICALLY
        SEGREGATED SOUTHERN CITY
      

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.750

        WHERE AFRICAN-AMERICANS
        WERE SUPPOSED TO ALWAYS SIT
      

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.120

        AT THE BACK OF THE BUS,


00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.290

        OR NOT SIT AT ALL,
        IF WHITE PEOPLE WANTED THE SEAT.
      

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.490

        AND ONE DAY IN EARLY DECEMBER,


00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.730

        SHE DECIDES, "I'M GONNA SIT
        AT THE FRONT OF THE BUS."
      

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:27.830

        GO ON, MOVE BACK
        TO THE COLORED SECTION.
      

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:29.900

        Parker Palmer:
        SHE WAS ASKED,
	"WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO DO THAT?"
      

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.570

        AND SHE SAID,
        "BECAUSE I WAS TIRED,"
      

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:33.870

        BUT SHE DIDN'T MEAN THAT
        SHE WAS JUST PHYSICALLY TIRED.
      

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.970

        SHE MEANT HER SOUL WAS TIRED.


00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.180

        HER HEART WAS TIRED.


00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.140

        HER WHOLE BEING WAS TIRED
        OF LIVING A DIVIDED LIFE,
      

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.620

        OF BEHAVING ON THE OUTSIDE AS
        IF SHE WERE NOT THE FULL PERSON
      

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.520

        SHE KNEW HERSELF
        TO BE ON THE INSIDE,
      

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.720

        WITH AS MUCH RIGHT TO THAT SEAT
        AS ANY WHITE PERSON HAD.
      

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.290

        NO!


00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.930

        Parker Palmer:
        AND WE KNOW, OF COURSE,
	THAT THAT ACTION OF HERS
      

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.730

        TRIGGERED AN ENORMOUS UPRISING
        IN THIS COUNTRY
      

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.170

        CALLED THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
        OF THE '50s AND '60s
      

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.210

        WHICH ENDED IN NEW LAWS,
        ANTI-SEGREGATION LAWS,
      

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.540

        BEING PASSED
        BY THE SUPREME COURT.
      

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.410

        Terry Williams:
        THAT EFFORT WAS
	EXTRAORDINARILY COLLECTIVE
      

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.020

        IN THE SENSE THAT THIS WAS
        MASSIVE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE
      

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.720

        WHO WERE ORGANIZED IN CITIES
        AND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
      

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.620

        TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT
        TO CHANGE THESE LAWS,
      

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.330

        TO CHANGE
        THE DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES
      

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.960

        AND ALLOW PEOPLE
        A PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION
      

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.000

        AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE,
        AS WELL AS SOME OTHER ISSUES.
      

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.640

        WE'RE WILLING
        TO BE BEATEN FOR DEMOCRACY,
      

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.370

        AND YOU MISUSE
        DEMOCRACY IN THE STREET.
      

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.710

        YOU BEAT PEOPLE BLOODY


00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:48.110

        IN ORDER THAT THEY WILL NOT HAVE
        THE PRIVILEGE TO VOTE.

	A SOCIAL MOVEMENT
      

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.850

        BY EXAMINING
        THE NATURE OF CHANGE IT SEEKS,
      

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.120

        THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE IT SEEKS,


00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.820

        AND THE GOAL OF ITS MEMBERS.


00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:00.820

        THIS EXPLORATION REVEALS


00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.890

        A VARIETY OF TYPES
        OF SOCIAL MOVEMENTS,
      

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.300

        INCLUDING REVOLUTIONARY,

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.940

        MILLENARIAN, REFORMIST
        AND EXPRESSIVE.
      

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.010

        IN THE CASE OF
        THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT,
      

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.740

        WE SEE AN EXAMPLE OF
        A REFORMIST SOCIAL MOVEMENT.
      

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.040

        William Kornblum:
        A REFORMIST SOCIAL MOVEMENT
      

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.050

        IS AN EFFORT BY PEOPLE
        IN THE MOVEMENT TO CREATE CHANGE
      

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.620

        WHICH IS NOT REVOLUTIONARY,


00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.090

        DOESN'T TEAR DOWN MANY OF THE
        INSTITUTIONS OF THE SOCIETY;
      

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.120

        IT TRIES TO CHANGE THEM.


00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.190

        NOW IS THE TIME
      

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.760

        TO RISE FROM THE DARK AND
        DESOLATE VALLEY OF SEGREGATION
      

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.760

        TO THE SUN-LIT PATH
        OF RACIAL JUSTICE.
      

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.530

        Terry Williams:
        THE LAWS NEEDED TO BE REFORMED.
      

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.270

        THEY NEEDED TO BE CHANGED.


00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.670

        AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT,


00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.270

        YOU HAD TO HAVE
        THIS KIND OF MASSIVE EFFORT,
      

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.810

        BECAUSE LAWS ARE RARELY CHANGED
        BY INDIVIDUAL EFFORT.
      

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.450

        AND SO THIS
        CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
      

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:56.710

        REPRESENTED

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.220

        AN ATTEMPT TO REFORM
      

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:11.160

        OR CHANGE ASPECTS

        WHAT WE CELEBRATE EVEN MORE


00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.000

        IS THAT WE ARE ALL DESCENDANTS

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.540

        BUT ALSO

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:34.050

        AS A MOVEMENT

        THE EXPRESSIVE SOCIAL MOVEMENT,
      

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.450

        THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
      

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:40.940

        AIDS WAS DRAMATICALLY
        CHANGING PEOPLE'S LIVES.
      

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.710

        THAT FACT WAS
        POIGNANTLY DEPICTED
      

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:48.950

        IN THE 1987 "NAMES PROJECT,"
        WHEN A HUGE AIDS MEMORIAL QUILT
      

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:51.560

        WAS DISPLAYED ON THE MALL
        IN WASHINGTON D.C.
      

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.030

        EACH PANEL REPRESENTED
        A VICTIM OF AIDS.
      

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:59.830

        WHILE THIS PROJECT BROUGHT
        ATTENTION TO THE CRISIS
      

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.300

        AND THE NEED TO DEVOTE
        MORE FUNDS TO HIV RESEARCH,
      

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.700

        MANY PEOPLE FELT
        MORE NEEDED TO BE DONE.
      

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.010

        AND INDIVIDUALS,
        LIKE SOCIOLOGIST VICTOR AYALA,
      

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.380

        DECIDED TO DO WHATEVER
        THEY COULD TO HELP.
      

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.480

        Victor Ayala:
        BACK IN 1984,
      

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.950

        I HAD A NUMBER OF FRIENDS,
        THAT OVERNIGHT, WE REALIZED
      

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:28.690

        THAT THEY HAD DEVELOPED
        SOME TYPE OF SICKNESS.
      

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.530

        WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.


00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.960

        IT WAS A GREAT MYSTERY.


00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.730

        AND IN 1987,


00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.770

        A MEMBER OF MY FAMILY
        HAD CONTRACTED AIDS,
      

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:48.310

        AND AS A RESULT OF THAT,
        THERE BEGAN THE JOURNEY.
      

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.320

        Narrator:
        AYALA'S DESIRE
	TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HIV
      

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.720

        GRADUALLY EVOLVED
        INTO FORMAL RESEARCH.
      

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.590

        Victor Ayala:
        FIRST I WAS JUST
	DOING VOLUNTEER WORK.
      

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:04.730

        FROM THERE I MOVED TO STARTING
        TO DEVELOP A QUESTIONNAIRE
      

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:11.000

        WHERE I WAS ASKING PATIENTS
        ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL ACTIVITY.
      

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.100

        THEN I TOOK A PART-TIME POSITION


00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.740

        WITH THE NEW YORK
        STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
      

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:20.310

        WHERE I WAS A HOTLINE COUNSELOR.


00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:24.480

        I FOUND IT FASCINATING, IN TERMS
        OF WORKING ON THIS HOTLINE,
      

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.250

        AND WHAT PEOPLE WOULD TELL YOU,


00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.520

        IN TERMS
        OF THEIR SEXUAL PRACTICES
      

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.820

        OR IN TERMS OF THEIR FEAR


00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:40.600

        AROUND THINKING THAT THEY
        MAY HAVE CONTRACTED HIV.
      

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.100

        Narrator:
        AYALA'S VOLUNTEER WORK
      

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.740

        COINCIDED WITH HIS
        GRADUATE STUDIES IN SOCIOLOGY.
      

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:49.010

        ULTIMATELY, HE DECIDED TO FOCUS
        HIS DOCTORAL DISSERTATION
      

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.410

        ON AIDS AND THE URBAN POOR.


00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.710

        Victor Ayala:
        I WAS REALLY FASCINATED
      

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.280

        WITH HOW THE URBAN POOR
        WERE DEALING WITH HIV,
      

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.480

        BECAUSE NO ONE WAS
        REALLY TALKING ABOUT THAT,
      

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.380

        AND SO WHAT I DO,


00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.320

        IS GIVE VOICE TO THE EXPERIENCE
        OF URBAN POOR PEOPLE
      

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.860

        DEALING WITH AIDS,


00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:12.360

        HOW THEY BASICALLY
        STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE;
      

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.430

        AND HOW, ON THE ONE HAND,


00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:18.840

        YOU MAY BE PROVIDING
        MEDICAL CARE TO THIS POPULATION,
      

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:22.110

        BUT WITHOUT
        ANY SENSE OF STABILITY,
      

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:26.480

        WITHOUT HOUSING,
        WITHOUT ADEQUATE FOOD,
      

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.980

        WITHOUT
        AN ADEQUATE SUPPORT SYSTEM.
      

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.850

        I FOUND THAT THE TYPE OF SERVICE
        THAT WAS BEING PROVIDED
      

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.450

        WAS JUST NOT HELPING THEM.


00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.790

        I THINK THE OTHER AREA
        THAT MY WORK TOUCHES ON
      

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.360

        IS THAT SOMETIMES
        HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS
      

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.260

        MAY HAVE A PERCEPTION,
        OR A JUDGMENT,
      

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.460

        OF THE POPULATION
        THAT THEY SERVE.
      

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.930

        AND WITH THIS
        PARTICULAR POPULATION
      

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.840

        REALLY BEING URBAN POOR,
        THE DISENFRANCHISED POOR,
      

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.540

        CLEARLY, THERE WAS A STIGMA


00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.410

        IN TERMS OF HOW THEY
        SAW THIS POPULATION,
      

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.050

        AND THIS WORK
        DEFINITELY DEMONSTRATES
      

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:12.120

        HOW THAT STIGMA IMPACTS
        ON HOW THEY WERE SERVED.
      

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.290

        Narrator:
        AS WORD OF HIS RESEARCH SPREAD,
      

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:16.790

        AYALA BEGAN TO RECEIVE
        INVITATIONS TO SPEAK
	PUBLICLY ON AIDS IN 1986.
      

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.660

        AT CONFERENCES
        AND PUBLIC MEETINGS.
      

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:25.800

        Victor Ayala:
        I STARTED SPEAKING
      

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.700

        AT THAT TIME
        I WAS ALSO INVOLVED
      

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.470

        IN DEVELOPING
        THE BROOKLYN AIDS TASK FORCE
      

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.510

        THAT PROVIDES VARIOUS SERVICES


00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.050

        TO PEOPLE WITH AIDS
        AND THEIR FAMILY.
      

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.920

        SO MY SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS


00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.250

        WERE REALLY ABOUT
        PROVIDING INFORMATION,
      

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:49.260

        BUT ALSO IT WAS ABOUT TRYING
        TO RAISE AWARENESS AND MONEY.
      

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.630

        I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT YOU ARE
        HERE TODAY AND, AS YOU KNOW,
      

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:55.130

        WE HAVE BEEN TALKING
        A LOT ABOUT HIV AND AIDS
      

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:56.870

        IN THE URBAN COMMUNITY.


00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.600

        Narrator:
        WHAT BEGAN AS VOLUNTEER WORK
      

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.300

        EVOLVED INTO
        A ROUND-THE-CLOCK JOB.
      

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:03.040

        AT THE PEAK OF HIS ACTIVITY,


00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.710

        AYALA WAS TEACHING
        AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE,
      

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.080

        WORKING WITH AIDS PATIENTS
        AT NIGHT,
      

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:12.280

        AND SQUEEZING IN
        SPEAKING ENGAGEMENTS.
      

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:16.250

        Victor Ayala:
        I BELIEVE THAT THE PERSONAL
	BECAME THE POLITICAL,
      

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.790

        AND THAT IT WAS SO IMPORTANT
        TO GIVE VOICE TO THE PEOPLE
      

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.160

        THAT I HAD WORKED WITH.


00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.490

        THEY WEREN'T
        JUST RESEARCH SUBJECTS.
      

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.800

        THEY WERE SO ALIVE
        AND THEY REALLY TAUGHT ME
      

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.040

        SO MUCH ABOUT
        LIVING AND SURVIVING,
      

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:37.570

        AND BASICALLY, LEARNING TO LIVE
        WITHIN ONE'S OWN CIRCUMSTANCE.
      

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.880

        SO I WANTED TO
        GET THAT MESSAGE OUT.
      

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.810

        TV Host:
        IT DOES ALSO CONTRIBUTE
	TO BROADENING THE AWARENESS
      

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.650

        OR GIVING MORE VOICE
        TO THIS GROUP OF THE POPULATION
      

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:49.950

        WHICH, OTHERWISE,
        NO ONE WOULD SPEAK FOR...
      

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:51.820

        Narrator:
        IRONICALLY,
	BECOMING AN ACTIVIST
      

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.320

        WAS SOMETHING THAT AYALA
        HAD NEVER ENVISIONED.
      

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:56.730

        I THINK THE MOST
        IMPORTANT THING FOR ME
      

00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.900

        IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS
        HUMAN VALUE IN THIS POPULATION.
      

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.460

        Victor Ayala:
        WHEN I STARTED GRADUATE SCHOOL,
      

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.400

        I DID NOT THINK THAT I WOULD
        BE DOING WHAT I'M DOING TODAY,
      

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.140

        AND I THINK WHEN YOU
        DO THIS TYPE OF WORK,
      

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.680

        AS A SOCIOLOGIST, YOU HAVE
        A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
      

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:20.950

        YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
        TO IMPACT CHANGE.
      

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.920

        Narrator:
        FOR AYALA, THE PAYOFF IS SEEING
      

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.890

        THAT HIS EFFORTS HAVE PRODUCED
        A TANGIBLE BENEFIT.
      

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.660

        Victor Ayala:
        WE HAVE A GREAT
	MULTISERVICE AGENCY IN BROOKLYN,
      

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.360

        THE BROOKLYN AIDS TASK FORCE.


00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.600

        IT'S AN AGENCY THAT IS DIVERSE.


00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.770

        IT REALLY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT
        MULTICULTURALISM.
      

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.040

        IT LOOKS AT GAY AND LESBIANS,
        IT LOOKS AT AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
      

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.240

        IT LOOKS AT LATINOS,
        IT LOOKS AT ADOLESCENTS,
      

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.950

        AND IT REALLY TRIES
        TO BRING ABOUT
      

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:56.220

        COMPREHENSIVE
        AND COMPASSIONATE SERVICES.
      

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.360

        Narrator:
        IN THE YEARS SINCE
	VICTOR AYALA'S WORK BEGAN,
      

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.330

        AIDS AWARENESS
        HAS GROWN WORLDWIDE.
      

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:04.530

        AYALA'S STORY DEMONSTRATES


00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:07.760

        THAT A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL,
        DEDICATED TO SOCIAL ACTION,
      

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.630

        CAN SOMETIMES HAVE AN INFLUENCE


00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.300

        THAT FAR EXCEEDS
        HIS OR HER EXPECTATIONS.
      

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.710

        Victor Ayala:
        I THINK WE HAVE
	AN OBLIGATION TO OUR SOCIETY,
      

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.780

        AND WHATEVER PEOPLE CAN DO,
        THEY MUST DO,
      

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.010

        EVEN IF IT'S FEEDING
        THE HOMELESS,
      

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.780

        EVEN IF IT'S SHOWING KINDNESS
        TO AN INDIVIDUAL,
      

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:31.850

        THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE
        FOR OUR OWN HUMANITY
      

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:34.420

        AND THAT WE ALL
        SHOULD PLAY A ROLE IN THAT.
      

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.590

        AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
        SOMEONE'S COMING TO DO THAT,
      

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.460

        SO IT STARTS
        WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL.
      

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.600

        AND I REALLY BELIEVE


00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.730

        AN INDIVIDUAL CAN
        MAKE A DIFFERENCE,
      

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.840

        AND YOU JUST HAVE
        TO GET INVOLVED
      

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.870

        AND MOVE YOUR AGENDA
        AND MAKE IT WORK FOR YOU.
      

00:26:50.870 --> 00:27:00.780

        YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

        Narrator:
        SOCIAL ACTION OFTEN
	INVOLVES COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR,
      

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:17.700

        SUCH AS RALLIES,
        DEMONSTRATIONS AND MARCHES.
      

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.000

        COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR
        MAY BE ORGANIZED,
      

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.840

        AS IN A STRIKE,


00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.180

        OR IT MAY INVOLVE HIGHLY
        EMOTIONAL, SPONTANEOUS ACTIONS,
      

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.840

        SUCH AS RIOTS.


00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.510

        THESE SPONTANEOUS ACTIONS
        ARE OFTEN THE CATALYST
      

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:36.590

        FOR THE FORMATION OF SOCIAL
        MOVEMENTS SEEKING CHANGE.
      

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:39.690

        OFTEN THESE MOVEMENTS BEGIN--
        AND ARE SUSTAINED--
      

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.990

        BY DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS


00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:51.500

        WHO CHOOSE TO
        TAKE ACTION IN SOCIETY.
