00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:52.700


2
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.000
Nay, but this dotage of ourgeneral's overflows the measure.

3
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.900
Those his goodly eyes that overthe files

4
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.400
and musters of the war haveglowed like plated Mars

5
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.200
now bend, now turn the officeand devotion

6
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.300
of their view upon a tawnyfront.

7
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.570
His captain's heart, which, inthe scuffles of great fights,

8
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.300
hath burst the buckles on hisbreast,

9
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.570
reneges all temper

10
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
and is become the bellows andthe fan to cool a gypsy's lust.

11
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.400
Here they come.

12
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.570
Take a good note,

13
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.900
and you will see in him, thetriple pillar of the world,

14
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.630
transformed into a strumpet'sfool.

15
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.000
If it be love indeed, tell mehow much.

16
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.830
There's beggary in the love thatcan be reckoned.

17
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.830
I'll set a bourn how far to bebeloved.

18
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.730
Then must thou needs find outnew heaven, new earth.

19
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.030
News, my good lord, from Rome.

20
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.300
Grates me: the sum.

21
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.100
Nay, hear them, Antony.

22
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.400
Fulvia perchance is angry,

23
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.270
or who knows if thescarce-bearded Caesar

24
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.330
have not sent his powerfulmandate to you?

25
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.730
"Do this or this.

26
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.330
"Take in that kingdom andenfranchise that.

27
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.600
Perform it, or else we damnthee."

28
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.170
Oh, my love.

29
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.030
Perchance nay and most like:

30
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.370
You must not stay here longer.

31
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.000
Your dismission is come fromCaesar.

32
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.400
Therefore, hear it, Antony.

33
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.770
Where's Fulvia's process?

34
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.800
Caesar's I would say? Both?

35
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.830
As I am Egypt's queen, thoublushest, Antony,

36
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.730
and that blood of thine isCaesar's homager.

37
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.400
Else so thy cheek pays shame

38
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.500
when shrill-tongued Fulviascolds.

39
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.230
The messengers.

40
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.770
Let Rome in Tiber melt

41
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.300
and the wide arch of the rangedempire fall.

42
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.400
Here is my space.

43
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.470
Kingdoms are clay.

44
00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.500
Our dungy earth alike feedsbeast as man.

45
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.130
The nobleness of life is to dothus.

46
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.970
When such a mutual pair and sucha twain can do it,

47
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.770
in which I bind on pain ofpunishment

48
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.470
the world to weet, we stand uppeerless.

49
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.800
Excellent falsehood.

50
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.800
Why, did he marry Fulvia and notlove her?

51
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.330
I'll seem the fool, I am not.

52
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.200
Antony will be himself.

53
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.630
But stirred by Cleopatra.

54
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.570
Now, for the love of love andher soft hours,

55
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.530
let's not confound the time withconference harsh.

56
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.070
There's not a minute of ourlives should stretch

57
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.600
without some pleasure now.

58
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.800
What sport tonight?

59
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.130
Hear the ambassadors.

60
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.770
Fie, wrangling queen,

61
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.770
whom everything becomes tochide, to laugh, to weep,

62
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.270
whose every passion fullystrives

63
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.800
to make itself in thee fair andadmired!

64
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.870
No messenger but thine.

65
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.870
And all alone tonight we'llwander through the streets

66
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.800
and note the qualities ofpeople.

67
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.070
Come, my queen.

68
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.070
Last night, you did desire it.Speak not to us.

69
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.170
Is Caesar with Antonius prizedso slight?

70
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.070
Sir, sometimes when he is notAntony,

71
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.130
he comes too short of that greatproperty,

72
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.430
which still should go withAntony.

73
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.430
I am full sorry he approves thecommon liar,

74
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.070
who thus speaks of him at Rome.

75
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.570
I'll have of better deedstomorrow.

76
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.570
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, mostanything Alexas,

77
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.930
almost most absolute Alexas,

78
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:39.400
where's the soothsayer

79
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.100
that you praised so to thequeen?

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.130
Soothsayer.

81
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.370
Your will?

82
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.600
Is this the man?

83
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.530
Is it you, sir, that knowthings?

84
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.470
In nature's infinite book ofsecrecy, a little I can read.

85
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.000
Show him your hand.

86
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.930
Good sir, give me good fortune.

87
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.430
I make not but foresee.

88
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.830
Pray, then, foresee me one.

89
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.270
You shall be yet far fairer thanyou are.

90
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.630
He means in flesh.

91
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.370
No, you shall paint when you'reold.

92
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.470
Wrinkles forbid!

93
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.130
Vex not his prescience; beattentive.

94
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.230
Hush.

95
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.970
You shall be more beloving thanbeloved.

96
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.230
I'd rather heat my liver withdrinking.

97
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.230
Nay, hear him.

98
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.130
Good now, some excellentfortune.

99
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.500
Let me be married to three kingsin a forenoon

100
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.330
and widow them all.

101
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.530
Find me to marry me withOctavius Caesar,

102
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.270
and companion me with mymistress.

103
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.030
You shall outlive the lady whomyou serve.

104
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.470
Excellent! I love long lifebetter than figs.

105
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.570
You have seen and proved afairer former fortune

106
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.100
than that which is to approach.

107
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.930
Prithee, how many boys andwenches must I have?

108
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.300
If every of your wishes had awomb

109
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.900
and fertile every wish, amillion.

110
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.230
Out, fool! I forgive thee for awitch.

111
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.570
You think none but your sheetsare privy to your wishes.

112
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.000
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

113
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.930
We'll know all our fortunes.

114
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.070
Mine and most of our fortunestonight

115
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.600
shall be drunk to bed.

116
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.930
There's a palm presageschastity, if nothing else.

117
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.100
Even as the o'erflowing Niluspresageth famine?

118
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.800
Go, you wild bedfellow.

119
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.900
You cannot soothsay.

120
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.130
Prithee, tell her but aworky-day fortune.

121
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.370
Your fortunes are alike.

122
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.000
Oh, but how? But how?

123
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Give me particulars.

124
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.130
I have said.

125
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.270
Am I not an inch of fortunebetter than she?

126
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.670
Well, if you were but an inch offortune better than I,

127
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.430
where would you choose it?

128
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.970
Not in my husband's nose.

129
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.600
Our worser thoughts heavensmend!

130
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.730
Alexas, come; his fortune, hisfortune.

131
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.200
Let him marry a woman thatcannot go,

132
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.300
sweet Isis, I beseech thee!

133
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.370
And let her die too and give hima worse.

134
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:35.400
And let worse follow worse,

135
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.830
till the worst of all follow himlaughing to his grave,

136
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.970
fifty-fold a cuckold!

137
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.170
Amen.

138
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.600
Dear goddess, hear that prayerof the people,

139
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.170
for as it is a heartbreaking

140
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.170
to see a handsome manloose-wived,

141
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.700
so it is a deadly sorrow

142
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.870
to behold a foul knaveuncuckolded.

143
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.130
Saw you my lord?

144
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.130
No, lady.

145
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:56.130
Was he not here?

146
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.130
No, madam.

147
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.700
He was disposed to mirth,

148
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.800
but on the sudden a Romanthought hath struck him.

149
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.800
Enobarbus!

150
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800
Madam?

151
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.630
Seek him and bring him hither.

152
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.670
Where's Alexas?

153
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.800
Here, at your service.

154
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.670
My lord approaches.

155
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.800
We will not look upon him.

156
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.670
Go with us.

157
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.900
Fulvia, thy wife, first cameinto the field.

158
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.900
Against my brother Lucius?

159
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.200
Aye, but soon that war had end,

160
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.470
and the time's state madefriends of them,

161
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.230
jointing their force againstCaesar

162
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.370
whose better issue in the warfrom Italy

163
00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.670
upon the first encounter dravethem.

164
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.870
Well, what worst?

165
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.970
The nature of bad news infectsthe teller.

166
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.530
When it concerns the fool orcoward.

167
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.300
On, things that are past aredone with me.

168
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.030
'Tis thus who tells me true,though in his tale lie death,

169
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.470
I hear him as he flattered.

170
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.900
Labienusó this is stiff newsó

171
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.500
hath with his Parthian forceextended Asia from Euphrates.

172
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.130
His conquering banner shook

173
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.300
from Syria to Lydia and toIonia, whilstó

174
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.870
Antony, thou wouldst sayó

175
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.870
Oh, my lord.

176
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.100
Speak to me home.

177
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.500
Mince not the general tongue.

178
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.330
Name Cleopatra as she is calledin Rome.

179
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.200
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase,

180
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.100
and taunt my faults with suchfull licence

181
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.700
as both truth and malice havepower to utter.

182
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.100
Then we bring forth weeds

183
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.530
when our quick minds lie still

184
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.100
and our ills told us is as ourearing.

185
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.730
Fare thee well awhile.

186
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.470
At your noble pleasure.

187
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.230
These strong Egyptian fetters Imust break

188
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.900
or lose myself in dotage.

189
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.230
What are you?

190
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.030
Fulvia, thy wife, is dead.

191
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.800
Where died she?

192
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.370
In Sicyon.

193
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.700
Her length of sickness with whatelse more serious

194
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.000
importeth thee to know, thisbears.

195
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.330
Forbear me.

196
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.930
There's a great spirit gone!

197
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.430
Thus did I desire it.

198
00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.870
What our contempts doth oftenhurl from us,

199
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.170
we wish it ours again.

200
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.970
The present pleasure byrevolution

201
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.470
lowerings become the opposite ofitself.

202
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.570
She's good being gone.

203
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.400
The hand could pluck her backthat shoved her on.

204
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.700
I must from this enchantingqueen break off.

205
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.100
Ten thousand harms more than theills

206
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.470
that I know my idleness dothhatch.

207
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:47.970
How now. Enobarbus.

208
00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:51.500
What's your pleasure, sir?

209
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.900
I must with haste from hence.

210
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.000
Why, then, we kill all ourwomen.

211
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
We see how mortal an unkindnessis to them.

212
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.470
If they suffer our departure,death's the word.

213
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.630
I must be gone.

214
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.900
Under a compelling occasion, letwomen die.

215
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.370
It were pity to cast them awayfor nothing.

216
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.430
Though between them and a greatcause,

217
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:12.470
they should be esteemed nothing.

218
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.600
Cleopatra, catching but theleast noise of this,

219
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.070
dies instantly.

220
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:20.200
I've seen her die twenty timesupon a far poorer moment.

221
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.200
I do think there is mettle indeath,

222
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.970
which commits some loving actupon her.

223
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.870
She hath such a celerity indying.

224
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.530
She is cunning past man'sthought.

225
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.900
Alack, sir, no.

226
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.770
Her passions are made of nothing

227
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.530
but the finest part of purelove.

228
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:39.330
We cannot call her winds andwaters, sighs and tears.

229
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.000
They are greater storms andtempests

230
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.230
than almanacs can report.

231
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.530
Would I had never seen her.

232
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.630
Oh, sir.

233
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.770
You had then left unseen awonderful piece of work,

234
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.900
which not to have been blestwithal

235
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.630
would have discredited yourtravel.

236
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.830
Fulvia is dead.

237
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.800
Sir?

238
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.070
Fulvia is dead.

239
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.170
Fulvia?

240
00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.830
Dead!

241
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.770
Why, sir, give the gods athankful sacrifice.

242
00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.430
When it pleaseth their deities

243
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.430
to take the wife of a man fromhim,

244
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.670
it shows to man the tailors ofthe earth,

245
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:35.070
comforting therein that when oldrobes are worn out,

246
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.670
there are members to make new.

247
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.070
If there were no more women butFulvia,

248
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.370
then had you indeed a cut andthe case to be lamented.

249
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:47.600
The tears live in an onion thatshould water this sorrow.

250
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.900
The business she hath broachedin the state

251
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.300
cannot endure my absence.

252
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.000
The business you have broachedhere

253
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.500
cannot be without you,

254
00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.970
especially that of Cleopatra,

255
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.770
which wholly depends on yourabode.

256
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.900
No more light answers.

257
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.470
Let our officers have noticewhat we purpose.

258
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:09.470
I shall break the cause of ourexpedience to the queen

259
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.330
and get her leave to part.

260
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.130
For not alone the death ofFulvia

261
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.200
with more urgent touches dostrongly speak to us,

262
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.370
but the letters, too, of manyour contriving friends

263
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.770
in Rome petition us at home.

264
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.530
Sextus Pompeius hath given thedare to Caesar

265
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.800
and commands the empire of thesea.

266
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.230
Say our pleasure to such whoseplace is under us

267
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.830
requires our quick remove fromhence.

268
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.500
I shall do it.

269
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.930
Where is he?

270
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.230
See where he is,

271
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:43.430
who's with him, what he does.

272
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.770
I did not send you.

273
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:49.870
If you find him sad, say I amdancing.

274
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.700
If in mirth, report that I amsudden sick.

275
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.770
Quick and return.

276
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:01.830
Madam, methinks if you did lovehim dearly,

277
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.370
you do not hold the method toenforce the like from him.

278
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:07.600
What should I do, I do not?

279
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.270
In each thing, give him way.Cross him in nothing.

280
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.630
Thou teachest like a fool theway to lose him.

281
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.730
Tempt him not so too far, I wishforbear.

282
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.470
In time we hate that which weoften fear.

283
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.000
But here comes Antony.

284
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.370
I am sick and sullen.

285
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.170
I am sorry to give breathing tomy purpose.

286
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.370
Help me away, dear Charmian; Ishall fall.

287
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.870
It cannot be thus long.

288
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.370
The sides of nature will notsustain it.

289
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.070
Now, my dearest queenó

290
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.030
Pray you, stand farther from me.

291
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.330
What's the matter?

292
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.470
I know by that same eye there'ssome good news.

293
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.070
What says the married woman?

294
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.570
You may go.

295
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.430
Would she had never given youleave to come!

296
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.400
Let her not say 'tis I that keepyou here.

297
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.500
I have no power upon you; hersyou are.

298
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.800
The gods best knowó

299
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.470
Oh, never was there a queen somightily betrayed.

300
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.500
Yet at the first, I saw thetreasons planted.

301
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.600
Cleopatraó

302
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.600
Why should I think you can bemine and true

303
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.130
though you in swearing shake thethroned gods

304
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.900
who have been false to Fulvia?

305
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.100
Most sweet queenó

306
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.800
Nay, pray you, seek no color foryour going

307
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.100
but bid farewell and go.

308
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:17.730
When you sued staying, then wasthe time for words.

309
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:18.800
No going then.

310
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.670
Eternity was in our lips andeyes,

311
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.200
bliss in our brows bent.

312
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.370
None our parts so poor but was arace of heaven.

313
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.570
They are so still.

314
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.430
Or thou, the greatest soldier ofthe world,

315
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:32.670
art turned the greatest liar.

316
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.670
How now, lady!

317
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.900
I would I had thy inches.

318
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.800
Thou shouldst know there were aheart in Egypt.

319
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.100
Hear me, queen.

320
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:43.730
The strong necessity of timecommands our services awhile,

321
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:48.070
but my full heart remains in usewith you.

322
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.130
Our Italy shines o'er with civilswords.

323
00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:54.630
Sextus Pompeius makes hisapproaches to the port of Rome.

324
00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:58.270
Equality of two domestic powersbreed scrupulous faction.

325
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.730
The hated, grown to strength,are newly grown to love.

326
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.730
My more particular

327
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:10.200
and that which most with youshould safe my going

328
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.530
is Fulvia's death.

329
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.930
Though age from folly could notgive me freedom,

330
00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.630
it does from childishness.

331
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:25.730
Can Fulvia die?

332
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:28.570
She's dead, my queen.

333
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.030
Look here,

334
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.930
and at thy sovereign leisureread the garboils she awaked.

335
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:40.200
At the last best, see when andwhere she died.

336
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.230
O most false love!

337
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.500
Where be the sacred vials

338
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.730
thou shouldst fill withsorrowful water?

339
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.300
Now I see, I see in Fulvia'sdeath,

340
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.730
how mine received shall be.

341
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.770
Quarrel no more, but be preparedto know the purposes I bear,

342
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.500
which are or cease as you shallgive the advice.

343
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.870
By the fire that quickens Nilus'slime,

344
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.800
I go from hence thy soldier,servant,

345
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.300
making peace or war as thouaffect'st.

346
00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:17.000
Cut my lace, Charmian, come, butlet it be.

347
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.700
I am quickly ill and well, soAntony loves.

348
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.300
My precious queen, forbear,

349
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.900
and give true evidence to hislove,

350
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.430
which stands an honorable trial.

351
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.530
So Fulvia told me.

352
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.830
I prithee, turn aside and weepfor her,

353
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.530
then bid adieu to me and say thetears belong to Egypt.

354
00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.270
Good now, play one scene ofexcellent dissembling

355
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.900
and let it look like perfecthonor.

356
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.230
You'll heat my blood no more.

357
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.500
You can do better yet, but thisis meetly.

358
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:44.670
I'll leave you, lady.

359
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.370
Courteous lord, one word, sir.

360
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:51.000
You and I must part.

361
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.430
Oh, that's not it.

362
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:58.000
Sir, you and I have loved, butthere's not it.

363
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.200
That you know well ,something itis I would.

364
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.370
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,

365
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.370
and I am all forgotten.

366
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.500
But that your royalty holdsidleness your subject,

367
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.430
I should take you for idlenessitself.

368
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.330
Sir, forgive me.

369
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:32.230
Since my becomings kill me whenthey do not eye well to you.

370
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.500
Your honor calls you hence.

371
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.000
Therefore, be deaf to myunpitied folly,

372
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.070
and all the gods go with you.

373
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.030
Upon your sword sit laurelvictory,

374
00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:48.770
and smooth success be strewedbefore your feet.

375
00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.200
Let us go. Come.

376
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.830
Our separation so abides andflies

377
00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:06.930
that thou residing here goes yetwith me,

378
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.730
and I, hence fleeting here,remain with thee.

379
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.400
Away.

380
00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.170
You may see, Lepidus, andhenceforth know

381
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:23.630
it is not Caesar's natural viceto hate our great competitor.

382
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:27.030
From Alexandria, this is thenews.

383
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:32.700
He fishes, drinks, and wastesthe lamps of night in revel.

384
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.730
Is not more man-like thanCleopatra.

385
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.330
Nor the queen of Ptolemy morewomanly than he.

386
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.300
Hardly gave audience

387
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.600
or vouchsafed to think he hadpartners.

388
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.830
You shall find there a man whois the abstract

389
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:48.630
of all faults that all menfollow.

390
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:54.100
I must not think there are evilsenough to darken all hisgoodness.

391
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:56.870
His faults in him seem as thespots of heavenó

392
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.470
more fiery by night's blackness,

393
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.570
hereditary rather thanpurchased,

394
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:04.800
what he cannot change than whathe chooses.

395
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.000
You are too indulgent.

396
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.870
Let's grant, it is not amiss totumble on the bed of Ptolemy,

397
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.530
to give a kingdom for a mirth,

398
00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.400
to sit and keep the turn oftippling with a slave,

399
00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:16.470
to reel the streets at noon

400
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.270
and stand the buffet with knavesthat smell of sweat.

401
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:21.370
Say this becomes him.

402
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.230
As his composure must be rareindeed

403
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.830
whom these things cannotblemish,

404
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.870
yet must Antony no way excusehis foils

405
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:31.100
when we do bear so great weightin his lightness.

406
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.270
If he filled his vacancy withhis voluptuousness,

407
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:37.530
full surfeits and the dryness ofhis bones call on him for it.

408
00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.000
But to confound such time thatdrums him from his sport

409
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.470
and speaks as loud as his ownstate and ours,

410
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.400
'tis to be chid

411
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.900
as we rate boys, who, beingmature in knowledge,

412
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.100
pawn their experience to theirpresent pleasure

413
00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.800
and so rebel to judgment.

414
00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.570
Here's more news.

415
00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:00.330
Thy biddings have been done.

416
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.900
And every hour, most nobleCaesar,

417
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.100
shalt thou have report how 'tisabroad.

418
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.800
Pompey is strong at sea,

419
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.330
and it appears he is beloved bythose that only have fearedCaesar.

420
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.330
To the ports the discontentsrepair,

421
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.400
and men's reports give him muchwronged.

422
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.400
I should have known no less.

423
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.900
It hath been taught us from theprimal state

424
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.200
that he which is was wisheduntil he were.

425
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.070
And the ebbed man, ne'er lovedtill ne'er worth love,

426
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:28.630
comes deared by being lacked.

427
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.900
This common body,

428
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.670
like to a vagabond flag upon thestream,

429
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:40.130
goes to and back, lackeying thevarying tide

430
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.070
to rot itself with motion.

431
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.370
Caesar, I bring thee word,

432
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.800
Menecrates and Menas, famouspirates,

433
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.430
make the sea serve them,

434
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.970
which they ear and wound withkeels of every kind.

435
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.000
Many hot inroads they make inItaly.

436
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.800
The borders maritime lack bloodto think on't

437
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.570
and flush youth revolt.

438
00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.530
No vessel can peep forth, but'tis as soon taken as seen,

439
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.230
for Pompey's name strikes morethan could his war resisted.

440
00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:07.030
Antony, leave thy lasciviouswassails.

441
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.830
When thou once was beaten fromModena,

442
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:13.800
where thou slewest Hirtius andPansa, consuls,

443
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.630
at thy heel did famine follow,

444
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.030
whom thou fought'st against,though daintily brought up,

445
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.570
with patience more than savagescould suffer.

446
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:23.730
Thou didst drink the stale ofhorses

447
00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.000
and the gilded puddle whichbeasts would cough at.

448
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.100
Thy palate then did deign theroughest berry on the rudesthedge.

449
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:34.000
Yea, like the stag, when snowthe pasture sheets,

450
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.770
the barks of trees thou browsed.

451
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.570
On the Alps, it is reported thoudidst eat strange flesh,

452
00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.030
which some did die to look on.

453
00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:42.270
And all thisó

454
00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.400
it wounds thine honor that Ispeak it nowó

455
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.400
was borne so like a soldier

456
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.470
that thy cheek so much as lankednot.

457
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.070
'Tis pity of him.

458
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:52.800
Let his shames quickly drive himto Rome.

459
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.570
'Tis time we twain did showourselves in the field.

460
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.800
To that end, assemble weimmediate council.

461
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.670
Pompey thrives in our idleness.

462
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:06.200
Tomorrow, Caesar, I shall befurnished to inform you rightly

463
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.630
both what by sea and land I canbe able to front this presenttime.

464
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.700
Till which encounter, it is mybusiness too. Farewell.

465
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.800
Farewell, my lord.

466
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.230
What you shall know of meantimestirs abroad,

467
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.300
I shall beseech you, sir, to letme be partaker.

468
00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.470
Doubt not, sir; I knew it for mybond.

469
00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.270
Charmian.

470
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.400
Madam?

471
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.770
Give me to drink mandragora.

472
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.600
Why, madam?

473
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:43.400
That I might sleep out thisgreat gap of time my Antony isaway.

474
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.830
You think of him too much.

475
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:50.470
O, 'tis treason.

476
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.830
Madam, I trust not so.

477
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.830
Thou, eunuch Mardian!

478
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.400
What's your majesty pleasure?

479
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.000
Not now to hear thee sing.

480
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.530
I take no pleasure in aught aneunuch has.

481
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.330
Hast thou affections?

482
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.570
Yes, gracious madam.

483
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:13.730
Indeed!

484
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:18.130
Not in deed, madam, for I can donothing,

485
00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:21.000
but what indeed is honest to bedone.

486
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.130
Yet have I fierce affections

487
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.170
and think what Venus did withMars.

488
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.570
O Charmian,

489
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.200
where think'st thou he is now?

490
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.130
Stands he, or sits he?

491
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.800
Or does he walk, or is he on hishorse?

492
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.870
O happy horse, to bear theweight of Antony!

493
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:56.070
Do bravely, horse, for wot'stthou whom thou movest?

494
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:59.270
The demi-Atlas of this earth,

495
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:03.000
the arm and burgonet of men.

496
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.270
He's speaking now

497
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:11.130
or murmuring, "Where's myserpent of old Nile?"ó

498
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.630
so he calls me.

499
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:18.700
Now I feed myself with mostdelicious poison.

500
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.730
Think on me,

501
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.830
that I am with Phoebus' amorouspinches black

502
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.300
and wrinkled deep in time.

503
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.300
Broad-fronted Caesar,

504
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.930
when thou wast here above theground,

505
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.630
I was a morsel for a monarch.

506
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.770
And great Pompey would stand

507
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.300
and make his eyes grow in mybrow.

508
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:46.000
There would he anchor his aspectand die

509
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.370
with looking on his life.

510
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.270
Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

511
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.830
How much unlike art thou MarkAntony.

512
00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:00.270
Yet coming from him,

513
00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:02.770
that great medicine hath withhis tinct gilded thee.

514
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.100
How goes it with my brave MarkAntony?

515
00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.070
Last thing he did, dear queen,

516
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:10.800
he kissedóthe last of manydoubled kissesó

517
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:13.370
this orient pearl.

518
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.170
His speech sticks in my heart.

519
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:19.170
Mine ear must pluck it thence.

520
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.670
"Good friend," quoth he,

521
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:24.500
"say, the firm Roman to greatEgypt

522
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.300
"sends this treasure of anoyster

523
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.030
"at whose foot to mend the pettypresent,

524
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.230
"I will piece her opulent thronewith kingdoms.

525
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:38.570
All the east, say thou, shallcall her mistress."

526
00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.630
What was he, sad or merry?

527
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.170
Like to the time of the year

528
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.270
between the extremes of hot andcold,

529
00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.770
he was nor sad nor merry.

530
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:53.630
O well-divided disposition!

531
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.030
Note him; note him, goodCharmian.

532
00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.430
'Tis the man, but note him.

533
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.770
He was not sad,

534
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.170
for he would shine on those thatmake their looks by his.

535
00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.170
He was not merry, which seemedto tell them

536
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.770
his remembrance lay in Egyptwith his joy,

537
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:09.030
but between both.

538
00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.700
O heavenly mingle!

539
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.970
Be'st thou sad or merry.

540
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:20.100
The violence of either theebecomes so does it no man else.

541
00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.370
Met'st thou my posts?

542
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.630
Aye, madam, twenty severalmessengers.

543
00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:26.970
Why do you send so thick?

544
00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.970
Who's born that day when Iforget to send to Antony

545
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.330
shall die a beggar.

546
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.300
Ink and paper, Charmian.

547
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.430
Welcome, my good Alexas.

548
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:39.130
Did I, Charmian, ever loveCaesar so?

549
00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.730
O that brave Caesar!

550
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.700
Be choked with such anotheremphasis!

551
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.670
Say the brave Antony.

552
00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.330
The valiant Caesar!

553
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.270
By Isis, I will give thee bloodyteeth

554
00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:52.300
if thou with Caesar paragonagain my man of men.

555
00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.000
By your most gracious pardon,madam, I sing but after you.

556
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.100
My salad days when I was greenin judgment,

557
00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.930
cold in blood to say as I saidthen!

558
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.930
But, come, away.

559
00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.070
Get me ink and paper.

560
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.370
He shall have every day aseveral greeting,

561
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.970
or I'll unpeople Egypt.

562
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.600
If the great gods be just,

563
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.470
they shall assist the deeds ofjustest men.

564
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:30.000
Know, worthy Pompey, that whatthey do delay, they not deny.

565
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.570
Whiles we are suitors to theirthrone, decays the thing we suefor.

566
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.100
I shall do well.

567
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.770
The people love me, and the seais mine.

568
00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:42.830
My powers are crescent,

569
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:46.070
and my auguring hope says itwill come to the full.

570
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.630
Mark Antony in Egypt sits atdinner

571
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.200
and will make no wars withoutdoors.

572
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.000
Caesar gets money where he loseshearts.

573
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.370
Lepidus flatters both, of bothis flattered,

574
00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.330
but he neither loves nor eithercares for him.

575
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.830
Caesar and Lepidus are in thefield.

576
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.330
A mighty strength they carry.

577
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.930
Where have you this? 'Tis false.

578
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.430
From Silvius, sir.

579
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.730
He dreams.

580
00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:12.400
I know they are in Rome togetherlooking for Antony.

581
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.300
But all the charms of love saltCleopatra,

582
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.030
soften thy waned lip.

583
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.700
Let witchcraft join with beauty,lust with both.

584
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.400
Tie up the libertine in a fieldof feasts.

585
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.870
Keep his brain fuming.

586
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:32.400
Epicurean cooks sharpen withcloyless sauce his appetite,

587
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.700
that sleep and feeding mayprorogue his honor

588
00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.330
even till a lethe'd dullness.

589
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:39.670
Mark Antony is every hour inRome expected.

590
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.970
Since he went from Egypt, 'tis aspace for further travel.

591
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.900
I did not think this amoroussurfeiter

592
00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:51.170
would have donned his helm forsuch a petty war.

593
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.670
His soldiership is twice theother twain,

594
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.670
but let us rear the higher ouropinion

595
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.170
that our stirring can from thelap of Egypt's widow

596
00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.970
pluck the never-lust-weariedAntony.

597
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.030
I cannot hope Caesar and Antonyshall well greet together.

598
00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.730
Were it not that we stand upagainst them all,

599
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:10.300
'twere pregnant they shouldsquare between themselves,

600
00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.630
for they have entertained causeenough to draw their swords.

601
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.330
But how the fear of us maycement their division

602
00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.330
and bind up the petty differencewe yet not know.

603
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.600
Be it as our gods will have it.

604
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.730
It only stands our lives upon touse our strongest hands.

605
00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.400
Good Enobarbus,

606
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.670
'tis a worthy deed and shallbecome you well

607
00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:41.700
to entreat your captain to softand gentle speech.

608
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.730
'Tis not a time for privatestomaching.

609
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.930
Every time serves for the matterthat is then born in it.

610
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:48.770
But small to greater mattersmust give way.

611
00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:51.300
Not if the small come first.

612
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.600
Your speech is passion,

613
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.000
but, pray you, stir no embersup.

614
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.900
Here comes the noble Antony.

615
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.800
Noble friends,

616
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.170
that which combined us was mostgreat,

617
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.900
and let not a leaner action rendus.

618
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.630
What's amiss, may it be gentlyheard.

619
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.470
When we debate our trivialdifference loud,

620
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.870
we do commit murder in healingwounds.

621
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.600
Then, noble partners,

622
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.700
the rather, for I earnestlybeseech,

623
00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.270
touch you the sourest pointswith sweetest terms

624
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:24.230
nor curstness grow to thematter.

625
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.400
'Tis spoken well.

626
00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.000
Were we before our armies and tofight, I should do thus.

627
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.430
Welcome to Rome.

628
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.130
Thank you.

629
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.230
Sit.

630
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.370
Sit, sir.

631
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:38.370
Nay, then.

632
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:53.900
I learn, you take things illwhich are not so

633
00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.830
or being concern you not.

634
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.800
I must be laughed at, if or fornothing or a little,

635
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.500
I should say myself offended,

636
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.300
and with you chiefly in theworld.

637
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.370
My being in Egypt, Caesar, whatwas it to you?

638
00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:09.730
No more than my residing here atRome might be to you in Egypt.

639
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.130
Yet if you there did practice onmy state,

640
00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:15.600
your being in Egypt might be myquestion.

641
00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.700
How intend you, practiced?

642
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:19.700
You may be pleased to catch atmine intent

643
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.770
by what did here befall me.

644
00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.270
Your wife and brother made warsupon me,

645
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.630
and their contestation was themefor you.

646
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:30.330
You were the word of war.

647
00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.300
You do mistake your business.

648
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:34.870
My brother never did urge me inhis act.

649
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:38.530
Of this my letters before didsatisfy you.

650
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.030
If you'll patch a quarrel,

651
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.730
as matter whole you have not tomake it with,

652
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.130
it must not be with this.

653
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:44.830
As for my wife,

654
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.430
I would you had her spirit insuch another.

655
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.600
The third of the world is yours,

656
00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.670
which with a snaffle you maypace easy

657
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.370
but not such a wife.

658
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.630
So much uncurbable, hergarboils, Caesar,

659
00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:58.970
made out of her impatience,

660
00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:01.330
which not wanted shrewdness ofpolicy too.

661
00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:05.400
I grieving grant did you toomuch disquiet.

662
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.900
For that, you must but say, Icould not help it.

663
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.030
I wrote to you;

664
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:15.100
when rioting in Alexandria youdid pocket up my letters

665
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.130
with taunts did gibe my missiveout of audience.

666
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.970
Sir, he fell upon me ereadmitted then.

667
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.400
Three kings I had newly feasted

668
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.900
and did want of what I was inthe morning.

669
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.300
But next day I told him ofmyself,

670
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.670
which was as much as to haveasked him pardon.

671
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.830
Let this fellow be nothing ofour strife.

672
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:35.430
If we contend out of ourquestion, wipe him.

673
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:38.970
You have broken the article ofyour oath,

674
00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.230
which you shall never havetongue to charge me with.

675
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:42.230
Soft, Caesar.

676
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:43.670
No, Lepidus, let him speak.

677
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.100
The honor is sacred which hetalks on now,

678
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.530
supposing that I lacked it.

679
00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.830
But on, Caesar.

680
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:51.400
The article of my oath.

681
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.130
To lend me arms and aid when Irequired them,

682
00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.100
the which you both denied.

683
00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.900
Neglected, rather,

684
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:03.500
and then when poisoned hours hadbound me up

685
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.130
from mine own knowledge.

686
00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:12.400
As nearly as I may, I'll playthe penitent to you.

687
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.730
But mine honesty shall not makepoor my greatness

688
00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.770
nor my power work without it.

689
00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.400
Truth is, that Fulvia,

690
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.330
to have me out of Egypt, madewars here,

691
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.530
for which myself, the ignorantmotive,

692
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.970
do so far ask pardon as befitsmine honor

693
00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.500
to stoop in such a case.

694
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.630
'Tis noble spoken.

695
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:33.830
If it might please you,

696
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:35.930
to enforce no further the griefsbetween ye,

697
00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:37.330
to forget them quite,

698
00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.570
and to remember that the presentneed

699
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.000
speaks to atone you.

700
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.630
Worthily spoken.

701
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.230
Or if you borrow one another'slove for the instant,

702
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:48.830
you may, when you hear no morewords of Pompey,

703
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.230
return it again.

704
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.900
You shall have time to wranglein when you have nothing else todo.

705
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.430
Thou art a soldier only; speakno more.

706
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:59.900
That truth should be silent Ihad almost forgot.

707
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:03.030
You wrong this presence,therefore, speak no more.

708
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.500
Go to then your consideratestone.

709
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:09.770
I do not much dislike the matter

710
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.030
but the manner of his speech.

711
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:18.070
For it cannot be we shall remainin friendship,

712
00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.030
our conditions so differing intheir acts.

713
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:28.630
Yet if I knew what hoop shouldhold us staunch,

714
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.530
from edge to edge of the world Iwould pursue it.

715
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:32.530
Give me leave, Caesar.

716
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.730
Speak, Agrippa.

717
00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.570
Thou hast a sister by themother's sideó

718
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.100
admired Octavia.

719
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.670
Great Mark Antony is now awidower.

720
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.300
Say not so, Agrippa.

721
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.830
If Cleopatra heard you,

722
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.630
your reproof were well deservedof rashness.

723
00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:47.530
I am not married, Caesar.

724
00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:49.500
Let me hear Agrippa furtherspeak.

725
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.900
To hold you in perpetual amity,to make you brothers,

726
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.170
and to knit your hearts with anunslipping knot,

727
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.870
take Antony Octavia to his wife,

728
00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.270
whose beauty claims no worse ahusband than the best of men,

729
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:04.570
whose virtue and whose generalgraces speak that

730
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.200
which none else can utter.

731
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.570
By this marriage,

732
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.700
all little jealousies, which nowseem great,

733
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.300
and all great fears, which nowimport their dangers,

734
00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:13.870
would then be nothing.

735
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.830
Truths would be tales where nowhalf tales be truths.

736
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.870
Her love to both would,

737
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:22.970
each to other and all loves toboth, draw after her.

738
00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.870
Pardon what I have spoke,

739
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:26.370
for 'tis a studied,

740
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:32.130
not a present thought by dutyruminated.

741
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.430
Will Caesar speak?

742
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:43.900
Not till he hears how Antony istouched with what is spokealready.

743
00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:47.630
What power is in Agrippa?

744
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:51.130
If I would say, "Agrippa, be itso," to make this good?

745
00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.970
The power of Caesar and hispower unto Octavia.

746
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.230
May I never,

747
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.270
to this good purpose that sofairly shows,

748
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.370
dream of impediment!

749
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.530
Let me have your hand furtherthis act of grace

750
00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.300
and from this hour the heart ofbrothers govern in our loves

751
00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.330
and sway our great designs.

752
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.430
There is my hand.

753
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:32.500
A sister I bequeath you,

754
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.170
whom no brother did ever love sodearly.

755
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:40.370
Let her live to join ourkingdoms and our hearts

756
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.530
and never fly off our lovesagain.

757
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:46.000
Happily, amen!

758
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.470
I did not think to draw my swordagainst Pompey,

759
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:56.570
for he hath laid strangecourtesies

760
00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.500
and great of late upon me.

761
00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.930
I must thank him only

762
00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.070
lest my remembrance suffer illreport.

763
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:04.830
At heel of that, defy him.

764
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.300
Time calls upon us.

765
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.870
Of us must Pompey presently besought,

766
00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.530
or else he seeks out us.

767
00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:14.030
Where lies he?

768
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.000
About the mount Misenum.

769
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.070
What is his force by land?

770
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.500
Great and increasing,

771
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.730
but by sea, he's an absolutemaster.

772
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.000
So is the fame.

773
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.430
Would we had spoke together.

774
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:25.770
Haste we for it.

775
00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.600
Yet ere we put ourselves inarms,

776
00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.630
dispatch we the business we havetalked of.

777
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:30.830
With most gladness

778
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.600
and do invite you to my sister'sview.

779
00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.900
Whither straight I'll lead you.

780
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:37.270
Let us, Lepidus, not lack yourcompany.

781
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.500
Noble Antony, not sicknessshould detain me.

782
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:48.900
Welcome from Egypt, sir.

783
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.400
Good Enobarbus!

784
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.370
We have cause to be glad thatmatters are so well digested.

785
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.670
You stayed well by it in Egypt.

786
00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.870
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out ofcountenance

787
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.870
and made the night light withdrinking.

788
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:07.570
Eight wild boars roasted wholeat a breakfast

789
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.200
and but twelve persons there, isthis true?

790
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.600
This was but as a fly by aneagle.

791
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.470
We had much more monstrousmatter of feast,

792
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:19.100
which worthily deserved thenoting.

793
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:24.630
She's a most triumphant lady, ifreport be square to her.

794
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:28.600
When she first met Mark Antony,

795
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.030
she pursed up his heart upon theriver of Cydnus.

796
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.230
There she appeared indeed,

797
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.930
or my reporter devised well forher.

798
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.470
I'll tell you.

799
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:49.500
The barge she sat in, like aburnished throne,

800
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:51.670
burned on the water.

801
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.400
The poop was beaten gold.

802
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:58.030
Purple the sails and so perfumed

803
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.900
that the winds were love-sickwith them.

804
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.670
The oars were silver,

805
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.900
which to the tune of flutes keptstroke,

806
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.570
and made the water, which theybeat to follow faster,

807
00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.500
as amorous of their strokes.

808
00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:22.430
For her own person, it beggaredall description.

809
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.570
She did lie in her pavilion,

810
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.870
cloth-of-gold of tissue,

811
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.970
over-picturing that Venus

812
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:34.100
where we see the fancy outworknature.

813
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.600
On each side her stood prettydimpled boys,

814
00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:41.000
like smiling Cupids withdivers-colored fans,

815
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.670
whose wind did seem to glow thedelicate cheeks

816
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:49.570
which they did cool and whatthey undid did.

817
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.900
O, rare for Antony.

818
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.200
Her gentlewomen, like theNereides,

819
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.670
so many mermaids, tended her inthe eyes

820
00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.700
and made their bends adornings.

821
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.500
At the helm a seeming mermaidsteers.

822
00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.130
The silken tackle swell with thetouches

823
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.500
of those flower-soft hands

824
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.400
that yarely frame the office.

825
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.670
From the barge, a strangeinvisible perfume

826
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:22.670
hits the sense off the adjacentwharfs.

827
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:24.730
The city cast her people outupon her;

828
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.070
and Antony, enthroned in themarketplace,

829
00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:31.000
did sit alone, whistling to theair,

830
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.300
which, but for vacancy, had goneto gaze on Cleopatra too

831
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.700
and made a gap in nature.

832
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.900
Rare Egyptian!

833
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.000
Upon her landing, Antony sent toher,

834
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.770
invited her to supper.

835
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:47.430
She replied it should be betterhe became her guest,

836
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.030
which she entreated.

837
00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:52.100
Our courteous Antony,

838
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.100
whom never the word of "no"woman heard speak,

839
00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:58.330
being barbered ten times over,

840
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.130
goes to the feast,

841
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.030
and for his ordinary,

842
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:06.000
pays his heart for what his eyeseat only.

843
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.330
Royal wench.

844
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.700
She made great Caesar lay hissword to bed.

845
00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.200
He plowed her, and she cropped.

846
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.470
I saw her once hop forty paces

847
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.270
through the public street,

848
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:23.500
and having lost her breath, shespoke and panted

849
00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.230
that she did make defectperfection.

850
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:33.600
And, breathless, power breatheforth.

851
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.270
Now Antony must leave herutterly.

852
00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.770
Never; he will not.

853
00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:43.070
Age cannot wither her,

854
00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:48.770
nor custom stale her infinitevariety.

855
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:52.170
Other women cloy the appetitesthey feed,

856
00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:56.570
but she makes hungry where mostshe satisfies,

857
00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.430
for vilest things becomethemselves in her

858
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:04.100
that the holy priests bless herwhen she is riggish.

859
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.500
If beauty, wisdom, modesty,

860
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.300
can settle the heart of Antony,

861
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:13.270
Octavia is a blessed lottery tohim.

862
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.670
The world and my great office

863
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:17.800
will sometimes divide me fromyour bosom.

864
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.530
All which time before the gods

865
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.300
my knee shall bow my prayers tothem for you.

866
00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.400
Good night, sir.

867
00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:32.130
My Octavia, read not myblemishes in the world's report.

868
00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:35.230
I have not kept my square,

869
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:40.170
but that to come shall all bedone by the rule.

870
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.770
Good night, dear lady.

871
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:47.100
Good night, sir.

872
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.070
Good night.

873
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.170
Now, sirrah, you do wishyourself in Egypt?

874
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:07.230
Would I had never come fromthence, nor you thither.

875
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.700
If you can, your reason?

876
00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.430
I see it in my motion, have itnot in my tongue,

877
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:14.270
but yet hie you to Egypt again.

878
00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:17.700
Say to me,

879
00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.470
whose fortunes shall risehigher, Caesar's or mine?

880
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.570
Caesar's.

881
00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:25.370
Therefore, O Antony, stay not byhis side.

882
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:28.000
Thy demon that's thy spiritwhich keeps thee

883
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.130
is noble, courageous, high,unmatchable,

884
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:31.970
where Caesar's is not.

885
00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:35.930
But near him, thy angel becomesa fear as being overpowered.

886
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:38.370
Therefore, make space enoughbetween you.

887
00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:39.770
Speak this no more.

888
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.770
If thou dost play with him atany game, thou art sure to lose.

889
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:46.300
And of that natural luck, hebeats thee against the odds.

890
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.100
Thy luster thickens when heshines by.

891
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.370
I say again, thy spirit is allafraid to govern thee near him,

892
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:56.970
but he away, 'tis noble.

893
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:00.400
Get thee gone.

894
00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.730
Say to Ventidius I would speakwith him.

895
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.300
He shall to Parthia.

896
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:15.630
Be it art or hap, he hath spokentrue.

897
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.430
The very dice obey him.

898
00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:23.400
And in our sports, my bettercunning faints under his chance.

899
00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.530
If we draw lots, he speeds.

900
00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.800
His cocks do win the battlestill of mine

901
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.470
when it is all to naught,

902
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:33.770
and his quails ever beat mine,inhooped, at odds.

903
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.530
I will to Egypt.

904
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.530
And though I make this marriagefor my peace,

905
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.770
in the east my pleasure lies.

906
00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:50.970
O, come, Ventidius; you must toParthia.

907
00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.300
Your commission's ready. Followme and receive it.

908
00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.830
Give me some music.

909
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:08.230
Music, moody food of us thattrade in love.

910
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:15.370
Let it alone.

911
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.700
Let's to billiards. Come,Charmian.

912
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:19.600
My arm is sore; best play withMardian.

913
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.870
As well a woman with an eunuchplayed as with a woman.

914
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.070
Come, you'll play with me, sir?

915
00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:26.630
As well as I can, madam.

916
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:29.030
And when goodwill is showed,though it come too short,

917
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.000
the actor may plead pardon.

918
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.900
I'll none now.

919
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.170
Give me mine angle.

920
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.000
We'll to the river.

921
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.900
There, my music playing far off,

922
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.770
I will betray tawny-finnedfishes.

923
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:47.100
My bended hook shall piercetheir slimy jaws.

924
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:48.370
And as I draw them up,

925
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.900
I'll think them every one anAntony

926
00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.770
and say, "Ah, ha! You'recaught."

927
00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:58.000
'Twas merry when you wagered onyour angling.

928
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.230
When your diver did hang asalt-fish on his hook,

929
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:03.830
which he with fervency drew up.

930
00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:07.130
That timeóO times!

931
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.600
I laughed him out of patience.

932
00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.400
And that night, I laughed himinto patience.

933
00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.800
And next morn, ere the ninthhour,

934
00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.200
I drunk him to his bed,

935
00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:22.200
then put my tires and mantles onhim,

936
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.930
whilst I wore his swordPhilippan.

937
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.330
O, from Italy.

938
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:33.530
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings inmine ears

939
00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.670
that long time have been barren.

940
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:36.800
Madam, madamó

941
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.670
Antony is dead.

942
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:41.230
If thou say so, villain, I'llkill'st thy mistress.

943
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:44.300
But well and free, if thou soyield him, there is gold.

944
00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.430
And here my bluest veins tokiss,

945
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:49.430
a hand that kings have lippedand trembled kissing.

946
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.130
First, madam, he is well.

947
00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:53.470
Why, there's more gold.

948
00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:56.330
But, sirrah, mark, we use to saythe dead are well.

949
00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:58.300
Bring it to that, the gold Igive thee will I melt

950
00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.070
and pour down thy ill-utteringthroat.

951
00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.270
Good madam, hear me.

952
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:03.330
Well, go to, I will.

953
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.200
but there's no goodness in thyface.

954
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.170
If Antony be free and healthful,

955
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:09.730
why so tart a favor to trumpetsuch good tidings?

956
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:14.500
If not well, thou shouldst comelike a fury crowned with snakes,

957
00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.730
not like a formal man.

958
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.270
Will it please you hear me?

959
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:22.770
I have a mind to strike thee erethou speak'st.

960
00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:25.300
Yet if thou say Antony lives, iswell,

961
00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.770
or friends with Caesar, or notcaptive to him,

962
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.070
I'll set thee in a shower ofgold

963
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.270
and hail rich pearls upon thee.

964
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:33.500
Madam, he's well.

965
00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.330
Well said.

966
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.500
And friends with Caesar.

967
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:36.970
Thou art an honest man.

968
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:38.700
Caesar and he are greaterfriends than ever.

969
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.130
Make thee a fortune from me.

970
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:42.670
But yet, madamó

971
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:45.100
I do not like "but yet."

972
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.270
It does allay the goodprecedence.

973
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.330
Fie upon "but yet."

974
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:53.470
"But yet" is as a jailer tobring forth some monstrousmalefactor.

975
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:56.270
Prithee, friend, pour out thepack of matter to mine ear.

976
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.600
The good and bad together: he'sfriends with Caesar,

977
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.570
in state of health thou say'st,

978
00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:01.630
and thou say'st free.

979
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.700
Free, madam, no; I make no suchreport.

980
00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.730
He's bound unto Octavia.

981
00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:08.400
For what good turn?

982
00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:11.400
For the best turn in the bed.

983
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.270
I am pale, Charmian.

984
00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.800
Madam, he's married to Octavia.

985
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.600
The most infectious pestilenceupon thee!

986
00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:24.730
Good madam, patience.

987
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.130
What say you?

988
00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.230
Hence, horrible villain,

989
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.100
or I'll spurn thine eyes likeballs before me.

990
00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:32.230
I'll unhair thy head.

991
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:36.830
Thou shalt be whipped with wire,stewed in brine,

992
00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.170
smarting in lingering pickle.

993
00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.500
Gracious madam, I that do bringthe news made not the match.

994
00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:46.100
Say 'tis not so, a province Iwill give thee

995
00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.170
and make thy fortunes proud.

996
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:52.030
The blow thou hadst shall makethy peace for moving me to rage.

997
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:56.600
And I will boot thee with whatgift beside thy modesty can beg.

998
00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.200
He's married, madam.

999
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.200
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.

1000
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.300
Nay, then I'll run.

1001
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.670
What mean you, madam? I havemade no fault.

1002
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:05.530
Good madam, keep yourself withinyourself. The man is innocent.

1003
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.900
Some innocents 'scape not thethunderbolt.

1004
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:12.900
Melt Egypt into Nile,

1005
00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:17.870
and kindly creatures turn all toserpents!

1006
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:19.970
Call the slave again.

1007
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.830
Though I am mad, I will not bitehimócall!

1008
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:23.970
He is afeard to come.

1009
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:27.230
I will not hurt him!

1010
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:31.830
These hands do lack nobility

1011
00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.930
that they strike a meaner thanmyself

1012
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.970
since I myself have given myselfthe cause.

1013
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:44.330
Come hither, sir.

1014
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.530
Though it be honest, it is nevergood to bring bad news.

1015
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.970
Give to a gracious message anhost of tongues,

1016
00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:54.470
but let ill tidings tellthemselves when they be felt.

1017
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:55.570
I have done my duty.

1018
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:57.100
Is he married?

1019
00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:02.030
I cannot hate thee worser than Ido if thou again say "yes."

1020
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:03.300
He's married, madam.

1021
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:06.570
The gods confound thee!

1022
00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:08.930
Dost thou hold there still?

1023
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:10.100
Should I lie, madam?

1024
00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.570
O, I would thou didst,

1025
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.800
so half my Egypt were submerged

1026
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.500
and made a cistern for scaledsnakes!

1027
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.130
Go, get thee hence.

1028
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:19.870
Hadst thou Narcissus in thyface,

1029
00:50:19.870 --> 00:50:21.670
to me, thou wouldst appear mostugly.

1030
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:22.770
He is married?

1031
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:23.970
I crave your highness' pardon.

1032
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:25.430
He is married?

1033
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.400
Take no offense that I would notoffend you.

1034
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.830
To punish me for what you makeme do seems much unequal.

1035
00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:31.800
He is married to Octavia.

1036
00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.570
O, that his fault should make aknave of thee

1037
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.730
that art not what thou art sureof.

1038
00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.230
Get thee hence.

1039
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:43.670
The merchandise that thou hastbrought from Rome

1040
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:44.970
are all too dear for me.

1041
00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:48.470
Lie they upon my hand and beundone by 'em.

1042
00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:01.770
Good Your Highness, patience.

1043
00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:11.230
In praising Antony, I havedispraised Caesar.

1044
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.800
Many times, madam.

1045
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:21.330
I am paid for it now.

1046
00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:25.770
Lead me from hence. I faint.

1047
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.670
O Iras!

1048
00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:37.500
Charmian!

1049
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:45.030
'Tis no matter.

1050
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:49.330
Go to the fellow, good Alexas.

1051
00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:53.000
Bid him report the feature ofOctaviaó

1052
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.100
her years, her inclination.

1053
00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.870
Let him not leave out the colorof her hair.

1054
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:04.570
Bring me word quickly.

1055
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:09.500
Let him forever go.

1056
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:13.430
Let him not.

1057
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:20.300
Charmian, though he be paintedone way like a Gorgon,

1058
00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.270
the other way's a Mars.

1059
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:29.770
Bid you, Alexas, bring me wordhow tall she is.

1060
00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:37.500
Pity me, Charmian,

1061
00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.370
but do not speak to me.

1062
00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:45.330
To you all three,

1063
00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:48.270
the senators alone of this greatworld,

1064
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:51.300
chief factors for the gods,

1065
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.770
I do not know wherefore myfather should revengers want,

1066
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.830
having a son and friends,

1067
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:58.370
since Julius Caesar,

1068
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:00.400
who at Philippi the good Brutusghosted,

1069
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.530
there saw you laboring for him.

1070
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:07.430
What was it that moved paleCassius to conspire?

1071
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.300
And what made the all-honored,honest Roman Brutus,

1072
00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.000
with the armed rest, courtiersof beauteous freedom,

1073
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.700
to drench the capitol?

1074
00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.030
But that they would have one manbut a man?

1075
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:20.230
And that is it hath made me rigmy navy

1076
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:23.100
at whose burden the angeredocean foams,

1077
00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.970
with which I meant to scourgethe ingratitude

1078
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:29.530
that despiteful Rome cast on mynoble father.

1079
00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:31.100
Take your time.

1080
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.430
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey,with thy sails.

1081
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:37.970
We'll speak with thee at sea.

1082
00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:40.600
At land, thou know'st how muchwe do overcount thee.

1083
00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:41.900
At land, indeed,

1084
00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.900
thou dost overcount me of myfather's house.

1085
00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:47.200
But since the cuckoo builds notfor himself,

1086
00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:48.500
remain in it as thou mayst.

1087
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.300
Be pleased to tell usó

1088
00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:51.970
for this is from the presentó

1089
00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:53.870
how you take the offers we havesent you.

1090
00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:54.870
There's the point.

1091
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:56.670
Which do not be entreated to,

1092
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:58.930
but weigh what it is worthembraced.

1093
00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.530
And what may follow, to try alarger fortune.

1094
00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:05.170
You have made me offer ofSicily, Sardinia,

1095
00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:09.100
and I must rid all the sea ofpirates,

1096
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:13.000
then to send measures of wheatto Rome.

1097
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.800
This agreed upon to part withunhacked edges

1098
00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.000
and bear back our targesundinted.

1099
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
That's our offer.

1100
00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:26.530
Know, then, I came before youhere

1101
00:54:26.530 --> 00:54:28.930
a man prepared to take thisoffer,

1102
00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:31.100
but Mark Antony put me to someimpatience.

1103
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.200
Though I lose the praise of itby telling, you must know,

1104
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.000
when Caesar and your brotherwere at blows,

1105
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.100
your mother came to Sicily anddid find her welcome friendly.

1106
00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.130
I have heard it, Pompey,

1107
00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:44.770
and am well studied for aliberal thanks,

1108
00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:46.900
which I do owe you.

1109
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:50.500
Let me have your hand.

1110
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.000
I did not think, sir, to havemet you here.

1111
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.430
The beds in the east are soft,

1112
00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:00.930
and thanks to you that called metimelier than my purpose hither,

1113
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.970
for I have gained by it.

1114
00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:06.600
Since I saw you last, there is achange upon you.

1115
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.900
Well, I know not what counts

1116
00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:10.570
harsh fortune casts upon myface,

1117
00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:12.330
but in my bosom shall she nevercome

1118
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:13.770
to make my heart her vassal.

1119
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.300
Well met here.

1120
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.130
I hope so, Lepidus.

1121
00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:19.530
Thus we are agreed.

1122
00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:22.470
I crave our composition may bewritten and sealed between us.

1123
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:24.230
That's the next to do.

1124
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.100
We'll feast each other ere wepart.

1125
00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:27.600
And let's draw lots who shallbegin.

1126
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.630
That will I, Pompey.

1127
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:30.030
No, Antony, take the lot.

1128
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.130
But, first or last,

1129
00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.770
your fine Egyptian cookery shallhave the fame.

1130
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:39.030
I have heard Julius Caesar grewfat with feasting there.

1131
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:40.370
You have heard much.

1132
00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:41.670
I have fair meanings, sir.

1133
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:43.370
And fair words to them.

1134
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:45.330
Then so much have I heard.

1135
00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:47.470
And I have heard, Apollodoruscarriedó

1136
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.130
No more of that: he did so.

1137
00:55:50.130 --> 00:55:51.470
What, I pray you?

1138
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:54.800
A certain queen to Caesar in amattress.

1139
00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.770
I know thee now; how farestthou, soldier?

1140
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:02.370
Well, and well am like to do,

1141
00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:05.670
for I perceive four feasts aretoward.

1142
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.800
Let me shake thy hand.

1143
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.030
I've never hated thee.

1144
00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:11.200
I have seen thee fight, when Ihave envied thy behavior.

1145
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:15.100
Sir, I never loved you much, butI have praised you

1146
00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:18.630
when you have well deserved tentimes as much as I have said youdid.

1147
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:20.130
Enjoy thy plainness.

1148
00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:21.870
It nothing ill becomes thee.

1149
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:23.330
Will you lead, lords?

1150
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:34.470
You and I have known, sir.

1151
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:36.730
At sea, I think.

1152
00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:37.800
We have, sir.

1153
00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.330
You have done well by water.

1154
00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:43.030
And you by land.

1155
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:44.770
I will praise any man that willpraise me,

1156
00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:48.630
though it cannot be denied whatI have done by land.

1157
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:51.070
Nor what I have done by water.

1158
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.170
Yes, something you can deny foryour own safety.

1159
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.670
You have been a great thief bysea.

1160
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:57.130
And you by land.

1161
00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:58.630
There I deny my land service.

1162
00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:01.070
But give me your hand, Menas.

1163
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:08.330
If our eyes had authority,

1164
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:13.000
here they might take two thieveskissing.

1165
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.130
All men's faces are truewhatsome'er their hands are.

1166
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.930
But there is never a fair womanhas a true face.

1167
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:25.170
No slander; they steal hearts.

1168
00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:28.830
We came hither to fight withyou.

1169
00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:31.370
For my part, I am sorry it isturned to a drinking.

1170
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:34.200
Pompey doth this day laugh awayhis fortune.

1171
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:39.000
If he do, sure, he cannot weepit back again.

1172
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.070
You've said, sir.

1173
00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:45.570
We looked not for Mark Antonyhere.

1174
00:57:45.570 --> 00:57:48.330
Pray you, is he married toCleopatra?

1175
00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:50.970
Caesar's sister is calledOctavia.

1176
00:57:50.970 --> 00:57:54.730
True, sir; she was the wife ofCaius Marcellus.

1177
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:58.030
But she is now the wife ofMarcus Antonius.

1178
00:57:58.030 --> 00:57:59.130
Pray ye, sir?

1179
00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:00.870
'Tis true.

1180
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:03.430
Then is Caesar and he foreverknit together.

1181
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:06.700
If I were bound to divine ofthis unity,

1182
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.000
I would not prophesy so.

1183
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.800
I think the policy of thatpurpose made more in themarriage

1184
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.170
than the love of the parties.

1185
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:14.600
I think so too.

1186
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.970
But you shall find the band thatseems to tie their friendshiptogether

1187
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:20.730
will be the very strangler oftheir amity.

1188
00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:26.770
Octavia is of a holy, cold, andstill conversation.

1189
00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:29.030
Who would not have his wife so?

1190
00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:33.330
Not he that himself is not so,which is Mark Antony.

1191
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:36.930
He will to his Egyptian dishagain.

1192
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:41.130
Then shall the sighs of Octaviablow the fire up in Caesar.

1193
00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.030
And as I said before,

1194
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:45.400
that which is the strength oftheir amity

1195
00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:50.270
shall prove the immediate authorof their variance.

1196
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:53.570
Antony will use his affectionwhere it is.

1197
00:58:53.570 --> 00:58:56.230
He married but his occasionhere.

1198
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.600
And thus it may be.

1199
00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.270
Thus do they, sir.

1200
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:04.830
They take the flow of the Nile

1201
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:07.930
by certain scales in thepyramid.

1202
00:59:07.930 --> 00:59:11.000
They know by the height, thelowness, or the mean

1203
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.970
if dearth or foison follow.

1204
00:59:13.970 --> 00:59:16.900
The higher Nilus swells, themore it promises.

1205
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.600
As it ebbs, the seedsman, uponthe slime and ooze,

1206
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.530
scatters his grain and shortlycomes to harvest.

1207
00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:28.030
You have strange serpents there.

1208
00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:29.200
Ay, Lepidus.

1209
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:33.770
Your serpent of Egypt is brednow of your mud

1210
00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:36.800
by the operation of your sun.

1211
00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:40.230
So is your crocodile.

1212
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:41.800
A health to Lepidus!

1213
00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.570
I am not so well as I should be,

1214
00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:50.700
but I'll ne'er out.

1215
00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:53.800
Not till you have slept;

1216
00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.330
I fear me you'll be in tillthen.

1217
00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:59.000
Nay, certainly, I have heard

1218
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.170
the Ptolemies' pyramises arevery goodly things.

1219
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:08.800
Without contradiction, I haveheard that.

1220
01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.000
Pompey, a word.

1221
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.430
Say in mine ear; what is it?

1222
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:13.730
Forsake thy seat, I do beseechthee, Captain, and hear me speaka word.

1223
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:14.830
Forbear me till anon.

1224
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:18.470
This wine for Lepidus!

1225
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:23.200
What manner of thing is yourcrocodile?

1226
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:29.430
It is shaped, sir, like itself.

1227
01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:33.230
And it is as broad as it hathbreadth.

1228
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:37.630
It is just so high as it is

1229
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:41.170
and moves with its own organs.

1230
01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:44.330
It lives by that whichnourisheth it,

1231
01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.400
and the elements, once out ofit,

1232
01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.670
it transmigrates.

1233
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.000
What color is it of?

1234
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.470
Of its own color too.

1235
01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:00.700
'Tis a strange serpent.

1236
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:04.530
'Tis so, and the tears of it arewet.

1237
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:06.270
Will this description satisfyhim?

1238
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:09.970
With the health that Pompeygives him, else he is a veryepicure.

1239
01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:11.630
Go hang, sir, hang!

1240
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.770
Tell me of that? Away!

1241
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.070
Do as I bid you.

1242
01:01:15.070 --> 01:01:16.830
Where's this cup I called for?

1243
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:18.570
If for the sake of merit thouwilt hear me,

1244
01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:19.730
rise from thy stool.

1245
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:21.170
I think thou art mad.

1246
01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:27.070
These quicksands, Lepidus, keepoff them, for you sink.

1247
01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.970
The matter?

1248
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:31.070
I have ever held my cap off tothy fortunes.

1249
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:32.630
Thou hast served me with muchfaith.

1250
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:33.630
What else to say?

1251
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:35.230
Be jolly, lords.

1252
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.200
Wilt thou be lord of all theworld?

1253
01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.470
What sayest thou?

1254
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:41.200
Wilt thou be lord of the wholeworld that's twice?

1255
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:42.400
How should that be?

1256
01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.430
But entertain it, and thoughthou think me poor,

1257
01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.800
I am the man will give thee allthe world.

1258
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.600
Hast thou drunk well?

1259
01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.470
Now, Pompey, I have kept me fromthe cup.

1260
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:52.370
Thou art, if thou darest be, theearthly Jove.

1261
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:56.030
Whatever the ocean pales or skyinclips is thine if thou wilthave it.

1262
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:58.000
Show me which way.

1263
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.200
These three world-sharers, thesecompetitors are in thy vessel.

1264
01:02:01.830 --> 01:02:03.570
Let me cut the cable and, whenwe are put off,

1265
01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:06.630
fall to their throatsó all thereis thine.

1266
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:09.570
Ah, this thou shouldst have done

1267
01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:11.070
and not have spoke on it!

1268
01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:14.770
In me, 'tis villainy; in thee,it had been good service.

1269
01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:17.370
Thou must know 'tis not myprofit that doth lead minehonor.

1270
01:02:17.370 --> 01:02:19.800
Mine honor, it.

1271
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:22.570
Repent that e'er thy tongue hathso betrayed thine act.

1272
01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.370
Being done unknown,

1273
01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:27.570
I should afterwards have foundit well done

1274
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.630
but must condemn it now.

1275
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:33.900
Desist and drink.

1276
01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.470
For this, I'll never follow thypalled fortunes more.

1277
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:39.530
Who seeks and will not take whenonce 'tis offered

1278
01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.270
shall never find it more.

1279
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.170
This health for Lepidus!

1280
01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:52.470
Bear him ashore.

1281
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:53.800
I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

1282
01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.570
Here's to thee, Menas!

1283
01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:57.670
Enobarbus, welcome!

1284
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.070
Fill till the cup be hid.

1285
01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:00.870
There's a strong fellow, Menas.

1286
01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:02.070
Why?

1287
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.270
A' bears the third part of theworld in arms, man;

1288
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:06.400
see'st not?

1289
01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.900
The third part then is drunk.

1290
01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.300
Would it were all that it mightgo on wheels.

1291
01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:12.170
Drink thou; increase the reels.

1292
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:13.200
Come.

1293
01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.770
This is not yet an Alexandrianfeast.

1294
01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:16.200
It ripens towards it.

1295
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.930
Strike the vessels, ho?

1296
01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:21.130
Here's to Caesar!

1297
01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.400
I could well forbear it.

1298
01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.230
It's monstrous labor when I washmy brain

1299
01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:25.870
and it grows fouler.

1300
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.930
Be a child of the time.

1301
01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:29.830
Possess it, I'll make answer.

1302
01:03:29.830 --> 01:03:32.230
But I'd rather fast from allfour days

1303
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:33.430
than drink so much in one.

1304
01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:37.900
Ha, my brave emperor!

1305
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:41.270
Shall we dance now the Egyptianbacchanals

1306
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:42.770
and celebrate our drink?

1307
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:44.670
Let's have it, good soldier.

1308
01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:46.200
Come, let's all take hands

1309
01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.100
till that the conquering winehath steeped our sense

1310
01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.030
in soft and delicate Lethe.

1311
01:03:51.030 --> 01:03:52.270
All take hands.

1312
01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:57.830
Make battery to our ears withthe loud music.

1313
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:16.030
What would you more?

1314
01:04:18.270 --> 01:04:21.600
Pompey, good night.

1315
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:26.500
Good brother, let me request youoff.

1316
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.900
Our graver business frowns atthis levity.

1317
01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.600
Gentle lords, let's part.

1318
01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.800
You see we have burnt ourcheeks.

1319
01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.930
Strong Enobarb is weaker thanthe wine.

1320
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:41.170
And mine own tongue splits whatit speaks.

1321
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:46.330
The wild disguise hath almostanticked us all.

1322
01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:48.430
What needs more words?

1323
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:49.900
Good night.

1324
01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.570
Good Antony, your hand.

1325
01:04:55.570 --> 01:04:57.070
I'll try you on the shore.

1326
01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:59.730
And shall, sir; give us yourhand.

1327
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.700
O Antony, you have my father'shouse.

1328
01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:11.930
But, what? We are friends.

1329
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.330
Come, down into the boats.

1330
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:23.630
Take heed you fall not.

1331
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.730
Menas!

1332
01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:34.030
Menas!

1333
01:05:36.330 --> 01:05:37.970
I'll not on shore.

1334
01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:40.600
No, to my cabin.

1335
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:43.400
These drums, these trumpets,flutes!

1336
01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.430
What!

1337
01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:48.070
Let Neptune hear we bid a loudfarewell

1338
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.570
to these great fellows.

1339
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:10.830
You take from me a great part ofmyself.

1340
01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:12.930
Use me well in it.

1341
01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.500
Sister, prove such a wife as mythoughts make thee

1342
01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.330
and as my uarthest band shallpass on thy approof.

1343
01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:23.200
Most noble Antony, let not thepiece of virtue,

1344
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.270
which is set betwixt us as thecement of our love,

1345
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:27.900
to keep it builded, be the ramto batter the fortress of it.

1346
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.800
For better might we have lovedwithout this mean

1347
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.770
if on both parts this be notcherished.

1348
01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:33.900
Make me not offended in yourdistrust.

1349
01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:35.400
I have said.

1350
01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.200
You shall not find, though yoube therein curious,

1351
01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:41.770
the least cause for what youseem to fear.

1352
01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:43.830
So the gods keep you

1353
01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:46.570
and make the hearts of Romansserve your ends.

1354
01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:48.270
We will here part.

1355
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:52.000
Farewell, my dearest sister.

1356
01:06:53.370 --> 01:06:54.870
Fare thee well.

1357
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:56.600
The elements be kind to thee

1358
01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.700
and make thy spirits all ofcomfort.

1359
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.330
Fare thee well.

1360
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:04.100
My noble brother.

1361
01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.530
The April's in her eyes.

1362
01:07:06.530 --> 01:07:09.630
It is love's spring, and thesethe showers to bring it on.

1363
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:11.000
Be cheerful.

1364
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.300
Sir, look well to my husband'shouse and

1365
01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:17.470
What, Octavia?

1366
01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:20.770
I'll tell you in your ear.

1367
01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:24.970
Her tongue will not obey herheart,

1368
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:27.830
nor can her heart inform hertongue.

1369
01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:30.600
The swan's down-feather thatstands upon the swell

1370
01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.170
at full of tide and neither wayinclines.

1371
01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:35.900
Will Caesar weep?

1372
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.400
Why, Enobarbus,

1373
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.770
when Antony found Julius Caesardead,

1374
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:41.670
he cried almost to roaring,

1375
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:45.270
and he wept when at Philippi hefound Brutus slain.

1376
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.400
That year, indeed, he wastroubled with a rheum.

1377
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:53.300
Oh, sweet Octavia, you shallhear from me still.

1378
01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.770
The time shall not outgo mythinking on you.

1379
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:59.100
Come, sir, come.

1380
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.230
I'll wrestle with you in mystrength of love.

1381
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:04.670
Look, here I have you.

1382
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:08.030
Thus, I let you go and give youto the gods.

1383
01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:10.430
Adieu; be happy.

1384
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:14.100
Let all the number of the starsgive light to thy fair way.

1385
01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.330
Farewell. Farewell.

1386
01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:18.500
Farewell.

1387
01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.770
Where is the fellow?

1388
01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.030
Half afeard to come.

1389
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:33.330
Go to, go to.

1390
01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:34.870
Come hither, sir.

1391
01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:38.170
Come thou near.

1392
01:08:38.170 --> 01:08:41.330
Most gracious majestyó

1393
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:43.170
Didst thou behold Octavia?

1394
01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.530
Ay, dread queen.

1395
01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:45.530
Where?

1396
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:46.530
Madam, in Rome.

1397
01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:47.800
I looked her in the face

1398
01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:54.330
and saw her led between herbrother and Mark Antony.

1399
01:08:54.330 --> 01:08:55.630
Is she as tall as me?

1400
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.900
She is not, madam.

1401
01:08:57.900 --> 01:08:59.830
Didst hear her speak?

1402
01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:01.600
Is she shrill-tongued or low?

1403
01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:05.600
Madam, I heard her speak; she islow-voiced.

1404
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.170
That's not so good.

1405
01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:08.800
He cannot like her long.

1406
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.970
Like her! O Isis, 'tisimpossible.

1407
01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:16.800
I think so, Charmianó dull oftongue and dwarfish!

1408
01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.630
What majesty is in her gait?

1409
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.930
Remember, if ever thou look'dston majesty.

1410
01:09:22.930 --> 01:09:25.770
She creeps.

1411
01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:28.170
Her motion and her station areas one.

1412
01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:30.200
She shows a body rather than alife,

1413
01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.800
a statue than a breather.

1414
01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.830
Is this certain?

1415
01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:34.400
Or I have no observance.

1416
01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.700
Three in Egypt cannot makebetter note.

1417
01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:40.070
He's very knowing, I do perceiveit.

1418
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:42.100
There's nothing in her yet.

1419
01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:44.870
The fellow has good judgment.

1420
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:45.870
Excellent.

1421
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:47.730
Guess at her years, I prithee.

1422
01:09:47.730 --> 01:09:49.530
Madam, she was a widow.

1423
01:09:49.530 --> 01:09:54.470
Widow! Charmian, hark.

1424
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:56.800
And I do think she's thirty.

1425
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.070
Bear'st thou her face in mind?

1426
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:03.700
Is it long or round?

1427
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.730
Round, even to faultiness.

1428
01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:09.130
For the most part, too, they arefoolish that are so.

1429
01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:10.230
Her hair, what color?

1430
01:10:10.230 --> 01:10:11.330
Brown, madam,

1431
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:13.700
and her forehead as low as shewould wish it.

1432
01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:15.700
There's gold for thee.

1433
01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.030
Thou must not take my formersharpness ill.

1434
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:19.300
I will employ thee back again.

1435
01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:22.370
I find thee most fit forbusiness.

1436
01:10:22.370 --> 01:10:24.270
Go, make thee ready.

1437
01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:27.070
Our letters are prepared.

1438
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:28.730
A proper man.

1439
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.130
Indeed, he is so.

1440
01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:33.170
I repent me much that so Iharried him.

1441
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:37.400
Why, methinks, by him, thiscreature's no such thing.

1442
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.700
Nothing, madam.

1443
01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.870
The man hath seen some majestyand should know.

1444
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.730
Hath he seen majesty?

1445
01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:46.000
Isis else defend and serving youso long.

1446
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.070
I have one thing more to ask himyet, good Charmian.

1447
01:10:50.170 --> 01:10:51.770
But 'tis no matter.

1448
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:55.170
Thou shalt bring him to me whereI will write.

1449
01:10:55.170 --> 01:10:57.630
All may be well enough.

1450
01:10:57.630 --> 01:11:00.770
Nay, nay, Octavia, not onlythat.

1451
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:02.500
That were excusable,

1452
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.430
that and thousands more offsemblable import.

1453
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:09.700
But he hath waged new warsagainst Pompeyó

1454
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.570
made his will and read it topublic ear,

1455
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:12.970
spoke scantly of me

1456
01:11:12.970 --> 01:11:15.200
when perforce he could not butpay me terms of honor.

1457
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.700
My good lord, believe not all,

1458
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.670
or if you must believe, stomachnot all.

1459
01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:24.600
A more unhappy lady, if thisdivision chance,

1460
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.170
never stood between praying forboth parts.

1461
01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:31.230
The good gods will mock mepresently

1462
01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:35.000
when I shall pray, "O, bless mylord and husband!"

1463
01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.670
Undo that prayerby crying out asloud,

1464
01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:40.130
"O, bless my brother!"

1465
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:43.100
Husband, win; win, brother.

1466
01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:45.270
Prays, and destroys the prayer.

1467
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:49.770
No midway twixt these extremesat all.

1468
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.230
Gentle Octavia.

1469
01:11:57.530 --> 01:12:00.500
Let your best love draw to thatpoint

1470
01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.430
which seeks best to preserve it.

1471
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:06.600
If I lose mine honor, I losemyself.

1472
01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.170
Better I were not yours thanyours so branchless.

1473
01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:14.400
But, as you requested, yourselfshall go between us.

1474
01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:18.670
The meantime, lady,

1475
01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:23.400
I'll raise the preparation of awar shall stain your brother.

1476
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.970
Make your soonest haste so yourdesires are yours.

1477
01:12:27.970 --> 01:12:30.530
Thanks to my lord.

1478
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:36.100
The Jove of power make me mostweak, most weak.

1479
01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.070
Your reconciler.

1480
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:41.430
Wars twixt you twain would be asif the world should cleave

1481
01:12:41.430 --> 01:12:44.370
and that slain men should solderup the rift.

1482
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:51.730
When it appears to you wherethis begins,

1483
01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:54.530
turn your displeasure that way,

1484
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:57.000
for our faults can never be soequal

1485
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.830
that your love can equally movewith them.

1486
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:06.270
Provide your going, choose yourown company,

1487
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:08.970
and command what cost your hearthas mind to.

1488
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.130
How now, friend Eros.

1489
01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:25.900
There's strange news come, sir.

1490
01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.300
What, man?

1491
01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.500
Caesar and Lepidus have madewars upon Pompey.

1492
01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.630
This is old; what is thesuccess?

1493
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:38.500
Caesar, having made use of himin the wars against Pompey,

1494
01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:40.670
presently denied him rivality,

1495
01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:43.030
would not let him partake in theglory of the action,

1496
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:44.470
and, not resting here,

1497
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:47.630
accuses him of letters he hadformerly wrote to Pompey.

1498
01:13:47.630 --> 01:13:50.270
Upon his own appeal, seizes him.

1499
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:54.670
So the poor third is up tilldeath enlarge his confine.

1500
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:03.400
Then, world, thou hast a pair ofchaps, no more.

1501
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.700
Contemning Rome,

1502
01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.000
he has done all this and more inAlexandria.

1503
01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:09.100
Here's the manner of it.

1504
01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.200
In the marketplace, on atribunal silvered,

1505
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.670
Cleopatra and himself in chairsof gold

1506
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.430
were publicly enthroned.

1507
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:21.130
At the feet sat Caesarion, whomthey call my father's son

1508
01:14:21.130 --> 01:14:22.370
and all the unlawful issue

1509
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:24.930
that their lust since then hathmade between them.

1510
01:14:24.930 --> 01:14:27.630
Unto her he gave thestablishment of Egypt,

1511
01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:31.370
made her of lower Syria, Cyprus,Lydia, absolute queen.

1512
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:32.730
This in the public eye?

1513
01:14:32.730 --> 01:14:36.300
In the common showplace wherethey exercise.

1514
01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.130
His sons he there proclaimed thekings of kings.

1515
01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:43.330
Great Media, Parthia, andArmenia, he gave to Alexander.

1516
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:47.400
To Ptolemy, he assigned Syria,Cilicia, Phoenicia.

1517
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.370
She in the habiliments of thegoddess Isis that day appeared

1518
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:53.530
and oft before gave audience as'tis reported so.

1519
01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:55.100
Let Rome be thus informed.

1520
01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:58.130
Who, queasy with his insolencealready, will their goodthoughts call from him.

1521
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:59.400
The people knows it.

1522
01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.170
They have now received hisaccusations.

1523
01:15:01.170 --> 01:15:02.300
Who does he accuse?

1524
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.630
Caesaróand that having in SicilySextus Pompeius spoiled,

1525
01:15:05.630 --> 01:15:07.970
we had not rated him his part ofthe isle.

1526
01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:11.230
Then does he say he lent me someshipping unrestored.

1527
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:13.300
Lastly, he frets that Lepidus

1528
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.930
of the triumvirate should bedeposed

1529
01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:16.530
and being that we detain all hisrevenue.

1530
01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:17.730
Sir, this should be answered.

1531
01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:20.030
'Tis done already, and themessenger gone.

1532
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:23.570
I have told him, Lepidus wasgrown too cruel,

1533
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:26.500
that he his high authorityabused,

1534
01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.030
and did deserve his change,

1535
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:32.200
for what I have conquered, Igrant him part.

1536
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.870
But then in his Armenia andother of his conquered kingdoms,

1537
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:36.130
I demand the like.

1538
01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:37.600
He'll never yield to that.

1539
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.470
Nor must not then be yielded toin this.

1540
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:42.270
Hail, Caesar, and my lords!

1541
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:44.300
Hail, most dear Caesar!

1542
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:52.330
That ever I should call theecastaway.

1543
01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:55.470
You have not called me so, norhave you cause.

1544
01:15:56.900 --> 01:16:00.730
Why have you stolen upon usthus?

1545
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:04.030
You come not like Caesar'ssister.

1546
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:08.130
The wife of Antony should havean army for an usher,

1547
01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:09.930
and the neighs of horse to tellof her approach

1548
01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:11.900
long ere she did appear.

1549
01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.030
The trees by the way should haveborne men

1550
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:17.070
and expectation fainted, longingfor what it had not.

1551
01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:19.400
Nay, the dust should haveascended to the roof of heaven,

1552
01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:21.730
raised by your populous troops,

1553
01:16:21.730 --> 01:16:24.030
but you are come a market maidto Rome

1554
01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:26.200
and have prevented theostentation of our love,

1555
01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.900
which left unshown is often leftunloved.

1556
01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.070
We should have met you by seaand land,

1557
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:33.230
supplying every stage with anaugmented greeting.

1558
01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:35.730
Good my lord, to come thus was Inot constrained

1559
01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:37.500
but did it on my free will.

1560
01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:39.070
My lord, Mark Antony,

1561
01:16:39.070 --> 01:16:40.830
hearing that you prepared forwar,

1562
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:42.730
acquainted my grieved earwithal,

1563
01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:45.070
whereon, I begged his pardon forreturn.

1564
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:46.400
Which soon he granted,

1565
01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.070
being an obstruct 'tween hislust and him.

1566
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:49.130
Do not say so, my lord.

1567
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:50.170
I have eyes upon him,

1568
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:51.830
and his affairs come to me onthe wind.

1569
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:52.900
Where is he now?

1570
01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.430
My lord, in Athens.

1571
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:58.300
No, my most wronged sister.

1572
01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:02.770
Cleopatra hath nodded him toher.

1573
01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:05.330
He hath given his empire up to awhore,

1574
01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:08.200
who now are levying the kings ofthe earth for war.

1575
01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.330
Ay me, most wretched,

1576
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:14.230
that have my heart partedbetwixt two friends

1577
01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:16.200
that does afflict each other.

1578
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.470
Cheer your heart.

1579
01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.800
Be you not troubled with thetime

1580
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.870
which drives over your contentthese strong necessities.

1581
01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:32.330
But let determined things todestiny hold unbewailed theirway.

1582
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:34.170
Welcome to Rome.

1583
01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:36.970
Nothing more dear to me.

1584
01:17:36.970 --> 01:17:40.230
You are abused beyond the markof thought

1585
01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:42.370
and the high gods to do youjustice,

1586
01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:45.830
make them ministers of us andthose that love you.

1587
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:50.070
Best of comfort and ever welcometo us.

1588
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:51.430
Welcome, lady.

1589
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:52.600
Welcome, dear madam.

1590
01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:55.270
Each heart in Rome does love andpity you.

1591
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:59.030
Only the adulterous Antony, mostlarge in his abominations,

1592
01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:02.600
turns you off and gives hispotent regiment to a trull

1593
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:05.170
that noises it against us.

1594
01:18:05.170 --> 01:18:07.000
Is it so, sir?

1595
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.870
Most certain.

1596
01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:12.830
Sister, welcome.

1597
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:18.070
Pray you be ever known topatience.

1598
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:22.270
My dearest sister.

1599
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.570
I will be even with thee, doubtit not.

1600
01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:32.500
But why, why, why?

1601
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.200
Thou hast forspoke my being inthese wars

1602
01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.530
and say'st it is not fit.

1603
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:37.970
Well, is it? Is it?

1604
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:39.730
If not denounced against us,

1605
01:18:39.730 --> 01:18:42.370
why should not we be there inperson?

1606
01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:43.670
Well, I could reply,

1607
01:18:43.670 --> 01:18:46.070
if we should serve with horseand mares together,

1608
01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:47.330
the horse were merely lost.

1609
01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:48.470
What is't you say?

1610
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:51.200
Your presence needs must puzzleAntonyó

1611
01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:53.100
take from his heart, take fromhis brain,

1612
01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:55.530
from's time that should not thenbe spared.

1613
01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:57.100
He is already traduced forlevity.

1614
01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.330
And 'tis said in Rome thatPhotinus, an eunuch,

1615
01:19:00.330 --> 01:19:02.170
and your maids manage this war.

1616
01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:06.700
Sink Rome, and their tongues rotthat speak against us.

1617
01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.700
A charge we bear in the war

1618
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.270
and, as the president of mykingdom, will appear there for aman.

1619
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:13.030
Speak not against it; I will notstay behind.

1620
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:14.770
Is it not strange, Canidius,

1621
01:19:14.770 --> 01:19:16.400
that from Tarentum andBrundusium

1622
01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.400
he could so quickly cut theIonian Sea

1623
01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.000
and take in Toryne?

1624
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.470
You've heard on it, sweet?

1625
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.030
Celerity is never more admiredthan by the negligent.

1626
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:25.630
A good rebuke,

1627
01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.630
which might have well becomedthe best of men

1628
01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:29.100
to taunt at slackness.

1629
01:19:30.300 --> 01:19:33.430
Canidius, we will fight with himby sea.

1630
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:35.230
By sea! What else?

1631
01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:36.630
Why will my lord do so?

1632
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:38.370
For that he dares us to it.

1633
01:19:38.370 --> 01:19:40.130
Your ships are not well manned.

1634
01:19:40.130 --> 01:19:42.530
Your mariners are muleters,reapers,

1635
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:44.130
people engrossed by swiftimpress.

1636
01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:46.870
In Caesar's fleet are those thatoften have against Pompeyfought.

1637
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:48.770
Their ships are yare; yours,heavy.

1638
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:51.700
No disgrace will fall you forrefusing him at sea,

1639
01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.000
being prepared for land.

1640
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.400
By sea, by sea.

1641
01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:56.130
Most worthy sir, you thereinthrow away

1642
01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:58.230
the absolute soldiership youhave by land.

1643
01:19:58.230 --> 01:19:59.900
I'll fight at sea!

1644
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:04.470
I have sixty sails; Caesar, nonebetter.

1645
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:07.170
Our overplus of shipping will weburn

1646
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:09.570
and with the rest full-mannedfrom the head of Actium

1647
01:20:09.570 --> 01:20:11.300
beat the approaching Caesar.

1648
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:15.330
But if we fail, we then can doit at land.

1649
01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:16.330
How now, soldier?

1650
01:20:16.330 --> 01:20:18.530
O noble emperor, do not fight bysea.

1651
01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:20.930
Trust not to rotten planks.

1652
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:23.570
Do you misdoubt this sword,these my wounds?

1653
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:26.430
Let the Egyptians andPhoenicians go a-ducking.

1654
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:27.630
We are used to conquer,

1655
01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:29.830
standing on the earth, fightingfoot-to-foot.

1656
01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:31.130
Well, well, away!

1657
01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:33.230
Set we our squadrons on yondside of the hill

1658
01:20:33.230 --> 01:20:34.530
in eye of Caesar's battle

1659
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.970
from which place we may thenumber of the ships behold

1660
01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:39.070
and so proceed accordingly.

1661
01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:46.330
Strike not by land; keep whole.

1662
01:20:46.330 --> 01:20:49.500
Provoke not battle till we havedone at sea.

1663
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:52.100
Do not exceed the prescript ofthis scroll.

1664
01:20:53.670 --> 01:20:56.470
Our fortune lies upon this jump.

1665
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.730
Hark! The land bids me tread nomore upon it.

1666
01:21:43.730 --> 01:21:46.330
It is ashamed to bear me!

1667
01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:51.930
Friends, come hither.

1668
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:58.470
I am so lated in the world thatI have lost my way forever.

1669
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:00.270
I have a ship laden with gold.

1670
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:01.570
Take that, divide it;

1671
01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:03.030
fly, and make your peace withCaesar.

1672
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:04.070
Fly? Not we.

1673
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:05.700
I have fled myself

1674
01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:08.770
and have instructed cowards torun and show their shoulders.

1675
01:22:08.770 --> 01:22:10.770
Friends, begone.

1676
01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:13.200
I have myself resolved upon acourse

1677
01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.470
which has no need of you.

1678
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:15.570
Begone.

1679
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:18.000
My treasure's in the harbor.Take it.

1680
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:26.300
O, I followed that I blush tolook upon.

1681
01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:31.900
Leave me, I pray, a little.

1682
01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.000
Pray you, now.

1683
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.100
Nay, do so, for indeed I havelost command.

1684
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:40.330
Therefore, I pray you, I'll seeyou by and by.

1685
01:22:44.970 --> 01:22:47.530
Nay, gentle madam, to him,comfort him.

1686
01:22:47.530 --> 01:22:48.930
Do, most dear queen.

1687
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.700
Do! Why, what else?

1688
01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.770
No, no, no, no, no.

1689
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.500
The queen, my lord, the queen.

1690
01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.630
Go to him, madam. Speak withhim.

1691
01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:01.030
He is unqualitied with veryshame.

1692
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:04.630
Well then, sustain me, O!

1693
01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:08.100
Most noble sir, arise; the queenapproaches.

1694
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:10.470
Her head's declined and deathwill seize her,

1695
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:12.200
but your comfort makes therescue.

1696
01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.130
I have offended reputation, amost unnoble swerving.

1697
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:19.070
Sir, the queen.

1698
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:28.600
O whither hast thou led me,Egypt?

1699
01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.330
See how I convey my shame out ofthine eyes

1700
01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:33.500
by looking back what I have leftbehind,

1701
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.270
destroyed in dishonor.

1702
01:23:35.270 --> 01:23:39.030
O my lord, my lord,

1703
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:41.970
forgive my fearful sails!

1704
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:45.200
I little thought you would havefollowed.

1705
01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:47.300
Egypt, thou knew'st too well

1706
01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:50.030
my heart was to thy rudder tiedby the strings

1707
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:51.800
and thou shouldst tow me after.

1708
01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.670
O'er my spirit thy fullsupremacy thou knew'st

1709
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:56.170
and that thy beck might

1710
01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:58.000
from the bidding of the godscommand me.

1711
01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.100
O, my pardon.

1712
01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:05.930
Now I must to the young man sendhumble treaties,

1713
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:09.030
dodge and palter in the shiftsof lowness,

1714
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:11.070
who with half the bulk of theworld

1715
01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:16.630
played as I pleased, making andmarring fortunes.

1716
01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:19.600
You did know how much you weremy conqueror

1717
01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.230
and that my sword, made weak bymy affection,

1718
01:24:22.230 --> 01:24:23.970
would obey it on all cause.

1719
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:27.500
Pardon, pardon.

1720
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:39.430
Fall not a tear, I say;

1721
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:43.830
one of them rates all that iswon and lost.

1722
01:24:47.070 --> 01:24:49.570
Give me a kiss.

1723
01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.000
Even this repays me.

1724
01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:06.430
We sent our schoolmaster; is hecome back?

1725
01:25:08.170 --> 01:25:11.200
Love, I am full of lead.

1726
01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:14.630
Some wine within there and ourviands!

1727
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:25.030
Fortune knows we scorn her mostwhen most she offers blows.

1728
01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:27.730
Let him appear that's come fromAntony.

1729
01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:28.870
Know you him?

1730
01:25:28.870 --> 01:25:30.970
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmasteró

1731
01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:32.830
an argument that he is plucked

1732
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:35.500
when hither he sends so poor apinion of his wing

1733
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.630
which had superfluous kings formessengers

1734
01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:39.730
not many moons gone by.

1735
01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:42.030
Approach and speak.

1736
01:25:42.030 --> 01:25:44.930
Such as I am, I come fromAntony.

1737
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:48.870
I was of late as petty to hisends as is the morn-dew

1738
01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:51.830
on the myrtle leaf to his grandsea.

1739
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:53.800
Be it so; declare thine office.

1740
01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.500
Lord of his fortunes, he salutesthee

1741
01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.330
and requires to live in Egypt,

1742
01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:01.870
which not granted, he lessenshis requests;

1743
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:03.830
and to thee sues to let himbreathe

1744
01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:07.670
between the heavens and earth, aprivate man in Athensó

1745
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:09.030
this for him.

1746
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:11.730
Next, Cleopatra does confess thygreatness,

1747
01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:13.170
submits her to thy might,

1748
01:26:13.170 --> 01:26:17.370
and of thee, craves the circleof the Ptolemies for her heirs,

1749
01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:19.700
now hazarded to thy grace.

1750
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:22.270
For Antony,

1751
01:26:26.530 --> 01:26:29.270
I have no ears to his request.

1752
01:26:30.230 --> 01:26:33.370
The queen of audience nor desireshall fail,

1753
01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:37.070
so she from Egypt drive herall-disgraced friend,

1754
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:39.600
or take his life there.

1755
01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.670
This if she perform, she shallnot sue unheard.

1756
01:26:44.670 --> 01:26:46.030
So to them both.

1757
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:48.830
Fortune pursue thee!

1758
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:51.070
Bring him through the bands.

1759
01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:03.370
To try thy eloquence now 'tistime; dispatch.

1760
01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:08.270
From Antony win Cleopatra;promise.

1761
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:10.900
And in our name, what sherequires.

1762
01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:16.230
Add more from thine invention,offers.

1763
01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:18.770
Women are not in their bestfortunes strong,

1764
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:21.970
but want will perjure thenever-touched vestal.

1765
01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:26.530
Try thy cunning, Thyreus.

1766
01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:28.770
Make thine own edict for thypains,

1767
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:30.230
which we will answer as a law.

1768
01:27:30.230 --> 01:27:31.770
Caesar, I go.

1769
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:36.700
Observe how Antony becomes hisflaw,

1770
01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:39.870
and what thou think'st his veryaction speaks

1771
01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:42.470
in every power that moves.

1772
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:44.230
Caesar, I shall.

1773
01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.570
What shall we do, Enobarbus?

1774
01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:55.700
Think and die.

1775
01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:57.830
Is Antony or we in fault inthis?

1776
01:27:57.830 --> 01:28:01.870
Antony only, that would make hiswill lord of his reason.

1777
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:04.470
What though you fled from thatgreat face of war,

1778
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:06.400
whose several ranges frightedeach other,

1779
01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:07.670
why should he follow?

1780
01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:09.300
The itch of his affection

1781
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.400
should not then have nicked hiscaptainship

1782
01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:14.700
at such a point when half tohalf the world opposed,

1783
01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:17.000
he being the meered question.

1784
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.770
'Twas a shame no less than washis loss,

1785
01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:24.170
to course your flying flags andleave his navy gazing.

1786
01:28:24.170 --> 01:28:25.270
Prithee, peace.

1787
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:26.500
Is that his answer?

1788
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.670
Aye, my lord.

1789
01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:29.900
The queen shall then havecourtesy,

1790
01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:31.500
so she shall yield us up.

1791
01:28:31.500 --> 01:28:32.800
He says so.

1792
01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:33.900
Well, let her know it.

1793
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:38.070
To the boy, Caesar send thisgrizzled head,

1794
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:42.270
and he will fill thy wishes tothe brim with principalities.

1795
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:44.730
That head, my lord?

1796
01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:46.030
To him again;

1797
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:49.130
tell him he wears the rose ofyouth upon him

1798
01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:52.030
from which the world should notesomething particular.

1799
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:56.400
His coin, ships, legions may bea coward's,

1800
01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.530
whose ministers would prevailunder the service of a child

1801
01:28:59.530 --> 01:29:01.670
as soon as in the command ofCaesar.

1802
01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:05.930
I dare him, therefore, to layhis gay comparisons apart

1803
01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:10.330
and answer me declined, swordagainst swordó

1804
01:29:10.330 --> 01:29:12.800
ourselves alone.

1805
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:15.200
I'll write it; follow me.

1806
01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:17.830
Yes, like enough,

1807
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:20.700
high-battled Caesar will unstatehis happiness

1808
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:23.500
and be staged to the showagainst a sworder.

1809
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:28.530
I see men's judgments are aparcel of their fortunes.

1810
01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.900
And things outward do draw theinward quality after them

1811
01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.800
to suffer all alike that heshould dream,

1812
01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:36.430
knowing all measures

1813
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:40.730
the full Caesar will answer hisemptiness.

1814
01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:45.830
Caesar, thou hast subdued his isjudgment too.

1815
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:48.300
A messenger from Caesar.

1816
01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.830
What, no more ceremony?

1817
01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.770
See, my women.

1818
01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:57.130
Against the blown rose may theystop their nose

1819
01:29:57.130 --> 01:29:59.530
that kneeled unto the buds.

1820
01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:02.070
Admit him, sir.

1821
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:05.700
Mine honesty and I begin tosquare.

1822
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:11.870
The loyalty well held to foolsdoes make our faith mere folly.

1823
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:15.270
Yet he that can endure to followwith allegiance a fallen lord

1824
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:17.570
does conquer him that did hismaster conquer

1825
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:22.400
and earns a place in the story.

1826
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.000
Caesar's will?

1827
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.600
Hear it apart.

1828
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.770
None but friends; say boldly.

1829
01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:31.400
So haply are they friends toAntony.

1830
01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:34.070
He needs as many, sir, as Caesarhas or needs not us.

1831
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:37.830
If Caesar please, our masterwill leap to be his friend,

1832
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:40.570
for us, you know, whose he is weare,

1833
01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:43.100
and that is Caesar's.

1834
01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:44.330
So.

1835
01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:48.370
Thus then, thou most renowned,

1836
01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:51.330
Caesar entreats not to considerin what case thou stand'st

1837
01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:53.830
further than he is Caesar.

1838
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:57.300
Go on, right royal.

1839
01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:00.300
He knows that you embrace notAntony as you did love

1840
01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:03.430
but as you feared him.

1841
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:04.730
O!

1842
01:31:04.730 --> 01:31:07.600
The scars upon your honor,therefore, he does pity

1843
01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.700
as constrained blemishes, not asdeserved.

1844
01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.730
He is a god and knows what ismost right.

1845
01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:17.370
Mine honor was not yielded butconquered merely.

1846
01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:20.370
To be sure of that, I will askAntony.

1847
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:29.070
Sir, sir, thou art so leaky thatwe must leave thee to thysinking,

1848
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:33.070
for thy dearest quit thee.

1849
01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:36.670
Shall I say to Caesar what yourequire of him?

1850
01:31:36.670 --> 01:31:39.470
For he partly begs to be desiredto give.

1851
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:41.800
It much would please him that ofhis fortunes

1852
01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.800
you should make a staff to leanupon.

1853
01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.500
But it would warm his spirits

1854
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:47.600
to hear from me that you hadleft Antony

1855
01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.770
and put yourself under hisshroud,

1856
01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.430
the universal landlord.

1857
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:52.430
What's your name?

1858
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:53.700
My name is Thyreus.

1859
01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:55.970
Most kind messenger, say togreat Caesar this:

1860
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:58.570
in deputation, I kiss hisconquering hand.

1861
01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:00.530
Tell him, I am prompt to lay mycrown at his feet

1862
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:01.900
and there to kneel.

1863
01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:05.030
Tell him from his all-obeyingbreath, I hear the doom ofEgypt.

1864
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:06.400
'Tis your noblest course.

1865
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.500
Wisdom and fortune combatingtogether.

1866
01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:10.630
If that the former dare but whatit can,

1867
01:32:10.630 --> 01:32:12.270
no chance may shake it.

1868
01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:15.500
Give me grace to lay my duty onyour hand.

1869
01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:17.230
Your Caesar's father oft,

1870
01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:19.100
when he hath mused of takingkingdoms in,

1871
01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:24.300
bestowed his lips on thatunworthy place as it rainedkisses.

1872
01:32:24.300 --> 01:32:27.630
Favors, by Jove that thunders!

1873
01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:30.130
What art thou, fellow?

1874
01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:32.770
One that but performs thebidding of the fullest man

1875
01:32:32.770 --> 01:32:34.870
and worthiest to have commandobeyed.

1876
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:36.370
You will be whipped.

1877
01:32:37.770 --> 01:32:40.000
Approach there.

1878
01:32:40.970 --> 01:32:43.570
Ah, you kite!

1879
01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:47.330
Now gods and devils!

1880
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:48.670
Authority melts from me.

1881
01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:51.530
Of late when I cried "ho" likeboys unto a muss,

1882
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:54.030
kings would start forth and cry,"Your will?"

1883
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:58.200
Have you no ears? I am Antonyyet!

1884
01:32:59.530 --> 01:33:02.000
Take hence this Jack and whiphim.

1885
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.370
'Tis better playing with alion's whelp

1886
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:06.570
than with an old one dying.

1887
01:33:06.570 --> 01:33:08.970
Moon and stars! Whip him.

1888
01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:12.030
Were it twenty of the greatesttributaries that do acknowledgeCaesar,

1889
01:33:12.030 --> 01:33:15.300
should I find them so saucy withthe hand of she here.

1890
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:18.370
What's her name? Since she wasCleopatra?

1891
01:33:18.370 --> 01:33:19.870
Whip him, fellows, till like aboy

1892
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:22.630
you see him cringe his face andwhine aloud for mercy.

1893
01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:23.670
Take him hence.

1894
01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:24.800
Mark Antony!

1895
01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:26.600
Tug him awayóbeing whipped,bring him again.

1896
01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.570
This Jack of Caesar's shall bearus an errand to him.

1897
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:34.000
You were half blasted ere I knewyou.

1898
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.470
Ha! Have I my pillow leftunpressed in Rome

1899
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:39.700
forborne the getting of a lawfulrace

1900
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.170
and by a gem of women

1901
01:33:41.170 --> 01:33:43.370
to be abused by one that lookson feeders?

1902
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:44.870
Good my lordó

1903
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:46.900
You have been a boggler ever.

1904
01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:50.030
But when we in our viciousnessgrow hardó

1905
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:53.530
O misery on it then the wisegods seel our eyes,

1906
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:56.230
in our own filth, drop our clearjudgments,

1907
01:33:56.230 --> 01:33:57.630
make us adore our errors,

1908
01:33:57.630 --> 01:34:00.200
laugh at us while we strut toour confusion.

1909
01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.900
O, is it come to this?

1910
01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:08.530
I found you as a morsel coldupon dead Caesar's trencher.

1911
01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:11.930
Nay, you were a fragment ofCneius Pompey's.

1912
01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:15.330
Besides what hotter hours,unregistered in vulgar fame,

1913
01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:17.000
you have luxuriously picked out.

1914
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.300
For I am sure, though,

1915
01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:19.900
you can guess what temperanceshould be,

1916
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.170
you know not what it is.

1917
01:34:21.170 --> 01:34:22.370
Wherefore is this?

1918
01:34:22.370 --> 01:34:24.530
To let a fellow that will takerewards

1919
01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:26.600
and say "God quit you!"

1920
01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.930
be familiar with my playfellow,your handó

1921
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:34.230
this kingly seal and plighter ofhigh hearts!

1922
01:34:34.230 --> 01:34:37.670
O, that I were upon the hill ofBasan,

1923
01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:41.230
to outroar the horned herd,

1924
01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:43.000
for I have savage cause.

1925
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.370
And to proclaim it civilly werelike a haltered neck

1926
01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:50.330
which does the hangman thank forbeing yare about him.

1927
01:34:50.330 --> 01:34:51.400
Is he whipped?

1928
01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.870
Soundly, my lord.

1929
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:56.000
Cried he and begged a pardon?

1930
01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.170
He did ask a favor.

1931
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:04.930
If that thy father live,

1932
01:35:04.930 --> 01:35:08.630
let him repent thou wast notmade his daughter,

1933
01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:11.670
and be thou sorry to followCaesar in his triumph

1934
01:35:11.670 --> 01:35:13.800
since thou hast been whipped forfollowing him.

1935
01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:19.270
Henceforth, the white hand of alady fever thee,

1936
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:20.630
shake thou to look on it.

1937
01:35:20.630 --> 01:35:23.470
Get thee back to Caesar; tellhim thy entertainment.

1938
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:25.930
Look, thou say he makes me angrywith him

1939
01:35:25.930 --> 01:35:28.300
for he seems proud anddisdainful,

1940
01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:32.830
harping on what I am, not whathe knew I was.

1941
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:35.030
He makes me angry!

1942
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:38.200
And at this time most easy 'tisto do it

1943
01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:40.070
when my good stars that were myformer guides

1944
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:41.600
have empty left their orbs

1945
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:46.070
and shot their fires into theabysm of hell.

1946
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:49.830
If he mislike my speech and whatis done,

1947
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:52.930
tell him he has Hipparchus, myenfranched bondman,

1948
01:35:52.930 --> 01:35:56.530
whom he may at pleasure whip, orhang, or torture

1949
01:35:56.530 --> 01:35:58.000
as he shall like to quit me.

1950
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.600
Urge it thou. Hence, with thystripes, begone.

1951
01:36:06.170 --> 01:36:11.870
Have you done yet?

1952
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:16.170
Alack, our terrene moon is noweclipsed.

1953
01:36:16.170 --> 01:36:20.030
And it portends alone the fallof Antony.

1954
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:22.500
I must stay his time.

1955
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:28.600
To flatter Caesar would youmingle eyes

1956
01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:31.600
with one that ties his points?

1957
01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:36.130
Not know me yet?

1958
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:43.500
Coldhearted toward me?

1959
01:36:44.670 --> 01:36:49.030
Ah, dear, if I be so,

1960
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:53.670
from my cold heart let heavenengender hail,

1961
01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:56.070
and poison it in the source,

1962
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:58.430
and the first stone drop in myneck

1963
01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:01.330
as it determines so dissolve mylife.

1964
01:37:01.330 --> 01:37:03.530
The next Caesarion smite,

1965
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:06.100
till by degrees the memory of mywomb,

1966
01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:07.970
together with my brave Egyptiansall,

1967
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:10.570
by the discandying of thispelleted storm,

1968
01:37:10.570 --> 01:37:12.070
lie graveless

1969
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:16.500
till the flies and gnats of Nilehave buried them for prey.

1970
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.330
I am satisfied.

1971
01:37:25.730 --> 01:37:31.200
Caesar sits down in Alexandria,where I will oppose his fate.

1972
01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:35.270
Our force by land hath noblyheld.

1973
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:37.400
Our navy, too, have knit again,

1974
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:41.470
and fleet threatening mostsea-like.

1975
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:44.170
Where hast thou been, my heart?

1976
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.670
Dost thou hear, lady?

1977
01:37:49.670 --> 01:37:54.270
If from the field I shall returnonce more to kiss these lips,

1978
01:37:54.270 --> 01:37:57.070
I will appear in blood.

1979
01:37:57.070 --> 01:38:00.430
I and my sword will earn ourchronicle.

1980
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:02.100
There's hope in it yet.

1981
01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:04.570
That's my brave lord.

1982
01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:07.930
I will be treble-sinewed,hearted, breathed,

1983
01:38:07.930 --> 01:38:09.530
and fight maliciously.

1984
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:11.630
For when mine hours were niceand lucky,

1985
01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:14.370
men did ransom lives of me forjests.

1986
01:38:14.370 --> 01:38:16.030
But now I'll set my teeth

1987
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:19.900
and send to darkness all thatstop me.

1988
01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.570
Come, let's have one other gaudynight.

1989
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:25.730
Call to me all my sad captains.

1990
01:38:25.730 --> 01:38:27.230
Fill our bowls once more.

1991
01:38:27.230 --> 01:38:30.030
Let's mock the midnight bell

1992
01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:31.500
It is my birthday.

1993
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.100
I had thought to have held itpoor,

1994
01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:37.930
but since my lord is Antonyagain,

1995
01:38:37.930 --> 01:38:41.430
I will be Cleopatra.

1996
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:43.600
We will yet do well.

1997
01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.930
Call all his noble captains tomy lord.

1998
01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:48.030
Do so; we'll speak to them.

1999
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:51.470
And tonight I'll force the winepeep through their scars.

2000
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:54.670
Come, my queen, there's sap init yet.

2001
01:38:54.670 --> 01:38:57.770
The next time I do fight I'llmake death love me,

2002
01:38:57.770 --> 01:39:01.830
for I will contend even with hispestilent scythe.

2003
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:12.000
Now he'll outstare thelightning.

2004
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.400
To be furious is to be frightedout of fear.

2005
01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:19.330
And in that mood, the dove willpeck the estridge.

2006
01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:21.600
And I see still a diminution

2007
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:24.870
in our captain's brain restoreshis heart.

2008
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:28.200
When valor preys on reason,

2009
01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.270
it eats the sword it fightswith.

2010
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:39.730
I will seek some way to leavehim.

2011
01:39:49.630 --> 01:39:51.630
He calls me boy

2012
01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:55.000
and chides as he had power tobeat me out of Egypt.

2013
01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.170
My messenger he hath whippedwith rods,

2014
01:39:58.170 --> 01:40:04.570
dares me to personal combat,Caesar to Antony.

2015
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:13.470
Let the old ruffian know I havemany other ways to die,

2016
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:15.100
meantime laugh at his challenge.

2017
01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:16.100
Caesar must think,

2018
01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.830
when one so great begins torage,

2019
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:20.030
he's hunted even to falling.

2020
01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:23.300
Give him no breath but now makeboot of his distraction.

2021
01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:28.600
Never anger made good guard foritself.

2022
01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.300
Let our best heads know thattomorrow

2023
01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.130
the last of many battles we meanto fight.

2024
01:40:32.130 --> 01:40:35.930
Within our files there are ofthose

2025
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:37.470
that served Mark Antony butlateó

2026
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:40.370
enough to fetch him in.

2027
01:40:40.370 --> 01:40:41.430
See it done.

2028
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:44.500
And feast the army.

2029
01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:47.370
We have store to do it, and theyhave earned the waste.

2030
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.530
Poor Antony.

2031
01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:58.300
He will not fight with me,Domitius.

2032
01:40:58.300 --> 01:40:59.870
No.

2033
01:40:59.870 --> 01:41:01.470
And why should he not?

2034
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:04.600
He thinks being 20 times ofbetter fortune,

2035
01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:07.830
he is 20 men to 1.

2036
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:12.170
Tomorrow, soldier, by sea andland I'll fight,

2037
01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:14.330
or I will live or bathe my dyinghonor

2038
01:41:14.330 --> 01:41:16.600
in the blood shall make it liveagain.

2039
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.900
Will thou fight well?

2040
01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:21.070
I'll strike and cry, "Take all."

2041
01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:23.100
Well said; come on.

2042
01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:24.530
Call forth my householdservants.

2043
01:41:24.530 --> 01:41:26.700
Let's tonight be bounteous atour meal.

2044
01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.900
Oh, give me thy hand.

2045
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:31.370
Thou hast been rightly honest.

2046
01:41:31.370 --> 01:41:32.630
So hast thou.

2047
01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:36.730
Thou and thou and thou.

2048
01:41:36.730 --> 01:41:38.900
You have served me well,

2049
01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:40.600
and kings have been yourfellows.

2050
01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:42.100
What means this?

2051
01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.530
'Tis one of those odd tricks

2052
01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.770
which sorrow shoots out of themind.

2053
01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:49.030
And thou art honest too.

2054
01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:51.430
I wish I could be made so manymen,

2055
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:54.330
and all of you clapped uptogether in an Antony

2056
01:41:54.330 --> 01:41:57.470
that I might do you service sogood as you have done.

2057
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:58.500
The gods forbid.

2058
01:41:58.500 --> 01:41:59.700
Well..

2059
01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:02.570
Well, my good fellows, wait onme tonight.

2060
01:42:02.570 --> 01:42:05.200
Scant not my cups and make asmuch of me

2061
01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.070
as when mine empire was yourfellow too

2062
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:08.730
and suffered my command.

2063
01:42:08.730 --> 01:42:09.730
What does he mean?

2064
01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:11.970
To make his followers weep.

2065
01:42:11.970 --> 01:42:14.030
Tend me tonight.

2066
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:15.930
May be it is the period of yourduty.

2067
01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:17.830
Haply you shall not see me moreó

2068
01:42:17.830 --> 01:42:19.230
or if, a mangled shadow.

2069
01:42:19.230 --> 01:42:23.730
Perchance tomorrow you'll serveanother master.

2070
01:42:23.730 --> 01:42:26.370
I look on you as one that takeshis leave.

2071
01:42:26.370 --> 01:42:29.230
Mine honest friends, I turn younot away.

2072
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:32.000
But like a master married toyour good service,

2073
01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.270
stay till death.

2074
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:37.230
Tend me tonight two hours, I askno more.

2075
01:42:37.230 --> 01:42:39.000
And the gods yield you for it.

2076
01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.170
What mean you, sir, to give themthis discomfort?

2077
01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:45.000
Look, they weep.

2078
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:48.370
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed.

2079
01:42:48.370 --> 01:42:52.670
For shame, transform us not towomen.

2080
01:42:52.670 --> 01:42:54.270
Ho, ho, ho!

2081
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:57.230
Now the witch take me if I meantit thus!

2082
01:42:57.230 --> 01:42:58.870
Oh.

2083
01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:02.170
Grace grow where those dropsfall!

2084
01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:06.170
My hearty friends, you take mein too dolorous a sense.

2085
01:43:06.170 --> 01:43:08.530
For I spake to you for yourcomfort,

2086
01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:11.870
did desire you to burn thisnight with torches.

2087
01:43:11.870 --> 01:43:15.300
Know, my hearts, I hope well oftomorrow

2088
01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:18.900
and will lead you where ratherI'll expect victorious life

2089
01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:22.570
than death and honor.

2090
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:26.030
Let's to supper, come, and drownconsideration.

2091
01:43:46.030 --> 01:43:50.530
Eros! Mine armor, Eros!

2092
01:43:50.530 --> 01:43:52.700
Sleep a little.

2093
01:43:52.700 --> 01:43:57.500
No, my chuck.

2094
01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:00.630
Eros, come; mine armor, Eros!

2095
01:44:00.630 --> 01:44:03.300
Come good fellow, put mine ironon.

2096
01:44:03.300 --> 01:44:05.600
If fortune be not ours today,

2097
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.530
it is because we brave her;come.

2098
01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:09.570
Nay, I'll help too.

2099
01:44:09.570 --> 01:44:11.330
What's this for?

2100
01:44:11.330 --> 01:44:12.130
Ah, let be, let be!

2101
01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:22.170
Thou art the armorer of myheart.

2102
01:44:22.170 --> 01:44:22.830
Thou art the armorer of myheart.

2103
01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:23.730
False, false; this, this.

2104
01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:27.300
Sooth, la, I'll help, thus itmust be.

2105
01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:29.370
Well, well, we shall thrive now.

2106
01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:31.270
Seest thou, my good fellow?

2107
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:33.230
Go put on thy defences.

2108
01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:34.330
Briefly, sir.

2109
01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:35.670
Is not this buckled well?

2110
01:44:35.670 --> 01:44:37.200
Rarely, rarely.

2111
01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.570
He that unbuckles this till wedo please

2112
01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:41.330
to daff it for our repose shallhear a storm.

2113
01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:42.700
Thou fumblest, Eros.

2114
01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:46.030
My queen's a squire more tightat this than thou.

2115
01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.170
Dispatch.

2116
01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:57.270
O love, that thou could see mywars today

2117
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:59.030
and knew'st the royaloccupation,

2118
01:44:59.030 --> 01:45:00.830
thou should see a workman in it.

2119
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:03.000
The morn is fair. Good morrow,general.

2120
01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.570
This morning, like the spirit ofa youth

2121
01:45:04.570 --> 01:45:07.670
that means to be of note, beginsbetimes.

2122
01:45:07.670 --> 01:45:11.870
So, so; come, give me that.

2123
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:14.200
Oh, oh, this way.

2124
01:45:26.130 --> 01:45:27.500
Fare thee well, dame.

2125
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:32.230
Whatever becomes of me, this isa soldier's kiss.

2126
01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:47.730
He goes forth gallantly.

2127
01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:50.800
That he and Caesar mightdetermine this great war

2128
01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:54.300
in single fight, then Antonyó

2129
01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:59.770
But nowó Well, on.

2130
01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:03.270
The gods make this a happy dayto Antony.

2131
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:06.470
Would thou and those thy scarshad once prevailed

2132
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:08.030
to make me fight at land.

2133
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:10.270
Hadst thou done so, the kingsthat have revolted

2134
01:46:10.270 --> 01:46:12.100
and the soldier that has thismorning left thee

2135
01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.930
would have still have followedyour heels.

2136
01:46:13.930 --> 01:46:15.500
Who's gone this morning?

2137
01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:16.930
Who?

2138
01:46:16.930 --> 01:46:18.130
One ever near thee.

2139
01:46:18.130 --> 01:46:20.800
Call for Enobarbus, he shall nothear thee

2140
01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.700
or from Caesar's camp, say, "Iam none of thine."

2141
01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:26.770
What say'st thou?

2142
01:46:26.770 --> 01:46:28.370
Sir, he is with Caesar.

2143
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:31.600
Sir, his chests and treasure hehas not with him.

2144
01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:34.700
Is he gone?

2145
01:46:34.700 --> 01:46:36.700
Most certain.

2146
01:46:39.770 --> 01:46:44.930
Go, Eros; send his treasureafter.

2147
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:46.030
Do it.

2148
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:48.070
Detain no jot, I charge thee.

2149
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:49.770
Write to him.

2150
01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:54.200
I will subscribe gentle adieusand greetings,

2151
01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:59.670
say that I wish he never findmore cause to change a master.

2152
01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:05.400
O my fortunes have corruptedhonest men!

2153
01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.800
Dispatch.

2154
01:47:11.300 --> 01:47:14.970
Enobarbus!

2155
01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.130
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin thefight.

2156
01:47:17.130 --> 01:47:19.700
Our will is Antony be tookalive.

2157
01:47:19.700 --> 01:47:20.670
Make it so known.

2158
01:47:20.670 --> 01:47:24.230
Caesar, I shall.

2159
01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:27.270
The time of universal peace isnear.

2160
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:29.830
Prove this a prosperous day,

2161
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:33.330
the three-nooked world shallbear the olive freely.

2162
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:36.200
Antony is come into the field.

2163
01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.800
Go charge Agrippa.

2164
01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:42.670
Plant those that have revoltedin the van,

2165
01:47:42.670 --> 01:47:47.800
that Antony may seem to spendhis fury upon himself.

2166
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:55.600
Enobarbus, Antony hath afterthee

2167
01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.470
sent all thy treasure with hisbounty overplus.

2168
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:59.470
I give it you.

2169
01:47:59.470 --> 01:48:01.730
Mock not, Enobarbus.I tell youtrue.

2170
01:48:01.730 --> 01:48:03.900
Best you safed the bringer outof the host.

2171
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:07.100
I must attend mine office orwould have done it myself.

2172
01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:12.830
Your emperor continues still aJove.

2173
01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.800
I am alone the villain of theearth,

2174
01:48:23.800 --> 01:48:26.630
and feel I am so most.

2175
01:48:26.630 --> 01:48:31.130
O Antony, thou mine of bounty,

2176
01:48:31.130 --> 01:48:34.730
how wouldst thou have paid mybetter service

2177
01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:39.730
when my turpitude thou dost socrown with gold.

2178
01:48:43.470 --> 01:48:45.500
This blows my heart.

2179
01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:48.170
If swift thought break it not,

2180
01:48:48.170 --> 01:48:50.770
a swifter mean shall outstrikethought.

2181
01:48:50.770 --> 01:48:54.930
But thought will do it, I feel.

2182
01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:59.630
I fight against thee.

2183
01:48:59.630 --> 01:49:07.900
No, I will go seek some ditchwherein to die.

2184
01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:13.400
The foulest best fits my latterpart of life.

2185
01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.900
We have beat him to his camp!

2186
01:49:20.900 --> 01:49:22.130
Run one before!

2187
01:49:22.130 --> 01:49:24.530
Let the queen know of our gests.

2188
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:26.400
Tomorrow before the sun shallsee us,

2189
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:29.170
we'll spill the blood that hastoday escaped.

2190
01:49:29.170 --> 01:49:33.370
Oh, I thank you all, fordoughty-handed are you

2191
01:49:33.370 --> 01:49:35.630
and have fought not as youserved the cause

2192
01:49:35.630 --> 01:49:38.800
but as it had been each man'slike mine.

2193
01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.370
You have shown all Hectors.

2194
01:49:41.370 --> 01:49:44.270
Enter the city, clip our wives,your friends.

2195
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:48.300
Tell them your feats whilst theywith joyful tears

2196
01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:50.400
wash the congealment from yourwounds

2197
01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.800
and kiss the honored gasheswhole.

2198
01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.830
Lord of lords.

2199
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:57.930
O infinite virtue,

2200
01:49:57.930 --> 01:50:02.400
comest thou smiling from theworld's great snare uncaught?

2201
01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:06.470
My nightingale, we have beatthem to their beds.

2202
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:09.130
Behold this man.

2203
01:50:09.130 --> 01:50:12.370
Commend unto his lips thyfavoring hand.

2204
01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:16.630
Kiss it, my warrior!

2205
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:19.900
He hath fought today as if a godin hate of mankind

2206
01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:21.270
had destroyed in such a shape.

2207
01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:23.230
I'll give thee, friend, an armorall of gold.

2208
01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:24.270
It was a king's.

2209
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:25.430
He has deserved it,

2210
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:28.870
were it carbuncled like holyPhoebus' car.

2211
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:30.770
Give me thy hand.

2212
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:33.600
Through Alexandria make a jollymarch.

2213
01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:36.870
Bear our hacked targets like themen that owe them.

2214
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:40.070
Had our great palace thecapacity to camp this host?

2215
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:42.770
We all would sup together anddrink carouses

2216
01:50:42.770 --> 01:50:46.830
to the next day's fate whichpromises royal peril.

2217
01:50:46.830 --> 01:50:48.000
Trumpeters,

2218
01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:51.430
with brazen din blast you thecity's ear.

2219
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:53.670
Make mingle with rattlingtambourines,

2220
01:50:53.670 --> 01:50:56.630
that heaven and earth may striketheir sounds together,

2221
01:50:56.630 --> 01:50:59.200
applauding our approach.

2222
01:51:04.730 --> 01:51:09.530
O, bear me witness, night.

2223
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:12.330
Be witness to me, O thou blessedmoon,

2224
01:51:12.330 --> 01:51:16.800
when men revolted shall uponrecord bear hateful memory,

2225
01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:23.630
poor Enobarbus did before thyface repent.

2226
01:51:23.630 --> 01:51:26.330
O sovereign mistress of truemelancholy,

2227
01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:29.470
the poisonous damp of nightdisponge upon me,

2228
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:33.100
that life, a very rebel to mywill,

2229
01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.830
may hang no longer on me.

2230
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:41.200
Throw my heart against the flintand hardness of my fault,

2231
01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:45.430
which, being dried with grief,will break to powder

2232
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:50.300
and finish all foul thoughts.

2233
01:51:50.300 --> 01:51:56.630
O Antony, nobler than my revoltis infamous,

2234
01:51:56.630 --> 01:51:59.370
forgive me in thine ownparticular,

2235
01:51:59.370 --> 01:52:04.070
but let the world rank me inregister

2236
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:09.300
a master-leaver and a fugitive.

2237
01:52:09.300 --> 01:52:12.630
O Antony!

2238
01:52:12.630 --> 01:52:16.400
O Antony!

2239
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:19.870
Their preparation is today bysea.

2240
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:21.400
We please them not by land.

2241
01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:25.070
For both, my lord.

2242
01:52:25.070 --> 01:52:27.170
I would they fight in the fireor in the air;

2243
01:52:27.170 --> 01:52:28.170
we'd fight there too.

2244
01:52:28.170 --> 01:52:30.300
But thus it is.

2245
01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:32.870
Our foot upon the hillsadjoining to the city

2246
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:33.630
shall stay with us.

2247
01:52:33.630 --> 01:52:35.500
Order for sea is given.

2248
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:36.630
They've put forth the haven,

2249
01:52:36.630 --> 01:52:40.170
where their appointment we maybest discover

2250
01:52:40.170 --> 01:52:42.870
and look on their endeavour.

2251
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:45.500
But being charged, we will bestill by land,

2252
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:47.170
which, as I take it, we shall,

2253
01:52:47.170 --> 01:52:49.230
for his best force is forth toman his galleys.

2254
01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:52.500
To the vales and hold our bestadvantage.

2255
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:56.530
This foul Egyptian hath betrayedme.

2256
01:52:56.530 --> 01:52:58.600
My fleet hath yielded to thefoe,

2257
01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:01.970
and yonder they cast their capsup and carouse together

2258
01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:04.200
like friends long lost.

2259
01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:07.730
Triple-turned whore!

2260
01:53:07.730 --> 01:53:10.830
'Tis thou hast sold me to thisnovice!

2261
01:53:10.830 --> 01:53:15.400
And my heart makes only wars onthee.

2262
01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:17.430
Bid them all fly,

2263
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:20.400
for when I am revenged upon mycharm, I have done all.

2264
01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.170
Bid them all fly; begone!

2265
01:53:26.030 --> 01:53:30.630
O sun, thy uprise shall I see nomore.

2266
01:53:30.630 --> 01:53:34.630
Fortune and Antony part here.

2267
01:53:34.630 --> 01:53:38.000
Even here do we shake hands.

2268
01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.700
All come to this?

2269
01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:46.070
The hearts that spanieled me atheels,

2270
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:49.000
to whom I gave their wishes, dodiscandy,

2271
01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:52.500
melt their sweets on blossomingCaesar.

2272
01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:57.700
And this pine is barked thatovertopped them all.

2273
01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:00.300
Betrayed I am.

2274
01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:04.400
O this false soul of Egypt!

2275
01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:10.230
This grave charm whose eyebecked forth my wars

2276
01:54:10.230 --> 01:54:11.830
and called them home,

2277
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:15.470
whose bosom was my crownet, mychief endó

2278
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:18.530
like a right gypsy hath at fastand loose

2279
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:23.700
beguiled me to the very heart ofloss.

2280
01:54:33.370 --> 01:54:37.530
What, Eros! Eros!

2281
01:54:45.130 --> 01:54:48.430
Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

2282
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:50.430
Why is my lord enraged againsthis love?

2283
01:54:50.430 --> 01:54:53.300
Vanish or I shall give thee thydeserving

2284
01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:56.030
and blemish Caesar's triumph.

2285
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:57.900
Let him take thee

2286
01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:00.670
and hoist thee up to theshouting plebeians,

2287
01:55:00.670 --> 01:55:01.870
follow his chariot

2288
01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:04.370
like the greatest spot of allthy sex.

2289
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:06.600
Oh, most monster-like be shown

2290
01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:09.200
for poorest diminutives fordoits;

2291
01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:12.970
and let patient Octavia plow thyvisage up

2292
01:55:12.970 --> 01:55:16.200
with her prepared nails.

2293
01:55:18.630 --> 01:55:20.630
'Tis well thou art gone.

2294
01:55:20.630 --> 01:55:22.770
If it be well to live,

2295
01:55:22.770 --> 01:55:25.770
but better 'twere thou fell'stinto my fury,

2296
01:55:25.770 --> 01:55:30.930
for one death might haveprevented many.

2297
01:55:30.930 --> 01:55:32.170
The witch shall die

2298
01:55:32.170 --> 01:55:36.930
to the young Roman boy she hathsold me,

2299
01:55:36.930 --> 01:55:39.270
and I fall under this plot.

2300
01:55:39.270 --> 01:55:41.770
She dies for it.

2301
01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:45.100
Help me, my women!

2302
01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:49.000
O, he is more mad than Telamonfor his shield.

2303
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.030
The boar of Thessaly was neverso embossed.

2304
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:52.300
To the monument.

2305
01:55:52.300 --> 01:55:54.370
There, lock yourself and sendhim word you are dead.

2306
01:55:54.370 --> 01:55:56.370
The soul and body rive not morein parting

2307
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:57.370
than greatness going off.

2308
01:55:57.370 --> 01:55:58.530
To the monument.

2309
01:55:58.530 --> 01:56:01.900
Mardian, go tell him I haveslain myself.

2310
01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:04.200
Say that the last I spoke was"Antony,"

2311
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:06.330
and word it prithee piteously.

2312
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:09.400
Hence, Mardian, and bring me howhe takes my death.

2313
01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:11.230
To the monument!

2314
01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:22.270
Eros, thou yet behold'st me?

2315
01:56:22.270 --> 01:56:25.300
Ay, noble lord.

2316
01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:28.230
Sometimes we see a cloud that'sdragonish,

2317
01:56:28.230 --> 01:56:32.830
a vapor sometime like a bear orlion,

2318
01:56:32.830 --> 01:56:37.600
a towered citadel, a pendentrock,

2319
01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:42.630
a forked mountain or bluepromontory with trees upon it,

2320
01:56:42.630 --> 01:56:47.330
that nod unto the world and mockour eyes with air.

2321
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:48.930
Thou hast seen these signs.

2322
01:56:48.930 --> 01:56:51.000
They are black vesper'spageants.

2323
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.470
Ay, my lord.

2324
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:56.200
That which is now a horse, evenwith a thought,

2325
01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:00.730
the rack dislimns and makes itindistinct

2326
01:57:00.730 --> 01:57:02.570
as water is in water.

2327
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:04.100
It does, my lord.

2328
01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.100
My good knave Eros,

2329
01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:09.700
now thy captain is even such abody.

2330
01:57:09.700 --> 01:57:13.270
Here I am Antony,

2331
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:15.130
yet cannot hold this visibleshape.

2332
01:57:15.130 --> 01:57:22.370
My knave, I made these wars forEgypt.

2333
01:57:22.370 --> 01:57:24.770
And the queenó

2334
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:29.630
whose heart I thought I had, forshe had mine,

2335
01:57:29.630 --> 01:57:35.500
which whilst it was mine hadannexed unto it a million more,

2336
01:57:35.500 --> 01:57:37.830
now lost.

2337
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:43.070
She, Eros, has packed cards withCaesar

2338
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:50.130
and false-played my glory untoan enemy's triumph.

2339
01:57:50.130 --> 01:57:54.030
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros.

2340
01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:59.530
There is left us ourselves toend ourselves.

2341
01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:04.630
O! Thy vile lady!

2342
01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:07.100
She has robbed me of my sword.

2343
01:58:07.100 --> 01:58:08.230
No, Antony.

2344
01:58:08.230 --> 01:58:10.130
My mistress loved thee,

2345
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:13.300
and her fortunes mingled withthine entirely.

2346
01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:15.730
Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!

2347
01:58:15.730 --> 01:58:19.630
She hath betrayed me and shalldie the death.

2348
01:58:19.630 --> 01:58:22.870
Death of one person can be paidbut once,

2349
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:25.330
and that she has discharged.

2350
01:58:25.330 --> 01:58:28.570
What thou wouldst do is doneunto thy hand.

2351
01:58:28.570 --> 01:58:33.770
The last she spoke was, "Antony!Most noble Antony!"

2352
01:58:33.770 --> 01:58:35.330
Then in the midst,

2353
01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:38.470
a tearing groan did break thename of Antony.

2354
01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:41.700
It was divided between her heartand lips.

2355
01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:48.100
She rendered life thy name soburied in her.

2356
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:56.830
Dead, then?

2357
01:58:56.830 --> 01:58:58.970
Dead.

2358
01:59:03.570 --> 01:59:05.730
Unarm, Eros.

2359
01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:13.200
The long day's task is done, andwe must sleep.

2360
01:59:14.030 --> 01:59:16.870
Off, pluck off.

2361
01:59:16.870 --> 01:59:21.800
The seven-fold shield of Ajax

2362
01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:24.130
cannot keep the battery from myheart.

2363
01:59:24.130 --> 01:59:27.170
O, cleave, my sides!

2364
01:59:27.170 --> 01:59:30.530
Heart, once be stronger than thycontinent,

2365
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:32.930
crack thy frail case!

2366
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:34.930
Apace, Eros, apace.

2367
01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:38.770
No more a soldier; bruisedpieces, go.

2368
01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:40.600
You have been nobly borne.

2369
01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:42.670
From me awhile.

2370
01:59:51.570 --> 01:59:56.070
I will overtake thee, Cleopatra,

2371
01:59:56.070 --> 02:00:00.930
and weep for my pardon.

2372
02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:07.430
So it must be, for now alllength is torture.

2373
02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:18.200
Since the torch is out, lie downand stray no farther.

2374
02:00:23.130 --> 02:00:26.400
Now all labor Mars what it does.

2375
02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:30.870
Yea, very force entangles itselfwith strength.

2376
02:00:33.530 --> 02:00:37.500
Seal then, and all is done.

2377
02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:41.970
Eros!

2378
02:00:41.970 --> 02:00:44.400
I come, my queen.

2379
02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:47.770
Eros!

2380
02:00:47.770 --> 02:00:49.870
Stay for me.

2381
02:00:49.870 --> 02:00:53.600
Where souls do couch on flowers,

2382
02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:56.270
we'll hand-in-hand

2383
02:00:56.270 --> 02:01:02.500
and with our sprightly port makethe ghosts gaze.

2384
02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:06.670
Dido and her Aeneas shall wanttroops,

2385
02:01:06.670 --> 02:01:13.200
and all the haunt be ours.

2386
02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:15.900
Come, Eros, Eros!

2387
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:21.200
What would my lord?

2388
02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:26.730
Since Cleopatra died, I havelived in such dishonor

2389
02:01:26.730 --> 02:01:29.770
that the gods detest mybaseness.

2390
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:33.130
I, that with my sword quarteredthe world

2391
02:01:33.130 --> 02:01:36.470
and over green Neptune's backwith ships made cities,

2392
02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:40.670
condemn myself to lack thecourage of a woman.

2393
02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:44.870
Less noble mind than she whichby her death

2394
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:49.430
our Caesar tells "I am conquerorof myself."

2395
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:53.370
Thou art sworn, Eros,

2396
02:01:53.370 --> 02:01:55.500
that when the exigent shouldcome,

2397
02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.100
which now is come indeed,

2398
02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:59.370
when I should see behind me

2399
02:01:59.370 --> 02:02:02.530
the inevitable prosecution ofdisgrace and horror,

2400
02:02:02.530 --> 02:02:05.870
that on my command, thou thenwouldst kill me.

2401
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:09.130
Do it; the time is come.

2402
02:02:09.130 --> 02:02:12.730
Thou strikest not me, 'tisCaesar thou defeat'st.

2403
02:02:12.730 --> 02:02:14.430
Put color in thy cheek.

2404
02:02:14.430 --> 02:02:15.800
The gods withhold me!

2405
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:17.770
Shall I do that which all theParthian darts,

2406
02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:19.270
though enemy lost aim and couldnot?

2407
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:20.630
Eros.

2408
02:02:20.630 --> 02:02:22.630
Wouldst thou be windowed ingreat Rome

2409
02:02:22.630 --> 02:02:25.600
and see thy master thus withpleached arms,

2410
02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:27.870
bending down his corrigibleneck,

2411
02:02:27.870 --> 02:02:29.970
his face subdued to penetrativeshame

2412
02:02:29.970 --> 02:02:32.070
whilst the wheeled seat offortunate Caesar

2413
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:33.200
drawn before him,

2414
02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.370
branded his baseness thatensued?

2415
02:02:35.370 --> 02:02:36.530
I would not see it.

2416
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:39.830
Come, then; for with a wound Imust be cured.

2417
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:41.900
Draw that thy honest sword,

2418
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:44.670
which thou hast worn most usefulfor thy country.

2419
02:02:44.670 --> 02:02:49.270
O, sir, pardon me!

2420
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:51.430
When I did make thee free,

2421
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:54.300
sworest thou not then to do thiswhen I bade thee?

2422
02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:57.500
Do it at once, or thy precedentservices

2423
02:02:57.500 --> 02:03:00.530
are all but accidentsunpurposed.

2424
02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:03.770
Draw and come.

2425
02:03:03.770 --> 02:03:06.430
Turn from me then, that noblecountenance,

2426
02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:08.400
wherein the worship of the wholeworld lies.

2427
02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:10.070
Lo thee!

2428
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.770
My sword is drawn.

2429
02:03:13.770 --> 02:03:18.100
Then let it do at once the thingwhy thou hast drawn it!

2430
02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.100
My dear master, my captain, andmy emperor,

2431
02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:27.130
let me say, before I strike thisbloody stroke, farewell.

2432
02:03:27.130 --> 02:03:29.170
'Tis said, man; and farewell.

2433
02:03:29.170 --> 02:03:32.830
Farewell, great chief.

2434
02:03:37.600 --> 02:03:38.970
Shall I strike now?

2435
02:03:38.970 --> 02:03:40.970
Now, Eros.

2436
02:03:40.970 --> 02:03:42.530
Why, there then!

2437
02:03:49.600 --> 02:03:53.100
Thus do I escape the sorrow ofAntony's death.

2438
02:04:04.030 --> 02:04:10.500
Thrice nobler than myself!

2439
02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:13.230
Thou teachest me, O valiantEros,

2440
02:04:13.230 --> 02:04:15.970
what I should and thou couldstnot.

2441
02:04:15.970 --> 02:04:27.170
My queen and Eros have got uponme a nobleness in record,

2442
02:04:27.170 --> 02:04:29.830
but I will be a bridegroom in mydeath

2443
02:04:29.830 --> 02:04:33.330
and run into it as to a lover'sbed.

2444
02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.170
Come then.

2445
02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:42.670
And, Eros, thy master dies thyscholar.

2446
02:04:42.670 --> 02:04:45.930
To do thus, I learned of thee.

2447
02:04:54.370 --> 02:05:00.100
How nowónot dead? Not dead?

2448
02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:04.200
The guard, ho!

2449
02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:07.130
O, dispatch me!

2450
02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:08.930
What's the noise?

2451
02:05:11.630 --> 02:05:13.630
I have done my work in, friends.

2452
02:05:13.630 --> 02:05:15.500
Make an end of what I havebegun.

2453
02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:17.130
The star is fallen.

2454
02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:18.370
And time is at his period.

2455
02:05:18.370 --> 02:05:20.630
Alas, and woe!

2456
02:05:20.630 --> 02:05:23.270
Let him that loves me strike medead.

2457
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.970
Not I.

2458
02:05:23.970 --> 02:05:24.670
Nor I.

2459
02:05:24.670 --> 02:05:25.400
Nor anyone.

2460
02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:26.130
Where's Antony?

2461
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:28.870
There, Alexas, there.

2462
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:30.970
Lives he?

2463
02:05:30.970 --> 02:05:33.330
Will thou not answer, man?

2464
02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:36.630
Art thou there, Alexas?

2465
02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:40.900
Draw thy sword and give mesufficing strokes for death.

2466
02:05:40.900 --> 02:05:45.400
Most absolute lord,

2467
02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:51.470
my mistress Cleopatra sent me tothee.

2468
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:53.470
When did she send thee?

2469
02:05:53.470 --> 02:05:58.070
Now, my lord.

2470
02:05:58.070 --> 02:06:00.330
Where is she?

2471
02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:02.870
Locked in her monument.

2472
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:06.470
She had a prophesying fear ofwhat hath come to pass.

2473
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:08.900
For when she sawó

2474
02:06:08.900 --> 02:06:12.700
which never shall be foundó

2475
02:06:12.700 --> 02:06:15.470
you did suspect she had disposedwith Caesar

2476
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:17.530
and that your rage would not bepurged,

2477
02:06:17.530 --> 02:06:20.830
she sent you word she was dead.

2478
02:06:20.830 --> 02:06:24.600
But fearing since how it mightwork,

2479
02:06:24.600 --> 02:06:28.470
hath sent me to proclaim thetruth.

2480
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:31.570
And I am come, I dread, toolate.

2481
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:39.070
Too late, good Alexas.

2482
02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:42.330
Bear me, good friends, whereCleopatra bides.

2483
02:06:42.330 --> 02:06:46.870
It is the last service that Ishall command you.

2484
02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:48.630
I have led you oft.

2485
02:06:48.630 --> 02:06:53.970
Carry me now, good friends, andhave my thanks for all.

2486
02:07:13.630 --> 02:07:20.870
O Charmian, I will never go fromhence.

2487
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:23.670
Be comforted, dear madam.

2488
02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:26.470
No, I will not.

2489
02:07:26.470 --> 02:07:30.100
All strange and terrible eventsare welcome,

2490
02:07:30.100 --> 02:07:33.200
but comforts we despise.

2491
02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:37.300
Our size of sorrow proportionedto our cause

2492
02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:41.900
must be as great as that whichmakes it.

2493
02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:46.700
How now!

2494
02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.100
Is he dead?

2495
02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:52.130
His death's upon him but notdead.

2496
02:07:52.130 --> 02:07:56.070
His guard have brought himhither.

2497
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:06.700
O sun, burn the great spherethou movest in.

2498
02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:10.700
Darkling stand the varying shoreof the world.

2499
02:08:13.330 --> 02:08:17.570
O Antony.

2500
02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:21.870
Antony, Antony!

2501
02:08:30.500 --> 02:08:34.400
Help, Charmian, help.

2502
02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.300
Iras, help.

2503
02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:38.900
Help, friends below.

2504
02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:42.100
Let's draw him hither.

2505
02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:43.370
Peace.

2506
02:08:43.370 --> 02:08:47.630
Not Caesar's valor hathoverthrown Antony,

2507
02:08:47.630 --> 02:08:51.370
but Antony's hath triumphed onitself.

2508
02:08:51.370 --> 02:08:56.270
So it should be that none butAntony should conquer Antony.

2509
02:08:56.270 --> 02:09:01.000
But woe 'tis so!

2510
02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.300
I am dying, Egypt, dying.

2511
02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:09.770
Only I here importune deathawhile

2512
02:09:09.770 --> 02:09:12.400
until of many thousand kisses

2513
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:15.930
the poor last I lay upon thylips.

2514
02:09:15.930 --> 02:09:18.300
I dare not, dear.

2515
02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:20.130
Dear my lord, pardon,

2516
02:09:20.130 --> 02:09:21.600
I dare not, lest I be taken.

2517
02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:24.570
Not the imperious show of thefull-fortuned Caesar

2518
02:09:24.570 --> 02:09:26.470
ever shall be broached with me.

2519
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:29.130
If knife, drugs, serpents haveedge, sting, or operation,

2520
02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:30.470
I am safe.

2521
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:31.900
Your wife Octavia,

2522
02:09:31.900 --> 02:09:34.000
with her modest eyes and stillconclusion,

2523
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.670
shall acquire no honor demuringupon demurringe.

2524
02:09:36.670 --> 02:09:41.300
Come, come, Antony.

2525
02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:42.830
Help me, my women.

2526
02:09:42.830 --> 02:09:45.270
We must draw thee up.

2527
02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:48.270
Assist, good friends.

2528
02:09:48.270 --> 02:09:51.300
O, quick or I am gone.

2529
02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:54.370
Here's sport indeed!

2530
02:09:54.370 --> 02:09:58.230
How heavy weighs my lord.

2531
02:09:58.230 --> 02:10:00.930
Our strength is all gone intoheaviness

2532
02:10:00.930 --> 02:10:02.730
that makes the weight.

2533
02:10:02.730 --> 02:10:05.270
Had I great Juno's power,

2534
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:07.670
the strong-winged Mercury shouldfetch thee up

2535
02:10:07.670 --> 02:10:09.470
and set thee by Jove's side.

2536
02:10:09.470 --> 02:10:13.330
Yet come a little.

2537
02:10:13.330 --> 02:10:15.700
Wishes were ever fools.

2538
02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:22.330
O, come, come, come.

2539
02:10:22.330 --> 02:10:26.870
And welcome, welcome!

2540
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:30.570
Die where thou hast lived.

2541
02:10:30.570 --> 02:10:33.130
Quicken with kissing.

2542
02:10:33.130 --> 02:10:37.270
Had my lips that power, thuswould I wear them out.

2543
02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:39.600
A heavy sight!

2544
02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:49.070
I am dying, Egypt, dying.

2545
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:53.570
Give me some wine, and let mespeak a little.

2546
02:10:53.570 --> 02:10:56.230
No, let me speak.

2547
02:10:56.230 --> 02:10:57.430
And let me rail so high

2548
02:10:57.430 --> 02:11:00.600
that the false housewife Fortunebreak her wheel,

2549
02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:02.630
provoked by my offence.

2550
02:11:02.630 --> 02:11:05.800
One word, sweet queen.

2551
02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:13.000
Of Caesar, seek your honor withyour safety.

2552
02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.070
They do not go together.

2553
02:11:17.070 --> 02:11:19.770
Gentle, hear me.

2554
02:11:19.770 --> 02:11:23.200
None about Caesar trust butProculeius.

2555
02:11:23.200 --> 02:11:26.200
My resolution and my hands I'lltrust.

2556
02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:27.670
None about Caesar.

2557
02:11:27.670 --> 02:11:31.870
The miserable change now at myend.

2558
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:34.830
Lament nor sorrow at,

2559
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:38.730
but please thy thoughts infeeding them

2560
02:11:38.730 --> 02:11:41.170
with those my former fortunes

2561
02:11:41.170 --> 02:11:45.930
wherein I lived the greatestprince of the whole world,

2562
02:11:45.930 --> 02:11:52.570
the noblest and do now notbasely die,

2563
02:11:52.570 --> 02:11:57.300
not cowardly put off my helmetto my countrymanó

2564
02:11:57.300 --> 02:12:05.870
a Roman by a Romanó valiantlyvanquished.

2565
02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:13.500
Now my spirit is going.

2566
02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:16.470
I can no more.

2567
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:22.000
Noblest of men, woo't die?

2568
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.930
Hast thou no care of me?

2569
02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:30.030
Shall I abide in this dullworld,

2570
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:35.700
which in thy absence is nobetter than a sty?

2571
02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:42.600
O, see, my women.

2572
02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:47.400
The crown of the earth dothmelt.

2573
02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.830
My lord!

2574
02:12:54.830 --> 02:13:01.400
O, withered is the garland ofthe war!

2575
02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:06.370
The soldier's pole is fallen.

2576
02:13:06.370 --> 02:13:12.600
Young boys and girls are levelnow with men.

2577
02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:15.770
The odds is gone,

2578
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:20.600
and there is nothing leftremarkable

2579
02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.800
beneath the visiting moon.

2580
02:13:27.370 --> 02:13:29.130
O, quietness, lady!

2581
02:13:29.130 --> 02:13:31.070
She's dead too, our sovereign.

2582
02:13:31.070 --> 02:13:32.100
Lady!

2583
02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.100
Madam!

2584
02:13:33.100 --> 02:13:36.700
O madam, madam, madam!

2585
02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:38.630
Royal Egypt Empress!

2586
02:13:38.630 --> 02:13:41.270
Peace, peace, Iras!

2587
02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:47.100
No more but even a woman

2588
02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:51.100
and commanded by such poorpassion

2589
02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:54.270
as the maid that milks and doesthe meanest chares.

2590
02:13:54.270 --> 02:14:01.700
It were for me to throw myscepter at the injurious gods,

2591
02:14:01.700 --> 02:14:06.430
to tell them that this world didequal theirs

2592
02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:12.900
till they had stolen our jewel.

2593
02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:16.330
All's but naught.

2594
02:14:16.330 --> 02:14:18.700
Patience is sottish,

2595
02:14:18.700 --> 02:14:26.100
and impatience does become a dogthat's mad.

2596
02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:35.500
Then is it sin to rush into thesecret house of death?

2597
02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:40.770
Ere death dare come to us?

2598
02:14:43.770 --> 02:14:45.630
How do you, women?

2599
02:14:45.630 --> 02:14:51.330
What, what! Good cheer!

2600
02:14:51.330 --> 02:14:55.400
Why, how now, Charmian!

2601
02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:59.670
My noble girls!

2602
02:14:59.670 --> 02:15:05.570
Ah, women, women, look, our lampis spent.

2603
02:15:05.570 --> 02:15:08.530
It's out.

2604
02:15:08.530 --> 02:15:12.800
Good sirs, take heart.

2605
02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:15.130
We'll bury him.

2606
02:15:15.130 --> 02:15:19.330
And then what's brave, what'snoble,

2607
02:15:19.330 --> 02:15:23.470
let's do it after the high Romanfashion

2608
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:29.000
and make death proud to take us.

2609
02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Come. Away.

2610
02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:49.070
This case of that huge spiritnow is cold.

2611
02:15:49.070 --> 02:15:53.100
Ah, women, women!

2612
02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:55.630
Come.

2613
02:15:55.630 --> 02:15:59.900
We have no friend but resolution

2614
02:15:59.900 --> 02:16:03.770
and the briefest end.

2615
02:16:13.530 --> 02:16:16.600
Go to him, Dolabella; bid himyield.

2616
02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:18.030
Being so frustrate,

2617
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:20.230
tell him he mocks the pausesthat he makes.

2618
02:16:20.230 --> 02:16:22.230
Caesar, I shall.

2619
02:16:27.170 --> 02:16:28.730
Wherefore is that?

2620
02:16:28.730 --> 02:16:32.470
And what art thou that darestappear thus to us?

2621
02:16:32.470 --> 02:16:34.270
I am called Dercetas.

2622
02:16:34.270 --> 02:16:36.230
Mark Antony I served,

2623
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:39.430
who best was worthy, best to beserved.

2624
02:16:39.430 --> 02:16:43.570
Whilst he stood up and spoke, hewas my master.

2625
02:16:43.570 --> 02:16:46.030
And I wore my life to spend uponhis haters.

2626
02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:49.000
If thou please to take me tothee,

2627
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.670
as I was to him I'll be toCaesar.

2628
02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:58.400
If thou pleasest not, I yieldthee up my life.

2629
02:16:58.400 --> 02:17:00.100
What is it thou say'st?

2630
02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:04.470
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

2631
02:17:11.770 --> 02:17:19.730
The breaking of so great a thingshould make a greater crack.

2632
02:17:19.730 --> 02:17:24.430
The round world should haveshook lions into civil streets

2633
02:17:24.430 --> 02:17:28.600
and citizens to their dens.

2634
02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:32.170
The death of Antony is not asingle doom.

2635
02:17:32.170 --> 02:17:34.030
In the name lay a moiety of theworld.

2636
02:17:34.030 --> 02:17:35.630
He is dead, Caesar.

2637
02:17:35.630 --> 02:17:37.970
Not by a public minister ofjustice

2638
02:17:37.970 --> 02:17:39.670
nor by a hired knife

2639
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:41.370
but that self hand,

2640
02:17:41.370 --> 02:17:43.100
which writ his honor in the actsit did,

2641
02:17:43.100 --> 02:17:46.000
hath, with the courage which theheart did lend it,

2642
02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.270
splitted the heart.

2643
02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:50.530
This is his sword; I robbed hiswound of it.

2644
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:55.530
Behold it stained with his mostnoble blood.

2645
02:18:03.300 --> 02:18:08.170
Look you sad, friends?

2646
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:11.300
The gods rebuke me,

2647
02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:15.130
but it is tidings to wash theeyes of kings.

2648
02:18:22.970 --> 02:18:25.400
And strange it is that naturemust compel us

2649
02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:27.430
to lament our most persisteddeeds.

2650
02:18:27.430 --> 02:18:29.430
His taints and honors wagedequal with him.

2651
02:18:29.430 --> 02:18:32.430
A rarer spirit never did steerhumanity.

2652
02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:38.770
But you, gods, will give us somefaults to make us men.

2653
02:18:38.770 --> 02:18:41.100
Caesar is touched.

2654
02:18:41.100 --> 02:18:43.130
When such a spacious mirror'sset before him,

2655
02:18:43.130 --> 02:18:47.370
he needs must see himself.

2656
02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:56.700
O Antony!

2657
02:18:56.700 --> 02:19:00.270
I have followed thee to this.

2658
02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:10.170
But we do lance diseases in ourbodies.

2659
02:19:10.170 --> 02:19:13.800
I must perforce have shown tothee such a declining day

2660
02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:16.070
or looked on thine.

2661
02:19:16.070 --> 02:19:25.070
We could not stall together inthe whole world,

2662
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:27.400
but yet let me lament

2663
02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:31.470
with tears as sovereign as theblood of hearts

2664
02:19:31.470 --> 02:19:37.670
that thou, my brother,

2665
02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:40.930
my competitor in top of alldesign,

2666
02:19:40.930 --> 02:19:43.630
my mate in empire,

2667
02:19:43.630 --> 02:19:50.100
friend and companion in thefront of war,

2668
02:19:50.100 --> 02:19:52.730
the arm of mine own body

2669
02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:56.530
and the heart where mine histhoughts did kindle.

2670
02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:04.800
That our stars, unreconcilable,

2671
02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:11.600
should divide our equalness tothis.

2672
02:20:31.330 --> 02:20:35.000
Hear me, good friends.

2673
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:39.430
But I will tell you at somemeeter season.

2674
02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:42.670
The business of this man looksout of him.

2675
02:20:42.670 --> 02:20:46.530
We'll hear him what he says.

2676
02:20:46.530 --> 02:20:48.270
Whence are you?

2677
02:20:48.270 --> 02:20:51.400
A poor Egyptian yet.

2678
02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:53.900
The queen, my mistress,

2679
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:57.270
confined in all she has, hermonument,

2680
02:20:57.270 --> 02:21:00.670
of thy intents desiresinstruction

2681
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:03.470
that she preparedly may frameherself

2682
02:21:03.470 --> 02:21:06.230
to the way she's forced to.

2683
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:08.430
Bid her have good heart.

2684
02:21:08.430 --> 02:21:11.670
She soon shall know of us, bysome of ours,

2685
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:16.830
wow honorable and how kindly wedetermine for her.

2686
02:21:16.830 --> 02:21:21.830
For Caesar cannot learn to beungentle.

2687
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:25.700
So the gods preserve thee!

2688
02:21:27.570 --> 02:21:30.400
Come hither, Proculeius.

2689
02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:36.970
Go and say, we purpose her noshame.

2690
02:21:36.970 --> 02:21:38.670
Give her what comforts

2691
02:21:38.670 --> 02:21:40.600
the quality of her passion shallrequire.

2692
02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:41.730
Lest, in her greatness,

2693
02:21:41.730 --> 02:21:44.900
by some mortal stroke she dodefeat us.

2694
02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:48.170
For her life in Rome would beeternal in our triumph.

2695
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:53.830
Go, and with your speediestbring us what she saysó

2696
02:21:53.830 --> 02:21:54.930
How you find of her.

2697
02:21:54.930 --> 02:21:57.500
Caesar, I shall.

2698
02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:59.230
Where's Dolabella to secondProculeius?

2699
02:21:59.230 --> 02:22:01.430
Dolabella!

2700
02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:06.270
Let him alone, for I remembernow how he's employed.

2701
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:09.470
He shall in time be ready.

2702
02:22:16.970 --> 02:22:19.670
Go with me to my tent

2703
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:22.370
where you shall see how hardly Iwas drawn into this war,

2704
02:22:22.370 --> 02:22:28.200
how calm and gentle I proceededstill in all my writings.

2705
02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:33.530
Go with me and see what I canshow in this.

2706
02:22:35.730 --> 02:22:39.130
My desolation does begin to makea better life.

2707
02:22:39.130 --> 02:22:42.700
'Tis paltry to be Caesar.

2708
02:22:42.700 --> 02:22:48.670
Not being Fortune, he's butFortune's knave,

2709
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:51.230
a minister of her will.

2710
02:22:51.230 --> 02:22:57.470
And it is great to do that thingthat ends all other deeds

2711
02:22:57.470 --> 02:23:02.700
which shackles accidents andbolts up change,

2712
02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:08.630
which sleeps and never palatesmore the dug.

2713
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:14.800
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.

2714
02:23:19.970 --> 02:23:23.100
Caesar sends greeting to theQueen of Egypt

2715
02:23:23.100 --> 02:23:25.630
and bids thee study on what fairdemands

2716
02:23:25.630 --> 02:23:28.400
thou means to have him grantthee.

2717
02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:29.830
What's thy name?

2718
02:23:29.830 --> 02:23:32.000
My name is Proculeius.

2719
02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.930
Antony did tell me of you;

2720
02:23:34.930 --> 02:23:37.400
bade me trust you.

2721
02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:39.570
But I do not greatly care to bedeceived

2722
02:23:39.570 --> 02:23:41.570
that have no use for trusting.

2723
02:23:41.570 --> 02:23:45.970
If your master would have aqueen his beggar,

2724
02:23:45.970 --> 02:23:47.730
you must tell him

2725
02:23:47.730 --> 02:23:53.600
that majesty, to keep decorum,must no less beg than a kingdom.

2726
02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:58.800
If he please to give meconquered Egypt for my son,

2727
02:23:58.800 --> 02:24:02.430
he gives me so much of mine own

2728
02:24:02.430 --> 02:24:05.670
as I will kneel to him withthanks.

2729
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:06.830
Be of good cheer.

2730
02:24:06.830 --> 02:24:09.000
You're fallen into a princelyhand.

2731
02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:10.300
Fear nothing.

2732
02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:12.700
Make your full reference freelyto my lord,

2733
02:24:12.700 --> 02:24:18.730
who is so full of grace that itflows over on all that need.

2734
02:24:23.330 --> 02:24:26.230
Let me report to him your sweetdependency,

2735
02:24:26.230 --> 02:24:28.000
and you shall find a conqueror

2736
02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.070
that will pray in aid forkindness,

2737
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:32.630
where he for grace is kneeledto.

2738
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:37.200
Pray you, tell him I am hisfortune's vassal,

2739
02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:41.100
and I send him the greatness hehas got.

2740
02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:46.270
I hourly learn a doctrine ofobedience

2741
02:24:46.270 --> 02:24:51.130
and would gladly look him im theface.

2742
02:24:51.130 --> 02:24:53.370
This I'll report, dear lady.

2743
02:24:53.370 --> 02:24:54.770
Have comfort,

2744
02:24:54.770 --> 02:24:58.700
for I know your plight is pitiedof him that caused it.

2745
02:24:58.700 --> 02:24:59.700
O Cleopatra!

2746
02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:00.770
Thou art taken, queen!

2747
02:25:00.770 --> 02:25:01.870
Quick, quick, good hands.

2748
02:25:01.870 --> 02:25:03.070
Hold, worthy lady, hold.

2749
02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:04.330
Do not yourself such wrong,

2750
02:25:04.330 --> 02:25:06.800
who are in this relieved but notbetrayed.

2751
02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:08.970
What of death, too, that ridsour dogs of languish?

2752
02:25:08.970 --> 02:25:10.430
Cleopatra!

2753
02:25:10.430 --> 02:25:12.900
Do not abuse my master's bountyby the undoing of yourself.

2754
02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:15.700
Let the world see his noblenesswell acted,

2755
02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:18.100
which your death will never letcome forth.

2756
02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:19.600
Where art thou, death?

2757
02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:22.430
Come hither, come!

2758
02:25:22.430 --> 02:25:29.000
Come, come, and take a queenworth many babes and beggars!

2759
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:30.470
O, temperance, lady!

2760
02:25:30.470 --> 02:25:33.100
Sir, I will eat no meat.

2761
02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.070
I'll not drink, sir.

2762
02:25:35.070 --> 02:25:37.700
If idle talk will once benecessary,

2763
02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:39.170
I'll not sleep neither.

2764
02:25:39.170 --> 02:25:41.500
This mortal house I'll ruin!

2765
02:25:41.500 --> 02:25:43.670
Do Caesar what he can.

2766
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:45.100
Know, sir,

2767
02:25:45.100 --> 02:25:47.700
that I will not wait pinioned atyour master's court

2768
02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:51.700
nor once be chastised with thesober eye of dull Octavia.

2769
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:53.230
Shall they hoist me up

2770
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:56.300
and show me to the shoutingvarletry of censuring Rome?

2771
02:25:56.300 --> 02:26:00.370
Rather a ditch in Egypt begentle grave unto me!

2772
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:04.330
Rather on Nilus' mud lay mestark naked

2773
02:26:04.330 --> 02:26:08.130
and let the water flies blow meinto abhorring!

2774
02:26:08.130 --> 02:26:12.830
Rather make my country's highpyramides my gibbet

2775
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:16.400
and hang me up in chains!

2776
02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.370
You do extend these thoughts ofhorror

2777
02:26:18.370 --> 02:26:21.230
further than you shall findcause in Caesar.

2778
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:26.370
Proculeius,

2779
02:26:26.370 --> 02:26:29.870
what thou hast done thy masterCaesar knows,

2780
02:26:29.870 --> 02:26:31.670
and he hath sent for thee.

2781
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:34.470
For the queen, I'll take her tomy guard.

2782
02:26:34.470 --> 02:26:35.670
So, Dolabella.

2783
02:26:35.670 --> 02:26:40.070
It shall content me best; begentle to her.

2784
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:42.030
To Caesar I will speak what youshall please,

2785
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:44.470
if you'll employ me to him.

2786
02:26:44.470 --> 02:26:48.470
Say, I would die.

2787
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:59.770
Most noble empress, you haveheard of me?

2788
02:26:59.770 --> 02:27:02.200
I cannot tell.

2789
02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:05.030
Assuredly you know me.

2790
02:27:07.500 --> 02:27:11.800
No matter, sir, what I haveheard or known,

2791
02:27:13.500 --> 02:27:17.430
you laugh when boys or womentell their dreams.

2792
02:27:17.430 --> 02:27:19.970
Is it not your trick?

2793
02:27:19.970 --> 02:27:24.900
I understand not, madam.

2794
02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:30.230
I dreamt there was an EmperorAntony.

2795
02:27:30.230 --> 02:27:33.530
O, such another sleep,

2796
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:36.300
that I might see but suchanother man!

2797
02:27:36.300 --> 02:27:38.070
If it might please yeó

2798
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:40.830
His face was as the heavens

2799
02:27:40.830 --> 02:27:43.970
and therein stuck a sun andmoon,

2800
02:27:43.970 --> 02:27:45.300
which kept their course

2801
02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:47.700
and lighted the little O of theearth.

2802
02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:49.200
Most sovereign creatureó

2803
02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.500
His legs bestrid the ocean.

2804
02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:54.930
His reared arm crested theworld.

2805
02:27:54.930 --> 02:27:59.230
His voice was propertied as allthe tuned spheres,

2806
02:27:59.230 --> 02:28:01.470
and that to friends.

2807
02:28:01.470 --> 02:28:04.930
But when he meant to quail andshake the orb,

2808
02:28:04.930 --> 02:28:07.700
he was as rattling thunder.

2809
02:28:07.700 --> 02:28:13.070
For his bounty, there was nowinter in it.

2810
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:18.600
An autumn 'twas that grew themore by reaping.

2811
02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:22.100
His delights were dolphin-like.

2812
02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:25.730
They showed his back above theelement they lived in.

2813
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:30.830
In his livery walked crowns andcrownets.

2814
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:36.470
Realms and islands were asplates dropped from his pocket.

2815
02:28:36.470 --> 02:28:38.730
Cleopatra!

2816
02:28:38.730 --> 02:28:45.730
Think you there was or might besuch a man

2817
02:28:45.730 --> 02:28:47.970
as this I dreamt of?

2818
02:28:47.970 --> 02:28:52.300
Gentle madam, no.

2819
02:28:52.300 --> 02:28:56.370
You lie up to the hearing of thegods.

2820
02:29:01.330 --> 02:29:06.200
But if there be or ever were onesuch,

2821
02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:10.730
it's past the size of dreaming.

2822
02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:16.070
Nature wants stuff to viestrange forms with fancy,

2823
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:21.530
yet to imagine an Antony werenature's piece against fancy,

2824
02:29:21.530 --> 02:29:25.900
condemning shadows quite.

2825
02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:27.670
Hear me, good madam.

2826
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:32.630
Your loss is as yourself great.

2827
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:36.030
And you bear it as answering tothe weight.

2828
02:29:36.030 --> 02:29:39.070
Would I might never o'ertakepursued success,

2829
02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:41.700
but I do feel by the rebound ofyours

2830
02:29:41.700 --> 02:29:45.370
a grief that smites my veryheart at root.

2831
02:29:45.370 --> 02:29:48.870
I thank you, sir,

2832
02:29:50.530 --> 02:29:54.400
Know you what Caesar means to dowith me?

2833
02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:56.570
I am loath to tell you what Iwould you knew.

2834
02:29:56.570 --> 02:29:58.300
Nay, pray you, siró

2835
02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:01.430
Though he be honorableó

2836
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:04.170
He'll lead me then in triumph?

2837
02:30:04.170 --> 02:30:06.500
Madam, he will; I know it.

2838
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:40.930
Arise, you shall not kneel.

2839
02:30:40.930 --> 02:30:46.970
I pray you, rise.

2840
02:30:46.970 --> 02:30:48.870
Rise, Egypt.

2841
02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:51.730
Sir, the gods will have it thus.

2842
02:30:51.730 --> 02:30:55.570
My master and my lord I mustobey.

2843
02:30:58.370 --> 02:31:00.830
Take to you no hard thoughts.

2844
02:31:00.830 --> 02:31:02.930
The record of what injuries youdid us,

2845
02:31:02.930 --> 02:31:04.230
though written in our flesh,

2846
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:07.370
we shall remember as things butdone by chance.

2847
02:31:07.370 --> 02:31:10.430
Sole sir of the world,

2848
02:31:10.430 --> 02:31:14.470
I cannot project mine own causeso well to make it clear,

2849
02:31:14.470 --> 02:31:18.430
but do confess I have been ladenwith like frailties

2850
02:31:18.430 --> 02:31:22.970
which before have often shamedour sex.

2851
02:31:22.970 --> 02:31:28.130
Cleopatra, know we willextenuate rather than enforce.

2852
02:31:28.130 --> 02:31:31.330
If you apply yourself to ourintents,

2853
02:31:31.330 --> 02:31:33.230
which towards you are mostgentle,

2854
02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:37.430
you shall find a benefit in thischange.

2855
02:31:37.430 --> 02:31:40.600
But if you seek to lay on me acruelty,

2856
02:31:40.600 --> 02:31:42.130
by taking Antony's course,

2857
02:31:42.130 --> 02:31:46.530
you shall bereave yourself of mygood purposes

2858
02:31:46.530 --> 02:31:49.400
and put your children to thatdestruction

2859
02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:54.530
which I'll guard them from ifthereon you rely.

2860
02:31:54.530 --> 02:31:56.030
I'll take my leave.

2861
02:31:56.030 --> 02:31:59.170
And may, through all the world;'tis yours.

2862
02:31:59.170 --> 02:32:04.000
And we, your scutcheons and yoursigns of conquest,

2863
02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:08.570
shall hang in what place youplease.

2864
02:32:08.570 --> 02:32:12.070
Here, my good lord.

2865
02:32:15.030 --> 02:32:17.630
You shall advise me in all forCleopatra.

2866
02:32:17.630 --> 02:32:20.230
This is the brief of money,plate, and jewels,

2867
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:21.570
I am possessed of.

2868
02:32:21.570 --> 02:32:25.230
'Tis exactly valued, not pettythings admitted.

2869
02:32:26.070 --> 02:32:28.570
Still be it yours.

2870
02:32:28.570 --> 02:32:30.830
Bestow it at your pleasure.

2871
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:36.430
And believe Caesar's no merchant

2872
02:32:36.430 --> 02:32:39.730
to make prize with you of thingsthat merchants sold.

2873
02:32:39.730 --> 02:32:42.670
Therefore, be cheered.

2874
02:32:42.670 --> 02:32:45.870
Make not your thoughts yourprisons.

2875
02:32:45.870 --> 02:32:48.900
No, dear queen.

2876
02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:52.000
For we intend so to dispose you

2877
02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.400
as yourself shall give uscounsel.

2878
02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:58.470
Feed and sleep.

2879
02:32:58.470 --> 02:33:02.500
Our care and pity is so muchupon you

2880
02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:07.470
that we remain your friend.

2881
02:33:07.470 --> 02:33:08.500
And so adieu.

2882
02:33:08.500 --> 02:33:11.700
My master and my lord.

2883
02:33:11.700 --> 02:33:16.330
Not so. Adieu.

2884
02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:34.430
He words me, girls; he words me.

2885
02:33:34.430 --> 02:33:39.730
That I should not be noble tomyself.

2886
02:33:39.730 --> 02:33:43.700
But, hark thee, Charmian.

2887
02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.430
Finish, good lady.

2888
02:33:47.430 --> 02:33:52.330
The bright day is done, and weare for the dark.

2889
02:33:52.330 --> 02:33:54.070
Hie thee again.

2890
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:57.000
I have spoke already, and it isprovided.

2891
02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:58.570
Go put it to the haste.

2892
02:33:58.570 --> 02:33:59.630
Madam, I will.

2893
02:33:59.630 --> 02:34:00.900
Where is the queen?

2894
02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:02.630
Behold, sir.

2895
02:34:02.630 --> 02:34:03.900
Dolabella!

2896
02:34:03.900 --> 02:34:07.530
Madam, as thereto sworn by yourcommand,

2897
02:34:07.530 --> 02:34:09.300
which my love makes religion toobey,

2898
02:34:09.300 --> 02:34:10.470
I tell you this:

2899
02:34:10.470 --> 02:34:12.730
Caesar through Syria intends hisjourney.

2900
02:34:12.730 --> 02:34:13.970
And within three days,

2901
02:34:13.970 --> 02:34:16.100
you with your children will hesend before.

2902
02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:19.670
Make your best use of this.

2903
02:34:19.670 --> 02:34:21.970
I have performed your pleasureand my promise.

2904
02:34:21.970 --> 02:34:26.870
Dolabella, I shall remain yourdebtor.

2905
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:31.670
I, your servant.

2906
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:35.870
Adieu, good queen.

2907
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:37.200
I must attend on Caesar.

2908
02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:40.330
Farewell and thanks.

2909
02:34:44.500 --> 02:34:47.600
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?

2910
02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:50.230
Thou, an Egyptian puppet,

2911
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:53.230
shall be shown in Rome as wellas Ió

2912
02:34:53.230 --> 02:34:57.070
mechanic slaves with greasyaprons,

2913
02:34:57.070 --> 02:35:00.930
rules and hammers shall upliftus to the view.

2914
02:35:00.930 --> 02:35:03.830
In their thick breaths,.rank ofgross diet

2915
02:35:03.830 --> 02:35:07.870
shall be enclouded and forced todrink their vapour.

2916
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:09.000
O the good gods.

2917
02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:12.630
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras.

2918
02:35:12.630 --> 02:35:17.370
Saucy lictors will catch at uslike strumpets

2919
02:35:17.370 --> 02:35:22.100
and scald rhymers ballad us outof tune.

2920
02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:26.570
The quick comedians extemporallywill stage us

2921
02:35:26.570 --> 02:35:30.200
and present our Alexandrianrevels.

2922
02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:34.570
Antony shall be brought drunkenforth,

2923
02:35:34.570 --> 02:35:41.230
and I shall see some squeakingCleopatra boy my greatness

2924
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:43.570
in the posture of a whore.

2925
02:35:43.570 --> 02:35:46.430
O the good gods!

2926
02:35:46.430 --> 02:35:49.330
Nay, that's certain.

2927
02:35:49.330 --> 02:35:51.800
I'll never see it.

2928
02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:55.270
For I am sure my nails arestronger than mine eyes.

2929
02:35:55.270 --> 02:35:58.130
Why, that's the way to fooltheir preparation

2930
02:35:58.130 --> 02:36:03.030
and to conquer their most absurdintents.

2931
02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:08.400
Now, Charmian!

2932
02:36:10.330 --> 02:36:14.730
Show me, my women, like a queen.

2933
02:36:14.730 --> 02:36:17.600
Go fetch my best attires.

2934
02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:22.430
I am again for Cydnus to meetMark Antony.

2935
02:36:22.430 --> 02:36:24.870
Sirrah Iras, go.

2936
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:29.570
Now, noble Charmian, we'lldispatch indeed.

2937
02:36:29.570 --> 02:36:32.200
And when thou hast done thischare,

2938
02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:37.870
I'll give thee leave to playtill doomsday.

2939
02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:40.370
Bring our crown and all.

2940
02:36:40.370 --> 02:36:42.500
Wherefore's this noise?

2941
02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:44.370
Here is a rural fellow

2942
02:36:44.370 --> 02:36:47.600
that will not be denied yourhighness presence.

2943
02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:49.930
He brings you figs.

2944
02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:53.000
Let him come in.

2945
02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:01.170
What poor an instrument may do anoble deed.

2946
02:37:01.170 --> 02:37:04.000
He brings me liberty.

2947
02:37:05.770 --> 02:37:08.430
My resolution's placed,

2948
02:37:08.430 --> 02:37:12.670
and I have nothing of woman inme now.

2949
02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:17.230
From head to foot I ammarble-constant.

2950
02:37:17.230 --> 02:37:22.500
Now the fleeting moon; no planetis of mine.

2951
02:37:25.930 --> 02:37:27.500
This is the man.

2952
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:31.470
Avoid and leave him.

2953
02:37:31.470 --> 02:37:34.330
Hast thou the pretty worm ofNilus there

2954
02:37:34.330 --> 02:37:36.730
that kills and pains not?

2955
02:37:36.730 --> 02:37:40.630
Truly, I have him,

2956
02:37:40.630 --> 02:37:42.200
but I would not be the party

2957
02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:43.970
that should desire you to touchhim,

2958
02:37:43.970 --> 02:37:46.870
for his biting is immortal.

2959
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:50.530
Those that do die of it doseldom or never recover.

2960
02:37:50.530 --> 02:37:53.570
Rememberest thou any that havedied on it?

2961
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:57.030
Very manyó men and women too.

2962
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:59.470
I heard of one of them onlyyesterday.

2963
02:37:59.470 --> 02:38:02.900
A very honest woman, butsomething given to lie

2964
02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:07.030
as a woman should not do but inthe way of honesty.

2965
02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:09.470
How she died of the biting ofit,

2966
02:38:09.470 --> 02:38:10.670
what pain she felt,

2967
02:38:10.670 --> 02:38:13.000
truly, she made very good reportof the worm.

2968
02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:16.100
But this is most fallible.

2969
02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:19.470
The worm's an odd worm.

2970
02:38:19.470 --> 02:38:24.330
Get thee hence; farewell.

2971
02:38:24.330 --> 02:38:28.370
I wish you joy of the worm.

2972
02:38:28.370 --> 02:38:29.670
Farewell.

2973
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:32.170
You must think this, look you,

2974
02:38:32.170 --> 02:38:35.300
that the worm will do his kind.

2975
02:38:35.300 --> 02:38:37.830
Ay, ay; farewell.

2976
02:38:37.830 --> 02:38:41.030
Look you, the worm is not to betrusted

2977
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:43.770
but in the keeping of wisepeople,

2978
02:38:43.770 --> 02:38:47.100
for, indeed, there is nogoodness in the worm.

2979
02:38:47.100 --> 02:38:49.700
Take thou no care; it shall beheeded.

2980
02:38:49.700 --> 02:38:51.370
Very good.

2981
02:38:51.370 --> 02:38:53.700
Give it nothing, I pray you,

2982
02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:56.030
for it's not worth the feeding.

2983
02:38:56.030 --> 02:38:57.800
Will it eat me?

2984
02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:00.070
You must not think I am sosimple,

2985
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:03.200
but I know the devil himselfwill not eat a woman.

2986
02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:06.470
I know that a woman is a dishfor the gods

2987
02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:08.730
if the devil dresses her not.

2988
02:39:08.730 --> 02:39:11.870
But, truly, these same whoresondevils

2989
02:39:11.870 --> 02:39:14.130
do the gods great harm in theirwomen,

2990
02:39:14.130 --> 02:39:18.070
for in every ten that they make,the devils mar five.

2991
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:21.930
Well, get thee gone; farewell.

2992
02:39:21.930 --> 02:39:25.930
Yes, forsooth.

2993
02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:35.570
I wish you joy of the worm.

2994
02:39:43.570 --> 02:39:47.030
Give me my robe.

2995
02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:09.430
Put on my crown.

2996
02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:19.830
I have immortal longings in me.

2997
02:40:19.830 --> 02:40:24.900
Now no more the juice of Egypt'sgrape shall moist this lip.

2998
02:40:24.900 --> 02:40:28.030
Yare, yare, good Iras.

2999
02:40:28.030 --> 02:40:29.600
Quick.

3000
02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:32.330
Methinks I hear Antony call.

3001
02:40:32.330 --> 02:40:36.400
I see him rouse himself topraise my noble act.

3002
02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:39.100
I hear him mock the luck ofCaesar,

3003
02:40:39.100 --> 02:40:44.170
which the gods give men toexcuse their after wrath.

3004
02:40:44.170 --> 02:40:49.770
Husband, I come.

3005
02:40:49.770 --> 02:40:52.430
Now to that name my courageprove my title.

3006
02:40:52.430 --> 02:40:57.500
I am fire and air.

3007
02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:02.170
My other elements I give tobaser life.

3008
02:41:02.170 --> 02:41:06.330
So; have you done?

3009
02:41:06.330 --> 02:41:13.000
Come then and take the lastwarmth of my lips.

3010
02:41:16.530 --> 02:41:21.030
Farewell, kind Charmian.

3011
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:26.530
Iras, long farewell.

3012
02:41:34.130 --> 02:41:37.400
Have I the aspic in my lips?

3013
02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:40.200
Dost fall?

3014
02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:44.270
If thou and nature can so gentlypart,

3015
02:41:44.270 --> 02:41:46.870
the stroke of death is as alover's pinch,

3016
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:51.600
which hurts and is desired.

3017
02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:54.330
Dost thou lie still?

3018
02:41:54.330 --> 02:41:57.800
If thus thou vanishest,

3019
02:41:57.800 --> 02:42:04.470
thou tell'st the world it is notworth leave-taking.

3020
02:42:04.470 --> 02:42:07.070
Dissolve thick cloud and rain,

3021
02:42:07.070 --> 02:42:10.330
that I may say the godsthemselves do weep.

3022
02:42:10.330 --> 02:42:12.470
This proves me base.

3023
02:42:12.470 --> 02:42:15.070
If she first meet the curledAntony,

3024
02:42:15.070 --> 02:42:18.800
he'll make demand of her andspend that kiss

3025
02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:21.800
which is my heaven to have.

3026
02:42:23.170 --> 02:42:30.300
Come, thou mortal wretch.

3027
02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.170
With thy sharp teeth

3028
02:42:41.170 --> 02:42:54.930
this knot intrinsicate of lifeat once untie.

3029
02:42:54.930 --> 02:43:03.500
Poor venomous fool, be angry anddispatch.

3030
02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:10.870
Peace, peace.

3031
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:14.330
Dost thou not see my baby at mybreast

3032
02:43:14.330 --> 02:43:17.270
that sucks the nurse asleep?

3033
02:43:17.270 --> 02:43:18.770
O, break!

3034
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:20.600
O, break!

3035
02:43:22.330 --> 02:43:26.330
As sweet as balm,

3036
02:43:26.330 --> 02:43:28.670
as soft as air,

3037
02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:34.230
as gentleó

3038
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:38.500
O Antony!

3039
02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:47.770
Nay, I will take thee too.

3040
02:43:47.770 --> 02:43:51.470
What should I stayó

3041
02:43:51.470 --> 02:43:54.370
In this vile world?

3042
02:43:54.370 --> 02:43:58.770
So fare thee well.

3043
02:43:58.770 --> 02:44:01.300
Now boast thee, death,

3044
02:44:01.300 --> 02:44:07.500
in thy possession lies a lassunparalleled.

3045
02:44:07.500 --> 02:44:09.900
Downy windows close,

3046
02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:16.070
and golden Phoebus never bebeheld of eyes again so royal.

3047
02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.700
Your crown's awry.

3048
02:44:21.700 --> 02:44:28.030
I'll mend it and then play.

3049
02:44:28.030 --> 02:44:30.830
Where is the queen?

3050
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:37.900
Speak softly, wake her not.

3051
02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:41.470
Caesar hath sentó

3052
02:44:41.470 --> 02:44:44.030
Too slow a messenger.

3053
02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:55.400
O, come apace, dispatch!

3054
02:44:59.030 --> 02:45:02.330
I partly feel thee.

3055
02:45:02.330 --> 02:45:05.530
What work is here?

3056
02:45:05.530 --> 02:45:10.000
Charmian, is this well done?

3057
02:45:12.370 --> 02:45:18.930
It is well done and fitting fora princess

3058
02:45:18.930 --> 02:45:23.370
descended of so many royalkings.

3059
02:45:29.130 --> 02:45:32.370
How goes it here?

3060
02:45:32.370 --> 02:45:34.870
All dead.

3061
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:39.900
Caesar, thy thoughts touch theireffects in this.

3062
02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:44.730
Thyself art coming to seeperformed the dreaded act

3063
02:45:44.730 --> 02:45:48.700
which thou so sought'st tohinder.

3064
02:45:57.530 --> 02:46:01.430
O sir, you are too sure anaugurer.

3065
02:46:01.430 --> 02:46:04.500
That you did fear is done.

3066
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:17.170
Bravest at the last, she leveledat our purposes,

3067
02:46:17.170 --> 02:46:20.600
and, being royal, took her ownway.

3068
02:46:26.170 --> 02:46:29.630
The manner of their deaths?

3069
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:31.370
I do not see them bleed.

3070
02:46:31.370 --> 02:46:33.530
Who was last with them?

3071
02:46:33.530 --> 02:46:37.530
A simple countryman that broughther figs.

3072
02:46:37.530 --> 02:46:42.100
This was his basket.

3073
02:46:42.100 --> 02:46:45.670
If she had swallowed poison,

3074
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:48.370
'twould appear by externalswelling,

3075
02:46:48.370 --> 02:46:52.400
but she looks like sleep

3076
02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:58.970
as she would catch anotherAntony

3077
02:46:58.970 --> 02:47:02.530
in her strong toil of grace.

3078
02:47:02.530 --> 02:47:05.270
Here, on her breast.

3079
02:47:05.270 --> 02:47:07.630
There is a vent of blood andsomething blown.

3080
02:47:07.630 --> 02:47:09.730
The like is on her arm.

3081
02:47:09.730 --> 02:47:11.300
This is an aspic's trail,

3082
02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:14.600
and these fig leaves have slimeupon them,

3083
02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:17.600
such as the aspic leaves uponthe caves of Nile.

3084
02:47:17.600 --> 02:47:21.070
Most probable that so she died.

3085
02:47:21.070 --> 02:47:23.630
For her physician tells me

3086
02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:28.800
she hath pursued conclusionsinfinite of easy ways to die.

3087
02:47:31.570 --> 02:47:32.800
Take up her bed

3088
02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:37.500
and bear her women from themonument.

3089
02:47:37.500 --> 02:47:41.130
She shall be buried by herAntony.

3090
02:47:41.130 --> 02:47:46.830
No grave upon the earth shallclip in it a pair so famous.

3091
02:47:46.830 --> 02:47:50.800
High events as these strikethose that make them,

3092
02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:54.270
and their story is no less inpity than his glory

3093
02:47:54.270 --> 02:47:56.700
which brought them to belamented.

3094
02:47:58.530 --> 02:48:03.500
Our army shall in solemn showattend this funeral

3095
02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:06.900
and then to Rome.

3096
02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:09.970
Come, Dolabella,

3097
02:48:09.970 --> 02:48:13.270
see high order in this greatsolemnity.

3098
02:50:14.470 --> 02:50:17.470
