00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:53.630


2
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.400
As I remember, Adam,

3
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.870
it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will

4
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.830
but poor 1,000 crowns

5
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.400
and, as thou sayest,

6
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.070
charged my brother on his blessing

7
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.170
to breed me well:

8
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.830
and there begins my sadness.

9
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.600
My brother Jaques he keeps at school,

10
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.330
and report speaks goldenly of his profit.

11
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.900
For my part, he keeps me rustically at home,

12
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500
or, to speak more properly, stays me here at home unkept;

13
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.970
for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth

14
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.600
that differs not from the stalling of an ox?

15
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.270
Oh, his horses are bred better,

16
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.630
for besides that they are fair with their feeding,

17
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.000
they are taught their manage

18
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.770
and to that end riders dearly hired.

19
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.300
But I his brother gain nothing under him but growth,

20
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.400
for the which his animals on his dunghills

21
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.000
are as much bound to him as I.

22
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.830
Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me,

23
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.430
the something that nature gave me

24
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.400
his countenance seems to take from me.

25
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.930
He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a brother,

26
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.470
and as much as in him lies

27
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.400
mines my gentility with my education.

28
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.200
This is it, Adam, that grieves me;

29
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.070
and the spirit of my father, which I think is within me,

30
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.630
begins to mutiny against this servitude.

31
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.430
I will no longer endure it,

32
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.030
though yet, I know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

33
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.670
Yonder comes my master, your brother.

34
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.930
Now, sir, what make you here?

35
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.100
Nothing.

36
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.670
I am not taught to make anything.

37
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.230
What mar you then, sir?

38
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.330
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made,

39
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness.

40
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.830
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.

41
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.970
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?

42
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.630
What prodigal portion have I spent

43
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.230
that I should come to such penury?

44
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.000
Know you where your are, sir?

45
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.630
O, sir, very well: here in your orchard.

46
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.470
Know you before whom, sir?

47
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.400
Aye, better than him I am before knows me.

48
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.170
I know that you are my eldest brother;

49
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.130
and in the gentle condition of blood, you should so know me.

50
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.270
The courtesy of nations allows you my better,

51
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.730
in that you are the first-born;

52
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.870
but the same tradition takes not away my blood

53
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.630
were there 20 brothers betwixt us.

54
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.400
I have as much of my father in me as you,

55
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.530
albeit, I confess, your coming before me is nearer to his reverence.

56
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.900
What, boy.

57
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.830
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

58
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.530
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

59
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.800
I am no villain.

60
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.830
I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

61
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.230
He was my father,

62
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.430
and he is thrice a villain

63
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.300
that says such a father begot villains.

64
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.330
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat

65
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.100
till this other hand had pulled out thy tongue for saying so.

66
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.500
Thou hast railed on thyself.

67
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.800
Sweet masters, be patient.

68
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.400
For your father's remembrance, be at accord.

69
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.730
Let me go, I say!

70
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.870
I shall not till I please.

71
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.100
You shall hear me.

72
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.100
Ah!

73
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.500
My father charged you in his will to give me good education.

74
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.170
You have trained me like a peasant,

75
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.330
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities.

76
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
The spirit of my father grows strong in me,

77
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.730
and I will no longer endure it!

78
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.770
Therefore,

79
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.430
allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman,

80
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.430
or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament.

81
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.170
With that, I will go buy my fortunes.

82
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.430
And what wilt thou do?

83
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.770
Beg when that is spent?

84
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.070
Well, sir, get you in.

85
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.470
I will not long be troubled with you.

86
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.270
You shall have some part of your will.

87
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.330
I pray you, leave me.

88
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.130
I shall no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

89
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.670
Get you with him, you old dog.

90
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.200
Is "old dog" my reward?

91
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.570
Most true, I have lost my teeth in your service.

92
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.400
God be with my old master.

93
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.070
He would not have spoke such a word.

94
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.130
Is it e'en so?

95
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.570
Begin you to grow upon me?

96
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.030
I will physic your rankness,

97
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.900
and yet give no thousand crowns neither.

98
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.600
Holla, Dennis!

99
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.930
Calls your worship?

100
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.470
Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?

101
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.730
So please you,

102
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.070
he is here at the door and importunes access to you.

103
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.400
Call him in.

104
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.000
'Twill be a good way, for tomorrow the wrestling is.

105
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200
Good morrow to your worship.

106
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.230
Good Monsieur Charles,

107
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.770
what's the new news at the new court?

108
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.130
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news.

109
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.970
That is, the old duke has been banished

110
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.700
by his younger brother the new duke,

111
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.100
and three or four loving lords

112
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.530
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,

113
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.870
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke.

114
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.070
Therefore, he gives them good leave to wander.

115
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.270
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter,

116
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.630
be banished with her father?

117
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.400
Oh, no, for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves her,

118
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.730
being ever from their cradles bred together,

119
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.270
that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her.

120
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.530
She is at the court

121
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.030
and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter,

122
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.000
and never two ladies loved as they do.

123
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.000
Where will the old duke live?

124
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.030
They say he is already at the forest of Arden

125
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.900
and a many merry men with him,

126
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.570
and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England.

127
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.970
They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day

128
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.770
and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world.

129
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.870
What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

130
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.000
Marry, do I, sir,

131
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.230
and I came to acquaint you with a matter.

132
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.800
I am given, sir, secretly, to understand

133
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.470
that your younger brother Orlando

134
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.670
hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall.

135
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.130
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit;

136
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.470
and he that escapes me without some broken limb

137
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.570
shall acquit him well.

138
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.170
Your brother is but young and tender;

139
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.730
and, for your love, I would be loath to foil him

140
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.130
which I must for my own honour if he come in.

141
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.670
Therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you withal

142
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.270
that either you might stay him from his intendment

143
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.970
or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into,

144
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.100
in that it is a thing of his own search

145
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.270
and altogether against my will.

146
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.930
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me,

147
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.730
which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite.

148
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.400
I had myself notice of my brother's purpose herein

149
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.830
and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it,

150
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.970
but he is resolute.

151
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.800
And thou wert best look to't,

152
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.970
for if thou dost him any slight disgrace,

153
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.630
or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee,

154
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.030
he will practise against thee by poison,

155
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.600
entrap thee by some treacherous device

156
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.530
and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life

157
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.800
by some indirect means or other;

158
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.430
for, I assure thee--

159
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.030
and almost with tears I speak it--

160
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.430
there is not one so young and so villainous

161
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.730
this day living.

162
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.400
I am heartily glad I came hither to you.

163
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.230
If he come tomorrow, I'll give him his payment.

164
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.030
And so, God keep your worship.

165
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.900
Farewell, good Charles.

166
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.300
Now will I stir this gamester:

167
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.600
I hope I shall see an end of him,

168
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.200
for my soul, yet I know not why, hates nothing more than he.

169
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.000
Yet he's gentle, never schooled yet learned,

170
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.630
full of noble device, all sorts enchantingly beloved--

171
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.600
indeed, so much in the heart of the world

172
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.370
and especially of mine own people, who best know him,

173
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.300
that I am altogether misprized.

174
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.900
But it shall not be so long.

175
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.270
This wrestler shall clear all.

176
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.400
Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy hither,

177
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.330
which now I'll go about.

178
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.370
Oh.

179
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:36.200
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

180
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.270
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of,

181
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.030
and would you yet I were merrier?

182
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.570
Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father,

183
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.770
you must not learn me to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

184
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:57.000
Herein, I see thou lovest me not with the full weight that I love thee.

185
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.170
If my uncle, thy banished father,

186
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.770
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father,

187
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.430
so thou hadst still been with me,

188
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.770
I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine.

189
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.170
So wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me

190
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.400
were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee.

191
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.770
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate

192
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.770
to rejoice in yours.

193
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.730
You know my father hath no child but I,

194
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.300
nor none is like to have;

195
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.800
and truly, when he dies, thou shalt be his heir,

196
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.600
for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce,

197
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.730
I will render thee again in affection.

198
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.130
By mine honour, I will,

199
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:45.170
and when I break that oath, let me turn monster.

200
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.700
Therefore, my sweet Rose,

201
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.470
my dear Rose...

202
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.930
be merry.

203
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.030
From henceforth, I will, coz,

204
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.000
and devise sports.

205
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.270
Ah.

206
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.470
Let me see.

207
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.470
What think you of falling in love?

208
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.930
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal,

209
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.030
ah, but love no man in good earnest

210
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.430
nor no further in sport neither

211
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.230
than with the safety of a pure blush

212
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.500
thou mayst in honour come off again.

213
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.530
What shall be our sport, then?

214
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.100
Let us sit and mock

215
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.470
the good housewife Fortune from her wheel

216
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.400
that her gifts henceforth may be bestowed equally.

217
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.800
I would we could do so,

218
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.900
for her benefits are mightily misplaced,

219
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.570
and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake

220
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.870
in her gifts to women.

221
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.170
'Tis true,

222
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.370
for those she makes fair, she scarce makes honest,

223
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.400
and those she makes honest, she makes very ill-favoredly.

224
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.700
Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to Nature's.

225
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.700
Fortune reigns in the gifts of the world,

226
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.470
not in the lineaments of Nature.

227
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.300
No?

228
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.630
How now, wit!

229
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.230
Whither wander you?

230
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.500
Mistress, you must come away to your father.

231
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.170
Were you made the messenger?

232
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.900
No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.

233
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.570
Where learned you that oath, fool?

234
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.770
Of a certain knight

235
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.030
that swore by his honour they were good pancakes

236
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.230
and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.

237
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.530
Now I'll stand to it.

238
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.930
The pancakes were naught, and the mustard was good,

239
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.670
and yet was not the knight forsworn.

240
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.970
How prove you that

241
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.030
in the great heap of your knowledge?

242
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.870
Aye, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

243
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.330
Stand you both forth now.

244
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.700
Oh.

245
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.270
Stroke your chins,

246
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.230
and swear by your beards that I am a knave.

247
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.770
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

248
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.830
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were;

249
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.470
but if you swear by that that is not,

250
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.730
you are not forsworn.

251
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.770
No more was this knight swearing by his honour,

252
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.000
for he never had any;

253
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.630
or if he had, he had sworn it away

254
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.600
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

255
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.870
Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

256
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.330
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.

257
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.270
My father's love is enough to honour him.

258
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.630
Enough; speak no more of him.

259
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.000
You'll be whipped for taxation, one of these days.

260
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.370
The more pity that fools may not speak wisely

261
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.000
what wise men do foolishly.

262
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.470
By my troth, thou sayest true,

263
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.470
for since the little wit that fools have was silenced,

264
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.770
the little foolery that wise men have

265
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.130
makes a great show.

266
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.030
Ah, here comes Monsieur Le Beau.

267
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.330
With his mouth full of news.

268
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.270
Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young.

269
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.730
Then shall we be news-crammed.

270
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.930
All the better.

271
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.500
We shall be the more marketable.

272
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.100
Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau.

273
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.270
What is the news?

274
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.400
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

275
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.730
Sport!

276
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.100
Of what color?

277
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.300
What color, madam?

278
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.400
How shall I answer you?

279
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.530
As wit and fortune will.

280
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.830
Or as the Destinies decree.

281
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.970
Well said.

282
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.300
That was laid on with a trowel.

283
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.200
You amaze me, ladies.

284
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.100
I would have told you of good wrestling

285
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.700
which you have lost the sight of.

286
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.730
Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.

287
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.500
I will tell you the beginning,

288
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.270
and if it please your ladyships, you may see the end;

289
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.700
for the best is yet to do.

290
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.930
Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

291
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.870
There comes an old man and his three sons.

292
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.000
I could match this beginning with an old tale.

293
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.970
Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence.

294
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.100
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the duke's wrestler,

295
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.470
which Charles, in a moment,

296
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.200
threw him and broke three of his ribs

297
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.370
that there is little hope of life in him.

298
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.870
So he served the second and so the third.

299
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.470
Yonder they lie,

300
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.970
the poor old man, their father, making such pitiful dole over them

301
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.430
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.

302
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.130
Alas.

303
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.830
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have lost?

304
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.200
Why, this that I speak of.

305
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.130
Thus men may grow wiser every day.

306
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.870
It is the first time that ever I heard

307
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.730
breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.

308
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.130
Or I, I promise thee.

309
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.270
But is there any else

310
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.600
longs to see this broken music in his sides?

311
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.630
Is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking?

312
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.400
Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

313
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.800
They are ready to perform it.

314
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.930
Come on.

315
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.770
Since the youth will not be entreated,

316
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.570
his own peril on his forwardness.

317
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.200
Is yonder the man?

318
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.430
Even he, madam.

319
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.130
Alas, he is too young,

320
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.570
and yet he looks successfully.

321
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.070
How now, daughter and cousin.

322
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.500
Are you crept hither to see the wrestling?

323
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.470
Aye, my liege, so please you give us leave.

324
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.130
You will take little delight in it,

325
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.230
I can tell you.

326
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.600
There is such odds in the man.

327
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.900
In pity of the challenger's youth, I would fain dissuade him,

328
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.300
but he will not be entreated.

329
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.470
Speak to him, ladies.

330
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.370
See if you can move him.

331
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.270
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

332
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.830
Do so; I'll not be by.

333
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.200
Monsieur the challenger, the princess calls for you.

334
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.470
I attend them with all respect and duty.

335
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.000
Young sir, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

336
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.300
No, fair princess.

337
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.700
He is the general challenger.

338
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.000
I come but in as others do

339
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.870
to try with him the strength of my youth.

340
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.500
Young gentleman,

341
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.130
your spirits are too bold for your years.

342
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.430
You have seen cruel proof of this man's strength.

343
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.870
If you saw yourself with your eyes

344
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.400
or knew yourself with your judgment,

345
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.830
the fear of this adventure

346
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.400
would counsel you to a more equal enterprise.

347
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.600
We pray you, for your own sake,

348
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.500
to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

349
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.130
Do, young sir.

350
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.930
Your reputation shall not therefore be misprized.

351
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.600
We shall make it our suit to the duke

352
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.430
that the wrestling may not go forward.

353
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.570
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,

354
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.500
wherein I confess me much guilty

355
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.400
to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing,

356
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.070
but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes

357
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.200
go with me to my trial,

358
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.970
wherein if I be foiled,

359
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.300
there is but one shamed that was never gracious;

360
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.730
if killed, but one dead that was willing to be so.

361
00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.970
I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me;

362
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.870
the world no injury, for in it I have nothing;

363
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.500
only in the world I fill up a place

364
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.870
which may be better supplied when I have made it empty.

365
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.370
The little strength I have, I would it were with you.

366
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.900
And mine to eke out hers.

367
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.100
Fare you well.

368
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.530
Pray heaven I be deceived in you.

369
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.570
Your heart's desires be with you.

370
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.500
Come, where is this young gallant

371
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.930
that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth?

372
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.900
Ready, sir,

373
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.070
but his will hath in it a more modest working.

374
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.330
You shall try but one fall.

375
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.800
No, I warrant, your grace,

376
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.570
you shall not entreat him to a second

377
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.870
that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.

378
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.100
You mean to mock me after.

379
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.770
You should not have mocked me before.

380
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.300
But come your ways.

381
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.600
Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!

382
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.970
I would I were invisible,

383
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.330
to catch the strong fellow by the leg.

384
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.530
Hold.

385
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.500
O excellent, young man!

386
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.130
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye,

387
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.830
I can tell who should down.

388
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.300
No more. No more.

389
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.200
Yes, I beseech your grace.

390
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.770
I am not yet well breathed.

391
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.200
How dost thou, Charles?

392
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.270
He cannot speak, my lord.

393
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.300
Bear him away.

394
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900
What is thy name, young man?

395
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.300
Orlando, my liege,

396
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.370
the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

397
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.800
I would thou hadst been son to some man else.

398
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.430
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,

399
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.500
but I did find him still mine enemy.

400
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.930
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed

401
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.370
hadst thou descended from another house,

402
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.700
now fare thee well.

403
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.000
Thou art a gallant youth.

404
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.100
I would thou hadst told me of another father.

405
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.230
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

406
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.130
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,

407
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.570
his youngest son,

408
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.270
and would not change that calling to be adopted heir to Frederick.

409
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.900
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,

410
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.030
and all the world was of my father's mind.

411
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.470
Had I before known this young man his son,

412
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.700
I should have given him tears unto entreaties

413
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.300
ere he should thus have ventured.

414
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.800
Gentle cousin,

415
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.600
let us go thank him and encourage him.

416
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.630
My father's rough and envious disposition

417
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.400
sticks me at heart.

418
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.300
Sir...

419
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.830
you have well deserved.

420
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.770
If you do keep your promises in love

421
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.070
but justly as you have exceeded all promise,

422
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.270
your mistress shall be happy.

423
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.330
Gentleman, wear this for me...

424
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.900
one out of suits with fortune,

425
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.100
that would give more but that her hand lacks means.

426
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.200
Shall we go, coz?

427
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.900
Aye.

428
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.900
Fare you well, fair gentleman.

429
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.000
Can I not say I thank you?

430
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.830
My better parts are all thrown down,

431
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.130
and that which here stands up is but a quintain,

432
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.430
a mere lifeless block.

433
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.300
He calls us back.

434
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.970
My pride fell with my fortunes.

435
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.370
I'll ask him what he would.

436
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.270
Did you call, sir?

437
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:35.630
Sir, you have wrestled well

438
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.570
and overthrown more than your enemies.

439
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.230
Will you go, coz?

440
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.670
Have with you.

441
00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:48.670
Fare you well.

442
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.230
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?

443
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.730
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.

444
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.100
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown,

445
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.800
or Charles or something weaker masters thee.

446
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.830
Good sir...

447
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.500
I do in friendship counsel you to leave this place.

448
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.630
Albeit you have deserved high commendation,

449
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.900
true applause, and love,

450
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.630
yet such is now the duke's condition

451
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.700
that he misconstrues all that you have done.

452
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.070
The duke is humorous.

453
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:26.470
What he is indeed more suits you to conceive than I to speak of.

454
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.530
I thank you, sir, and pray you, tell me this:

455
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.400
which of the two was daughter of the duke

456
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.870
that here was at the wrestling?

457
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.970
Neither his daughter if we judge by manners,

458
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.030
and yet indeed, the smaller is his daughter.

459
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.000
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke

460
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.170
and here detain'd by her usurping uncle to keep his daughter company,

461
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.770
whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters;

462
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.130
but I can tell you that of late

463
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.830
this duke hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece

464
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.330
grounded upon no other argument

465
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.470
but that the people praise her for her virtues

466
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.330
and pity her for her good father's sake;

467
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.530
and on my life,

468
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.130
his malice 'gainst the lady will suddenly break forth.

469
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.230
Sir, fare you well.

470
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.170
Hereafter, in a better world than this,

471
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.300
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

472
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.970
I rest much bounden to you; fare you well.

473
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.630
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother,

474
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.900
from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother,

475
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.570
but heavenly Rosalind--

476
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.700
Why, cousin!

477
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.330
Why, Rosalind!

478
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.370
Cupid have mercy, not a word?

479
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.870
Not one to throw at a dog.

480
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.800
Perth, no, thy words are too precious

481
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.330
to be cast away upon curs.

482
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.500
Throw some of them at me.

483
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.670
Come, lame me with reasons.

484
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.700
Then there were two cousins laid up

485
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.630
when the one should be lamed with reasons

486
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.400
and the other mad without any.

487
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.630
But is all this for thy father?

488
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.530
No, some of it is for my child's father.

489
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.430
Ah.

490
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:10.330
O, how full of briers is this working-day world!

491
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.370
They are but burs, cousin,

492
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.870
thrown upon thee in holiday foolery.

493
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.500
If we walk not in the trodden paths,

494
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.370
our very petticoats will catch them.

495
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.000
I could throw them off my coat.

496
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.330
These burs are in my heart.

497
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.600
Ahem-- hem them away.

498
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.070
I would try,

499
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.270
if I could cry "hem" and have him.

500
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.170
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

501
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.030
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself.

502
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.970
O, a good wish upon you,

503
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.230
and you shall try in time in despite of a fall;

504
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.870
but turning these jests out of service,

505
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.300
let us talk in good earnest.

506
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.970
Is it possible on such a sudden

507
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.530
that you should fall into so strong a liking

508
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.300
with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

509
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.370
The duke my father loved his father dearly.

510
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.830
But does it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?

511
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.870
By this kind of chase, I should hate him,

512
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.300
for my father hated his father dearly.

513
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.700
Yet, I hate not Orlando.

514
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.530
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

515
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.070
Why should I not?

516
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.230
Does he not deserve well?

517
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.600
Let me love him for that.

518
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.930
Do you love him because I do.

519
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.170
Mistress,

520
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.500
dispatch you with your safest haste,

521
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.900
and get you from our court.

522
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.000
Me, uncle?

523
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.470
You, cousin.

524
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.930
Within these 10 days,

525
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.300
if that thou be'st found

526
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.500
so near our public court as 20 miles,

527
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.300
thou diest for it.

528
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.700
I do beseech your grace,

529
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.770
let me the knowledge of my faultbear with me.

530
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.030
If with myself I hold intelligence

531
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:03.070
or have acquaintance of mine own desires,

532
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.430
if that I do not dream or be not frantic--

533
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.300
as I do trust I am not--

534
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.630
then, dear uncle, never so much as in a thought unborn

535
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.070
did I offend your highness.

536
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.570
Thus do all traitors.

537
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.770
If their purgation did consist in words,

538
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.530
they are as innocent as grace itself.

539
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.400
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

540
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.130
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor.

541
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.230
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

542
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.300
Thou art thy father's daughter;there's enough.

543
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.300
So was I when your highness took his dukedom.

544
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.700
So was I when your highness banish'd him.

545
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.470
Treason is not inherited, my lord;

546
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.470
or if we did derive it from our friends,

547
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.670
what's that to me?

548
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.630
My father was no traitor.

549
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.100
Then, good my liege,

550
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.330
mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous.

551
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.500
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

552
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.230
Aye, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,

553
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.400
else had she with her father ranged along.

554
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.170
I did not then entreat to have her stay.

555
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.600
It was your pleasure and your own remorse.

556
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.970
I was too young that time to value her,

557
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.700
but now I know her.

558
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.070
If she be a traitor, why, then so am I,

559
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.630
for still, we slept together, rose in an instant,

560
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.530
learn'd, play'd, eat together;

561
00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.930
and wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,

562
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:30.200
still we went coupled and inseparable.

563
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.770
She is too subtle for thee;

564
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.930
and her smoothness, her very silence,

565
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.700
and her patience speak to the people;

566
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.900
and they pity her.

567
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.130
Thou art a fool.

568
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.170
She robs thee of thy name,

569
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.470
and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous

570
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.670
when she is gone.

571
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.370
Open not thy lips!

572
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.130
Firm and irrevocable is my doom which I have pass'd upon her.

573
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.330
She is banish'd.

574
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.900
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege.

575
00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.730
I cannot live out of her company.

576
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.930
You are a fool.

577
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.400
You, niece, provide yourself.

578
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.600
If you outstay the time,

579
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.130
upon mine honour and in the greatness of my word,

580
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.830
you die.

581
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.600
O my poor Rosalind...

582
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.570
whither wilt thou go?

583
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.900
Wilt thou change fathers?

584
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.300
I will give thee mine.

585
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.500
Oh, I charge thee,

586
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.300
be thou not more grieved than I am.

587
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.170
I have more cause.

588
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.000
Thou hast not, cousin.

589
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.400
Prithee, be cheerful.

590
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.530
Know'st thou not,

591
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.100
the duke hath banish'd me, his daughter?

592
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.500
That he hath not.

593
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.200
No, hath not?

594
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.870
Rosalind lacks then the love which teaches thee

595
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.730
that thou and I am one.

596
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.200
Therefore, devise with me how we may fly,

597
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.830
whither to go and what to bear with us;

598
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:15.700
and do not seek to take your charge upon you,

599
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.970
to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out,

600
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.770
for by this heaven,now at our sorrows pale,

601
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.670
say what thou canst; I'll go along with thee.

602
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.700
Why, whither shall we go?

603
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.130
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

604
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.570
Alas, what danger will it be to us,

605
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.730
maids as we are, to travel forth so far?

606
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.370
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

607
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:48.430
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire

608
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.800
and with a kind of umber smirch my face;

609
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.070
the like will you.

610
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.830
So shall we pass along and never stir assailants.

611
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.500
Would it not be better,

612
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.770
because that I am more than common tall,

613
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:05.530
that I should suit me all points like a man?

614
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.900
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,

615
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.830
a boar spear in my hand;

616
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.400
and in my heart lie there

617
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.830
what hidden woman's fear there will.

618
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.530
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside

619
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.730
as many other mannish cowards have

620
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.170
that do outface it with their semblances.

621
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:27.900
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

622
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.070
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page,

623
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.330
and look you therefore, call me Ganymede,

624
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.100
but what will you be call'd?

625
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.300
Something that hath a reference to my state.

626
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.770
No longer Celia, but Aliena.

627
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.870
Oh, shh.

628
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.970
But, cousin,

629
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.470
what if we assay'd to steal the clownish fool

630
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.170
out of your father's court?

631
00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.630
Would he not be a comfort to our travels?

632
00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.730
He'll go o'er the wide world with me.

633
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.230
Leave me alone to woo him.

634
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:08.570
Let's away and get our jewels and our wealth together,

635
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.700
devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit

636
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.700
that will be made after my flight.

637
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.030
Now go we in content

638
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.500
to liberty and not to banishment.

639
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.200
