00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:53.630


2
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.400
As I remember, Adam,

3
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.870
it was upon this fashionbequeathed me by will

4
00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.830
but poor 1,000 crowns

5
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.400
and, as thou sayest,

6
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.070
charged my brother on hisblessing

7
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.170
to breed me well:

8
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.830
and there begins mysadness.

9
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.600
My brother Jaques he keepsat school,

10
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.330
and report speaks goldenlyof his profit.

11
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.900
For my part, he keeps merustically at home,

12
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500
or, to speak moreproperly, stays me here athome unkept;

13
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.970
for call you that keepingfor a gentleman of mybirth

14
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.600
that differs not from thestalling of an ox?

15
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.270
Oh, his horses are bredbetter,

16
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.630
for besides that they arefair with their feeding,

17
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.000
they are taught theirmanage

18
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.770
and to that end ridersdearly hired.

19
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.300
But I his brother gainnothing under him butgrowth,

20
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.400
for the which his animalson his dunghills

21
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.000
are as much bound to himas I.

22
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.830
Besides this nothing thathe so plentifully givesme,

23
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.430
the something that naturegave me

24
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.400
his countenance seems totake from me.

25
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.930
He lets me feed with hishinds, bars me the placeof a brother,

26
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.470
and as much as in him lies

27
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.400
mines my gentility with myeducation.

28
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.200
This is it, Adam, thatgrieves me;

29
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.070
and the spirit of myfather, which I think iswithin me,

30
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.630
begins to mutiny againstthis servitude.

31
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.430
I will no longer endureit,

32
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.030
though yet, I know no wiseremedy how to avoid it.

33
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.670
Yonder comes my master,your brother.

34
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.930
Now, sir, what make youhere?

35
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.100
Nothing.

36
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.670
I am not taught to makeanything.

37
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.230
What mar you then, sir?

38
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.330
Marry, sir, I am helpingyou to mar that which Godmade,

39
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
a poor unworthy brother ofyours with idleness.

40
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.830
Marry, sir, be betteremployed, and be naughtawhile.

41
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.970
Shall I keep your hogs andeat husks with them?

42
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.630
What prodigal portion haveI spent

43
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.230
that I should come to suchpenury?

44
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.000
Know you where your are,sir?

45
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.630
O, sir, very well: here inyour orchard.

46
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.470
Know you before whom, sir?

47
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.400
Aye, better than him I ambefore knows me.

48
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.170
I know that you are myeldest brother;

49
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.130
and in the gentlecondition of blood, youshould so know me.

50
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.270
The courtesy of nationsallows you my better,

51
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.730
in that you are thefirst-born;

52
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.870
but the same traditiontakes not away my blood

53
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.630
were there 20 brothersbetwixt us.

54
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.400
I have as much of myfather in me as you,

55
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.530
albeit, I confess, yourcoming before me is nearerto his reverence.

56
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.900
What, boy.

57
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.830
Come, come, elder brother,you are too young in this.

58
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.530
Wilt thou lay hands on me,villain?

59
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.800
I am no villain.

60
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.830
I am the youngest son ofSir Rowland de Boys.

61
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.230
He was my father,

62
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.430
and he is thrice a villain

63
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.300
that says such a fatherbegot villains.

64
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.330
Wert thou not my brother,I would not take this handfrom thy throat

65
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.100
till this other hand hadpulled out thy tongue forsaying so.

66
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.500
Thou hast railed onthyself.

67
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.800
Sweet masters, be patient.

68
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.400
For your father'sremembrance, be at accord.

69
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.730
Let me go, I say!

70
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.870
I shall not till I please.

71
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.100
You shall hear me.

72
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.100
Ah!

73
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.500
My father charged you inhis will to give me goodeducation.

74
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.170
You have trained me like apeasant,

75
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.330
obscuring and hiding fromme all gentleman-likequalities.

76
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330
The spirit of my fathergrows strong in me,

77
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.730
and I will no longerendure it!

78
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.770
Therefore,

79
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.430
allow me such exercises asmay become a gentleman,

80
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.430
or give me the poorallottery my father leftme by testament.

81
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.170
With that, I will go buymy fortunes.

82
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.430
And what wilt thou do?

83
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.770
Beg when that is spent?

84
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.070
Well, sir, get you in.

85
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.470
I will not long betroubled with you.

86
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.270
You shall have some partof your will.

87
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.330
I pray you, leave me.

88
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.130
I shall no further offendyou than becomes me for mygood.

89
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.670
Get you with him, you olddog.

90
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.200
Is "old dog" my reward?

91
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.570
Most true, I have lost myteeth in your service.

92
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.400
God be with my old master.

93
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.070
He would not have spokesuch a word.

94
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.130
Is it e'en so?

95
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.570
Begin you to grow upon me?

96
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.030
I will physic yourrankness,

97
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.900
and yet give no thousandcrowns neither.

98
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.600
Holla, Dennis!

99
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.930
Calls your worship?

100
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.470
Was not Charles, theduke's wrestler, here tospeak with me?

101
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.730
So please you,

102
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.070
he is here at the door andimportunes access to you.

103
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.400
Call him in.

104
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.000
'Twill be a good way, fortomorrow the wrestling is.

105
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.200
Good morrow to yourworship.

106
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.230
Good Monsieur Charles,

107
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.770
what's the new news at thenew court?

108
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.130
There's no news at thecourt, sir, but the oldnews.

109
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.970
That is, the old duke hasbeen banished

110
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.700
by his younger brother thenew duke,

111
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.100
and three or four lovinglords

112
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.530
have put themselves intovoluntary exile with him,

113
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.870
whose lands and revenuesenrich the new duke.

114
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.070
Therefore, he gives themgood leave to wander.

115
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.270
Can you tell if Rosalind,the duke's daughter,

116
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.630
be banished with herfather?

117
00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.400
Oh, no, for the duke'sdaughter, her cousin, soloves her,

118
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.730
being ever from theircradles bred together,

119
00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.270
that she would havefollowed her exile or havedied to stay behind her.

120
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:04.530
She is at the court

121
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.030
and no less beloved of heruncle than his owndaughter,

122
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.000
and never two ladies lovedas they do.

123
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.000
Where will the old dukelive?

124
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.030
They say he is already atthe forest of Arden

125
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.900
and a many merry men withhim,

126
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.570
and there they live likethe old Robin Hood ofEngland.

127
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.970
They say many younggentlemen flock to himevery day

128
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.770
and fleet the timecarelessly as they did inthe golden world.

129
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.870
What, you wrestle tomorrowbefore the new duke?

130
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.000
Marry, do I, sir,

131
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.230
and I came to acquaint youwith a matter.

132
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.800
I am given, sir, secretly,to understand

133
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.470
that your younger brotherOrlando

134
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.670
hath a disposition to comein disguised against me totry a fall.

135
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.130
Tomorrow, sir, I wrestlefor my credit;

136
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.470
and he that escapes mewithout some broken limb

137
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.570
shall acquit him well.

138
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.170
Your brother is but youngand tender;

139
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.730
and, for your love, Iwould be loath to foil him

140
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.130
which I must for my ownhonour if he come in.

141
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.670
Therefore, out of my loveto you, I came hither toacquaint you withal

142
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.270
that either you might stayhim from his intendment

143
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.970
or brook such disgracewell as he shall run into,

144
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.100
in that it is a thing ofhis own search

145
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.270
and altogether againstmy will.

146
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.930
Charles, I thank thee forthy love to me,

147
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:14.730
which thou shalt find Iwill most kindly requite.

148
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.400
I had myself notice of mybrother's purpose herein

149
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.830
and have by underhandmeans laboured to dissuadehim from it,

150
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.970
but he is resolute.

151
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:30.800
And thou wert best lookto't,

152
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.970
for if thou dost him anyslight disgrace,

153
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.630
or if he do not mightilygrace himself on thee,

154
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.030
he will practise againstthee by poison,

155
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.600
entrap thee by sometreacherous device

156
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.530
and never leave thee tillhe hath ta'en thy life

157
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.800
by some indirect means orother;

158
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.430
for, I assure thee--

159
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.030
and almost with tears Ispeak it--

160
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.430
there is not one so youngand so villainous

161
00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.730
this day living.

162
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.400
I am heartily glad I camehither to you.

163
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.230
If he come tomorrow, I'llgive him his payment.

164
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.030
And so, God keep yourworship.

165
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:11.900
Farewell, good Charles.

166
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.300
Now will I stir thisgamester:

167
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.600
I hope I shall see an endof him,

168
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.200
for my soul, yet I knownot why, hates nothingmore than he.

169
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.000
Yet he's gentle, neverschooled yet learned,

170
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.630
full of noble device, allsorts enchantinglybeloved--

171
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.600
indeed, so much in theheart of the world

172
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.370
and especially of mine ownpeople, who best know him,

173
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.300
that I am altogethermisprized.

174
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.900
But it shall not be solong.

175
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.270
This wrestler shall clearall.

176
00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.400
Nothing remains but that Ikindle the boy hither,

177
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.330
which now I'll go about.

178
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.370
Oh.

179
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:36.200
I pray thee, Rosalind,sweet my coz, be merry.

180
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.270
Dear Celia, I show moremirth than I am mistressof,

181
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.030
and would you yet I weremerrier?

182
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.570
Unless you could teach meto forget a banishedfather,

183
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.770
you must not learn me toremember any extraordinarypleasure.

184
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:57.000
Herein, I see thou lovestme not with the fullweight that I love thee.

185
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.170
If my uncle, thy banishedfather,

186
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.770
had banished thy uncle,the duke my father,

187
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.430
so thou hadst still beenwith me,

188
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.770
I could have taught mylove to take thy fatherfor mine.

189
00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.170
So wouldst thou if thetruth of thy love to me

190
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:13.400
were so righteouslytempered as mine is tothee.

191
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.770
Well, I will forget thecondition of my estate

192
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.770
to rejoice in yours.

193
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.730
You know my father hath nochild but I,

194
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.300
nor none is like to have;

195
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.800
and truly, when he dies,thou shalt be his heir,

196
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.600
for what he hath takenaway from thy fatherperforce,

197
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.730
I will render thee againin affection.

198
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.130
By mine honour, I will,

199
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:45.170
and when I break thatoath, let me turn monster.

200
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.700
Therefore, my sweet Rose,

201
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.470
my dear Rose...

202
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.930
be merry.

203
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.030
From henceforth, I will,coz,

204
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.000
and devise sports.

205
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.270
Ah.

206
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:02.470
Let me see.

207
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:07.470
What think you of fallingin love?

208
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.930
Marry, I prithee, do, tomake sport withal,

209
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.030
ah, but love no man ingood earnest

210
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.430
nor no further in sportneither

211
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.230
than with the safety of apure blush

212
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.500
thou mayst in honour comeoff again.

213
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.530
What shall be our sport,then?

214
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.100
Let us sit and mock

215
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.470
the good housewife Fortunefrom her wheel

216
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:33.400
that her gifts henceforthmay be bestowed equally.

217
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.800
I would we could do so,

218
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.900
for her benefits aremightily misplaced,

219
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.570
and the bountiful blindwoman doth most mistake

220
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.870
in her gifts to women.

221
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.170
'Tis true,

222
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.370
for those she makes fair,she scarce makes honest,

223
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:48.400
and those she makeshonest, she makes veryill-favoredly.

224
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.700
Nay, now thou goest fromFortune's office toNature's.

225
00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.700
Fortune reigns in thegifts of the world,

226
00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.470
not in the lineaments ofNature.

227
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.300
No?

228
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.630
How now, wit!

229
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.230
Whither wander you?

230
00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:05.500
Mistress, you must comeaway to your father.

231
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.170
Were you made themessenger?

232
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:09.900
No, by mine honour, but Iwas bid to come for you.

233
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.570
Where learned you thatoath, fool?

234
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.770
Of a certain knight

235
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.030
that swore by his honourthey were good pancakes

236
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.230
and swore by his honourthe mustard was naught.

237
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.530
Now I'll stand to it.

238
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.930
The pancakes were naught,and the mustard was good,

239
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.670
and yet was not the knightforsworn.

240
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:23.970
How prove you that

241
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.030
in the great heap of yourknowledge?

242
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.870
Aye, marry, now unmuzzleyour wisdom.

243
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.330
Stand you both forth now.

244
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.700
Oh.

245
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.270
Stroke your chins,

246
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.230
and swear by your beardsthat I am a knave.

247
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.770
By our beards, if we hadthem, thou art.

248
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.830
By my knavery, if I hadit, then I were;

249
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.470
but if you swear by thatthat is not,

250
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.730
you are not forsworn.

251
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.770
No more was this knightswearing by his honour,

252
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.000
for he never had any;

253
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.630
or if he had, he had swornit away

254
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.600
before ever he saw thosepancakes or that mustard.

255
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.870
Prithee, who is't thatthou meanest?

256
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.330
One that old Frederick,your father, loves.

257
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.270
My father's love is enoughto honour him.

258
00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.630
Enough; speak no more ofhim.

259
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.000
You'll be whipped fortaxation, one of thesedays.

260
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.370
The more pity that foolsmay not speak wisely

261
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.000
what wise men dofoolishly.

262
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.470
By my troth, thou sayesttrue,

263
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.470
for since the little witthat fools have wassilenced,

264
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.770
the little foolery thatwise men have

265
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.130
makes a great show.

266
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.030
Ah, here comes Monsieur LeBeau.

267
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.330
With his mouth full ofnews.

268
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.270
Which he will put on us aspigeons feed their young.

269
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.730
Then shall we benews-crammed.

270
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:30.930
All the better.

271
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.500
We shall be the moremarketable.

272
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.100
Bon jour, Monsieur LeBeau.

273
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.270
What is the news?

274
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.400
Fair princess, you havelost much good sport.

275
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.730
Sport!

276
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.100
Of what color?

277
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.300
What color, madam?

278
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:43.400
How shall I answer you?

279
00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.530
As wit and fortune will.

280
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.830
Or as the Destiniesdecree.

281
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.970
Well said.

282
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.300
That was laid on with atrowel.

283
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.200
You amaze me, ladies.

284
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.100
I would have told you ofgood wrestling

285
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.700
which you have lost thesight of.

286
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.730
Yet tell us the manner ofthe wrestling.

287
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.500
I will tell you thebeginning,

288
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.270
and if it please yourladyships, you may see theend;

289
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.700
for the best is yet to do.

290
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.930
Well, the beginning, thatis dead and buried.

291
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.870
There comes an old man andhis three sons.

292
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.000
I could match thisbeginning with an oldtale.

293
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.970
Three proper young men ofexcellent growth andpresence.

294
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.100
The eldest of the threewrestled with Charles, theduke's wrestler,

295
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.470
which Charles, in amoment,

296
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.200
threw him and broke threeof his ribs

297
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.370
that there is little hopeof life in him.

298
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:24.870
So he served the secondand so the third.

299
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.470
Yonder they lie,

300
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.970
the poor old man, theirfather, making suchpitiful dole over them

301
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:32.430
that all the beholderstake his part withweeping.

302
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:34.130
Alas.

303
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.830
But what is the sport,monsieur, that the ladieshave lost?

304
00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.200
Why, this that I speak of.

305
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.130
Thus men may grow wiserevery day.

306
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.870
It is the first time thatever I heard

307
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.730
breaking of ribs was sportfor ladies.

308
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.130
Or I, I promise thee.

309
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:46.270
But is there any else

310
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.600
longs to see this brokenmusic in his sides?

311
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.630
Is there yet another dotesupon rib breaking?

312
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.400
Shall we see thiswrestling, cousin?

313
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.800
They are ready to performit.

314
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.930
Come on.

315
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.770
Since the youth will notbe entreated,

316
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.570
his own peril on hisforwardness.

317
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.200
Is yonder the man?

318
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.430
Even he, madam.

319
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.130
Alas, he is too young,

320
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.570
and yet he lookssuccessfully.

321
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.070
How now, daughter andcousin.

322
00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:32.500
Are you crept hither tosee the wrestling?

323
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.470
Aye, my liege, so pleaseyou give us leave.

324
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.130
You will take littledelight in it,

325
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.230
I can tell you.

326
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.600
There is such odds in theman.

327
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:41.900
In pity of thechallenger's youth, Iwould fain dissuade him,

328
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.300
but he will not beentreated.

329
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.470
Speak to him, ladies.

330
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.370
See if you can move him.

331
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.270
Call him hither, goodMonsieur Le Beau.

332
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.830
Do so; I'll not be by.

333
00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:54.200
Monsieur the challenger,the princess calls foryou.

334
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.470
I attend them with allrespect and duty.

335
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.000
Young sir, have youchallenged Charles thewrestler?

336
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.300
No, fair princess.

337
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.700
He is the generalchallenger.

338
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.000
I come but in as others do

339
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.870
to try with him thestrength of my youth.

340
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:13.500
Young gentleman,

341
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.130
your spirits are too boldfor your years.

342
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.430
You have seen cruel proofof this man's strength.

343
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.870
If you saw yourself withyour eyes

344
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:25.400
or knew yourself with yourjudgment,

345
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.830
the fear of this adventure

346
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:31.400
would counsel you to amore equal enterprise.

347
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.600
We pray you, for your ownsake,

348
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.500
to embrace your own safetyand give over thisattempt.

349
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.130
Do, young sir.

350
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.930
Your reputation shall nottherefore be misprized.

351
00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:44.600
We shall make it our suitto the duke

352
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.430
that the wrestling may notgo forward.

353
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.570
I beseech you, punish menot with your hardthoughts,

354
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.500
wherein I confess me muchguilty

355
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.400
to deny so fair andexcellent ladies anything,

356
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.070
but let your fair eyes andgentle wishes

357
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.200
go with me to my trial,

358
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.970
wherein if I be foiled,

359
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.300
there is but one shamedthat was never gracious;

360
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:06.730
if killed, but one deadthat was willing to be so.

361
00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.970
I shall do my friends nowrong, for I have none tolament me;

362
00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.870
the world no injury, forin it I have nothing;

363
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.500
only in the world I fillup a place

364
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.870
which may be bettersupplied when I have madeit empty.

365
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.370
The little strength Ihave, I would it were withyou.

366
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.900
And mine to eke out hers.

367
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:29.100
Fare you well.

368
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.530
Pray heaven I be deceivedin you.

369
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.570
Your heart's desires bewith you.

370
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.500
Come, where is this younggallant

371
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.930
that is so desirous to liewith his mother earth?

372
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.900
Ready, sir,

373
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.070
but his will hath in it amore modest working.

374
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.330
You shall try but onefall.

375
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.800
No, I warrant, your grace,

376
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.570
you shall not entreat himto a second

377
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.870
that have so mightilypersuaded him from afirst.

378
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.100
You mean to mock me after.

379
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.770
You should not have mockedme before.

380
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.300
But come your ways.

381
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.600
Now Hercules be thy speed,young man!

382
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.970
I would I were invisible,

383
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:13.330
to catch the strong fellowby the leg.

384
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.530
Hold.

385
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.500
O excellent, young man!

386
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.130
If I had a thunderbolt inmine eye,

387
00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.830
I can tell who shoulddown.

388
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.300
No more. No more.

389
00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:52.200
Yes, I beseech your grace.

390
00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.770
I am not yet wellbreathed.

391
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.200
How dost thou, Charles?

392
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.270
He cannot speak, my lord.

393
00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.300
Bear him away.

394
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.900
What is thy name, youngman?

395
00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.300
Orlando, my liege,

396
00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.370
the youngest son of SirRowland de Boys.

397
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:13.800
I would thou hadst beenson to some man else.

398
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.430
The world esteem'd thyfather honourable,

399
00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.500
but I did find him stillmine enemy.

400
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.930
Thou shouldst have betterpleased me with this deed

401
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.370
hadst thou descended fromanother house,

402
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.700
now fare thee well.

403
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.000
Thou art a gallant youth.

404
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.100
I would thou hadst told meof another father.

405
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.230
Were I my father, coz,would I do this?

406
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.130
I am more proud to be SirRowland's son,

407
00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:36.570
his youngest son,

408
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.270
and would not change thatcalling to be adopted heirto Frederick.

409
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.900
My father loved SirRowland as his soul,

410
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.030
and all the world was ofmy father's mind.

411
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.470
Had I before known thisyoung man his son,

412
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.700
I should have given himtears unto entreaties

413
00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.300
ere he should thus haveventured.

414
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.800
Gentle cousin,

415
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.600
let us go thank him andencourage him.

416
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.630
My father's rough andenvious disposition

417
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.400
sticks me at heart.

418
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.300
Sir...

419
00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.830
you have well deserved.

420
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.770
If you do keep yourpromises in love

421
00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.070
but justly as you haveexceeded all promise,

422
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.270
your mistress shall behappy.

423
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.330
Gentleman, wear this forme...

424
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.900
one out of suits withfortune,

425
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.100
that would give more butthat her hand lacks means.

426
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.200
Shall we go, coz?

427
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.900
Aye.

428
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.900
Fare you well, fairgentleman.

429
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.000
Can I not say I thank you?

430
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.830
My better parts are allthrown down,

431
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.130
and that which here standsup is but a quintain,

432
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:13.430
a mere lifeless block.

433
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.300
He calls us back.

434
00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.970
My pride fell with myfortunes.

435
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:21.370
I'll ask him what hewould.

436
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.270
Did you call, sir?

437
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:35.630
Sir, you have wrestledwell

438
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.570
and overthrown more thanyour enemies.

439
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.230
Will you go, coz?

440
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.670
Have with you.

441
00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:48.670
Fare you well.

442
00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.230
What passion hangs theseweights upon my tongue?

443
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.730
I cannot speak to her, yetshe urged conference.

444
00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:04.100
O poor Orlando, thou artoverthrown,

445
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.800
or Charles or somethingweaker masters thee.

446
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.830
Good sir...

447
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.500
I do in friendship counselyou to leave this place.

448
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.630
Albeit you have deservedhigh commendation,

449
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.900
true applause, and love,

450
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.630
yet such is now the duke'scondition

451
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.700
that he misconstrues allthat you have done.

452
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.070
The duke is humorous.

453
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:26.470
What he is indeed moresuits you to conceive thanI to speak of.

454
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.530
I thank you, sir, and prayyou, tell me this:

455
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.400
which of the two wasdaughter of the duke

456
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.870
that here was at thewrestling?

457
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.970
Neither his daughter if wejudge by manners,

458
00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:36.030
and yet indeed, thesmaller is his daughter.

459
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.000
The other is daughter tothe banish'd duke

460
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.170
and here detain'd by herusurping uncle to keep hisdaughter company,

461
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.770
whose loves are dearerthan the natural bond ofsisters;

462
00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:45.130
but I can tell you that oflate

463
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.830
this duke hath ta'endispleasure 'gainst hisgentle niece

464
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:49.330
grounded upon no otherargument

465
00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:51.470
but that the people praiseher for her virtues

466
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.330
and pity her for her goodfather's sake;

467
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.530
and on my life,

468
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.130
his malice 'gainst thelady will suddenly breakforth.

469
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.230
Sir, fare you well.

470
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.170
Hereafter, in a betterworld than this,

471
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.300
I shall desire more loveand knowledge of you.

472
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.970
I rest much bounden toyou; fare you well.

473
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.630
Thus must I from the smokeinto the smother,

474
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.900
from tyrant duke unto atyrant brother,

475
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:19.570
but heavenly Rosalind--

476
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:27.700
Why, cousin!

477
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:34.330
Why, Rosalind!

478
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.370
Cupid have mercy, not aword?

479
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.870
Not one to throw at a dog.

480
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.800
Perth, no, thy words aretoo precious

481
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:46.330
to be cast away upon curs.

482
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.500
Throw some of them at me.

483
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.670
Come, lame me withreasons.

484
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.700
Then there were twocousins laid up

485
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:53.630
when the one should belamed with reasons

486
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.400
and the other mad withoutany.

487
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:58.630
But is all this for thyfather?

488
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:02.530
No, some of it is for mychild's father.

489
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.430
Ah.

490
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:10.330
O, how full of briers isthis working-day world!

491
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.370
They are but burs, cousin,

492
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.870
thrown upon thee inholiday foolery.

493
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.500
If we walk not in thetrodden paths,

494
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.370
our very petticoats willcatch them.

495
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.000
I could throw them off mycoat.

496
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.330
These burs are in myheart.

497
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.600
Ahem-- hem them away.

498
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.070
I would try,

499
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.270
if I could cry "hem" andhave him.

500
00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:32.170
Come, come, wrestle withthy affections.

501
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.030
O, they take the part of abetter wrestler thanmyself.

502
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.970
O, a good wish upon you,

503
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.230
and you shall try in timein despite of a fall;

504
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.870
but turning these jestsout of service,

505
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.300
let us talk in goodearnest.

506
00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.970
Is it possible on sucha sudden

507
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.530
that you should fall intoso strong a liking

508
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.300
with old Sir Rowland'syoungest son?

509
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.370
The duke my father lovedhis father dearly.

510
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.830
But does it thereforeensue that you should lovehis son dearly?

511
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.870
By this kind of chase, Ishould hate him,

512
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.300
for my father hated hisfather dearly.

513
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.700
Yet, I hate not Orlando.

514
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.530
No, faith, hate him not,for my sake.

515
00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.070
Why should I not?

516
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.230
Does he not deserve well?

517
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.600
Let me love him for that.

518
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.930
Do you love him because Ido.

519
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.170
Mistress,

520
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.500
dispatch you with yoursafest haste,

521
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.900
and get you from ourcourt.

522
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:41.000
Me, uncle?

523
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.470
You, cousin.

524
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:44.930
Within these 10 days,

525
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.300
if that thou be'st found

526
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.500
so near our public courtas 20 miles,

527
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.300
thou diest for it.

528
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.700
I do beseech your grace,

529
00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:54.770
let me the knowledge of myfaultbear with me.

530
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:59.030
If with myself I holdintelligence

531
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:03.070
or have acquaintance ofmine own desires,

532
00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.430
if that I do not dream orbe not frantic--

533
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.300
as I do trust I am not--

534
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.630
then, dear uncle, never somuch as in a thoughtunborn

535
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.070
did I offend yourhighness.

536
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:15.570
Thus do all traitors.

537
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.770
If their purgation didconsist in words,

538
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:20.530
they are as innocent asgrace itself.

539
00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.400
Let it suffice thee that Itrust thee not.

540
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.130
Yet your mistrust cannotmake me a traitor.

541
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.230
Tell me whereon thelikelihood depends.

542
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.300
Thou art thy father'sdaughter;there's enough.

543
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.300
So was I when yourhighness took his dukedom.

544
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.700
So was I when yourhighness banish'd him.

545
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.470
Treason is not inherited,my lord;

546
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:42.470
or if we did derive itfrom our friends,

547
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.670
what's that to me?

548
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.630
My father was no traitor.

549
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:50.100
Then, good my liege,

550
00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.330
mistake me not so much tothink my poverty istreacherous.

551
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.500
Dear sovereign, hear mespeak.

552
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.230
Aye, Celia; we stay'd herfor your sake,

553
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.400
else had she with herfather ranged along.

554
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.170
I did not then entreat tohave her stay.

555
00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.600
It was your pleasure andyour own remorse.

556
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.970
I was too young that timeto value her,

557
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:13.700
but now I know her.

558
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.070
If she be a traitor, why,then so am I,

559
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.630
for still, we slepttogether, rose in aninstant,

560
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.530
learn'd, play'd, eattogether;

561
00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.930
and wheresoever we went,like Juno's swans,

562
00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:30.200
still we went coupled andinseparable.

563
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.770
She is too subtle forthee;

564
00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.930
and her smoothness, hervery silence,

565
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.700
and her patience speak tothe people;

566
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.900
and they pity her.

567
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.130
Thou art a fool.

568
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.170
She robs thee of thy name,

569
00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:48.470
and thou wilt show morebright and seem morevirtuous

570
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.670
when she is gone.

571
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.370
Open not thy lips!

572
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.130
Firm and irrevocable is mydoom which I have pass'dupon her.

573
00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:55.330
She is banish'd.

574
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.900
Pronounce that sentencethen on me, my liege.

575
00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.730
I cannot live out of hercompany.

576
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.930
You are a fool.

577
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.400
You, niece, provideyourself.

578
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.600
If you outstay the time,

579
00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.130
upon mine honour and inthe greatness of my word,

580
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.830
you die.

581
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.600
O my poor Rosalind...

582
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.570
whither wilt thou go?

583
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.900
Wilt thou change fathers?

584
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.300
I will give thee mine.

585
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.500
Oh, I charge thee,

586
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.300
be thou not more grievedthan I am.

587
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.170
I have more cause.

588
00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.000
Thou hast not, cousin.

589
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.400
Prithee, be cheerful.

590
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.530
Know'st thou not,

591
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.100
the duke hath banish'd me,his daughter?

592
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:55.500
That he hath not.

593
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:58.200
No, hath not?

594
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.870
Rosalind lacks then thelove which teaches thee

595
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.730
that thou and I am one.

596
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.200
Therefore, devise with mehow we may fly,

597
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.830
whither to go and what tobear with us;

598
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:15.700
and do not seek to takeyour charge upon you,

599
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.970
to bear your griefsyourself and leave me out,

600
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.770
for by this heaven,now atour sorrows pale,

601
00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.670
say what thou canst; I'llgo along with thee.

602
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.700
Why, whither shall we go?

603
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:34.130
To seek my uncle in theforest of Arden.

604
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:37.570
Alas, what danger will itbe to us,

605
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.730
maids as we are, to travelforth so far?

606
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.370
Beauty provoketh thievessooner than gold.

607
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:48.430
I'll put myself in poorand mean attire

608
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.800
and with a kind of umbersmirch my face;

609
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:52.070
the like will you.

610
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.830
So shall we pass along andnever stir assailants.

611
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.500
Would it not be better,

612
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.770
because that I am morethan common tall,

613
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:05.530
that I should suit me allpoints like a man?

614
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.900
A gallant curtle-axe uponmy thigh,

615
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.830
a boar spear in my hand;

616
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.400
and in my heart lie there

617
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.830
what hidden woman's fearthere will.

618
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:19.530
We'll have a swashing anda martial outside

619
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.730
as many other mannishcowards have

620
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.170
that do outface it withtheir semblances.

621
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:27.900
What shall I call theewhen thou art a man?

622
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.070
I'll have no worse a namethan Jove's own page,

623
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:34.330
and look you therefore,call me Ganymede,

624
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.100
but what will you becall'd?

625
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:40.300
Something that hath areference to my state.

626
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.770
No longer Celia, butAliena.

627
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.870
Oh, shh.

628
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.970
But, cousin,

629
00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.470
what if we assay'd tosteal the clownish fool

630
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.170
out of your father'scourt?

631
00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:58.630
Would he not be a comfortto our travels?

632
00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:01.730
He'll go o'er the wideworld with me.

633
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.230
Leave me alone to woo him.

634
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:08.570
Let's away and get ourjewels and our wealthtogether,

635
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.700
devise the fittest timeand safest way to hide usfrom pursuit

636
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.700
that will be made after myflight.

637
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.030
Now go we in content

638
00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:21.500
to liberty and not tobanishment.

639
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.200
