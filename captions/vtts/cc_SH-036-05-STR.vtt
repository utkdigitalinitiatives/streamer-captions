00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470


2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.500
Satis quod sufficit.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.400
I praise God for you, sir:your reasons at dinner

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.070
have been sharpand sententious;

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.570
pleasant without scurrility,witty without affection,

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.630
audacious without impudency,learned without opinion,

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.130
and strange with- out heresy.

8
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.000
I did converse this quondam day

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.430
with a companion of the king's,who is intituled, nominated,

10
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.630
or called, DonAdriano de Armado.

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.530
Novi hominem tanquam te:his humour is lofty,

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.100
his discourse peremptory,his tongue filed,

13
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.230
his eye ambitious,his gait majestical,

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.100
and his general behavior vain,ridiculous, and thrasonical.

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.870
He is too picked, too spruce,too affected, too odd,

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.200
as it were, too peregrinate,as I may say.

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.600
A most singular and choiceepithet.

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.970
He draweth out the threadof his verbosity finer

19
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.730
than the stapleof his argument.

20
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.700
I abhor such fanaticalphantasimes, such insociable

21
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.370
and point-devise companions;such rackers of orthography,

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.470
as to speak dout, fine,when he should say doubt;

23
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.600
det, when he shouldpronounce debt,

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.030
--d, e, b, t, not d, e, t:he clepeth a calf, cauf;

25
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.600
(laughing throughout speech)

26
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:47.500
half, hauf; neighbour vocaturnebor; neigh abbreviated ne.

27
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.370
This is abhominable, --whichhe would call abbominable:

28
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.170
it insinuateth me of insanie:

29
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.370
anne intelligis, domine?to make frantic, lunatic.

30
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.730
Laus Deo, bene intelligo.

31
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.070
Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! alittle scratch'd, 'twill serve.

32
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.370
Videsne quis venit?

33
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.570
Video, et gaudeo.

34
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.800
Men of peace, wellencountered.

35
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.270
Most military sir,salutation.

36
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.570
Sir, it is the king'smost sweet pleasure

37
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.800
and affection to congratulatethe princess at her

38
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.170
pavilion in theposteriors of this day,

39
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.330
which the rude multitudecall the afternoon.

40
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.200
The posterior of theday, most generous sir,

41
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.070
is liable, congruent andmeasurable for the afternoon:

42
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.330
the word is well chosen,culled, sweet and apt,

43
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.500
I do assure you,sir, I do assure.

44
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.370
Sir, the king is a noblegentleman, and my familiar,

45
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.600
I do assure ye,very good friend:

46
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.700
for what is inward between us,let it pass.

47
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.330
But I must tell thee, itwill please his grace,

48
00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.730
by the world, sometime tolean upon my poor shoulder,

49
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.400
and with his royal finger,thus, dally with my excrement,

50
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.070
with my mustachio; but,sweet heart, let that pass.

51
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.400
By the world, Irecount no fable:

52
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.100
some certain special honoursit pleaseth his greatness

53
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:26.330
to impart to Armado, asoldier, a man of travel,

54
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.870
that hath seen the world;but let that pass.

55
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.630
The very all of allis,--but, sweet heart,

56
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.730
I do implore secrecy,--thatthe king would have me

57
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.900
present the princess,sweet chuck,

58
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.070
with some delightfulostentation, or show,

59
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.800
or pageant, orantique, or firework.

60
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.670
Now, understanding that thecurate and your sweet self

61
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.730
are good at such eruptions andsudden breaking out of mirth,

62
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.330
as it were, I have acquaintedyou to the end withal,

63
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.900
to craveyour assistance.

64
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.000
They have been at a greatfeast of languages,

65
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.130
and stolen the scraps.

66
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.570
O, they have lived long onthe alms-basket of words.

67
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.730
I marvel thy master hathnot eaten thee for a word;

68
00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.800
Sir, you shall present beforeher the Nine Worthies.

69
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.630
Sir Nathaniel, as concerningsome entertainment of time,

70
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.470
some show in the posteriorof this day, to be rendered

71
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.730
by our assistants, atthe king's command,

72
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.330
and this mostgallant, illustrate,

73
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.330
and learned gentleman,before the princess;

74
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.900
I say none so fit as topresent the Nine Worthies.

75
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.400
Where will you find men worthyenough to present them?

76
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.600
Joshua, yourself;myself, Alexander,

77
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.670
this gallant gentleman,Judas Maccabaeus;

78
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.570
the swain, by reason ofhis great limb or joint,

79
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.400
shall pass Pompey the Great;

80
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.770
the page, Hercules,--

81
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.570
Pardon, sir; error: heis not quantity

82
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.630
for that Worthy's thumb:

83
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.400
he is not so big asthe end of his club.

84
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.130
Shall I have audience? he shallpresent Hercules in minority:

85
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.270
his enter and exit shallbe strangling a snake;

86
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.300
and I will have an prologueto their purpose.

87
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.000
An excellent device! so, ifany of the audience hiss,

88
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.030
you may cry 'Welldone, Hercules!

89
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.200
now thou crushest the snake!'

90
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.530
For the rest of the Worthies?--

91
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.900
I will play three myself.

92
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.200
Thrice-worthy gentleman!

93
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.970
Shall I tell you a thing?

94
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.170
We attend.

95
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:44.870
We will have, if thisfadge not, an antique.

96
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.500
I beseech you, follow.

97
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.230
Via, goodman Dull! thou hastspoken no word all this time.

98
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.830
Nor understood noneneither, sir.

99
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.870
Allons! we will employthee.

100
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.970
I'll make one in a dance,or so; or I will play

101
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.830
On the tabour to the Worthies,and let them dance the hay.

102
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.100
Most dull, honest Dull! Toour sport, away!

103
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:19.200


104
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.230
Sweet hearts, we shall berich ere we depart,

105
00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.270
If fairings come thusplentifully in:

106
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.300
A lady wall'd about withdiamonds!

107
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.870
Look you what I have fromthe loving king.

108
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.330
Madame, came nothing elsealong with that?

109
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.230
Nothing but this! yes, asmuch love in rhyme

110
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.970
As would be cramm'd up ina sheet of paper,

111
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.870
Writ o' both sides theleaf, margent and all,

112
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.600
That he was fain to sealon Cupid's name.

113
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.270
That was the way to makehis godhead wax,

114
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.300
For he hath been fivethousand years a boy.

115
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.100
Ay, and a shrewd unhappygallows too.

116
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.500
You'll ne'er be friends withhim; a' kill'd your sister.

117
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.670
He made her melancholy,sad, and heavy;

118
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.070
And so she died: had shebeen light, like you,

119
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.770
Of such a merry, nimble,stirring spirit,

120
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.200
She might ha' been agrandam ere she died:

121
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.600
And so may you; for alight heart lives long.

122
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.330
What's your dark meaning,mouse, of this light word?

123
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.200
A light condition in abeauty dark.

124
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.130
We need more light to findyour meaning out.

125
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.200
You'll mar the light bytaking it in snuff;

126
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.130
Therefore I'll darkly endthe argument.

127
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.470
See what you do, you doit still i' the dark.

128
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.170
So do not you, for you area light wench.

129
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.700
I weigh not you,and therefore light.

130
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.530
You weigh me not? O, that'syou care not for me.

131
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.330
Great reason; for 'pastcure is still past care.'

132
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.100
Well bandied both; a setof wit well play'd.

133
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.000
But Rosaline, you have afavour too:

134
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.030
Who sent it? and what isit?

135
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.500
I would you knew:

136
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.130
An if my face were but asfair as yours,

137
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.570
My favour were as great;be witness this.

138
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.730
Nay, I have verses too, Ithank Biron:

139
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.570
The numbers true; and,were the numbering too,

140
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.700
I were the fairest goddesson the ground:

141
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.570
I am compared to twentythousand fairs.

142
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.030
O, he hath drawn mypicture in his letter!

143
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.070
Any thing like?

144
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:05.830
Much in the letters;nothing in the praise.

145
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.900
Beauteous as ink; a goodconclusion.

146
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.200
But, Katharine, what was sentto you from fair Dumain?

147
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.870
Madam, this glove.

148
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.400
Did he not send you twain?

149
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.200
Yes, madam, and moreover

150
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.330
Some thousand verses of afaithful lover,

151
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:21.930
A huge translation ofhypocrisy,

152
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.370
Vilely compiled, profoundsimplicity.

153
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.670
This and these pearls tome sent Longaville:

154
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:31.600
The letter is too long byhalf a mile.

155
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.770
I think no less. Dost thounot wish in heart

156
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.930
The chain were longer andthe letter short?

157
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.400
Ay, or I would these handsmight never part.

158
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.870
We are wise girls to mockour lovers so.

159
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.730
They are worse fools topurchase mocking so.

160
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.570
That same Biron I'lltorture ere I go:

161
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.130
O that I knew he were butin by the week!

162
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.570
How I would make him fawnand beg and seek

163
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.630
And wait the season andobserve the times

164
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:05.470
And spend his prodigalwits in bootless rhymes

165
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.030
And shape his servicewholly to my hests

166
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:12.370
And make him proud to makeme proud that jests!

167
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.930
So perttaunt-like would Io'ersway his state

168
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.600
That he should be my fooland I his fate.

169
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.500
None are so surely caught,when they are catch'd,

170
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.270
As wit turn'd fool: folly,in wisdom hatch'd,

171
00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.100
Hath wisdom's warrant andthe help of school

172
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.470
And wit's own grace tograce a learned fool.

173
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.470
The blood of youth burnsnot with such excess

174
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.670
As gravity's revolt towantonness.

175
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.300
O, I am stabb'd withlaughter! Where's her grace?

176
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.800
Thy news Boyet?

177
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.130
Prepare, madam, prepare!

178
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.100
Arm, wenches, arm!encounters mounted are

179
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.230
Against your peace: Lovedoth approach disguised,

180
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.070
Armed in arguments; you'llbe surprised:

181
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.630
Muster your wits; stand inyour own defence;

182
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.970
Or hide your heads likecowards, and fly hence.

183
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:56.630
Saint Denis to SaintCupid! What are they

184
00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:01.470
That charge their breathagainst us? say, scout, say.

185
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.800
Under the cool shade of asycamore

186
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.700
I thought to close mineeyes some half an hour;

187
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.370
When, lo! to interrupt mypurposed rest,

188
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.130
Toward that shade I mightbehold addrest

189
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.700
The king and his companions:

190
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.800
warily I stole into aneighbour thicket by,

191
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.870
And overheard what youshall overhear,

192
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.870
That, by and by, disguisedthey will be here.

193
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.470
But what, but what, comethey to visit us?

194
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.530
They do, they do: and areapparell'd thus.

195
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.870
Like Muscovites orRussians, as I guess.

196
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.100
Their purpose is to parle,to court and dance;

197
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.770
And every one hislove-feat will advance

198
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.100
Unto his several mistress,which they'll know

199
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.030
By favours several whichthey did bestow.

200
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:45.130
And will they so? thegallants shall be task'd;

201
00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.630
For, ladies, we shallevery one be mask'd;

202
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.370
And not a man of themshall have the grace,

203
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.570
Despite of suit, to see alady's face.

204
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.570
Hold, Rosaline, thisfavour thou shalt wear,

205
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.770
And then the king willcourt thee for his dear;

206
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.970
Hold, take thou this, mysweet, and give me thine,

207
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.870
So shall Biron take me forRosaline.

208
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.770
And change your favourstoo; so shall your loves

209
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.370
Woo contrary, deceived bythese removes.

210
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.770
Come on, then; wear thefavours most in sight.

211
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.930
But in this changing whatis your intent?

212
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.870
The effect of my intent isto cross theirs:

213
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.270
They do it but in mockingmerriment;

214
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.530
And mock for mock is onlymy intent.

215
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.670
Their several counselsthey unbosom shall

216
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.200
To loves mistook, and sobe mock'd withal

217
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.930
Upon the next occasionthat we meet,

218
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.800
With visages displayed, totalk and greet.

219
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.770
But shall we dance, ifthey desire to't?

220
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.330
No, to the death, we willnot move a foot;

221
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.830
Nor to their penn'd speechrender we no grace,

222
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:48.000
But while 'tis spoke eachturn away her face.

223
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.470
Why, that contempt willkill the speaker's heart,

224
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.530
And quite divorce hismemory from his part.

225
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.900
Therefore I do it; and Imake no doubt

226
00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.200
The rest will ne'er comein, if he be out

227
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.500
There's no such sport assport by sport o'erthrown,

228
00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.470
To make theirs ours andours none but our own:

229
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.900
So shall we stay, mockingintended game,

230
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.600
And they, well mock'd,depart away with shame.

231
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.970
(♪ trumpet)

232
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.570
The trumpet sounds: bemask'd; the maskers come.

233
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.530
All hail, the richestbeauties on the earth!--

234
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.770
A holy parcel of thefairest dames.

235
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:36.370
That ever turn'dtheir--backs--to mortal views!

236
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.230
Their eyes, villain, theireyes!

237
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.330
That ever turn'd their eyeson mortal views! --Out--

238
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:45.370
True; out indeed.

239
00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:49.000
Boyet: What would thesestrangers? know their minds,

240
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.330
If they do speak ourlanguage, 'tis our will:

241
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.730
That some plain manrecount their purposes

242
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.800
Know what they would.

243
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.400
What would you with theprincess?

244
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.570
Nothing but peace andgentle visitation.

245
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.400
What would they, say they?

246
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:04.870
Nothing but peace andgentle visitation.

247
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.400
Why, that they have; andbid them so be gone.

248
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.170
She says, you have it, andyou may be gone.

249
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.700
Say to her, we havemeasured many miles

250
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.270
To tread a measure withher on this grass.

251
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.200
They say, that they havemeasured many a mile

252
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.930
To tread a measure withyou on this grass.

253
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.070
It is not so. Ask them howmany inches

254
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.930
Is in one mile: if theyhave measured many,

255
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.200
The measure then of one iseasily told.

256
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.000
If to come hither you havemeasured miles,

257
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.830
And many miles, theprincess bids you tell

258
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.630
How many inches doth fillup one mile.

259
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.530
Tell her, we measure themby weary steps.

260
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.270
She hears herself.

261
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.870
How many weary steps,

262
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.300
Of many weary miles youhave o'ergone,

263
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.700
Are number'd in the travelof one mile?

264
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.370
We number nothing that wespend for you:

265
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.000
Our duty is so rich, soinfinite,

266
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.130
That we may do it stillwithout accompt.

267
00:13:57.130 --> 00:14:00.330
Vouchsafe to show thesunshine of your face,

268
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.130
That we, like savages, mayworship it.

269
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:07.000
My face is but a moon, andclouded too.

270
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.030
Blessed are clouds, to doas such clouds do!

271
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:17.230
Vouchsafe, bright moon, andthese thy stars, to shine,

272
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.830
Those clouds removed, uponour watery eyne.

273
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.530
O vain petitioner! beg agreater matter;

274
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:27.470
Thou now request'st butmoonshine in the water.

275
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.730
Then, in our measure dobut vouchsafe one change.

276
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.730
Thou bid'st me beg: thisbegging is not strange.

277
00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.830
Play, music, then! Nay,you must do it soon.

278
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:44.930
Not yet! no dance! Thuschange I like the moon.

279
00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:48.470
Will you not dance? Howcome you thus estranged?

280
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.700
You took the moon at full,but now she's changed.

281
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:58.970
Yet still she is the moon,and I the man.

282
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.930
The music plays; vouchsafesome motion to it.

283
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.930
Our ears vouchsafe it.

284
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.130
But your legs should doit.

285
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.970
Since you are strangersand come here by chance,

286
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.670
We'll not be nice:

287
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.000
Take hands.

288
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.970
We will not dance.

289
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:37.030
If you deny to dance,let's hold more chat.

290
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.330
In private, then.

291
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:47.500
I am best pleased withthat.

292
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.000
White-handed mistress, onesweet word with thee.

293
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.270
Honey, and milk, andsugar; there is three.

294
00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.600
Nay then, two treys, andif you grow so nice,

295
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.300
Metheglin, wort, andmalmsey: well run, dice!

296
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.170
There's half-a-dozensweets.

297
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.330
Seventh sweet, adieu:

298
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.970
Since you can cog, I'llplay no more with you.

299
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.130
One word in secret.

300
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.630
Let it not be sweet.

301
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.700
Thou grievest my gall.

302
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.100
Gall! bitter.

303
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.470
Therefore meet.

304
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:17.230
Will you vouchsafe with meto change a word?

305
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.470
Name it.

306
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.670
Fair lady,--

307
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.400
Say you so? Fair lord,--

308
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.700
Take that for your fairlady.

309
00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.170
Please it you,

310
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:32.370
As much in private, andI'll bid adieu.

311
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.730
What, was your vizard madewithout a tongue?

312
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.970
I know the reason, lady,why you ask.

313
00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.530
O for your reason!quickly, sir; I long.

314
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:42.000
You have a double tonguewithin your mask,

315
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.870
And would afford myspeechless vizard half.

316
00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.600
Veal, quoth the Dutchman.Is not 'veal' a calf?

317
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.600
A calf, fair lady!

318
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.900
No, a fair lord calf.

319
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:52.930
Let's part the word.

320
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.400
No, I'll not be your half

321
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.030
Take all, and wean it; itmay prove an ox.

322
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.500
Look, how you butt yourselfin these sharp mocks!

323
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.870
Will you give horns,chaste lady? do not so.

324
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.700
Then die a calf, beforeyour horns do grow.

325
00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:08.830
One word in private withyou, ere I die.

326
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.300
Bleat softly then; thebutcher hears you cry.

327
00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.970
The tongues of mockingwenches are as keen

328
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.000
As is the razor's edgeinvisible,

329
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.100
Cutting a smaller hairthan may be seen,

330
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.870
Above the sense of sense;so sensible

331
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:29.030
Seemeth their conference;their conceits have wings

332
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:33.330
Fleeter than arrows, bullets,wind, thought, swifter things.

333
00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.600
Not one word more, my maids;break off, break off.

334
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.200
By heaven, all dry-beatenwith pure scoff!

335
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.970
Farewell, mad wenches; youhave simple wits.

336
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.270
Twenty adieus, my frozenMuscovits.

337
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.170
Are these the breed ofwits so wonder'd at?

338
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.730
Tapers they are, with yoursweet breaths puff'd out.

339
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.500
Well-liking wits they have;gross, gross; fat, fat.

340
00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:09.100
O poverty in wit,kingly-poor flout!

341
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.530
Will they not, think you,hang themselves tonight?

342
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.000
Or ever, but in vizards,show their faces?

343
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.170
This pert Biron was out ofcountenance quite.

344
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.670
O, they were all inlamentable cases!

345
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.130
The king was weeping-ripefor a good word.

346
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.130
Biron did swear himselfout of all suit.

347
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.730
Dumain was at my service,and his sword:

348
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:34.030
No point, quoth I; myservant straight was mute.

349
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.830
Lord Longaville said, Icame o'er his heart;

350
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:37.200
And trow you what hecalled me?

351
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.630
Qualm, perhaps.

352
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:39.500
Yes, in good faith.

353
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.770
Go, sickness as thou art!

354
00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.500
Well, better wits haveworn plain statute-caps.

355
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.900
But will you hear? theking is my love sworn.

356
00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.600
And quick Biron hathplighted troth to me.

357
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.730
And Longaville was for myservice born.

358
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.100
Dumain is mine, as sure asbark on tree.

359
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.100
Madam, and prettymistresses, give ear:

360
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.000
Immediately they willagain be here

361
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.430
In their own shapes; forit can never be

362
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.830
They will digest thisharsh indignity.

363
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.630
Will they return?

364
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.530
They will, they will, Godknows,

365
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.530
And leap for joy, thoughthey are lame with blows:

366
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.530
Therefore change favours;and, when they repair,

367
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.300
Blow like sweet roses inthis summer air.

368
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:20.470
What shall we do,

369
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.800
If they return in theirown shapes to woo?

370
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.470
Good madam, if by meyou'll be advised,

371
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.500
Let's, mock them still, aswell known as disguised:

372
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.170
Let us complain to themwhat fools were here,

373
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.430
Disguised like Muscovites,in shapeless gear;

374
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.970
And wonder what they wereand to what end

375
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.870
Their shallow shows andprologue vilely penn'd

376
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.000
Fair sir, God save you!Where's the princess?

377
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.970
Gone to her tent. Pleaseit your majesty

378
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.770
Command me any service toher thither?

379
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.370
That she vouchsafe meaudience for one word.

380
00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:56.130
I will; and so will she, Iknow, my lord.

381
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.170
This fellow pecks up witas pigeons pease,

382
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.030
And utters it again whenGod doth please:

383
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:02.330
He is wit's pedler, andretails his wares

384
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.100
At wakes and wassails,meetings, markets, fairs;

385
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:07.300
And we that sell by gross,the Lord doth know,

386
00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.900
Have not the grace tograce it with such show.

387
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.900
This is the ape of form,monsieur the nice,

388
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.930
That, when he plays attables, chides the dice

389
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.600
In honourable terms: O, he can sing

390
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.970
A mean most meanly; and inushering

391
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:22.270
Mend him who can: theladies call him sweet;

392
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.900
The stairs, as he treadson them, kiss his feet:

393
00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.370
This is the flower thatsmiles on every one,

394
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:29.100
To show his teeth as whiteas whale's bone;

395
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.030
And consciences, that willnot die in debt,

396
00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.900
Pay him the due ofhoney-tongued Boyet.

397
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.230
A blister on his sweettongue, with my heart,

398
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.730
That put Armado's page outof his part!

399
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:39.900
See where it comes!Behavior, what wert thou

400
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.130
Till this madman show'dthee? and what art thou now?

401
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.770
All hail, sweet madam, andfair time of day!

402
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.270
'Fair' in 'all hail' isfoul, as I conceive.

403
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.130
Construe my speechesbetter, if you may.

404
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.070
Then wish me better; Iwill give you leave.

405
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.430
We came to visit you, andpurpose now

406
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.830
To lead you to our court;vouchsafe it then.

407
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.430
This field shall hold me;and so hold your vow:

408
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.200
Nor God, nor I, delightsin perjured men.

409
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.530
Rebuke me not for thatwhich you provoke:

410
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.470
The virtue of your eyemust break my oath.

411
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:12.500
You nickname virtue; viceyou should have spoke;

412
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.170
For virtue's office neverbreaks men's troth.

413
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.530
Now by my maiden honour,yet as pure

414
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.470
As the unsullied lily, Iprotest,

415
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:21.800
A world of torments thoughI should endure,

416
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.900
I would not yield to beyour house's guest;

417
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.700
So much I hate a breakingcause to be

418
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.130
Of heavenly oaths, vow'dwith integrity.

419
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.570
O, you have lived indesolation here,

420
00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.330
Unseen, unvisited, much toour shame.

421
00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.700
Not so, my lord; it is notso, I swear;

422
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:42.370
We have had pastimes hereand pleasant game:

423
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.370
A mess of Russians left usbut of late.

424
00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.800
How, madam! Russians!

425
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.900
Ay, in truth, my lord;

426
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.030
Trim gallants, full ofcourtship and of state.

427
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.000
Madam, speak true. It isnot so, my lord:

428
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.670
My lady, to the manner ofthe days,

429
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.300
In courtesy givesundeserving praise.

430
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.370
We four indeed confrontedwere with four

431
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:05.300
In Russian habit: herethey stay'd an hour,

432
00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.730
And talk'd apace; and inthat hour, my lord,

433
00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.300
They did not bless us withone happy word.

434
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.170
I dare not call themfools; but this I think,

435
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.430
When fools are thirsty,they would fain have drink.

436
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.330
This jest is dry to me.Fair gentle sweet,

437
00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.730
Your wit makes wise thingsfoolish: when we greet,

438
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.870
With eyes best seeing,heaven's fiery eye,

439
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.170
By light we lose light:your capacity

440
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.430
Is of that nature that toyour huge store

441
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.570
Wise things seem foolishand rich things but poor.

442
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.770
This proves you wise andrich, for in my eye,--

443
00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.300
I am a fool, and full ofpoverty.

444
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.800
But that you take whatdoth to you belong,

445
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.800
It were a fault to snatchwords from my tongue.

446
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.230
O, I am yours, and allthat I possess!

447
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.300
All the fool mine?

448
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.800
I cannot give you less.

449
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.270
Which of the vizards wasit that you wore?

450
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.130
Where? when? what vizard?why demand you this?

451
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.930
There, then, that vizard;that superfluous case

452
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.630
That hid the worse andshow'd the better face.

453
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:02.970
We are descried; they'llmock us now downright.

454
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.830
Let us confess and turn itto a jest.

455
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:09.000
Amazed, my lord? why looksyour highness sad?

456
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.370
Help, hold his brows! he'llswoon! Why look you pale?

457
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.600
Sea-sick, I think, comingfrom Muscovy.

458
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.900
Thus pour the stars downplagues for perjury.

459
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.300
Can any face of brass holdlonger out?

460
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.570
Here stand I, Lady, dart thyskill at me;

461
00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:24.870
Bruise me with scorn,confound me with a flout;

462
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.200
Thrust thy sharp wit quitethrough my ignorance;

463
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.130
Cut me to pieces with thykeen conceit;

464
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.930
And I will wish thee nevermore to dance,

465
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.930
Nor never more in Russianhabit wait.

466
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.800
O, never will I trust tospeeches penn'd,

467
00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.470
Nor to the motion of aschoolboy's tongue,

468
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:42.800
Nor never come in vizardto my friend,

469
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.570
Nor woo in rhyme, like ablind harper's song!

470
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.370
Taffeta phrases, silkenterms precise,

471
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.330
Three-piled hyperboles,spruce affectation,

472
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.000
Figures pedantical; thesesummer-flies

473
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.400
Have blown me full ofmaggot ostentation:

474
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.500
I do forswear them; and Ihere protest,

475
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.800
By this white glove;--howwhite the hand, God knows!--

476
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.200
Henceforth my wooing mindshall be express'd

477
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.330
In russet yeas and honestkersey noes:

478
00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:20.730
And, to begin, wench,--soGod help me, la!--

479
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:26.370
My love to thee is sound,sans crack or flaw.

480
00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.630
Sans sans, I pray you.

481
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:29.570
Yet I have a trick

482
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.130
Of the old rage: bear withme, I am sick;

483
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.900
I'll leave it by degrees.

484
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:37.670
These lords are visited;you are not free,

485
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.930
For the Lord's tokens onyou do I see.

486
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.700
No, they are free thatgave these tokens to us.

487
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.700
Our states are forfeit:seek not to undo us.

488
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.600
It is not so; for how canthis be true,

489
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.130
That you stand forfeit,being those that sue?

490
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.400
Peace! for I will not haveto do with you.

491
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.970
Nor shall not, if I do asI intend.

492
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.130
Speak for yourselves; mywit is at an end.

493
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.570
Teach us, sweet madam, forour rude transgression

494
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:05.000
Some fair excuse.

495
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.870
The fairest is confession.

496
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:13.970
Were not you here but evennow disguised?

497
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.230
Madam, I was.

498
00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.170
And were you well advised?

499
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.530
I was, fair madam.

500
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.270
When you then were here,

501
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.830
What did you whisper inyour lady's ear?

502
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.470
That more than all theworld I did respect her.

503
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.970
When she shall challengethis, you will reject her.

504
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.200
Upon mine honour, no.

505
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.030
Peace, peace! forbear:

506
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.300
Your oath once broke, youforce not to forswear.

507
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.230
Despise me, when I breakthis oath of mine.

508
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:47.970
I will: and therefore keepit. Rosaline,

509
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.000
What did the Russianwhisper in your ear?

510
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.500
Madam, he swore that hedid hold me dear

511
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.430
As precious eyesight, anddid value me

512
00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:01.030
Above this world; addingthereto moreover

513
00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:04.870
That he would wed me, orelse die my lover.

514
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.030
God give thee joy of him!the noble lord

515
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.230
Most honourably dothunhold his word.

516
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.700
What mean you, madam? bymy life, my troth,

517
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.870
I never swore this ladysuch an oath.

518
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:18.630
By heaven, you did; and toconfirm it plain,

519
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.900
You gave me this: but takeit, sir, again.

520
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:25.270
My faith and this theprincess I did give:

521
00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:29.070
I knew her by this jewelon her sleeve.

522
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.400
Pardon me, sir, this jeweldid she wear;

523
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:38.230
And Lord Biron, I thankhim, is my dear.

524
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.770
What, will you have me, oryour pearl again?

525
00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:47.670
Neither of either; I remitboth twain.

526
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:50.770
I see the trick on't: herewas a consent,

527
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.000
Knowing aforehand of ourmerriment,

528
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.930
The ladies did changefavours: and then we,

529
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:57.970
Following the signs, woo'dbut the sign of she.

530
00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:59.930
Now, to our perjury to addmore terror,

531
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.270
We are again forsworn, inwill and error.

532
00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.330
Much upon this it is: andmight not you

533
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.600
Forestall our sport, tomake us thus untrue?

534
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600
Full merrily

535
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.970
Hath this brave manage,this career, been run.

536
00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.600
Lo, he is tilting straight!Peace! I have done.

537
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.100
(♪ Loud drum)

538
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.930
Welcome, pure wit! thoupartest a fair fray.

539
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.730
O Lord, sir, they wouldknow

540
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.370
Whether the three Worthiesshall come in or no.

541
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.070
Go, bid them prepare.

542
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:29.830
We will turn it finely off,sir; we will take some care.

543
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.830
Biron, they will shame us:let them not approach.

544
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.930
We are shame-proof, mylord: and tis some policy

545
00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.170
To have one show worse thanthe king's and his company.

546
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.230
I say they shall not come in.

547
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.200
Nay, my good lord, let meo'errule you now:

548
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.870
That sport best pleasesthat doth least know how:

549
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:48.770
Where zeal strives tocontent, and the contents

550
00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.170
Dies in the zeal of thatwhich it presents:

551
00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.930
Their form confoundedmakes most form in mirth,

552
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.970
When great things labouringperish in their birth.

553
00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.000
A right description of oursport, my lord.

554
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.200
Anointed, I implore somuch of your

555
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.600
royal sweet breath as will uttera brace of words.

556
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.300
Doth this man serve God?

557
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:11.400
Why ask you?

558
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.770
He speaks not like a manof God's making.

559
00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.300
That is all one, my fair,sweet, honey monarch; for,

560
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.600
I protest, the schoolmasteris exceeding fantastical;

561
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.170
too, too vain, too toovain: but we will put it,

562
00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.970
as they say, tofortuna de la guerra.

563
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:29.200
I wish you the peace ofmind, most royal couplement!

564
00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:37.570
Here is like to be a goodpresence of Worthies.

565
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:42.430
He presents Hector of Troy;the swain, Pompey the Great;

566
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:46.170
the parish curate,Alexander; Armado's page,

567
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:51.130
Hercules; the pedant,Judas Maccabaeus:

568
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.000
I Pompey am,--

569
00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.570
You lie, you are not he.

570
00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.000
I Pompey am,--

571
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.830
With libbard's head onknee.

572
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.600
Well said, old mocker: I mustneeds be friends with thee.

573
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.370
I Pompey am, Pompeysurnamed the Big--

574
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.970
The Great.

575
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.600
It is, 'Great,' sir:--

576
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.030
Pompey surnamed the Great;

577
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.800
That oft in field, withtarge and shield,

578
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.100
did make my foe to sweat: Andtravelling along this coast,

579
00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.900
I here am come bychance, And lay my arms

580
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:33.230
before the legs of thissweet lass of France,

581
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.400
If your ladyship would say,'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

582
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.500
Great thanks, greatPompey.

583
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.530
'Tis not so much worth;but I hope I was perfect:

584
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.130
I made a littlefault in 'Great.'

585
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.230
My hat to a halfpenny, Pompeyproves the best Worthy.

586
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:06.600
When in the world I lived, Iwas the world's commander;

587
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.270
Louder.

588
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.070
Shhh.

589
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:19.300
By east, west, north, and south,I spread my conquering might:

590
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:24.630
My scutcheon plain declaresthat I am Alisander,--

591
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:27.100
Your nose says, no, you arenot for it stands too right.

592
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.970
Your nose smells 'no' in this,most tender-smelling knight.

593
00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:35.900
The conqueror is dismay'd.Proceed, good Alexander.

594
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.730
When in the world I lived, Iwas the world's commander,--

595
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.730
Most true, 'tis right; youwere so, Alisander.

596
00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.270
Pompey the Great,--

597
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.870
Your servant, and Costard.

598
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.430
Take away the conqueror,take away Alisander.

599
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.070
O, sir, you haveoverthrown

600
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.970
Alisander the conqueror!

601
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.230
A conqueror, andafeard to speak!

602
00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:01.170
Run away for shame,Alisander.

603
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.600
There, an't shall pleaseyou; a foolish mild man;

604
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.430
an honest man, lookyou, and soon dashed.

605
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.830
He is a marvellous goodneighbour, faith,

606
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.570
and a very good bowler:but, for Alisander,

607
00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:17.500
--alas, you see how 'tis,--alittle o'erparted.

608
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:19.100
But there are Worthies a-coming

609
00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.830
will speak their mindin some other sort.

610
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.200
Stand aside good Pompey.

611
00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.970
Great Hercules ispresented by this imp,

612
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:39.370
Whose club kill'd Cerberus,that three-headed canis;

613
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:43.200
And when he was a babe, achild, a shrimp,

614
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.570
Thus did he strangleserpents in his manus.

615
00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.800
Quoniam he seemeth inminority,

616
00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:56.200
Ergo I come with thisapology.

617
00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:07.270
Keep some state in thyexit, and vanish.

618
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.870
(laughing)

619
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.830
I, Judas am,--

620
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:18.900
A Judas!

621
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.500
(hissing)

622
00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.070
Not Iscariot, sir.

623
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.230
Judas, yclipedMaccabaeus.

624
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.530
Judas Maccabaeus clipt isplain Judas.

625
00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.600
I, Judas am,--

626
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.700
The more shame for you,Judas.

627
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.800
What mean you, sir?

628
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.300
To make Judas hanghimself.

629
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.830
Begin, sir; you are myelder.

630
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.130
Well followed: Judas washanged on an elder.

631
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.870
I will not be put out ofcountenance.

632
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:43.570
Because thou hast no face.

633
00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.470
What is this?

634
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.470
A cittern-head.

635
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:48.770
The head of a bodkin.

636
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.600
A Death's face in a ring.

637
00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.700
The face of an old Romancoin, scarce seen.

638
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.700
And now forward; for we haveput thee in countenance.

639
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:58.100
You have put me out ofcountenance.

640
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.070
False; we have given theefaces.

641
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.230
But you have out-facedthem all.

642
00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:02.570
An thou wert a lion, wewould do so.

643
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:04.130
Therefore, as he is anass, let him go.

644
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:09.500
And so adieu, sweet Jude!nay, why dost thou stay?

645
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.100
For the latter end of hisname.

646
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.430
For the ass to the Jude;give it him:--Jud-as, away!

647
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:22.230
This is not generous, notgentle, not humble.

648
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:27.030
A light for Monsieur Judas! itgrows dark, he may stumble.

649
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:31.470
Alas, poor Maccabaeus, howhath he been baited!

650
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:34.370
Hide thy head, Achilles:here comes Hector in arms.

651
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.070
But is this Hector?

652
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.970
I think Hector was not soclean-timbered.

653
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.270
His leg is too big forHector's.

654
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.970
More calf, certain.

655
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.270
No; he is best endued inthe small.

656
00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.930
This cannot be Hector.

657
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.730
He's a god or a painter;for he makes faces.

658
00:33:51.730 --> 00:34:02.370
The armipotent Mars, oflances the almighty,

659
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.570
Gave Hector a gift,--

660
00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:08.000
A gilt nutmeg.

661
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.770
A lemon.

662
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:09.900
Stuck with cloves.

663
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.130
No, cloven.

664
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.770
Peace!--

665
00:34:15.930 --> 00:34:21.630
The armipotent Mars, oflances the almighty

666
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:27.870
Gave Hector a gift, theheir of Ilion;

667
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:32.300
A man so breathed, thatcertain he would fight; yea

668
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:37.330
From morn till night, from outof his pavilion.

669
00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.770
I am that flower,--

670
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:40.900
That mint.

671
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.430
That columbine.

672
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:44.430
Sweet Lord Longaville,rein thy tongue.

673
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:46.930
I must rather give it the rein,for it runs against Hector.

674
00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:48.800
Ay, and Hector's agreyhound.

675
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.130
The sweet war-man is deadand rotten; sweet chucks,

676
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.630
beat not the bones of theburied: when he breathed,

677
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:01.800
he was a man. But I willforward with my device.

678
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.070
Sweet royalty, bestow onme the benifit of hearing.

679
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.470
Speak, brave Hector: weare much delighted.

680
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:12.030
This Hector far surmountedHannibal,--

681
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.800
The party is gone, fellowHector, she is gone;

682
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.070
she is two months on her way.

683
00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:19.000
What meanest thou?

684
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.370
Faith, unless you playthe honest Troyan,

685
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.230
the poor wench is castaway: she's quick;

686
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:25.130
the child brags in herbelly already: tis yours.

687
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.700
Dost thou infamonizeme among potentates?

688
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.800
thou shalt die.

689
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.670
Then shall Hector be whippedfor Jaquenetta that is

690
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.330
quick by him and hanged forPompey that is dead by him.

691
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.500
Most rare Pompey!

692
00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.630
Renowned Pompey!

693
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.400
Greater than great, great,great, great Pompey!

694
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.100
Pompey the Huge!

695
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.300
Hector trembles.

696
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.370
By the north pole, I dochallenge thee.

697
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.400
I will not fight with apole, like a northern man:

698
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:50.670
I'll slash; I'll do it bythe sword. I bepray you,

699
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.630
let me borrow my armsagain.

700
00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.170
Room for the incensedWorthies!

701
00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.030
I'll do it in my shirt.

702
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.130
Most resolute Pompey!

703
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.900
Master, let me take youa buttonhole lower.

704
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.500
Do you not see Pompey isuncasing for the combat?

705
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.400
What mean you? You willlose your reputation.

706
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:13.030
Gentlemen andsoldiers, pardon me;

707
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.900
I will not combat in my shirt.

708
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.030
What reason have youfor't?

709
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:24.900
The naked truth of itis, I have no shirt;

710
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.330
I go woolward for penance.

711
00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.230
(laughing)

712
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.170
God save you, madam!

713
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.870
Welcome, Mercade;

714
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.970
But that thou interrupt'stour merriment.

715
00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.370
I am sorry, madam; for thenews I bring

716
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:57.130
Is heavy in my tongue. Theking your father--

717
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:58.500
Dead, for my life!

718
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.600
Even so; my tale is told.

719
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.200
Worthies, away! the scenebegins to cloud.

720
00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:39.830
For mine own part, Ibreathe free breath.

721
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.000
I have seen the day of wrong

722
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.400
through the littlehole of discretion,

723
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.870
and I will right myselflike a soldier.

724
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:52.900
How fares your majesty?

725
00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.330
Boyet, prepare; I willaway tonight.

726
00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.900
Madam, not so; I dobeseech you, stay.

727
00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:05.500
Prepare, I say. I thankyou, gracious lords,

728
00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.270
For all your fairendeavors; and entreat,

729
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.570
Out of a new-sad soul,that you vouchsafe

730
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.700
In your rich wisdom toexcuse or hide

731
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.070
The liberal opposition ofour spirits,

732
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.230
If over-boldly we haveborne ourselves

733
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.130
In the converse of breath:

734
00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:29.870
Your gentleness was guilty ofit. Farewell worthy lord!

735
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:35.330
A heavy heart bears not animble tongue:

736
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.770
Excuse me so, coming tooshort of thanks

737
00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:41.230
For my great suit soeasily obtain'd.

738
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.830
The extreme parts of timeextremely forms

739
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.700
All causes to the purposeof his speed,

740
00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.970
And often at his veryloose decides

741
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:51.470
That which long processcould not arbitrate:

742
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:54.070
And though the mourningbrow of progeny

743
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.730
Forbid the smilingcourtesy of love

744
00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:58.830
The holy suit which fainit would convince,

745
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:03.800
Yet, since love's argumentwas first on foot,

746
00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.930
Let not the cloud ofsorrow justle it

747
00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.400
From what it purposed;since, to wail friends lost

748
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.100
Is not by much sowholesome-profitable

749
00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.230
As to rejoice at friendsbut newly found.

750
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.800
I understand you not: mygriefs are double.

751
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.830
Honest plain words bestpierce the ear of grief;

752
00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.630
For your fair sakes havewe neglected time,

753
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:31.330
Play'd foul play with ouroaths: your beauty, ladies,

754
00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.970
Hath much deform'd us,fashioning our humours

755
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.570
Even to the opposed end ofour intents:

756
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:40.470
And what in us hath seem'dridiculous,--

757
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.300
As love is full ofunbefitting strains,

758
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.530
All wanton as a child,skipping and vain,

759
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:48.830
Form'd by the eye andtherefore, like the eye,

760
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:52.300
Full of strange shapes, ofhabits and of forms,

761
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.030
Varying in subjects as theeye doth roll

762
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:59.770
To every varied object inhis glance:

763
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.900
Which parti-coatedpresence of loose love

764
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.570
Put on by us, if, in yourheavenly eyes,

765
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.730
Have misbecomed our oathsand gravities,

766
00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:10.870
Those heavenly eyes, thatlook into these faults,

767
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.400
Suggested us to make.Therefore, ladies,

768
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.770
Our love being yours, theerror that love makes

769
00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:21.930
Is likewise yours: we toourselves prove false,

770
00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.970
By being once false forever to be true

771
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.570
To those that make usboth,--fair ladies, you:

772
00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:33.770
We have received yourletters full of love;

773
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:36.870
Your favours, theambassadors of love;

774
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:37.970
And, in our maiden council,

775
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.400
rated them at courtship,pleasant jest and courtesy,

776
00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.100
As bombast and as liningto the time:

777
00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.130
But more devout than thisin our respects

778
00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.370
Have we not been; andtherefore met your loves

779
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:56.570
In their own fashion, likea merriment.

780
00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.700
Our letters, madam, show'dmuch more than jest.

781
00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.170
So did our looks.

782
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:03.470
We did not quote them so.

783
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.070
Now, at the latest minuteof the hour,

784
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:09.430
Grant us your loves.

785
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:10.970
A time, methinks, tooshort

786
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.800
To make a world-without-endbargain in.

787
00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.430
No, no, my lord, yourgrace is perjured much,

788
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Full of dear guiltiness;and therefore this:

789
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.900
If for my love, as thereis no such cause,

790
00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:32.670
You will do aught, thisshall you do for me:

791
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:36.130
Your oath I will nottrust; but go with speed

792
00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.470
To some forlorn and nakedhermitage,

793
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.370
Remote from all thepleasures of the world;

794
00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:45.670
There stay until thetwelve celestial signs

795
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.730
Have brought about theannual reckoning.

796
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.470
If this austere insociablelife

797
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.070
Change not your offer madein heat of blood;

798
00:41:56.070 --> 00:42:00.470
If frosts and fasts, hardlodging and thin weeds

799
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:04.330
Nip not the gaudy blossomsof your love,

800
00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:08.100
But that it bear thistrial and last love;

801
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:11.570
Then, at the expiration ofthe year,

802
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:17.600
Come challenge me, challengeme by these deserts,

803
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.170
And, by this virgin palmnow kissing thine

804
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:27.000
I will be thine; and tillthat instant shut

805
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.900
My woeful self up in amournful house,

806
00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:33.270
Raining the tears oflamentation

807
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.830
For the remembrance of myfather's death.

808
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:43.670
If this thou do deny, letour hands part,

809
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:46.670
Neither entitled in theother's heart.

810
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.730
If this, or more thanthis, I would deny,

811
00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.230
To flatter up these powersof mine with rest,

812
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:56.570
The sudden hand of deathclose up mine eye!

813
00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:05.730
Hence ever then my heartis in thy breast.

814
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.270
But what to me, my love?but what to me? A wife?

815
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:14.100
A beard, fair health, andhonesty;

816
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.830
With three-fold love Iwish you all these three.

817
00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:21.270
O, shall I say, I thankyou, gentle wife?

818
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:24.030
Not so, my lord; atwelvemonth and a day

819
00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:27.600
I'll mark no words thatsmooth-faced wooers say:

820
00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.970
Come when the king doth tomy lady come;

821
00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:35.600
Then, if I have much love,I'll give you some.

822
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.430
I'll serve thee true andfaithfully till then.

823
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:43.300
Yet swear not, lest ye beforsworn again.

824
00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:47.100
What says Maria?

825
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.800
At the twelvemonth's end

826
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.330
I'll change my black gownfor a faithful friend.

827
00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:57.870
Studies my lady? mistress,look on me;

828
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.130
Behold the window of myheart, mine eye,

829
00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:04.230
What humble suit attendsthy answer there:

830
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.430
Impose some service on mefor thy love.

831
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:09.830
Oft have I heard of you,my Lord Biron,

832
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.070
Before I saw you; and theworld's large tongue

833
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.370
Proclaims you for a manreplete with mocks,

834
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.300
Full of comparisons andwounding flouts,

835
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.470
Which you on all estateswill execute

836
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:24.300
That come within the mercyof your wit.

837
00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:29.000
To weed this wormwood fromyour fruitful brain,

838
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.570
And therewithal to win me,if you please,

839
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.870
Without the which I am notto be won,

840
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:36.670
You shall this twelvemonthterm from day to day

841
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.300
Visit the speechless sickand still converse

842
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:43.600
With groaning wretches;and your task shall be,

843
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.130
With all the fierceendeavor of your wit

844
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.070
To enforce the painedimpotent to smile.

845
00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:52.670
To move wild laughter inthe throat of death?

846
00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.830
It cannot be; it isimpossible:

847
00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:56.570
Mirth cannot move a soulin agony.

848
00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:59.030
Why, that's the way tochoke a gibing spirit,

849
00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.970
Whose influence is begotof that loose grace

850
00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:04.200
Which shallow laughinghearers give to fools:

851
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.900
A jest's prosperity liesin the ear

852
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.200
Of him that hears it,never in the tongue

853
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.600
Of him that makes it:then, if sickly ears,

854
00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.830
Deaf'd with the clamoursof their own dear groans,

855
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.230
Will hear your idlescorns, continue then,

856
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.070
And I will have you andthat fault withal;

857
00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.100
But if they will not,throw away that spirit,

858
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.470
And I shall find you emptyof that fault,

859
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:25.830
Right joyful of yourreformation.

860
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:32.070
A twelvemonth! well;befall what will befall,

861
00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:35.870
I'll jest a twelvemonth inan hospital.

862
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:39.870
And so I take my leave.

863
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:47.100
No, madam; we will bringyou on your way.

864
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:49.200
Our wooing doth not endlike an old play;

865
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.800
Jack hath not Jill: theseladies' courtesy

866
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.770
Might well have made oursport a comedy.

867
00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.630
Come, sir, it wants atwelvemonth and a day,

868
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:58.300
And then 'twill end.

869
