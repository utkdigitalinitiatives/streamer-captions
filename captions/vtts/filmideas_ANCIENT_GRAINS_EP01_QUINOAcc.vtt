00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.667
(guitar riff)

00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:13.391
(slow electronic music)

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.333
- [Voiceover] Grains
have been staple sources

00:00:32.292 --> 00:00:33.958
of nutrition and livelihood

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:35.499
for most cultures and
countries for centuries.

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:39.000
(gentle music)

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:44.042
But like majority of
food in modern times,

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.500
most common types of
grain such as wheat,

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.250
rye and rice undergo processes

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.042
that strip them
off of nutrients.

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:00.666
What people of the modern world

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:09.499
may not be aware of

00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:10.750
is that there are
other types of grains

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:12.625
that have existed
for hundred of years.

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:15.833
And whose nutritional profile

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:18.875
can address their need
for healthier diets.

00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:22.499
(jazzy music)

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:28.209
Most popular of these
ancient grains is quinoa.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:32.000
Pronounced as keen-wah,

00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:35.250
its name is derived
from the Quechua word,

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:37.583
kinwa or kinua,
which means "mother".

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.583
Aptly named because the
Incas regarded quinoa

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.833
as the mother of all grains.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.625
Records show that
early cultivation,

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.499
domestication and
consumption of quinoa

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.917
can be traced back as
far as 3000 to 5000 BC,

00:01:56.083 --> 00:02:00.250
when it became a
popular and staple food

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:02.499
in the Andes Mountain
region in South America.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.958
Which presently constitutes
Argentina, Bolivia,

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:09.666
Chile, Columbia,
Ecuador and Peru.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:13.500
However, in the 1530's,

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.499
during the Spanish
conquest of South America,

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.499
quinoa almost became extinct.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.499
Out of disdain for the grain,

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:29.499
which they dubbed as
"food for Indians",

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.417
and to demoralize the empire,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.499
weaken the Incas culture,

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:36.209
and force it into submission,

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:38.334
Spanish colonists and explorers

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.708
including Francisco Pizarro,

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.083
destroyed hundreds
of quinoa fields.

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.250
The colonists also
ordered the Incas

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:52.958
to stop cultivating the grain

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:55.125
due to its status
as a sacred item

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.583
in Incas religious ceremonies,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.917
and that they grow wheat
and barley instead.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:04.500
Thanks to quinoa's
inherent resilience

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.750
to low-nutrient soil and
rough winds at high altitudes,

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:18.000
wild varieties continue
to thrive in higher parts

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:22.292
of the Andes mountains,

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.917
saving its species
from total annihilation

00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:27.083
and allowing the natives to
continue eating the grain

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:29.791
in secrecy.

00:03:29.958 --> 00:03:31.375
Quinoa was an integral
piece in the Inca culture

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:37.292
and along with the
empire's demise

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.499
was quinoa's inevitable
fall into obscurity.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.499
Between 1970 and 1980,
quinoa was rediscovered

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:52.250
by two Americans who
stumbled upon the grain

00:03:52.417 --> 00:03:55.459
while they were in
the Bolivian Andes.

00:03:55.583 --> 00:03:57.791
Impressed by the
grain's many wonders,

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.625
they began planting
and cultivating it

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:02.666
in Colorado, USA.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:05.042
Quinoa, with scientific
name Chenopodium quinoa,

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:12.292
is a species of Chenopodium,

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.083
or goosefoot plants.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.459
It is also known
as a pseudograin

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.042
or pseudocereal
because unlike barley,

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.958
wheat and rice which belong
to the true grass family,

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:25.541
it is a leafy grain
closely related to spinach,

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:28.958
beets and chards.

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.459
The quinoa plant
grows up to two meters

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:33.625
or six feet tall.

00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.499
Its triangular or
sometimes ovate leaves

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.459
are covered with calcium oxalate

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:40.583
which enables them
to lock moisture

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.708
and protect itself from
the sun's radiation

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:45.499
when grown in high altitudes.

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:48.334
Its two millimeter
round asheens or fruits,

00:04:48.666 --> 00:04:52.499
produce seeds that
vary in color.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:54.750
White, yellow, red,
brown and black.

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:59.042
There are over 100 known
varieties of quinoa,

00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:01.917
but these can be classified
into five major categories.

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:06.334
First, the Valley Quinoas.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.042
These quinoas are found
in inter-Andean valleys

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.917
between 6500 and 12000
feet above sea level

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:16.499
and grow up to three meters.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:19.083
Second, the Altiplano
Quinoas which grow

00:05:19.666 --> 00:05:22.541
in areas near Lake Titicaca

00:05:22.708 --> 00:05:24.499
and are shorter
than Valley Quinoas.

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:26.958
Third, the Saltflat Quinoas.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.125
These grow in Southern Bolivia

00:05:29.292 --> 00:05:30.875
and can survive in areas
with less or no water.

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:34.833
Fourth, the Sea Level Quinoas

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:37.209
which are mainly
found in South Chile

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:39.459
and produce bitter yellow seeds.

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.917
And fifth, the Sub
Tropics Quinoa.

00:05:42.167 --> 00:05:44.958
This variety thrives in
the valleys of Bolivia

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:47.750
and have adapted in
sub tropical climates.

00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:50.875
Their stems turn
orange upon maturity

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.791
and their seeds are small.

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:55.875
Because of quinoa's
ability to grow

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.708
in varying heights,
temperature, and climate,

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:03.958
its cultivation has transcended

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.083
geographical boundaries.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.209
It's now also being
produced in countries

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.334
across the globe,
like Canada, France,

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:16.334
United Kingdom,
Sweden, Denmark, Italy,

00:06:16.833 --> 00:06:21.666
Kenya and even India.

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.833
(electronic music)

00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:33.791
The people of the
ancient Inca empire

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.499
revered quinoa and for centuries

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:44.250
this grain has
provided the natives

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:46.292
of the Andes mountains

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:47.666
with sustenance and nutrition.

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:50.375
But recent studies
show that quinoa

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:56.541
shouldn't remain in the past,

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:58.499
nor stay just as an
alternative to most grains

00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:01.750
like rice or wheat.

00:07:01.917 --> 00:07:03.499
Its nutrition profile
remain priceless today

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:08.499
and it was years ago.

00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:10.708
Quinoa is actually
considered a superfood

00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:15.334
in so many ways.

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:17.250
In terms of protein,
one serving of quinoa

00:07:17.708 --> 00:07:21.000
can already provide the body

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:22.625
with all eight
essential amino acids.

00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:26.042
It is rich in lysine,

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:27.833
an amino acid that is
deficient in most grains.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.292
This makes quinoa an
idea source of protein,

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:34.541
especially for vegetarians.

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:36.750
People with diabetes and
cardiovascular ailments

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:41.459
can also benefit
from this grain.

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:43.541
Because quinoa has
a higher fat content

00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:47.250
compared to beans or maize,

00:07:47.417 --> 00:07:49.499
it is a good source
of heart-friendly fats

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.334
like Omega-6 and Omega-3 acids.

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:55.499
It also has a large dose
of fiber which is known

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:58.499
to lower levels and reduce
buildup of cholesterol.

00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:02.499
And for diabetics, help
control blood glucose levels.

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:07.167
Quinoa is also superior
to other grains

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:11.791
and legumes in terms of
vitamin and mineral content.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:15.334
It contains the highest
amount of potassium

00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:18.417
among whole grains
which is helpful

00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:20.666
in controlling blood pressure.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:22.833
Plus it has significant
amounts of phosphorus,

00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:27.459
calcium and zinc.

00:08:27.499 --> 00:08:29.499
Quinoa is also a viable
substitute to rice and wheat

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:33.250
for people who are
having weight problems.

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:35.541
Its rich B vitamin
content which includes

00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.499
riboflavin, thiamine,
folic acid and niacin

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.833
combined with iron
can help the body

00:08:45.083 --> 00:08:47.292
synthesize nutrients better,

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.499
produce energy efficiently
and increase metabolism.

00:08:49.499 --> 00:08:53.708
Also, at 172
calories per serving,

00:08:55.459 --> 00:08:58.499
one can eat in large
quantities with lesser guilt.

00:08:58.541 --> 00:09:02.417
Quinoa also has a variety
of antioxidants to boast of,

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:06.499
such as Vitamin E and manganese.

00:09:06.499 --> 00:09:09.125
It also contains
several phytochemicals

00:09:10.499 --> 00:09:12.917
such as feruli, coumaric,

00:09:13.499 --> 00:09:16.499
hydroxybenzoic,
and vanillic acid.

00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:20.500
Plus flavinoids like
quercetin and kaempferol.

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:25.042
While not necessary nutrients,

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:27.375
these antioxidants can
still positively contribute

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:30.500
to one's overall health
since these can help

00:09:30.666 --> 00:09:33.708
fight diseases like
stroke and cancer.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:36.750
(slow music)

00:09:40.833 --> 00:09:44.917
The Inca empire was
one of the greatest

00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.375
early civilizations
ever recorded.

00:09:54.499 --> 00:09:57.250
During its peak
between 1493 and 1527,

00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:02.000
the empire had expanded
to around 300,000

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.499
square miles,

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:06.917
covering land areas from Ecuador

00:10:07.083 --> 00:10:09.499
all the way down to Chile

00:10:09.499 --> 00:10:11.417
and it's believed that
quinoa contributed

00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:14.209
a great deal in the empire's
success and progress.

00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:18.375
At the time when the
empire was expanding

00:10:19.499 --> 00:10:21.708
and consolidating its
territories by conquest,

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:25.125
it is said that
the Inca warriors

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.625
ate balls of quinoa to
receive stamina and endurance

00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:32.000
to survive long marches
and win battles.

00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:35.499
And as the empire's
population rose

00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:40.666
close to 12 million people,

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:43.499
historians believe
that the empire's

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.499
effective cultivation and
distribution of quinoa

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:48.499
to its people and other
conquered territories

00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:51.499
allowed it to feed its citizens

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.625
and sustain its
authority over them.

00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:56.500
Legend also has
it that the Incas

00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:00.209
considered quinoa
as a sacred plant.

00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:03.125
Each year, in a very
sacred ceremony,

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:06.499
the Inca emperor would
sow the first quinoa seeds

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:09.500
of the season.

00:11:09.666 --> 00:11:11.000
Then in Cusco Peru,
quinoa seeds were entombed

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.083
and worshiped as the
forebears of the city

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.292
and its people.

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:19.499
Quinoa also played a
major role in the Incas

00:11:19.625 --> 00:11:22.417
religious rites.

00:11:22.499 --> 00:11:23.917
As a sign of reverence
to their sun god, Inti,

00:11:24.499 --> 00:11:27.583
the Incas would put quinoa
in a fountain of gold

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:30.583
as an offering.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.875
(soft piano)

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.791
But aside from its sacred
and religious uses,

00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:43.791
quinoa also has
medicinal properties

00:11:43.958 --> 00:11:46.583
that the Incas used
to treat illnesses.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.500
The Incas would make
a poultice or plaster

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.499
made from quinoa flour and water

00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:55.875
to heal broken bones and
fight infections in wounds.

00:11:56.042 --> 00:12:00.209
They also used
the grain to treat

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:04.499
urinary tract
problems, tuberculosis,

00:12:04.625 --> 00:12:07.625
appendicitis,

00:12:07.791 --> 00:12:09.125
liver problems

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.042
and altitude and
motion sicknesses.

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:14.250
The natives of the Andes
also included quinoa

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:17.334
in the diet of pregnant women

00:12:17.499 --> 00:12:19.500
since it is believed
to strengthen them

00:12:19.666 --> 00:12:21.583
during and after pregnancy

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.708
and that it can help them
produce healthier milk

00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:26.499
for their infants.

00:12:26.499 --> 00:12:28.292
Now the quinoa seeds
have an outer coating

00:12:33.499 --> 00:12:35.375
called saponin.

00:12:35.499 --> 00:12:37.209
It's responsible for
the grain's bitter taste

00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:40.499
so the natives would
thoroughly wash the seeds

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:44.375
before cooking them.

00:12:44.499 --> 00:12:46.250
Then they would use the
saponin-filled wash water

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:49.209
as shampoo, soap and detergent.

00:12:49.375 --> 00:12:52.500
But quinoa seeds are not
the only parts of the plant

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:55.499
the Incas found useful.

00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:57.917
Its leaves have
betacyanin pigments,

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.666
giving them a bright reddish hue

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:05.375
and the natives used the leaves

00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:07.042
as a natural dyeing
agent for their textiles.

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:10.583
The Incas saw and used

00:13:16.334 --> 00:13:17.583
quinoa's remarkable
properties to their advantage

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.833
and survival.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.459
No wonder that they
refer to this grain

00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:25.791
as chisaya mama, or
mother of all grains,

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:29.750
because it truly is an
exceptional piece of nature.

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:33.666
(electronic music)

00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:42.958
(soft guitar)

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.625
Quinoa became almost extinct

00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:49.958
during the Spanish
conquest of South America

00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:54.083
and its rediscovery
and reintroduction

00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:57.083
to modern civilization

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.042
is something people
have to be grateful for.

00:13:59.209 --> 00:14:01.708
Quinoa originated
in Peru and Bolivia.

00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:10.958
And these two countries remain

00:14:15.541 --> 00:14:16.958
the largest producers and
exporters of quinoa today.

00:14:17.125 --> 00:14:21.042
(soft music)

00:14:22.209 --> 00:14:25.541
As a matter of fact,

00:14:25.708 --> 00:14:26.875
their combined harvest in 2010

00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:29.459
accounted for nearly 99 percent

00:14:30.417 --> 00:14:32.499
of commercially grown
quinoa in the whole world.

00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:35.958
Peru harvested over
41,000 metric tons

00:14:36.583 --> 00:14:40.042
while Bolivia came close
with 29,500 metric tons

00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:47.167
of quinoa.

00:14:47.334 --> 00:14:48.499
The growing global
interest for the grain

00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:57.209
has helped over 70,000 small
family farms in Bolivia,

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:01.625
who cultivate quinoa in
their desert-like lands

00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:05.292
using small scaled
irrigation systems.

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:07.791
The significant
increase in demand

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:10.791
has generated increase
in income and economy

00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:14.499
in Bolivia,

00:15:14.499 --> 00:15:15.500
allowing its government
to slowly improve

00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:17.708
infrastructure,
facilities and services

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.666
for its citizens.

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:22.499
Cultivation of this grain

00:15:24.499 --> 00:15:25.750
is an undemanding endeavor.

00:15:25.917 --> 00:15:28.375
Because of its ability to grow

00:15:28.499 --> 00:15:30.250
in almost any type
of soil, vegetation,

00:15:30.417 --> 00:15:33.334
temperature and climate,

00:15:33.499 --> 00:15:35.499
other countries within
and outside South America

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.791
are now growing quinoa.

00:15:38.958 --> 00:15:41.209
Aside from Peru and Bolivia,

00:15:41.499 --> 00:15:43.499
it's also now produced in
the states of Colorado,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.459
Washington, California,
Oregon in the United States

00:15:46.499 --> 00:15:50.499
as well as in Canada, France,

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:53.250
United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark,

00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:56.499
Italy, Kenya, and India.

00:15:56.499 --> 00:16:00.000
Even the National Aeronautics

00:16:00.499 --> 00:16:01.583
and Space Administration or NASA

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.334
has their sights on
this super grain.

00:16:04.499 --> 00:16:07.209
Because of its
nutrition profile.

00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:09.499
NASA is eyeing quinoa
as a possible crop

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.500
in their controlled
ecological life support system

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:15.417
to sustain space explorers' diet

00:16:15.583 --> 00:16:17.958
during long duration
space flights.

00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:20.708
But while quinoa is
still under deliberation

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:28.500
as the grain of
our final frontier,

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:31.125
quinoa is already and
finally picking up fame

00:16:31.292 --> 00:16:34.083
worldwide.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.459
2013 was declared by
the United Nations

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:44.167
General Assembly as
the international year

00:16:44.334 --> 00:16:46.750
of quinoa.

00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:48.125
Because of the grain's
nutritional value,

00:16:55.499 --> 00:16:57.499
and its ability to grow
almost anywhere in the world,

00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:01.417
the UN believes that quinoa
is the world's weapon

00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:05.250
in eradicating poverty,
food, and nutrition problems.

00:17:05.417 --> 00:17:09.167
As the UN is
tenaciously promoting

00:17:13.417 --> 00:17:15.417
the value of quinoa
across continents,

00:17:15.499 --> 00:17:18.292
scientists,
pharmacologists, botanists,

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:21.666
and agriculturists
are also exploring

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.666
other potentials this
grain might still possess

00:17:24.833 --> 00:17:28.125
and how mankind
can take advantage

00:17:28.292 --> 00:17:30.499
of these potentials
for its survival.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.167
Just like how the Incas used it

00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:35.209
for thousands of years.

00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:37.459
(electronic music)

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.583
(jazzy music)

00:17:50.958 --> 00:17:55.875
Just like most grains,

00:18:01.499 --> 00:18:02.499
preparing and cooking
quinoa is easy.

00:18:02.625 --> 00:18:06.042
Before distribution,

00:18:06.417 --> 00:18:07.499
commercially milled
quinoa usually undergoes

00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:10.042
a process that removes
its outer coating

00:18:10.209 --> 00:18:12.875
called saponins.

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:14.625
Since saponins are responsible

00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:16.541
for the grain's bitter taste,

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.583
most consumers still rinse
the grains in cold water

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.791
before cooking just to make sure

00:18:21.958 --> 00:18:24.417
they eliminate saponin residue.

00:18:24.499 --> 00:18:26.666
Now, to cook quinoa.

00:18:28.833 --> 00:18:30.250
Just follow these
two easy steps.

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:32.833
First, in a pot put
one part of the grain

00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:38.499
to two parts liquid
and bring it to a boil.

00:18:38.499 --> 00:18:42.125
And second, once it's boiling,

00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:49.875
reduce the heat to simmer

00:18:50.499 --> 00:18:51.708
and cover the pot

00:18:55.209 --> 00:18:56.292
until the grains
become translucent.

00:18:56.459 --> 00:18:58.541
One basic indication
that the grain is cooked

00:19:00.499 --> 00:19:03.292
is the presence of a white
germ spiraling like a tail.

00:19:03.459 --> 00:19:07.499
Cooking quinoa this way
will take about 15 minutes.

00:19:07.917 --> 00:19:11.334
When cooked, quinoa seeds
look creamy and fluffy

00:19:12.666 --> 00:19:15.625
with a crunchy
texture which makes it

00:19:17.042 --> 00:19:19.083
a very interesting dish.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.499
Quinoa seeds can also
be processed into flour.

00:19:22.833 --> 00:19:25.958
100 percent quinoa flour
is heavy in texture,

00:19:26.417 --> 00:19:29.625
so most manufacturers
mix it with other flours

00:19:29.791 --> 00:19:32.750
like tapioca flour
and rice flour.

00:19:32.917 --> 00:19:36.167
Quinoa flour is gluten-free,

00:19:36.499 --> 00:19:38.334
so it's a very good
alternative for people

00:19:38.499 --> 00:19:40.875
who might have
allergic reactions

00:19:41.042 --> 00:19:43.000
to gluten based products.

00:19:43.167 --> 00:19:45.292
Now the leaves of the quinoa
plant are also edible.

00:19:45.583 --> 00:19:48.875
Just like spinach, it
can be blanched, boiled,

00:19:49.499 --> 00:19:52.499
and even served raw as a salad.

00:19:52.499 --> 00:19:55.125
It can also produce an
extract that can be used

00:19:55.875 --> 00:19:58.499
in tonics, puddings and syrups.

00:19:58.583 --> 00:20:01.583
Here's a quick chocolate
breakfast porridge recipe

00:20:02.292 --> 00:20:04.666
using quinoa.

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:06.250
Prepare the following:

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:10.541
One half cup of quinoa.

00:20:12.417 --> 00:20:14.125
One cup of water.

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:15.833
Two thirds cup of
chocolate soy milk.

00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:19.541
One tablespoon of cocoa powder.

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:22.459
One tablespoon of maple syrup.

00:20:23.499 --> 00:20:25.750
And one banana, mashed.

00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:28.292
In a pot, put quinoa and
water and bring it to a boil.

00:20:29.499 --> 00:20:33.499
Reduce heat and then add
the chocolate soy milk.

00:20:35.708 --> 00:20:39.292
Let it simmer for
five to seven minutes.

00:20:39.459 --> 00:20:42.167
Or until most of the liquid part

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:45.708
has been absorbed by the quinoa.

00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:48.209
Remove from heat and
then stir in the rest

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:51.917
of the ingredients.

00:20:52.083 --> 00:20:53.500
The cocoa powder,
maple syrup and banana.

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:58.042
You can make it more delicious

00:20:59.125 --> 00:21:00.375
by adding chopped
nuts or berries.

00:21:00.499 --> 00:21:03.167
And for a burst of flavor,

00:21:03.499 --> 00:21:04.917
put a dash of ground cinnamon

00:21:05.083 --> 00:21:06.791
or a drop of vanilla extract.

00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.499
Another recipe you can try
with quinoa is a salad.

00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:13.541
Just prepare the following:

00:21:14.499 --> 00:21:16.000
One half cup of quinoa.

00:21:18.499 --> 00:21:20.499
One cup of water.

00:21:21.541 --> 00:21:22.958
One stalk of spring
onions, chopped.

00:21:23.958 --> 00:21:27.083
One red pepper, sliced thinly.

00:21:27.499 --> 00:21:29.708
One fourth cucumber, sliced.

00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:32.167
One half cup of orange juice.

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:34.750
One teaspoon of lime juice.

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:37.500
One tablespoon of balsamic syrup

00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:40.499
and a pinch of salt.

00:21:40.708 --> 00:21:42.499
To prepare, cook the
quinoa with water in a pot

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:46.625
for 15 minutes.

00:21:46.791 --> 00:21:47.875
Then let it cool.

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:52.917
Mix all the vegetables together

00:21:54.499 --> 00:21:56.042
and combine it with
the cooked quinoa.

00:21:56.209 --> 00:21:58.499
For the dressing,

00:21:59.875 --> 00:22:01.000
just mix the orange
juice, lime juice,

00:22:01.375 --> 00:22:04.917
and balsamic syrup

00:22:05.083 --> 00:22:06.499
and drizzle it over
your mixed quinoa

00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:10.917
and vegetables.

00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:12.334
Add salt and pepper to taste.

00:22:12.499 --> 00:22:14.708

00:22:17.917 --> 00:22:22.750
The ancient people
of the Inca empire

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.708
had the privilege of enjoying
quinoa's many benefits

00:22:43.875 --> 00:22:46.750
in the past.

00:22:46.917 --> 00:22:48.125
And now, it's our
turn to experience

00:22:49.499 --> 00:22:51.625
the many blessings
it has in store

00:22:51.791 --> 00:22:53.708
for our generation.

00:22:53.875 --> 00:22:55.791

00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:04.499
