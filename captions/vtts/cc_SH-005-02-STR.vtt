00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830


2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.730
We must not make a scarecrow ofthe law

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.130
Setting it up to fear the birdsof prey

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.600
And let it keep one shape,

5
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.200
till custom make it theirperch

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.600
and not their terror.

7
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.700
Ay, but yet let us bekeen,

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.930
and rather cut a little,

9
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.670
Than fall, and bruise todeath.

10
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.630
Alas, this gentleman

11
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.170
Whom I would save, had amost noble father!

12
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.430
Let but your honour know,

13
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.170
Whom I believe to be moststrait in virtue,

14
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.470
That, in the working ofyour own affections,

15
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.600
Had time cohered with placeor place with wishing,

16
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.000
Or that the resoluteacting of your blood

17
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.130
Could have attain'd theeffect of your own purpose,

18
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.600
Whether you had notsometime in your life

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.600
Err'd in this point whichnow you censure him,

20
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.070
And pull'd the law uponyou.

21
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.970
'Tis one thing to betempted, Escalus,

22
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.270
Another thing to fall.

23
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.800
I not deny,

24
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.900
The jury, passing on theprisoner's life,

25
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.300
May in the sworn twelve

26
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.730
have a thief or twoguiltier than him they try.

27
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.670
What's open made to justice,that justice seizes:

28
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.530
what know the laws

29
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.370
That thieves do pass onthieves?

30
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.770
'Tis very pregnant,

31
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.970
The jewel that we find,

32
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.830
we stoop and take'tbecause we see it;

33
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.230
but what we do not see wetread upon,

34
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.470
and never think of it.

35
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.930
You may not so extenuatehis offence

36
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500
For I have had such faults;but rather tell me,

37
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.800
When I, that censure him,do so offend,

38
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.200
Let mine own judgmentpattern out my death,

39
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.700
And nothing come inpartial. Sir, he must die.

40
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.830
Be it as your wisdom will.

41
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.730
Where is the provost?

42
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.900
Here, if it like yourhonour.

43
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.800
See that Claudio

44
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.800
Be executed by nineto-morrow morning:

45
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.070
Bring him his confessor,let him be prepared;

46
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.300
For that's the utmost ofhis pilgrimage.

47
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.770
Well, heaven forgive him!and forgive us all!

48
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.600
Some rise by sin, and someby virtue fall:

49
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.270
Some run from brakes ofice, and answer none:

50
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.730
And some condemned for afault alone.

51
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.130
How now, sir! What's yourname?

52
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.630
and what's the matter?

53
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.300
If it Please your honour,

54
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.530
I am the poor duke'sconstable,

55
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.770
and my name is Elbow:

56
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.030
I do lean upon justice,sir,

57
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.000
and do bring in herebefore your good honour

58
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.800
two notorious benefactors.

59
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.170
Benefactors? Well; whatbenefactors are they?

60
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.670
are they not malefactors?

61
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.130
If it? please your honour,

62
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.830
I know not well what theyare:

63
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.230
but precise villains theyare,

64
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.170
that I am sure of; andvoid of all profanation

65
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.630
in the world that goodChristians ought to have.

66
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.900
Here's a wise officer;This comes off well.

67
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.600
Go to: what quality arethey of?

68
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.700
Elbow is your name? whydost thou not speak, Elbow?

69
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.230
He cannot, sir; he's outat elbow.

70
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.930
(laughing)

71
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.930
What are you, sir?

72
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.930
He, sir! a tapster, sir;parcel-bawd;

73
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.000
one that serves a badwoman; whose house, sir,

74
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.870
was, as they say, pluckeddown in the suburbs;

75
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.570
but now she professes ahot-house, which, I believe,

76
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.630
is a very ill house too.

77
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.000
How know you that?

78
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.530
My wife, sir, whom Idetest before heaven

79
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.000
and your honour,--

80
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.200
How? thy wife?

81
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.370
Ay, sir; whom, I thankheaven, is an honest woman,--

82
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.530
Dost thou detest hertherefore?

83
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.000
I say, sir, I will detestmyself also,

84
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.770
as well as she, that thishouse,

85
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.170
if it be not a bawd's house,it is pity of her life,

86
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.170
for it is a naughty house.

87
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.000
How dost thou know that,constable?

88
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.670
Marry, sir, by my wife;

89
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.330
who, if she had been awoman cardinally given,

90
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.300
might have been accused infornication, adultery,

91
00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.130
and all kinds ofuncleanliness there.

92
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.570
By the woman's means?

93
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.830
Ay, sir, by MistressOverdone's means:

94
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.070
but as she spit in hisface,

95
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.770
so she defied him.

96
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.730
Sir, if it please yourhonour, this is not so.

97
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.800
Prove it before thesevarlets here,

98
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.230
thou honourable man; proveit.

99
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.870
Do you hear how hemisplaces?

100
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.870
Sir, she came in greatwith child;

101
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.770
and longing, saving yourhonour's reverence,

102
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.530
for stewed prunes;

103
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.930
sir, we had but two in thehouse,

104
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.070
which at that very distanttime stood, as it were,

105
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.970
in a fruit-dish, a dish ofsome three-pence;

106
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.700
your honours have seensuch dishes;

107
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.870
they are not China dishes,but very good dishes,

108
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.000
Go to, go to: no matterfor the dish, sir.

109
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.800
No, indeed, sir,

110
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.370
and having but two in thedish, as I said,

111
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.230
Master Froth here, thisvery man,

112
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.000
having eaten the rest, asI said,

113
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.630
and, as I say, paying forthem very honestly;

114
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.530
for, as you know, MasterFroth,

115
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.200
I could not give youthree-pence again.

116
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.570
No, indeed.

117
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.270
Very well: you being then,

118
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.270
if you be remembered,

119
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.300
cracking the stones of theforesaid prunes,

120
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.000
Come, you are a tediousfool: to the purpose.

121
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.930
What was done to Elbow'swife,

122
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.600
that he hath cause tocomplain of?

123
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.230
Come me to what was doneto her.

124
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.200
Sir, your honour cannotcome to that yet.

125
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.400
No, sir, nor I mean itnot.

126
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.270
Sir, but you shall come toit,

127
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.370

And, I beseech you, lookinto Master Froth here, sir;

whose father died atHallowmas:

131
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.270

132
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.170
All-hallond eve.

133
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.900
This will last out a nightin Russia,

134
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.330
When nights are longestthere:

135
00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.300
I'll take my leave.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.770
And leave you to thehearing of the cause;

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.970
Hoping you'll find goodcause to whip them all.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.170
I think no less. Goodmorrow to your lordship.

139
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.030
Now, sir, come on:

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.000

141
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.100
Once? there wasnothing done to her once.

142

I beseech you, sir, ask himwhat this man did to my wife.

Why, no.

I'll be supposed upon abook,

155
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.570
his face is the worstthing about him.

156
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.300
Very good; if his face bethe worst thing about him,

157
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.900
how could Master Froth do theconstable's wife any harm?

158
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.900
I would know that of yourhonour.

159
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.400
He's in the right. Constable,what say you to it?

160
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.300

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.530
next, this is a respectedfellow;

163
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.030
and his mistress is arespected woman.

164
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.170
By this hand, sir,

165
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.330
his wife is a morerespected person

166
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.130
than any of us all.

167
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.030
Varlet, thou liest; thouliest, wicked varlet!

168
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.470
the time has yet to comethat she was ever respected.

169
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:28.800
Prove this, thou wickedHannibal, prove this

170
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.600
or I'll have mine actionof battery on thee.

171
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.430
If he took you a box o'the ear,

172
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.900
you might have your actionof slander too.

173
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.370
Marry, I thank your goodworship for it.

174
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.570

that thou wouldst discoverif thou couldst,

178

I thank your worship.

For mine own part,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.470
I never come into any roomin a tap-house,

203
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.770

What else?

209
00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.630
Bum, sir.

210
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.630
Troth, and your bum is thegreatest thing about you;

211
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.900
so that in the beastliestsense you are

212
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.130
Pompey the Great. Pompey,

213
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:17.200
you are partly a bawd,Pompey,

214
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.030
howsoever you colour it inbeing a tapster,

215
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.470
are you not? come, tell metrue:

216
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.270
it shall be the better foryou.

217
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.230
Truly, sir, I am a poorfellow who would live.

218
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.630
How would you live,Pompey? by being a bawd?

219
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.930
What do you think of thetrade, Pompey?

220
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.270
is it a lawful trade?

221
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.930
If the law would allow it,sir.

222
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.130
But the law will not allowit, Pompey;

223
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.700
nor it shall not beallowed in Vienna.

224
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.670
Does your worship mean togeld and splay

225
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.030

226
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.200
No, Pompey.

227
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.030
Truly, sir, in my pooropinion, they will to't then.

228
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.770
If your worship will takeorder

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.370

There are pretty ordersbeginning, I can tell you:

232
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.170
it is but heading andhanging.

233
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.770
If you head and hang allthat offend that way

234
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.400
but for ten year together,

235
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.870
you'll be glad to give out acommission for more heads:

236
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:10.830
if this law hold in Viennaten year,

237
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.800

Thank you, good Pompey;

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.500
I advise you, let me notfind you before me again

243
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.800
upon any complaintwhatsoever;

244
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.500
no, not for dwelling whereyou do:

245
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.730
if I do, Pompey,

246
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.470
I shall beat you to yourtent,

247
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.630
and prove a shrewd Caesarto you;

248
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.970
in plain dealing, Pompey,I shall have you whipt:

249
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.300
so, for this time, Pompey,fare you well.

250
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.870
I thank your worship foryour good counsel:

251
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.430
but I shall follow it asthe flesh and fortune

252
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.500
shall better determine.

253
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.100
Whip me? No, no; letcarman whip his jade:

254
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.230
The valiant heart is notwhipt out of his trade.

255
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.500
Come hither to me, MasterElbow;

256
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.700
come hither, Masterconstable.

257
00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.600
How long have you been inthis place of constable?

258
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.270
Seven year and a half,sir.

259
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.870
I thought, by yourreadiness in the office,

260
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.670
you had continued in itsome time.

261
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:25.830
You say, seven yearstogether?

262
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.100
And a half, sir.

263
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.570
Alas, it hath been greatpains to you.

264
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.330
They do you wrong to putyou so oft upon 't:

265
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:35.800
are there not men in yourward sufficient to serve it?

266
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.170
Faith, sir, few of any witin such matters:

267
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:40.400
as they are chosen,

268
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.630
they are glad to choose mefor them;

269
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.670
I do it for some piece ofmoney,

270
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.100
and go through with all.

271
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.400
Look you bring me in thenames of some six or seven,

272
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.970
the most sufficient ofyour parish.

273
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.930
To your worship's house,sir?

274
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.370
To my house. Fare youwell.

275
00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.930
I pray you home to dinnerwith me.

276
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.000
I humbly thank you.

277
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.130
It grieves me for thedeath of Claudio;

278
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.300
But there's no remedy.

279
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:20.430
Lord Angelo is severe.

280
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.200
It is but needful:

281
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.800
Mercy is not itself, thatoft looks so;

282
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.170
Pardon is still the nurseof second woe:

283
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.930
But yet,--poor Claudio!

284
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.430
Is it your will Claudioshall die tomorrow?

285
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:46.630
Did not I tell thee yea?hadst thou not order?

286
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.970
Why dost thou ask again?

287
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.930
Lest I might be too rash:

288
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.270
Under your goodcorrection, I have seen,

289
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:56.700
When, after execution,

290
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.870
judgment hath repentedo'er his doom.

291
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.070
Go to; let that be mine:

292
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.970
Do you your office, orgive up your place,

293
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.600
And you shall well bespared.

294
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.430
I crave your honour'spardon.

295
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.730
What shall be done, sir,with the groaning Juliet?

296
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:12.200
She's very near her hour.

297
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.230
Dispose of her

298
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.200
To some more fitter place,and that with speed.

299
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.170
Here is the sister of theman condemn'd

300
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.030
Desires access to you.

301
00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.130
Hath he a sister?

302
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:24.970
Ay, my good lord; a veryvirtuous maid,

303
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.630
And to be shortly of asisterhood,

304
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:28.270
If not already.

305
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.030
Well, let her be admitted.

306
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.470
See you the fornicatressbe removed:

307
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.630
Let have needful, but notlavish, means;

308
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.130
There shall be orderfor't.

309
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.330
You're welcome:

310
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.700
what's your will?

311
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.430
I am a woeful suitor toyour honour,

312
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:52.200
Please but your honourhear me.

313
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.630
Well; what's your suit?

314
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.270
There is a vice that mostI do abhor,

315
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.630
And most desire shouldmeet the blow of justice;

316
00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.630
For which I would notplead, but that I must;

317
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.900
For which I must notplead,

318
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.230
but that I am at war'twixt will and will not.

319
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.770
Well; the matter?

320
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.730
I have a brother iscondemn'd to die:

321
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.430
I do beseech you, let itbe his fault,

322
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.900
And not my brother.

323
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.630
Condemn the fault and notthe actor of it?

324
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:26.130
Why, every fault'scondemn'd ere it be done:

325
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.870
Mine were the very cipherof a function,

326
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.330
To fine the faults whosefine stands in record,

327
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.230
And let go by the actor.

328
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.600
O just but severe law!

329
00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.500
I had a brother, then.Heaven keep your honour!

330
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.530
Give't not o'er so: to himagain, entreat him;

331
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.600
Kneel down before him,hang upon his gown:

332
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.730
You are too cold; if youshould need a pin,

333
00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.000
You could not with moretame a tongue desire it:

334
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.200
To him, I say!

335
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.730
Must he needs die?

336
00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.500
Maiden, no remedy.

337
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.530
Yes; I do think that youmight pardon him,

338
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.500
And neither heaven nor mangrieve at the mercy.

339
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.230
I will not do't.

340
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.930
But can you, if you would?

341
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:08.300
Look, what I will not,that I cannot do.

342
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.730
But might you do't, and dothe world no wrong,

343
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.730
If so your heart weretouch'd with that remorse

344
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.600
A s mine is to him?

345
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.330
He's sentenced; 'tis toolate.

346
00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.570
You are too cold.

347
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.330
Too late? why, no; I, thatdo speak a word.

348
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.870
May call it back again.

349
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:25.700
Well, believe this,

350
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.670
No ceremony that to greatones 'longs,

351
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.630
Not the king's crown, northe deputed sword,

352
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.230
The marshal's truncheon,nor the judge's robe,

353
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:36.170
Become them with one halfso good a grace

354
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.530
As mercy does.

355
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.830
If he had been as you andyou as he,

356
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.630
You would have slipt likehim; but he, like you,

357
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.230
Would not have been sostern.

358
00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.330
Pray you, be gone.

359
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.100
I would to heaven I hadyour potency,

360
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.330
And you were Isabel!should it then be thus?

361
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.630
No; I would tell what'twere to be a judge,

362
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.000
And what a prisoner.

363
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.100
Ay, touch him; there's thevein.

364
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.400
Your brother is a forfeitof the law,

365
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.170
And you but waste yourwords.

366
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.230
Alas, alas!

367
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.330
Why, all the souls thatwere were forfeit once;

368
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.400
And He that might thevantage best have took

369
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.400
Found out the remedy.

370
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.400
How would you be,

371
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.200
If He, which is the top ofjudgment,

372
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.930
should but judge you asyou are?

373
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:23.970
O, think on that;

374
00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.070
And mercy then willbreathe within your lips,

375
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.700
Like man new made.

376
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.330
Be you content, fair maid;

377
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:37.500
It is the law, not Icondemn your brother:

378
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.170
Were he my kinsman,brother, or my son,

379
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:43.270
It should be thus withhim: he must die tomorrow.

380
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:46.470
To-morrow! O, that'ssudden!

381
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:47.630
Spare him, spare him!

382
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.600
He's not prepared fordeath.

383
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.330
Even for our kitchens wekill the fowl of season:

384
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.930
shall we serve heaven withless respect

385
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:03.470
than we do minister to ourgross selves?

386
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:07.700
Good, good my lord,bethink you;

387
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.230
Who is it that hath diedfor this offence?

388
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.930
There's many havecommitted it.

389
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.930
Ay, well said.

390
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:21.270
The law hath not been dead,though it hath slept:

391
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.500
Those many had not daredto do that evil,

392
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.930
If the first that did theedict infringe

393
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.470
Had answer'd for his deed:

394
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.930
now 'tis awake takes noteof what is done;

395
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:33.530
and, like a prophet,

396
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.900
Looks in a glass, thatshows what future evils,

397
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.730
Either new, or byremissness new-conceived,

398
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.900
And so in progress to behatch'd and born,

399
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.670
Are now to have nosuccessive degrees,

400
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.470
But, ere they live, toend.

401
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.500
Yet show some pity.

402
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.670
I show it most of all whenI show justice;

403
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.070
For then I pity those I donot know,

404
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.930
Which a dismiss'd offencewould after gall;

405
00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:03.100
And do him right that,answering one foul wrong,

406
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:10.770
Lives not to act another.Be satisfied;

407
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:17.130
Your brother diesto-morrow; be content.

408
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.670
So you must be the firstthat gives this sentence,

409
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.800
And he, that suffer's.

410
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.100
O, it is excellent

411
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:29.130
To have a giant'sstrength;

412
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:31.870
but it is tyrannous to useit like a giant.

413
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.770
That's well said.

414
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.170
Could great men thunder

415
00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:39.070
As Jove himself does, Jovewould ne'er be quiet,

416
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.400
For every pelting, pettyofficer

417
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.130
Would use his heaven forthunder;

418
00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:45.900
Nothing but thunder!

419
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:47.770
Merciful Heaven,

420
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.630
Thou rather with thy sharpand sulphurous bolt

421
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.370
Split'st the unwedgeableand gnarled oak

422
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:56.770
Than the soft myrtle: butman, proud man,

423
00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.430
Drest in a little briefauthority,

424
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.030
Most ignorant of what he'smost assured,

425
00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:04.600
His glassy essence, likean angry ape,

426
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.900
Plays such fantastictricks before high heaven

427
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.970
As make the angels weep;

428
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.670
who, with our spleens,

429
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.700
Would all themselves laughmortal.

430
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.300
O, to him, to him, wench!he will relent;

431
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.730
He's coming; I perceive 't.

432
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.770
We cannot weigh ourbrother with ourself:

433
00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:29.230
Great men may jest withsaints; 'tis wit in them,

434
00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.800
But in the less foulprofanation.

435
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.200
Thou'rt i' the right,girl; more o, that.

436
00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.300
That in the captain's buta choleric word,

437
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.030
Which in the soldier isflat blasphemy.

438
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.200
Art avised o' that? moreon 't.

439
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.430
Why do you put thesesayings upon me?

440
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.600
Because authority, thoughit err like others,

441
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.670
Hath yet a kind ofmedicine in itself,

442
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.600
That skins the vice o' thetop.

443
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.100
Go to your bosom;

444
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.470
Knock there, and ask yourheart

445
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:02.430
what it doth know

446
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.470
That's like my brother'sfault:

447
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:08.600
if it confess a naturalguiltiness such as is his,

448
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.570
Let it not sound a thoughtupon your tongue

449
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.600
Against my brother's life.

450
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.700
She speaks, and 'tis suchsense,

451
00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.570
that my sense breathes with it.

452
00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.400
Fare ye well.

453
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.770
Gentle my lord, turn back.

454
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:43.100
I will bethink me: comeagain tomorrow.

455
00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.170
Hark how I'll bribe you:good my lord, turn back.

456
00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.130
How! bribe me?

457
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.530
Ay, with such gifts thatheaven shall share with you.

458
00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:57.300
Not with fond shekels ofthe tested gold,

459
00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.800
Or stones whose rates areeither rich or poor

460
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.030
As fancy values them;

461
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.330
but with true prayers

462
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.200
That shall be up at heavenand enter there

463
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.030
Ere sun-rise, prayers frompreserved souls,

464
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.600
From fasting maids whoseminds are dedicate

465
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.600
To nothing temporal.

466
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:22.400
Well; come to meto-morrow.

467
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.600
Go to; 'tis well; away!

468
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.300
Heaven keep your honoursafe!

469
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:30.170
Amen: For I am that waygoing to temptation,

470
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.800
Where prayers cross.

471
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.870
At what hour to-morrow

472
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:35.570
Shall I attend yourlordship?

473
00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.270
At any time 'fore noon.

474
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.100
'Save your honour!

475
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:53.030
From thee, even from thyvirtue!

476
00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.530
What's this, what's this?

477
00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.430
Is this her fault or mine?

478
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.170
The tempter or thetempted, who sins most?

479
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:09.400
Ha!

480
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:14.200
Not she: nor doth shetempt: but it is I

481
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.730
That, lying by the violetin the sun,

482
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.570
Do as the carrion does,not as the flower,

483
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.100
Corrupt with virtuousseason.

484
00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:22.770
Can it be that modesty maymore betray our sense

485
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.730
Than woman's lightness?

486
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:26.300
Having waste groundenough,

487
00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.030
Shall we desire to razethe sanctuary

488
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:34.800
And pitch our evils there?O, fie, fie, fie!

489
00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:41.700
What dost thou, or whatart thou, Angelo?

490
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.530
Dost thou desire herfoully for those things

491
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:53.370
That make her good? O, lether brother live!

492
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.630
Thieves for their robberyhave authority

493
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:59.470
When judges stealthemselves.

494
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.730
What, do I love her,

495
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.730
That I desire to hear herspeak again,

496
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:13.170
And feast upon her eyes?

497
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:18.670
What is't I dream on?

498
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.730
O cunning enemy, that, tocatch a saint,

499
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:23.630
With saints dost bait thyhook!

500
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.100
Most dangerous is thattemptation that doth goad us on

501
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.270
To sin in loving virtue:never could the strumpet,

502
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.200
With all her doublevigour, art and nature,

503
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:36.530
Once stir my temper; butthis virtuous maid

504
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.630
Subdues me quite.

505
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.970
Even till now,

506
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:55.970
When men were fond, Ismiled and wonder'd how.

507
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.400
Bound by my charity and myblest order,

508
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.230
I come to visit theafflicted spirits

509
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.230
Here in the prison. Do methe common right

510
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:23.730
To let me see them and tomake me know

511
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.200
The nature of theircrimes,

512
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.270
that I may minister tothem accordingly.

513
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.400
I would do more than that,if more were needful.

514
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.630
Look, here's agentlewoman of mine,

515
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.800
Who, falling in the flawsof her own youth,

516
00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.900
Hath blister'd her report:she is with child;

517
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.430
And he that got it,sentenced;

518
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.100
a young man more fit to doanother such offence

519
00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.570
Than die for this.

520
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:46.930
When must he die?

521
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.430
As I do think, to-morrow.

522
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.670
I have provided for you:stay awhile,

523
00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.870
And you shall beconducted.

524
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.870
Repent you, fair one, ofthe sin you carry?

525
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.200
I do; and bear the shamemost patiently.

526
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.030
I'll teach you how you shallarraign your conscience,

527
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.100
And try your penitence, ifit be sound,

528
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.700
Or hollowly put on.

529
00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.470
I'll gladly learn.

530
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.100
Love you the man thatwrong'd you?

531
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.700
Yes, as I love the womanthat wrong'd him.

532
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.300
So then it seems your mostoffenceful act

533
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.930
Was mutually committed?

534
00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:27.270
Mutually.

535
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.930
Then was your sin ofheavier kind than his.

536
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.970
I do confess it, andrepent it, father.

537
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.330
'Tis meet so, daughter:but lest you do repent,

538
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.100
As that the sin hathbrought you to this shame,

539
00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.030
Which sorrow is always towardsourselves, not heaven,

540
00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:43.670
Showing we would not spareheaven as we love it,

541
00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:45.430
But as we stand in fear,

542
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.170
I do repent me, as it isan evil,

543
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.630
And take the shame withjoy.

544
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.670
There rest.

545
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.270
Your partner, as I hear,must die to-morrow,

546
00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:59.100
And I am going withinstruction to him.

547
00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.170
Grace go with you,Benedicite!

548
00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.700
Must die to-morrow! Oinjurious love,

549
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.370
That respites me a life,

550
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:20.900
whose very comfort isstill a dying horror!

551
00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:31.270
When I would pray andthink, I think and pray

552
00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:38.230
To several subjects. Heavenhath my empty words;

553
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.130
Whilst my invention,

554
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.500
hearing not my tongue,

555
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:50.170
Anchors on Isabel:

556
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:51.170
Heaven in my mouth,

557
00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:53.400
As if I did but only chewhis name;

558
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:59.070
And in my heart the strongand swelling evil

559
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:02.400
Of my conception.

560
00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.170
The state, whereon Istudied

561
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.500
Is like a good thing,being often read,

562
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:18.430
Grown fear'd and tedious;yea, my gravity,

563
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.130
Wherein--let no man hearme--I take pride,

564
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.500
Could I with boot changefor an idle plume,

565
00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:25.970
Which the air beats forvain.

566
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.930
O place, O form,

567
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.330
How often dost thou withthy case, thy habit,

568
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.230
Wrench awe from fools andtie the wiser souls

569
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:43.400
To thy false seeming!

570
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:49.400
Blood, thou art blood:

571
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.500
Let's write good angel onthe devil's horn:

572
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.400
'Tis not the devil'screst.

573
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.530
How now! who's there?

574
00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:04.570
One Isabel, a sister,desires access to you.

575
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.700
Teach her the way.

576
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:15.830
O heavens!

577
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.130
Why does my blood thusmuster to my heart,

578
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.570
Making both it unable foritself,

579
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.500
And dispossessing

580
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.970
all my other parts ofnecessary fitness?

581
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.500
So play the foolish throngswith one that swoons;

582
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.930
Come all to help him, andso stop the air

583
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:33.270
By which he should revive:

584
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.670
How now, fair maid?

585
00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:43.230
I am come to know yourpleasure.

586
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.070
That you might know it,

587
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:47.530
would much better please methan to demand what 'tis.

588
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:52.370
Your brother cannot live.

589
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:01.970
Even so. Heaven keep yourhonour!

590
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.730
Yet may he live awhile;and, it may be,

591
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:08.570
As long as you or I yet hemust die.

592
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.200
Under your sentence?

593
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.270
Yea.

594
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.600
When, I beseech you? thatin his reprieve,

595
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.830
Longer or shorter, he maybe so fitted

596
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.970
That his soul sicken not.

597
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:23.830
Ha! fie, these filthyvices!

598
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.100
It were as good to pardonhim

599
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.200
that hath from naturestolen

600
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.300
A man already made,

601
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.470
as to remit their saucysweetness

602
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.700
that do coin heaven'simage

603
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.230
In stamps that are forbid:

604
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:34.730
'tis all as easy

605
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.800
Falsely to take away alife true made

606
00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.230
As to put metal inrestrained means

607
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:40.070
To make a false one.

608
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.630
'Tis set down so inheaven, but not in earth.

609
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:46.630
Say you so? then I shallpose you quickly.

610
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.470
Which had you rather, thatthe most just law

611
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:54.570
Now took your brother'slife; or, to redeem him,

612
00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.270
Give up your body to suchsweet uncleanness

613
00:29:58.270 --> 00:30:00.230
As she that he hathstain'd?

614
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:01.170
Sir, believe this,

615
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.070
I had rather give my bodythan my soul.

616
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:08.700
I talk not of your soul:

617
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:09.600
our compell'd sins

618
00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.770
Stand more for number thanfor accompt.

619
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:12.670
How say you?

620
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.600
Nay, I'll not warrantthat;

621
00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.100
for I can speak againstthe thing I say.

622
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.630
Answer to this:

623
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.000
I, now the voice of therecorded law,

624
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.570
Pronounce a sentence onyour brother's life:

625
00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.500
Might there not be acharity in sin

626
00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.000
To save this brother's life?

627
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:30.970
Please you to do't,

628
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:32.700
I'll take it as a peril tomy soul,

629
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.130
It is no sin at all, butcharity.

630
00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.030
Pleased you to do't atperil of your soul,

631
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.070
Were equal poise of sinand charity.

632
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:42.000
That I do beg his life, ifit be sin,

633
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.970
Heaven let me bear it!

634
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:45.400
you granting of my suit,

635
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.000
If that be sin, I'll makeit my morn prayer

636
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.370
To have it added to thefaults of mine,

637
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:51.530
And nothing of youranswer.

638
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.570
Nay, but hear me.

639
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.070
Your sense pursues notmine:

640
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:58.070
either you are ignorant,

641
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:03.430
Or seem so craftily; andthat's not good.

642
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.200
Let me be ignorant, and innothing good,

643
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.470
But graciously to know Iam no better.

644
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.630
Thus wisdom wishes toappear most bright

645
00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.170
When it doth tax itself;

646
00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:12.170
as these black masks

647
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.530
Proclaim an enshieldbeauty ten times louder

648
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.800
Than beauty could,display'd.

649
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.430
But mark me;

650
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:24.130
To be received plain, I'llspeak more gross:

651
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:27.870
Your brother is to die.

652
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:30.070
So.

653
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.730
And his offence is so, asit appears,

654
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:36.100
Accountant to the law uponthat pain.

655
00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.170
True.

656
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.430
Admit no other way to savehis life,--

657
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.170
As I subscribe not that,nor any other,

658
00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.070
But in the loss ofquestion,

659
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.000
--that you, his sister,

660
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.900
Finding yourself desiredof such a person,

661
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.500
Whose credit with thejudge, or own great place,

662
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.430
Could fetch your brotherfrom the manacles

663
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.070
Of the all-building law;

664
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.270
and that there were noearthly mean to save him,

665
00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.130
but that either you mustlay down

666
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:02.500
the treasures of your body

667
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.570
To this supposed, or elseto let him suffer;

668
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:12.300
What would you do?

669
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.970
As much for my poorbrother as myself:

670
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.570
That is, were I under theterms of death,

671
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.530
The impression of keenwhips I'ld wear as rubies,

672
00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:24.600
And strip myself to death,as to a bed

673
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.130
That longing have beensick for,

674
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.400
ere I'ld yield my body upto shame.

675
00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.430
Then must your brotherdie.

676
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.070
And 'twere the cheaperway:

677
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.000
Better it were a brotherdied at once,

678
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.400
Than that a sister, byredeeming him,

679
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.070
Should die for ever.

680
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.670
Were not you then as cruelas the sentence

681
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.630
That you have slander'dso?

682
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.030
Ignomy in ransom and freepardon

683
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.370
Are of two houses:

684
00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.700
lawful mercy is nothingkin to foul redemption.

685
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.470
You seem'd of late to makethe law a tyrant;

686
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:52.300
And rather proved thesliding of your brother

687
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.030
A merriment than a vice.

688
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.800
O, pardon me, my lord; itoft falls out,

689
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.170
To have what we would have,we speak not what we mean:

690
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.370
I something do excuse thething I hate,

691
00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:08.170
For his advantage that Idearly love.

692
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:13.130
We are all frail.

693
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:17.500
Nay, women are frail too.

694
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.570
Ay, as the glasses wherethey view themselves;

695
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:25.970
Which are as easy broke asthey make forms.

696
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.370
Women! Help Heaven!

697
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.830
men their creation mar inprofiting by them.

698
00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.430
Nay, call us ten timesfrail;

699
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.400
For we are soft as ourcomplexions are,

700
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.570
And credulous to falseprints.

701
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:40.270
I think it well:

702
00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.530
And from this testimony ofyour own sex,--

703
00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.570
Since I suppose we aremade to be no stronger

704
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:51.100
Than faults may shake ourframes,--let me be bold;

705
00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:57.300
Be that you are, That is,a woman;

706
00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.500
if you be more, you'renone;

707
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.270
If you be one, as you arewell express'd

708
00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.270
By all external warrants,show it now,

709
00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:11.470
By putting on the destinedlivery.

710
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:15.470
I have no tongue but one:gentle my lord,

711
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.700
Let me entreat you speakthe former language.

712
00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:26.300
Plainly conceive, I loveyou.

713
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.730
My brother did loveJuliet,

714
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:30.530
And you tell me that heshall die for it.

715
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:38.900
He shall not, Isabel, ifyou give me love.

716
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:45.570
I know your virtue hath alicence in't,

717
00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.370
Which seems a littlefouler than it is,

718
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:48.400
To pluck on others.

719
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:53.600
Believe me, on minehonour,

720
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.830
My words express mypurpose.

721
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:06.970
Ha! little honour to bemuch believed,

722
00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:18.330
And most perniciouspurpose! Seeming, seeming!

723
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:21.870
I will proclaim thee,Angelo; look for't:

724
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:24.100
Sign me a present pardonfor my brother,

725
00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.370
Or with an outstretch'dthroat

726
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:30.770
I'll tell the world aloudwhat man thou art.

727
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:35.070
Who will believe thee,Isabel?

728
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:39.930
My unsoil'd name, theaustereness of my life,

729
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:42.300
My vouch against you, andmy place i' the state,

730
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.630
Will so your accusationoverweigh,

731
00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.670
That you shall stifle inyour own report

732
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:48.670
And smell of calumny.

733
00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.970
I have begun,

734
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:55.100
And now I give my sensualrace the rein:

735
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.800
Fit thy consent to mysharp appetite;

736
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.170
Lay by all nicety andprolixious blushes,

737
00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.800
That banish what they suefor;

738
00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.030
redeem thy brother

739
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.300
By yielding up thy body tomy will;

740
00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.500
Or else he must not onlydie the death,

741
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.730
But thy unkindness shallhis death draw out

742
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:14.830
To lingering sufferance.

743
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.830
Answer me to-morrow,

744
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.370
Or, by the affection thatnow guides me most,

745
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:27.730
I'll prove a tyrant tohim.

746
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:34.970
As for you, say what youcan,

747
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:40.700
my false o'erweighs yourtrue.

748
00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.400
To whom should I complain?Did I tell this,

749
00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:01.900
Who would believe me? Operilous mouths,

750
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.670
That bear in them one andthe self-same tongue,

751
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:08.630
Either of condemnation orapproof;

752
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:13.330
Bidding the law makecourt'sy to their will:

753
00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:16.100
Hooking both right andwrong to the appetite,

754
00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:22.070
To follow as it draws!

755
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.230
I'll to my brother:

756
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.870
Though he hath fallen byprompture of the blood,

757
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.130
Yet hath he in him such amind of honour.

758
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.630
That, had he twenty headsto tender down

759
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.900
On twenty bloody blocks,he'ld yield them up,

760
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:42.100
Before his sister shouldher body stoop

761
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:49.430
To such abhorr'dpollution.

762
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:57.430
Then, Isabel, live chaste,and, brother, die:

763
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:06.570
More than our brother isour chastity.

764
00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:10.100
I'll tell him yet ofAngelo's request,

765
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:16.970
And fit his mind to death,for his soul's rest.

766
00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:32.570
