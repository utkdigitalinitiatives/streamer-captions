00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.792
(slow tempo music)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.582
- The Fertile Crescent is
known in history to have hosted

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.667
some of the world's
greatest civilizations.

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.999
Babylonian, Assyrian ,
Egyptian, and Phoenician.

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:46.999
It's also aptly named
because its soil,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.000
enriched by the flowing waters
of the Tigris and Euphrates,

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:56.500
gave birth to some of the
world's ancient and best crops,

00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:00.166
such as barley, wheat,
lentils, and even peas.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:05.125
Also originating from
the Fertile Crescent

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.125
is the ancient spelt.

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:11.083
Spelt is believed to be the
ancestor specie of modern wheat

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:16.458
and has been cultivated since
the fifth millennium BC.

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:20.999
Ancient spelt is considered
the parent of modern wheat.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.500
How then did spelt come to be?

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.083
The most commonly known
theory is that spelt

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.041
was a result of hybridization
some 8,000 years ago

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:34.000
between another ancient
grain called emmer

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:38.125
and a wild goatgrass known
as aegilops squarrosa.

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:43.125
There are other archeological
data supporting a claim that

00:01:43.417 --> 00:01:47.458
Europe also cultivated spelt
simultaneously with the near

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.250
east except that recent DNA
evidence shows that spelt,

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:55.959
originating from Europe, was
a result of cross- pollination

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:59.458
between emmer and bread wheat.

00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.542
Spelt eventually spread to
central Europe during the

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.667
Bronze Age and then travelled
to other countries like

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:12.125
Switzerland and Germany
during the Iron Age.

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:16.959
In Germany, old records
dating back to 1850 show that

00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:24.250
more than 90% of its
agricultural lands
were growing spelt

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:28.999
and only 5% was
growing bread wheat.

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.999
Spelt stayed an
important grain in Europe

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.458
until Middle Ages and
finally crossed the seas

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:40.999
all the way to the United
States in the 1890's.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:45.999
Spelt grows from 1.4
to 1.7 meters tall

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.000
and has secondary stems.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.667
Its leaves are long, narrow,

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:54.999
and with few to almost
no hairs at all.

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.458
It has long, thin,
and brittle spikes.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:02.125
The spikelets contain
up to six flowers

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.458
that can produce two seeds
after self-pollination.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:09.250
These seeds are
protected by hulls,

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.667
thus they're commonly
called hulled seeds

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:15.458
during harvest time.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:17.667
Spelt is tolerant of
low fertility soils.

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:21.125
As a matter of fact, it
thrives well on sandy soils.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:25.875
It can be grown in
low temperature areas

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.999
and is less sensitive
to cold and snow.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:32.625
Altitude is also not a
problem because it's possible

00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:36.125
to plant spelt at 1,200
meters above sea level.

00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:41.125
Spelt is a low-yielding crop,

00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:43.999
meaning its total harvest
is less than other crops.

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:48.125
There's a positive
side to this attribute.

00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:50.875
As a low-yielding crop, it
can survive with minimal

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:54.458
or even without fertilizers,
even on less healthy soils.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:59.458
Another standout attribute of
spelt is its very thick husk.

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:04.667
Not only does the husk
protect the grain from frost,

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.834
it also protects it from
pollutants and insects.

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.999
Removing the husk requires
longer post-harvest processing,

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.999
so some producers keep the
husk intact during transport,

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:19.999
which in turn maintains
the grain's freshness

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.458
for a longer period of time.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.625
Spelt is both a winter
and summer crop.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:29.125
In Europe, it's sown
as a winter crop.

00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.999
While in the United
States and Canada,

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:34.125
it's sown as a summer crop.

00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:37.333
Spelt was forgotten at
some point in history

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.999
due to the introduction
of other grains

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.125
that have higher yields
and are easier to process

00:04:45.291 --> 00:04:48.125
for commercial
production purposes.

00:04:48.291 --> 00:04:51.750
Spelt survived in small
areas and villages in Europe

00:04:51.917 --> 00:04:54.999
and the near east and is
now gaining more recognition

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:58.834
for its nutritional value.

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.750
In the early years
of the 20th century,

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:21.417
Spelt started to lose its luster

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:23.667
when farmers were introduced
to its higher-yielding

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:26.667
and easier to process
wheat relative.

00:05:26.834 --> 00:05:29.999
Since then spelt has
remained in obscurity,

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:33.999
which is a shame because
spelt has a lot to offer.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.667
If spelt is basically the
older version of wheat,

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:43.667
how do they differ
from each other?

00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:46.041
Aside from the obvious
distinctions in
their appearances,

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:49.458
DNA profiles and genetic makeup,

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:52.458
they also have different
nutritional profiles.

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.834
Let's break down its nutrient,
mineral, and vitamin content.

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:59.999
100 grams of uncooked spelt

00:06:00.208 --> 00:06:02.000
contains the
following nutrients.

00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:04.875
70 grams of Carbohydrates,
11 grams of Fiber,

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.125
15 grams of Protein
and 15 grams of Sodium.

00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:14.000
It's packed with the
following minerals.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.834
388 grams of Potassium,
4.44 milligrams of Iron,

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:22.834
136 milligrams of Magnesium,
401 milligrams of Phosphorus

00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:29.125
and 3.28 milligrams of Zinc.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:34.999
It has the following vitamins.

00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:37.458
.36 milligrams of
Thiamin or Vitamin B1,

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:41.667
.113 rams of Riboflavin
or Vitamin B2,

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:46.458
6.8 milligrams of
Niacin or Vitamin B3,

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:50.875
45 micrograms of
Folate or Vitamin B9.

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:54.458
and .79 milligrams of Vitamin E.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:58.083
Because of its high
fiber content, it is
easier for the body

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.834
to digest and absorb
its nutrients,
vitamins, and minerals.

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:06.291
The fiber also helps
prevent constipation,

00:07:06.458 --> 00:07:09.417
thus making toxin elimination
faster and easier.

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:14.417
Spelt can also help reduce
risks of type 2 diabetes.

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:18.125
or other insulin
resistant diseases.

00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:21.458
The combined powers of its
fiber, magnesium, and Vitamin E,

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:25.999
help enzymes facilitate
better secretion rate

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:28.834
of glucose in the body.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:31.458
A special carbohydrate
called mucopolysaccharides

00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:36.458
is present in spelt.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.500
It's a long chain of hundreds
of glucose molecules,

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.999
which has a slow digestion
rate compared to carbohydrates

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.125
from refined grains.

00:07:45.291 --> 00:07:47.999
Since it digests slowly,

00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:51.999
the body gets packed with
energy for longer periods.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.667
It is said that
ancient German warriors

00:07:56.834 --> 00:07:59.125
and Roman legionnaires
ate spelt for endurance.

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.667
The mucopolysaccharides
also have anti-inflammatory

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:06.458
properties that can
keep bones, joints,

00:08:06.625 --> 00:08:09.458
and cartilage healthy.

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:12.542
Spelt also has an excellent
amino acid profile.

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:16.125
It's comparable to
that of wheat's.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:19.750
Spelt is believed to
promote good dispositions

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:22.125
and positive emotions
because of the amino acids,

00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:26.125
phenylalanine and tryptophan.

00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:29.542
These amino acids produce
dopamine and serotonin ,

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:33.125
two neurotransmitters that help

00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:35.625
the brain control
mood and behavior.

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:38.999
Lately, people have been
rating a food's health value

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.083
based on its bioavailability.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.834
Bioavailability pertains
to the amount or percentage

00:08:44.999 --> 00:08:48.125
of nutrients the body
actually digests, absorbs,

00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:51.834
and assimilates into its system.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:54.999
Spelt is said to have high
bioavailability ratings.

00:08:54.999 --> 00:08:59.667
The body doesn't need
to dispense more energy

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.999
just to ensure that spelt's
nutrients find their respective

00:09:03.999 --> 00:09:06.999
places within the system.

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:09.458
Unlike quinoa and
amaranth, spelt has gluten.

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:16.500
People prone to allergies and
other wheat-related conditions

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:20.125
such as gluten sensitive and
tauopathies and celiac sprues

00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:24.834
must first seek medical
advice before including spelt

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.999
in their diets.

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:29.999
Spelt may not be gluten-free,
but its gluten has a more

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:33.417
fragile composition
compared to wheats,

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:36.083
meaning spelt's gluten
can be easily broken down

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.417
by its high fiber content.

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:42.125
Modern wheat may out win
spelt in some aspects,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.999
but because spelt is
still a whole grain

00:09:47.999 --> 00:09:50.625
and has valuable
properties of its own,

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:52.834
it is possible that these two
will find themselves competing

00:09:52.999 --> 00:09:56.458
side by side in the whole
grains sections of supermarkets

00:09:56.625 --> 00:10:00.625
in the years to come.

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:02.999
There are certain grains in
history that enjoyed profound

00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:22.333
respect from the peoples
of early civilizations.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.667
The Chinese considered
millet a sacred crop.

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:06.999
The Mayans believed that humans
were fashioned from maize.

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:13.917
The Aztecs used amaranth in
their religious activities.

00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:21.750
Spelt, on the other hand, did
not experience such veneration

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:27.999
during the early times.

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:30.667
It was associated
with the poor populace

00:11:30.834 --> 00:11:33.083
as a staple food for peasants.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.834
This image of spelt has been
immortalized in literature.

00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:40.834
In a Russian tale titled

00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:49.125
The Tale of the Priest
and His Workman Balda

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.250
written by Alexander Pushkin,

00:11:52.417 --> 00:11:54.667
a poor peasant named
Balda agreed to work
for a mean priest.

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:59.000
His only pay was that
he would be allowed

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:01.208
to hit the priest
three times on the head

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:04.041
and that he is to be
fed with boiled spelt.

00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:07.834
Not a lot of Russian kids
today may know what spelt is,

00:12:07.999 --> 00:12:10.999
but they are familiar with
its social significance

00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:13.834
through stories like this.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:16.250
Another story in literature

00:12:25.583 --> 00:12:27.250
that uses spelt
as an image device

00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:29.625
to establish distinction
between the rich and the poor,

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:32.999
rural living and
urban lifestyle,

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:35.250
is found in the
second book of Satires

00:12:35.417 --> 00:12:37.834
by the roman poet, Horace.

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:40.625
He ended Satire 6 with a
story of the country mouse

00:12:40.792 --> 00:12:44.417
and city mouse where the
country mouse served spelt

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:47.834
when the city mouse
visited him in his cave.

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:51.041
The city mouse invited
the country mouse

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:54.208
to try the urban life.

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:56.208
But there, they were
met with a large dog

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.834
and the country mouse realized
that he had a good life

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:01.999
in his cage eating spelt

00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:04.999
Literature may have
cemented spelt's image

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:18.583
as a peasant food, but during
the Middle Ages in Germany,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.834
there was a nun who saw spelt
in a whole different light.

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:27.208
St. Hildegard von
Bingen, born in 1098 AD

00:13:27.375 --> 00:13:31.999
was a known visionary,
musician, mystic, and herbalist.

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:36.834
She was a famous pioneer
of holistic healing.

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:40.458
Aside from writing nearly
2,000 natural remedies,

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:44.166
she also strongly promoted
spelt's medicinal benefits

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:48.041
because she believed that the
grain created a healthy body,

00:13:48.208 --> 00:13:51.834
good blood, and a happy mind.

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:54.417
She actually called spelt
"The Queen of Cereals".

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:59.417
Spelt has a chance to redeem
itself to show the modern world

00:14:18.208 --> 00:14:22.375
that it deserves to be seen
from a whole new prospective.

00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:26.250
From being a grain of the past,

00:14:26.417 --> 00:14:28.375
spelt has qualities that can
make it a grain of the future.

00:14:28.542 --> 00:14:33.166
It's unfortunate to see how
the gems of the ancient world

00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:32.583
had to suffer demise at
the hands of modernization,

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.250
even spelt wasn't spared.

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:39.542
Along with the advent
of the 20th century,

00:15:50.917 --> 00:15:53.834
were modern practices that
revolutionized agriculture.

00:15:53.999 --> 00:15:58.834
With the introduction of
grain varieties and hybrids

00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:09.417
that have higher yields and
easier handling requirements,

00:16:09.583 --> 00:16:13.208
spelt had to step aside and
give away to its modern cousin

00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:17.208
wheat until eventually no one
was cultivating spelt anymore.

00:16:17.375 --> 00:16:22.208
The 1960's and 1970's saw the
rise of various environment

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:28.999
movements which then led to
the organic food movement

00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:32.625
in the 1990's.

00:16:32.792 --> 00:16:34.834
Because of this more people
have become interested

00:16:34.999 --> 00:16:37.999
in organic gardening and
community-based agriculture

00:16:37.999 --> 00:16:41.250
to grow fruits, vegetables
and whole grains.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.999
It's fortunate that this has
sparked a renewed interest

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:47.999
in old grains including spelt.

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:51.999
Spelt is still not
as popular as wheat

00:16:55.959 --> 00:16:58.667
and it's more expensive.

00:16:58.834 --> 00:17:01.208
While most grains
are self-threshing,

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:03.834
spelt needs to be
mechanically dehulled,

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:06.834
adding more manufacturing
steps before it can be milled.

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:10.834
This post-harvest dilemma,

00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:12.667
plus the fact that
it's low-yielding,

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:14.999
easily discourages
a lot of farmers

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:17.250
to commit to cultivating it.

00:17:17.417 --> 00:17:20.417
Spelt's fall into obscurity
can now be considered

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:24.999
its greatest advantage.

00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:27.999
Unlike some grains
that have been subject

00:17:27.999 --> 00:17:30.500
to hybridization and
genetic experimentation,

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:33.999
spelt was able to dodge
biological modifications

00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:37.625
Thus it was able to
retain the integrity

00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:40.208
of its ancient composition.

00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:42.959
Spelt is used as a substitute
for modern common wheat flour

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.250
in making pasta, breads,
cookies, muffins,

00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:52.250
pancakes, and cereal.

00:17:52.417 --> 00:17:55.208
Due to the rising
demand for whole grains,

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:58.083
spelt is slowly gaining
a strong foothold

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.834
in mainstream markets.

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:03.458
For example in Britain,
breads, cookies, and pasta

00:18:04.458 --> 00:18:08.667
made from whole grain
spelt flour are sold

00:18:08.834 --> 00:18:11.041
in health food shops
and specialty bakeries.

00:18:11.208 --> 00:18:15.583
In southern Germany and
southwestern Poland,

00:18:16.083 --> 00:18:20.208
spelt is still produced, where
it is usually kiln dried,

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:23.999
giving it a green color.

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:26.041
These green kernels
called gruenkern

00:18:26.208 --> 00:18:29.125
are used in baked
goods and soups.

00:18:29.291 --> 00:18:32.999
Spelt is also a
famous traditional
ingredient for brewing

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:37.166
beer and vodka especially
in European countries

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:40.834
such as Belgium,
Germany, and Poland.

00:18:40.999 --> 00:18:44.999
It is also a
traditional animal feed,

00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:49.625
especially in Europe
and North America.

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:52.208
The seeds are first ground
or milled before use.

00:18:52.375 --> 00:18:56.208
It's usually a feed
grain substitute for
oats during Spring

00:18:56.375 --> 00:19:00.458
when oats are not easily grown.

00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:03.667
While spelt has a similar
feed value to that of oats,

00:19:03.834 --> 00:19:07.999
it is, however, higher in
yield and protein content.

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:11.875
Data on production and
consumption of spelt

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:14.667
is still scarce today.

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:16.999
Its total statistics
is too small

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:19.208
to have any significant
impact in any local market,

00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:22.834
let alone in the
global grain industry.

00:19:22.999 --> 00:19:25.667
That's why it just falls under
the category "other grains"

00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:29.875
where it shares data
with other lesser grains.

00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:34.458
Things look promising for spelt

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.999
as it continues to garner
more interest from people

00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:44.583
who are in search of
alternative foods,

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.208
heirloomed varieties or
organic grain products.

00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:52.083
It may be true that spelt
was a poor man's grain

00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:21.458
during the Middle Ages,

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:23.333
but that doesn't mean that
it should still suffer

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.000
that same reputation
in modern times.

00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:30.417
As a matter of fact,

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:31.709
it has great odds of
rivaling modern wheat

00:20:31.875 --> 00:20:34.709
due to its excellent
nutrient profile,

00:20:34.875 --> 00:20:37.208
and not to mention its
exciting flavor and texture.

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:41.625
For example, wheat tends
to harden when cooked.

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:44.999
Spelt, however, becomes
crisp without being hard.

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:49.500
Like Barley, it's
chewy and sweet,

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:52.208
but doesn't feel
slimy when eaten.

00:20:52.375 --> 00:20:55.999
You can vary spelt's texture,

00:20:55.999 --> 00:20:57.834
depending on the manner of
preparation and cooking.

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:01.667
First, here are some
general cooking tips.

00:21:01.834 --> 00:21:05.250
Rinse spelt under running water.

00:21:05.417 --> 00:21:08.208
Make sure to remove any debris.

00:21:08.375 --> 00:21:11.041
Then for easier and
faster cooking time,

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.999
soak it for eight hours
or even overnight.

00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:17.417
Before cooking, drain the
water and rinse it again.

00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:21.667
For a soft and fluffy
texture like steamed rice,

00:21:21.834 --> 00:21:25.291
cook 1 cup of spelt
in 3 cups of water.

00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:28.834
Simmer for one a a half hours.

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:32.208
Here are two
recipes you can try.

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.875
The first is called
Spelt Tomato Soup.

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:37.834
For the spelt tomato soup,
prepare the following.

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:41.125
1 cup of spelt, 2
1/2 - 3 cups of water

00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:45.834
4 tablespoons of
extra virgin olive oil

00:21:45.999 --> 00:21:48.667
1 can of chopped tomatoes,
500 grams of cherry tomatoes

00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:53.667
2 sprigs of basil, 3 garlic
cloves (peeled and smashed)

00:21:54.291 --> 00:21:59.125
salt and pepper to taste

00:21:59.959 --> 00:22:02.667
First, cook spelt in boiling
water for 30 - 40 minutes

00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:06.999
or until tender, set aside.

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:10.999
Second, in a large saucepan,

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:13.208
put the olive oil and
the canned tomatoes.

00:22:13.375 --> 00:22:16.500
Add the cherry tomatoes,
basil, and garlic.

00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:20.041
Bring it to a boil and
simmer for 30 minutes.

00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:23.667
Let it cool for awhile.

00:22:23.834 --> 00:22:25.999
Lastly, put the cooked spelt
into the tomato mixture.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.041
You can adjust its
thickness by adding water.

00:22:32.417 --> 00:22:36.667
Season with salt and pepper.

00:22:36.834 --> 00:22:40.291
For the Spelt Summer Salad,

00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:45.208
you need the
following ingredients.

00:22:45.375 --> 00:22:47.667
1 1/2 cups of whole grain
spelt, 4 1/2 cups of water

00:22:47.834 --> 00:22:52.667
1/4 cup chopped red onion, 1
1/2 cups halved cherry tomatoes

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:57.834
1 cup chopped cucumber,
1 cup halved black olives

00:22:59.834 --> 00:23:04.667
1 tablespoon of white
balsamic vinegar

00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:07.458
1 tablespoon of olive oil

00:23:07.625 --> 00:23:10.625
1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese.

00:23:10.792 --> 00:23:13.834
In a large pot, put
spelt and water.

00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:16.917
Bring it to a boil then simmer
uncovered for about 1 minute

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:21.458
or until the water is absorbed
and the spelt is tender.

00:23:21.625 --> 00:23:25.625
Then drain it, rinse
with cold water

00:23:25.792 --> 00:23:28.250
and refrigerate for
at least 30 minutes.

00:23:28.417 --> 00:23:31.250
For the dressing, in a bowl,

00:23:31.417 --> 00:23:33.250
whisk together the
balsamic vinegar and oil.

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:36.208
To serve, in a large
serving bowl, put the spelt

00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:39.875
and toss in the red onion,
cherry tomatoes, cucumbers,

00:23:39.999 --> 00:23:43.999
and olives, then drizzle
the dressing all over.

00:23:43.999 --> 00:23:48.999
Because spelt's
production ceased in
the early 20th century,

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.041
it is relatively new to
a lot of people today.

00:23:53.208 --> 00:23:57.083
Thanks to the global
movement towards

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.000
healthier and
greener lifestyles,

00:23:59.166 --> 00:24:01.250
spelt is very fortunate to
be given another chance.

00:24:01.417 --> 00:24:05.458
This time to impress
the modern world.
