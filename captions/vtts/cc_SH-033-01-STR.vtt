00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:51.530


2
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.900
Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?

3
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.130
Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France

4
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.670
In my behavior to the majesty,

5
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.000
The borrow'd majesty, of England here.

6
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.200
A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'

7
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.930
Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.

8
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.970
Philip of France, in right and true behalf

9
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.600
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,

10
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.400
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim

11
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.700
To this fair island and the territories,

12
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.430
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,

13
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.670
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword

14
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.870
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,

15
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.270
And put these same into young Arthur's hand,

16
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.400
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.

17
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.200
What follows if we disallow of this?

18
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.300
The proud control of fierce and bloody war,

19
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.070
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.

20
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.070
Here have we war for war and blood for blood,

21
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.870
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.

22
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.630
Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,

23
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.070
The farthest limit of my embassy.

24
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.300
Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:

25
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.430
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;

26
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.700
For ere thou canst report I will be there,

27
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.900
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:

28
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.070
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath

29
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.630
And sullen presage of your own decay.

30
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.130
An honourable conduct let him have:

31
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.700
Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.

32
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.800
What now, my son! have I not ever said

33
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.970
How that ambitious Constance would not cease

34
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.630
Till she had kindled France and all the world,

35
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.170
Upon the right and party of her son?

36
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.200
This might have been prevented and made whole

37
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.070
With very easy arguments of love,

38
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.730
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must

39
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.030
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

40
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.130
Our strong possession and our right for us.

41
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.800
Your strong possession much more than your right,

42
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.930
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:

43
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.670
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,

44
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.370
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.

45
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.030
My liege, here is the strangest controversy

46
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.530
Come from country to be judged by you,

47
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.400
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?

48
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.630
Let them approach.

49
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.730
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay

50
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.000
This expedition's charge.

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.930
What men are you?

52
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.730
Your faithful subject I, a gentleman

53
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.870
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,

54
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.070
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,

55
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.330
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand

56
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.300
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.

57
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.330
What art thou?

58
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.130
The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.

59
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.700
Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?

60
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.000
You came not of one mother then, it seems.

61
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.070
Most certain of one mother, mighty king;

62
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.800
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:

63
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.170
But for the certain knowledge of that truth

64
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.330
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:

65
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.170
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.

66
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.900
Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother

67
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.870
And wound her honour with this diffidence.

68
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.900
I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;

69
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.330
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;

70
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.330
The which if he can prove, a' pops me out

71
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.330
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:

72
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.570
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!

73
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.230
A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,

74
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.030
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?

75
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.570
I know not why, except to get the land.

76
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.070
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:

77
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.570
But whether I be as true begot or no,

78
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.900
That still I lay upon my mother's head,

79
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.470
But that I am as well begot, my liege,--

80
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.130
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--

81
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.800
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.

82
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.630
If old sir Robert did beget us both

83
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.130
And were our father and this son like him,

84
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.430
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee

85
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.870
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!

86
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.730
Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!

87
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.030
He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;

88
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.530
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.

89
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.530
Do you not read some tokens of my son

90
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.930
In the large composition of this man?

91
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.030
Mine eye hath well examined his parts

92
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.230
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,

93
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:07.370
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?

94
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.400
Because he hath a half-face, like my father.

95
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.700
With half that face would he have all my land:

96
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.000
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!

97
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.400
My gracious liege, when that my father lived,

98
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.030
Your brother did employ my father much,--

99
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.530
Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:

100
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.030
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.

101
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.670
And once dispatch'd him in an embassy

102
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.370
To Germany, there with the emperor

103
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.000
To treat of high affairs touching that time.

104
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.970
The advantage of his absence took the king

105
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.670
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;

106
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.100
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,

107
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.230
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores

108
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.700
Between my father and my mother lay,

109
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.630
As I have heard my father speak himself,

110
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.400
When this same lusty gentleman was got.

111
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.500
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd

112
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.600
His lands to me, and took it on his death

113
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.530
That this my mother's son was none of his;

114
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.100
And if he were, he came into the world

115
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.700
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.

116
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.430
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,

117
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.600
My father's land, as was my father's will.

118
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.730
Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;

119
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.800
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,

120
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.870
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;

121
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.870
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands

122
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.570
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,

123
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.400
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,

124
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.600
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?

125
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.700
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept

126
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.530
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;

127
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.470
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,

128
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.430
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,

129
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.700
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;

130
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.930
My mother's son did get your father's heir;

131
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.230
Your father's heir must have your father's land.

132
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.300
Shall then my father's will be of no force

133
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.830
To dispossess that child which is not his?

134
00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.230
Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,

135
00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.200
Than was his will to get me, as I think.

136
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.230
Sirrah, whether thou hadst rather be a Faulconbridge

137
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.300
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,

138
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.700
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,

139
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.900
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?

140
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.700
Madam, an if my brother had my shape,

141
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.400
And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;

142
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.230
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,

143
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.800
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin

144
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.500
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose

145
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.700
Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'

146
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.170
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,

147
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.300
Would I might never stir from off this place,

148
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.600
I would give it every foot to have this face;

149
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.900
I would not be sir Nob in any case.

150
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.630
I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,

151
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.200
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?

152
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.870
I am a soldier and now bound to France.

153
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.970
Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.

154
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.700
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,

155
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.830
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.

156
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.000
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.

157
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.170
Nay, I would have you go before me thither.

158
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.500
Our country manners give our betters way.

159
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.930
What is thy name?

160
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.130
Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,

161
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:18.130
Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.

162
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.870
From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:

163
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:26.070
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,

164
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.770
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.

165
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.430
Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:

166
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:47.570
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.

167
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.770
Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,

168
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.030
When I was got, sir Robert was away!

169
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.100
The very spirit of Plantagenet!

170
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.500
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.

171
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.100
Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?

172
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.170
Something about, a little from the right,

173
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.470
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:

174
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.030
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,

175
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.100
And have is have, however men do catch:

176
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.230
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,

177
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.900
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.

178
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.630
Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;

179
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.570
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.

180
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:31.030
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed

181
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:34.130
For France, for France, for it is more than need.

182
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:45.870
Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!

183
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.470
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.

184
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.630
A foot of honour better than I was;

185
00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:05.070
But many a many foot of land the worse.

186
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.270
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.

187
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.970
'Good den, sir Richard!' 'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--

188
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.130
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;

189
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.830
For new-made honour doth forget men's names;

190
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.300
'Tis too respective and too sociable

191
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.770
For your conversion. Now your traveller,

192
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.330
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,

193
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.900
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,

194
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.600
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise

195
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:34.100
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'

196
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.330
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,

197
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;

198
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.070
And then comes answer like an Absey book:

199
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.900
'O sir, at your best command' says answer;

200
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.830
At your service; at your employment sir;

201
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.500
'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'

202
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.770
And so, ere answer knows what question would,

203
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.870
Saving in dialogue of compliment,

204
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.470
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,

205
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.200
The Pyrenean and the river Po,

206
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:07.230
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.

207
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:13.000
But this is worshipful society

208
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.230
And fits the mounting spirit like myself,

209
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.630
For he is but a bastard to the time

210
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.930
That doth not smack of observation;

211
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.000
And so am I, whether I smack or no;

212
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.670
And not alone in habit and device,

213
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.700
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,

214
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.300
But from the inward motion to deliver

215
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.430
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:

216
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.400
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,

217
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.500
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;

218
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.800
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.

219
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.400
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?

220
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.870
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband

221
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:59.630
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?

222
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:07.700
O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!

223
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.970
What brings you here to court so hastily?

224
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:13.370
Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,

225
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.570
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?

226
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.470
My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?

227
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.530
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?

228
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.270
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?

229
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.500
Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,

230
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.270
Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?

231
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:31.670
He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.

232
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.030
James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?

233
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.170
Good leave, good Philip.

234
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.230
(laughs) Sparrow: James,

235
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.570
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.

236
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.170
Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:

237
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.570
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me

238
00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.270
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:

239
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.870
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,

240
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:01.000
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:

241
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.930
We know his handiwork: then, good my mother,

242
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:07.900
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?

243
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.800
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.

244
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.930
Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,

245
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.430
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?

246
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.200
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?

247
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.030
Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.

248
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.500
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.

249
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:35.070
(laughing) But, madam, I was not old sir Robert's son;

250
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.130
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;

251
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.230
Legitimation, name and all is gone:

252
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.970
Then, good my mother, let me know my father;

253
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:51.370
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?

254
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.530
Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?

255
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.970
As faithfully as I deny the devil.

256
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.070
King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:

257
00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.730
By long and vehement suit I was seduced

258
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.730
To make room for him in my husband's bed:

259
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.030
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!

260
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.430
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,

261
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.100
Which was so strongly urged past my defence.

262
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.470
Now, by this light, were I to get again,

263
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.500
Madam, I would not wish a better father.

264
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.170
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,

265
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.630
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:

266
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:46.400
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,

267
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.630
Subjected tribute to commanding love,

268
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.070
Against whose fury and unmatched force

269
00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.630
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,

270
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.170
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.

271
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.370
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts

272
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:04.630
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,

273
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.700
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!

274
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.100
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well

275
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.100
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.

276
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:20.300
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;

277
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.900
And they shall say, when Richard me begot,

278
00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:27.500
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:

279
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:33.870
Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.

280
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.930
