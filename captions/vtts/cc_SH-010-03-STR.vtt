00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.130


2
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.600
Save thee, friend,and thy music:

3
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.270
dost thou live by thy tabour?

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.630
No, sir, I live by thechurch.

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.800
Art thou a churchman?

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.730
No such matter, sir: Ido live by the church;

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.270
for I do live at my house,

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.030
and my house dothstand by the church.

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.870
Art not thou theLady Olivia's fool?

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.530
No, indeed, sir; the LadyOlivia has no folly:

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.100
she will keep no fool,sir, till she be married;

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.200
and fools are as like husbandsas pilchards are to herrings;

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.730
the husband's the bigger:I am indeed not her fool,

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.830
but her corrupter of words.

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.100
I saw thee late at theCount Orsino's.

16
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.700
Foolery, sir, does walkabout the orb like the sun,

17
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.130
it shines every where.I would be sorry, sir,

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.700
but the fool should be as oft

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
with your master aswith my mistress:

20
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.870
I think I saw yourwisdom there.

21
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.300
Nay, an thou pass upon me,I'll no more with thee.

22
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.600
Hold, there's expenses forthee.

23
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.000
Now Jove, in his nextcommodity of hair,

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.070
send thee a beard!

25
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.800
By my troth, I'll tell thee,I am almost sick for one;

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.470
though I would not have it growon my chin. Is thy lady within?

27
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.900
Would not a pair of thesehave bred, sir?

28
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.300
Yes, being kept togetherand put to use.

29
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.500
I would play Lord Pandarusof Phrygia, sir,

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.430
to bring a Cressidato this Troilus.

31
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.070
I understand you, sir;'tis well begged.

32
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.770
The matter, I hope,is not great, sir,

33
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.130
begging but a beggar:Cressida was a beggar.

34
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.900
My lady is within, sir.

35
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.170
I will construe tothem whence you come;

36
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.470
who you are and what youwould are out of my welkin,

37
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.470
I might say 'element,' butthe word is over-worn.

38
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.270
This fellow is wise enoughto play the fool;

39
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.030
And to do that well cravesa kind of wit:

40
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.000
He must observe their moodon whom he jests,

41
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600
The quality of persons,and the time,

42
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.530
And, like the haggard,cheque at every feather

43
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.570
That comes before his eye.This is a practise

44
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.530
As full of labour as awise man's art

45
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.100
For folly that he wiselyshows is fit;

46
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.070
But wise men, folly-fall'n,quite taint their wit.

47
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.630
Save you, gentleman.

48
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.100
And you, sir.

49
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.200
Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

50
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.230
Et vous aussi; votreserviteur.

51
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.400
I hope, sir, you are; andI am yours.

52
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.500
Will you encounter thehouse? my niece is desirous

53
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.630
you should enter, if yourtrade be to her.

54
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.600
I am bound to your niece,sir; I mean, she is the

55
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.900
list of my voyage.

56
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.070
Taste your legs, sir; putthem to motion.

57
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.570
My legs do betterunderstand me, sir, than I

58
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.000
understand what you mean bybidding me taste my legs.

59
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.270
I mean, to go, sir, toenter.

60
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.170
I will answer you withgait and entrance.

61
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.370
Most excellentaccomplished lady,

62
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.730
the heavens rainodours on you!

63
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.370
That youth's a rare courtier:'Rain odours;' well.

64
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.730
My matter hath no voice,to your own most pregnant

65
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.430
and vouchsafed ear.

66
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.930
'Odours,' 'pregnant'and 'vouchsafed:'

67
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.400
I'll get 'em allthree all ready.

68
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.030
Let the garden door be shut,and leave me to my hearing.

69
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.170
Give me your hand, sir.

70
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.600
My duty, madam, and mosthumble service.

71
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.670
What is your name?

72
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.430
Cesario is your servant'sname, fair princess.

73
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.370
My servant, sir! 'Twasnever merry world

74
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.230
Since lowly feigning wascall'd compliment:

75
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.930
You're servant to theCount Orsino, youth.

76
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.770
And he is yours, and hismust needs be yours:

77
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.730
Your servant's servant isyour servant, madam.

78
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.830
For him, I think not onhim: for his thoughts,

79
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.600
Would they were blanks,rather than fill'd with me!

80
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.030
Madam, I come to whet yourgentle thoughts

81
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.030
On his behalf.

82
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.570
O, by your leave, I prayyou,

83
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.730
I bade you never speakagain of him:

84
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.130
But, would you undertakeanother suit,

85
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.030
I had rather hear you tosolicit that

86
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.070
Than music from thespheres.

87
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.930
Dear lady,--

88
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.300
Give me leave, beseechyou. I did send,

89
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.330
After the last enchantmentyou did here,

90
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.100
A ring in chase of you: sodid I abuse

91
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.070
Myself, my servant and, Ifear me, you:

92
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.870
Under your hardconstruction must I sit,

93
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.930
To force that on you, in ashameful cunning,

94
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.530
Which you knew none ofyours: what might you think?

95
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.900
Have you not set minehonour at the stake

96
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.730
And baited it with all theunmuzzled thoughts

97
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.600
That tyrannous heart can think?To one of your receiving

98
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.900
Enough is shown: acypress, not a bosom,

99
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.430
Hideth my heart. So, letme hear you speak.

100
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.670
I pity you.

101
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.830
That's a degree to love.

102
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.300
No, not a grize; for 'tisa vulgar proof,

103
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.400
That very oft we pityenemies.

104
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.170
Why, then, methinks 'tistime to smile again.

105
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.630
O, world, how apt the poorare to be proud!

106
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.700
If one should be a prey,how much the better

107
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.230
To fall before the lionthan the wolf!

108
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.530
(Clock strikes)

109
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.030
The clock upbraids me withthe waste of time.

110
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.670
Be not afraid, good youth,I will not have you:

111
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.800
And yet, when wit andyouth is come to harvest,

112
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.870
Your were is alike to reapa proper man:

113
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.400
There lies your way, duewest.

114
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.730
Then westward-ho! Graceand good disposition

115
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.930
Attend your ladyship!

116
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.430
You'll nothing, madam, tomy lord by me?

117
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.630
Stay:

118
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.130
I prithee, tell me whatthou thinkest of me.

119
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.270
That you do think you arenot what you are.

120
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.770
If I think so, I think thesame of you.

121
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.570
Then think you right: I amnot what I am.

122
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.200
I would you were as Iwould have you be!

123
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.800
Would it be better, madam,than I am?

124
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.870
I wish it might, for now Iam your fool.

125
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.800
O, what a deal of scornlooks beautiful

126
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.870
In the contempt and angerof his lip!

127
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.230
A murderous guilt showsnot itself more soon

128
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.170
Than love that would seemhid: love's night is noon.

129
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.530
Cesario, by the roses ofthe spring,

130
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.930
By maidhood, honour, truthand every thing,

131
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.270
I love thee so, that,maugre all thy pride,

132
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.700
Nor wit nor reason can mypassion hide.

133
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.430
Do not extort thy reasonsfrom this clause,

134
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.870
For that I woo, thoutherefore hast no cause,

135
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.300
But rather reason thuswith reason fetter,

136
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.330
Love sought is good, butgiven unsought better.

137
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.370
By innocence I swear, andby my youth

138
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.930
I have one heart, onebosom and one truth,

139
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.900
And that no woman has; nornever none

140
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.530
Shall mistress be of it,save I alone.

141
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.530
And so adieu, good madam:never more

142
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.630
Will I my master's tearsto you deplore.

143
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.470
Yet come again; for thouperhaps mayst move

144
00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.730
That heart, which nowabhors, to like his love.

145
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.200
No, faith, I'll not stay ajot longer.

146
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.600
Thy reason, dear venom,give thy reason.

147
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.500
You must needs yield yourreason, Sir Andrew.

148
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.330
Marry, I saw yourniece do more favours

149
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.500
to the count's serving-man thanever she bestowed upon me;

150
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.100
Did she see thee the while,old boy? tell me that.

151
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.230
As plain as I see you now.

152
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.730
This was a great argumentof love in her toward you.

153
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.500
'Slight, will you make anass o' me?

154
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.970
I will prove itlegitimate, sir,

155
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.400
upon the oaths ofjudgment and reason.

156
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.670
And they have beengrand-jury-men

157
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.070
since before Noahwas a sailor.

158
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.070
She did show favour to theyouth in your sight only

159
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.830
to exasperate you, to awakeyour dormouse valour,

160
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.430
to put fire in your heart andbrimstone in your liver.

161
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.930
You should thenhave accosted her;

162
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.330
and with some excellent jests,fire-new from the mint,

163
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.270
you should have bangedthe youth into dumbness.

164
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.030
This was looked for at yourhand, and this was balked:

165
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.170
the double gilt ofthis opportunity

166
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.030
you let time wash off,

167
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.370
and you are now sailed into thenorth of my lady's opinion;

168
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.100
where you will hanglike an icicle

169
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.400
on a Dutchman's beard,

170
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.070
unless you do redeem it

171
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.070
by some laudable attempteither of valour or policy.

172
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.670
An't be any way, itmust be with valour;

173
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.870
for policy I hate:

174
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.500
Why, then, build me thy fortunesupon the basis of valour.

175
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.200
Challenge me the count'syouth to fight with him;

176
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.330
hurt him in eleven places: myniece shall take note of it;

177
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
and assure thyself, there isno love-broker in the world

178
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.830
can more prevail in man'scommendation with woman

179
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.830
than report of valour.

180
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.270
There is no way but this,Sir Andrew.

181
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.300
Will either of you bear mea challenge to him?

182
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.670
Go, write it in a martialhand; be curst and brief;

183
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.500
it is no matter how witty,so it be eloquent and fun

184
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.470
of invention: taunt himwith the licence of ink:

185
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.370
if thou thou'sthim some thrice,

186
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.800
it shall not be amiss;

187
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.800
and as many lies as willlie in thy sheet of paper,

188
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.070
although the sheetwere big enough

189
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.970
for the bed of Ware in England,set 'em down: go, about it.

190
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.470
Let there be gallenough in thy ink,

191
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.370
though thou write with agoose-pen, no matter: about it.

192
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.970
Where shall I find you?

193
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.330
We'll call thee at thecubiculo: go.

194
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.200
This is a dear manikin toyou, Sir Toby.

195
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.770
I have been dear to him, lad,

196
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.000
some two thousandstrong, or so.

197
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.300
We shall have a rareletter from him:

198
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.230
but you'll not deliver't?

199
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.000
Never trust me, then;

200
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.730
and by all means stir onthe youth to an answer.

201
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.300
I think oxen and wainropes

202
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.700
cannot hale them together. ForAndrew, if he were opened,

203
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.530
and you find so muchblood in his liver

204
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.670
as will clog thefoot of a flea,

205
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.400
I'll eat the restof the anatomy.

206
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.470
And his opposite, the youth,

207
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.300
bears in his visage nogreat presage of cruelty.

208
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.400
Look, where the youngestwren of nine comes.

209
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.030
If you desire the spleen,

210
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.600
and will laugh yourselfinto stitches, follow me.

211
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.030
Yond gull Malvolio is turnedheathen, a very renegado;

212
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.030
for there is no Christian,

213
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.830
that means to be savedby believing rightly,

214
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.330
can ever believe such impossiblepassages of grossness.

215
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.300
He's in yellow stockings.

216
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.730
And cross-gartered?

217
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.500
Most villanously; like apedant that keeps a school

218
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.770
i' the church. Ihave dogged him,

219
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.930
like his murderer. He does obeyevery point of the letter

220
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.100
that I dropped to betray him:

221
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.500
he does smile hisface into more lines

222
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.000
than is in the new map with theaugmentation of the Indies:

223
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.670
you have not seen sucha thing as 'tis.

224
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.400
I can hardly forbearhurling things at him.

225
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.870
I know my lady will strike him:

226
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.230
if she do, he'll smile andtake't for a great favour.

227
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.900
Come, bring us, bring uswhere he is.

228
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.300
I would not by my willhave troubled you;

229
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.900
But, since you make yourpleasure of your pains,

230
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.700
I will no further chideyou.

231
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.530
I could not stay behindyou: my desire,

232
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.100
More sharp than filedsteel, did spur me forth;

233
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.770
And not all love to seeyou, though so much

234
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.170
As might have drawn one toa longer voyage,

235
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.830
But jealousy what mightbefall your travel,

236
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.670
Being skilless in theseparts; which to a stranger,

237
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.670
Unguided and unfriended,often prove

238
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.400
Rough and unhospitable: mywilling love,

239
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.630
The rather by thesearguments of fear,

240
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.270
Set forth in your pursuit.

241
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.670
My kind Antonio,

242
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.200
I can no other answer makebut thanks,

243
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.530
And thanks; and ever thanksoft good turns

244
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.800
Are shuffled off with suchuncurrent pay:

245
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.770
But, were my worth as ismy conscience firm,

246
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.930
You should find better dealing.

247
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.930
What's to do?

248
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.330
Shall we go see thereliques of this town?

249
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.770
To-morrow, sir: best firstgo see your lodging.

250
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.000
I am not weary, and 'tislong to night:

251
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.370
I pray you, let us satisfyour eyes

252
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.070
With the memorials and thethings of fame

253
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.770
That do renown this city.

254
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.000
Would you'ld pardon me;

255
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.130
I do not without dangerwalk these streets:

256
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.430
Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainstthe count his galleys

257
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.270
I did some service; ofsuch note indeed,

258
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.700
That were I ta'en here itwould scarce be answer'd.

259
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.870
Belike you slew greatnumber of his people.

260
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.200
The offence is not of sucha bloody nature;

261
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.670
Albeit the quality of thetime and quarrel

262
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.030
Might well have given usbloody argument.

263
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.830
It might have since beenanswer'd in repaying

264
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.700
What we took from them;which, for traffic's sake,

265
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.430
Most of our city did: onlymyself stood out;

266
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.970
For which, if I be lapsedin this place,

267
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.370
I shall pay dear.

268
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.200
Do not then walk too open.

269
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.170
It doth not fit me. Hold,sir, here's my purse.

270
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.270
In the south suburbs, atthe Elephant,

271
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.470
Is best to lodge: I willbespeak our diet,

272
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.600
Whiles you beguile the timeand feed your knowledge

273
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.570
With viewing of the town:there shall you have me.

274
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.600
Why I your purse?

275
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.030
Haply your eye shall lightupon some toy

276
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.170
You have desire topurchase; and your store,

277
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.230
I think, is not for idlemarkets, sir.

278
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.970
I'll be your purse-bearerand leave you

279
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.600
For an hour.

280
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.470
To the Elephant.

281
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.430
I do remember.

282
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.900
I have sent after him: hesays he'll come;

283
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.970
How shall I feast him?what bestow of him?

284
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.900
For youth is bought more oftthan begg'd or borrow'd.

285
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.000
I speak too loud.

286
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.300
Where is Malvolio? he issad and civil,

287
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.500
And suits well for aservant with my fortunes:

288
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.730
Where is Malvolio?

289
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.430
He's coming, madam; butin very strange manner.

290
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.500
He is, sure, possessed, madam.

291
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.000
Why, what's the matter?does he rave?

292
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.930
No. madam, he doesnothing but smile:

293
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.270
your ladyship were best tohave some guard about you,

294
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.300
if he come; for, sure, theman is tainted in's wits.

295
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.930
Go call him hither.

296
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.370
I am as mad as he,

297
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:39.800
If sad and merry madnessequal be.

298
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.770
How now, Malvolio!

299
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.070
Sweet lady, ho, ho.

300
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.200
Smilest thou?

301
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.530
I sent for thee upon a sadoccasion.

302
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.970
Sad, lady! I could be sad:this does make some

303
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.270
obstruction in the blood,this cross-gartering;

304
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.430
but what of that? if itplease the eye of one,

305
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.900
it is with me as thevery true sonnet is,

306
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.870
'Please one, and please all.'

307
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.100
Why, how dost thou, man? whatis the matter with thee?

308
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.830
Not black in my mind,though yellow in my legs.

309
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:20.100
It did come to his hands, andcommands shall be executed:

310
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.330
I think we do know thesweet Roman hand.

311
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.030
Wilt thou go to bed,Malvolio?

312
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:31.470
To bed! ay, sweet-heart,and I'll come to thee.

313
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.370
God comfort thee!

314
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.730
Why dost thou smile so andkiss thy hand so oft?

315
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.800
How do you, Malvolio?

316
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.530
At your request! yes;nightingales answer daws.

317
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.330
Why appear you with thisridiculous boldness

318
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.500
before my lady?

319
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.100
'Be not afraid ofgreatness:' 'twas well writ.

320
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.830
What meanest thou by that,Malvolio?

321
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.000
'Some are born great,'--

322
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.800
Ha!

323
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.000
'Some achievegreatness,'--

324
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.470
What sayest thou?

325
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.430
'And some have greatnessthrust upon them.'

326
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.030
Heaven restore thee!

327
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.670
'Remember who commendedthy yellow stocking s,'--

328
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.200
Thy yellow stockings!

329
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.430
'And wished to see theecross-gartered.'

330
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.600
Cross-gartered!

331
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.830
'Go to thou art made, ifthou desirest to be so;'--

332
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.470
Am I made?

333
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.000
'If not, let me see thee aservant still.'

334
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.430
Why, this is verymidsummer madness.

335
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.230
Madam, the young gentleman ofthe Count Orsino's is returned:

336
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.670
I could hardlyentreat him back:

337
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.530
he attends yourladyship's pleasure.

338
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.200
I'll come to him.

339
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.930
Good Maria, let thisfellow be looked to.

340
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.000
Where's my cousin Toby?

341
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.870
Let some of my people havea special care of him:

342
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.300
I would not have him miscarry

343
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.400
for the half of my dowry.

344
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.970
O, ho! do you come near me now?

345
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.070
no worse man than SirToby to look to me!

346
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.670
This concurs directlywith the letter:

347
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.600
she sends him on purpose,

348
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.030
that I may appearstubborn to him;

349
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.830
for she incites me tothat in the letter.

350
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.270
'Cast thy humbleslough,' says she;

351
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.270
'be opposite with a kinsman,surly with servants;

352
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.700
let thy tongue tang witharguments of state;

353
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.470
put thyself into thetrick of singularity;'

354
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.570
and consequently setsdown the manner how;

355
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.730
as, a sad face, a reverendcarriage, a slow tongue,

356
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.730
in the habit of some sirof note, and so forth.

357
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.030
I have limed her; butit is Jove's doing,

358
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:30.000
and Jove make me thankful!And when she went away now,

359
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.270
'Let this fellow be lookedto:' fellow! not Malvolio,

360
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.600
nor after my degree,but fellow.

361
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.300
Why, every thingadheres together,

362
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.200
that no dram of a scruple,no scruple of a scruple,

363
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.270
no obstacle, no incredulousor unsafe circumsta--

364
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.930
What can be said? Nothing thatcan be can come between me

365
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.000
and the full prospectof my hopes.

366
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.400
Well, Jove, not I, isthe doer of this,

367
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400
and he is to be thanked.

368
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.330
Which way is he, inthe name of sanctity?

369
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.370
If all the devils of hellbe drawn in little,

370
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.100
and Legion himself possessedhim, yet I'll speak to him.

371
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.600
Here he is, here he is.How is't with you, sir?

372
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.730
how is't with you, man?

373
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:33.070
Go off; I discard you: let meenjoy my private: go off.

374
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.700
Lo, how hollow the fiendspeaks within him!

375
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.800
did not I tell you?

376
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.270
Sir Toby, my lady prays youto have a care of him.

377
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.230
Ah, ha! does she so?

378
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:47.130
Go to, go to; peace, peace; wemust deal gently with him:

379
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.430
let me alone. Howdo you, Malvolio?

380
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.600
how is't with you? What,man! defy the devil:

381
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.670
consider, he's an enemy tomankind.

382
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.300
Do you know what you say?

383
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.170
La you, an you speakill of the devil,

384
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.770
how he takes it at heart! PrayGod, he be not bewitched!

385
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.800
Carry his water to thewise woman.

386
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.500
Marry, and it shall be doneto-morrow morning, if I live.

387
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.600
My lady would not lose himfor more than I'll say.

388
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.530
How now, mistress!

389
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.670
O Lord!

390
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.030
Prithee, hold thy peace;this is not the way:

391
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.270
do you not see you move him?let me alone with him.

392
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.130
No way but gentleness; gently,gently: the fiend is rough,

393
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:25.500
and will not be roughly used.

394
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.470
Why, how now, my bawcock!how dost thou, chuck?

395
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.530
Sir!

396
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.930
Get him to say hisprayers, good Sir Toby,

397
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.970
get him to pray.

398
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.370
My prayers, minx!

399
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.300
No, I warrant you, he willnot hear of godliness.

400
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.800
Go, hang yourselves all! youare idle shallow things:

401
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.230
I am not of your element:

402
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.870
you shall know more hereafter.

403
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:54.630
(laughing)

404
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.170
Is't possible?

405
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.330
If this were playedupon a stage now,

406
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.330
I could condemn it asan improbable fiction.

407
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.570
His very genius hath taken theinfection of the device, man.

408
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.270
Nay, pursue him now, lest thedevice take air and taint.

409
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.130
Why, we shall make him madindeed.

410
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.270
The house will be thequieter.

411
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.000
Come, we'll have him ina dark room and bound.

412
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.830
My niece is already in thebelief that he's mad:

413
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.170
we may carry it thus, for ourpleasure and his penance,

414
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.130
till our very pastime,tired out of breath,

415
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.730
prompt us to have mercy on him:

416
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.630
at which time we will bringthe device to the bar

417
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.130
and crown thee for afinder of madmen.

418
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.670
But see, but see.

419
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.600
More matter for a May morning.

420
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.100
Here's the challenge, read it:

421
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.970
warrant there's vinegarand pepper in't.

422
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.970
Is't so saucy?

423
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.800
Ay, is't, I warrant him:do but read.

424
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.430
Give me.

425
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.470
'Youth, whatsoever thou art,thou art but a scurvy fellow.'

426
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.600
Good, and valiant.

427
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.530
'Wonder not, nor admirenot in thy mind,

428
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.170
why I do call thee so,

429
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.700
for I will show theeno reason for't.'

430
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.370
A good note; that keeps youfrom the blow of the law.

431
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.000
'Thou comest to the ladyOlivia, and in my sight

432
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.500
she uses thee kindly: butthou liest in thy throat;

433
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.570
that is not the matterI challenge thee for.'

434
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.830
Very brief, and toexceeding good sense--less.

435
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.330
'I will waylay thee going home;

436
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.070
where if it be thychance to kill me,'--

437
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.170
Good.

438
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.070
'Thou killest me like arogue and a villain.'

439
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.870
Still you keep o' the windyside of the law: good.

440
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.330
'Fare thee well; and Godhave mercy upon

441
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.770
one of our souls! He mayhave mercy upon mine;

442
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.670
but my hope is better,and so look to thyself.

443
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.230
Thy friend, as thou usesthim, and thy sworn enemy,

444
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.330
ANDREW AGUECHEEK.

445
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.430
If this letter move himnot, his legs cannot:

446
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.270
I'll give't him.

447
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.570
You may have veryfit occasion for't:

448
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.970
he is now in somecommerce with my lady,

449
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.200
and will by and by depart.

450
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.400
Go, Sir Andrew: scout me forhim at the corner the orchard

451
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.100
like a bum-baily: so soonas ever thou seest him,

452
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.670
draw; and, as thoudrawest swear horrible;

453
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.500
for it comes to pass oftthat a terrible oath,

454
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.230
with a swaggering accentsharply twanged off,

455
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.770
gives manhood more approbation

456
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.700
than ever proof itself wouldhave earned him. Away!

457
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.470
Nay, let me alone forswearing.

458
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.370
Now will not Ideliver his letter:

459
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.900
for the behavior ofthe young gentleman

460
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.530
gives him out to be of goodcapacity and breeding;

461
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.730
his employment betweenhis lord and my niece

462
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.430
confirms no less:

463
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.930
therefore this letter, beingso excellently ignorant,

464
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.300
will breed no terrorin the youth:

465
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.170
he will find it comesfrom a clodpole.

466
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.430
But, sir, I will deliver hischallenge by word of mouth;

467
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.900
set upon Aguecheek anotable report of valour;

468
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.530
and drive the gentleman,as I know his

469
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.630
youth will aptly receiveit, into a most hideous

470
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.970
opinion of his rage, skill,fury and impetuosity.

471
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.070
This will so fright themboth that they will kill

472
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.300
one another by the look,like cockatrices.

473
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.600
I have said too much untoa heart of stone

474
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.470
And laid mine honour toounchary out:

475
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.170
There's something in methat reproves my fault;

476
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.300
But such a headstrongpotent fault it is,

477
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.800
That it but mocks reproof.

478
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.100
With the same 'havior thatyour passion bears

479
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.530
Goes on my master's grief.

480
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:20.430
Here, wear this jewel forme, 'tis my picture;

481
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.500
Refuse it not; it hath notongue to vex you;

482
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.000
And I beseech you comeagain to-morrow.

483
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.800
What shall you ask of methat I'll deny,

484
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.600
That honour saved may uponasking give?

485
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.370
Nothing but this; yourtrue love for my master.

486
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.270
How with mine honour may Igive him that

487
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.630
Which I have given to you?

488
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.670
I will acquit you.

489
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.970
Well, come againto-morrow: fare thee well:

490
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.930
A fiend like thee mightbear my soul to hell.

491
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.200
Gentleman, God save thee.

492
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.170
And you, sir.

493
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.970
That defence thou hast,betake thee to't:

494
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.870
of what nature the wrongs arethou hast done him, I know not;

495
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.800
but thy intercepter,full of despite,

496
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.830
bloody as the hunter, attendsthee at the orchard-end:

497
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.470
dismount thy tuck, beyare in thy preparation,

498
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.030
for thy assailant is quick,skilful and deadly.

499
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.600
You mistake, sir; I am sure noman hath any quarrel to me:

500
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.770
my remembrance is very free

501
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.430
and clear from any image ofoffence done to any man.

502
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.300
You'll find it otherwise,I assure you:

503
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.670
therefore, if you holdyour life at any price,

504
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.800
betake you to your guard; foryour opposite hath in him

505
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.570
what youth, strength, skill andwrath can furnish man withal.

506
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.900
I pray you, sir, what ishe?

507
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.770
He is knight, dubbedwith unhatched rapier

508
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.670
and on carpet consideration; buthe is a devil in private brawl:

509
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.030
souls and bodies hathhe divorced three;

510
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.530
and his incensement at thismoment is so implacable,

511
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.770
that satisfaction can be none

512
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.130
but by pangs of deathand sepulchre.

513
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:56.130
Hob, nob, is his word;give't or take't.

514
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.370
I will return againinto the house

515
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.400
and desire some conduct ofthe lady. I am no fighter.

516
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.030
I have heard ofsome kind of men

517
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.600
that put quarrels purposely onothers, to taste their valour:

518
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.870
belike this is aman of that quirk.

519
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.130
Sir, no;

520
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.300
his indignation derives itselfout of a very competent injury:

521
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.300
therefore, get you on andgive him his desire.

522
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.700
Back you shall notto the house,

523
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.770
unless you undertakethat with me

524
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.070
which with as much safetyyou might answer him:

525
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.730
therefore, on, or stripyour sword stark naked;

526
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.170
for meddle you must,that's certain,

527
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.570
or forswear to weariron about you.

528
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.200
This is as uncivil asstrange. I beseech you,

529
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.530
do me this courteous office,as to know of the knight

530
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.870
what my offence to him is:it is something of my

531
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.400
negligence, nothing of mypurpose.

532
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.530
I will do so.

533
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:55.670
Signior Fabian, stay you bythis gentleman till my return.

534
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.730
Pray you, sir, do you knowof this matter?

535
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.930
I know the knight isincensed against you,

536
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.270
even to a mortal arbitrement;

537
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.470
but nothing of thecircumstance more.

538
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.070
I beseech you, whatmanner of man is he?

539
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.100
Nothing of thatwonderful promise,

540
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.300
to read him by his form,

541
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.870
as you are like to find himin the proof of his valour.

542
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.730
He is, indeed, sir,the most skilful,

543
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.770
bloody and fatal oppositethat you could possibly

544
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.030
have found in anypart of Illyria.

545
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.530
Will you walk towards him?

546
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.270
I will make your peacewith him if I can.

547
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.470
I shall be muchbound to you for't:

548
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.700
I am one that had rather go withsir priest than sir knight:

549
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.930
I care not who knowsso much of my mettle.

550
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.530
Why, man, he's a very devil;

551
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.700
I have not seen such a firago.

552
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.830
I had a pass with him,rapier, scabbard and all,

553
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.300
and he gives me the stuck inwith such a mortal motion,

554
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.670
that it is inevitable;and on the answer,

555
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.500
he pays you as surely asyour feet hit the ground

556
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.970
they step on.

557
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.300
They say he has beenfencer to the Sophy.

558
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.600
Pox on't, I'll not meddlewith him.

559
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.770
Ay, but he will notnow be pacified:

560
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.670
Fabian can scarcehold him yonder.

561
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.030
Plague on't, an I thoughthe had been valiant

562
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.300
and so cunning in fence,

563
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.030
I'ld have seen him damned ereI'ld have challenged him.

564
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.270
Let him let the matter slip,

565
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.830
and I'll give him myhorse, grey Capilet.

566
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:33.000
I'll make the motion:

567
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:40.800
stand here, make agood show on't:

568
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.670
this shall end withoutthe perdition of souls.

569
00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.130
Marry, I'll ride your horseas well as I ride you.

570
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.570
I have his horse to takeup the quarrel:

571
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.530
I have persuaded him theyouth's a devil.

572
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.730
He is as horriblyconceited of him;

573
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.870
and pants and looks pale, asif a bear were at his heels.

574
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.770
There's no remedy, sir;

575
00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.600
he will fight withyou for's oath sake:

576
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.430
marry, he hath betterbethought him of his quarrel,

577
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.300
and he finds that now scarceto be worth talking of:

578
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.830
therefore draw, for thesupportance of his vow;

579
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.430
he protests he willnot hurt you.

580
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.430
Pray God defend me! Alittle thing would

581
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.830
make me tell them how muchI lack of a man.

582
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.700
Give ground, if you seehim furious.

583
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.700
Come, Sir Andrew,there's no remedy;

584
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.870
the gentleman will,

585
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.930
for his honour's sake,have one bout with you;

586
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.930
he cannot by theduello avoid it:

587
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.000
but he has promised me, as heis a gentleman and a soldier,

588
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
he will not hurtyou. Come on; to't.

589
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.330
Pray God, he keep hisoath!

590
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.700
I do assure you, 'tisagainst my will.

591
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.630
Put up your sword. If thisyoung gentleman

592
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.830
Have done offence, I takethe fault on me:

593
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.770
If you offend him, I forhim defy you.

594
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.700
You, sir! why, what areyou?

595
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.500
One, sir, that for hislove dares yet do more

596
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.470
Than you have heard himbrag to you he will.

597
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:23.400
Nay, if you be anundertaker, I am for you.

598
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.930
O good Sir Toby, hold!here come the officers.

599
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.530
I'll be with you anon.

600
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.430
Pray, sir, put your swordup, if you please.

601
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.170
Marry, will I, sir; and,for that I promised you,

602
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.430
I'll be as good as my word:

603
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.670
he will bear you easilyand reins well.

604
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:49.030
This is the man; do thyoffice.

605
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.730
Antonio, I arrest thee atthe suit of Count Orsino.

606
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.800
You do mistake me, sir.

607
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.900
No, sir, no jot; I knowyour favour well,

608
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.930
Though now you have nosea-cap on your head.

609
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.070
Take him away: he knows Iknow him well.

610
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.400
I must obey.

611
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.570
This comes with seekingyou:

612
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.530
But there's no remedy; Ishall answer it.

613
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.470
What will you do, now mynecessity

614
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.800
Makes me to askyou for my purse?

615
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.230
It grieves me Much more forwhat I cannot do for you

616
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.030
Than what befalls myself.You stand amazed;

617
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.530
But be of comfort.

618
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.700
Come, sir, away.

619
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.500
I must entreat of you someof that money.

620
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.800
What money, sir?

621
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.830
For the fair kindness youhave show'd me here,

622
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.200
And, part, being promptedby your present trouble,

623
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.700
Out of my lean and lowability

624
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.800
I'll lend you something:my having is not much;

625
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.630
I'll make division of mypresent with you:

626
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.870
Hold, there's half mycoffer.

627
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.070
Will you deny me now?

628
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.370
Is't possible that mydeserts to you

629
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.200
Can lack persuasion? Donot tempt my misery,

630
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.500
Lest that it make me sounsound a man

631
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.170
As to upbraid you withthose kindnesses

632
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.270
That I have done for you.

633
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.600
I know of none;

634
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.730
Nor know I you by voice orany feature:

635
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.370
I hate ingratitude more ina man

636
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.900
Than lying, vainness,babbling, drunkenness,

637
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.070
Or any taint of vice whosestrong corruption

638
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.530
Inhabits our frail blood.

639
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.100
O heavens themselves!

640
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.570
Come, sir, I pray you, go.

641
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:15.730
Let me speak a little. Thisyouth that you see here

642
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.370
I snatch'd one half out ofthe jaws of death,

643
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.400
Relieved him with suchsanctity of love,

644
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.130
And to his image, whichmethought did promise

645
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:27.270
Most venerable worth, didI devotion.

646
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.770
What's that to us? Thetime goes by: away!

647
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.400
But O how vile an idolproves this god

648
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.930
Thou hast, Sebastian, donegood feature shame.

649
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.330
In nature there's noblemish but the mind;

650
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.130
None can be call'ddeform'd but the unkind:

651
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.430
Virtue is beauty, but thebeauteous evil

652
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.200
Are empty trunkso'erflourish'd by the devil.

653
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.470
The man grows mad: awaywith him! Come, come, sir.

654
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.270
Lead me on.

655
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.970
Methinks his words do fromsuch passion fly,

656
00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.130
That he believes himself:so do not I.

657
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.770
Prove true, imagination,O, prove true,

658
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.600
That I, dear brother,be now ta'en for you!

659
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.500
Come hither, knight;come hither, Fabian:

660
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.500
He named Sebastian: I mybrother know

661
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.430
Yet living in my glass;even such and so

662
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.330
In favour was my brother,and he went

663
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.900
Still in this fashion,colour, ornament,

664
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.830
For him I imitate: O, ifit prove,

665
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:32.270
Tempests are kind and saltwaves fresh in love.

666
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.200
A very dishonest paltry boy,

667
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.770
and more a coward than a hare:

668
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.000
his dishonesty appearsin leaving his

669
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.170
friend here in necessityand denying him;

670
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.230
and for his cowardship,ask Fabian.

671
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.970
A coward, a most devoutcoward, religious in it.

672
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.970
'Slid, I'll after himagain and beat him.

673
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.770
Do; cuff him soundly, butnever draw thy sword.

674
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:55.930
An I do not,--

675
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.970
Come, let's see the event.

676
00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:04.330
I dare lay any money'twill be nothing yet.

677
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.430
