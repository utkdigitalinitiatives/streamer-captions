00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.130


2
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.600
Save thee, friend, and thy music:

3
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.270
dost thou live by thy tabour?

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.630
No, sir, I live by the church.

5
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.800
Art thou a churchman?

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.730
No such matter, sir: I do live by the church;

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.270
for I do live at my house,

8
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.030
and my house doth stand by the church.

9
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.870
Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.530
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly:

11
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.100
she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married;

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.200
and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings;

13
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.730
the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not her fool,

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.830
but her corrupter of words.

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.100
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.

16
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.700
Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,

17
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.130
it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir,

18
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.700
but the fool should be as oft

19
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
with your master as with my mistress:

20
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.870
I think I saw your wisdom there.

21
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.300
Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.

22
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.600
Hold, there's expenses for thee.

23
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.000
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair,

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.070
send thee a beard!

25
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.800
By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for one;

26
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.470
though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?

27
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.900
Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?

28
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.300
Yes, being kept together and put to use.

29
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.500
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir,

30
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.430
to bring a Cressida to this Troilus.

31
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.070
I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.

32
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.770
The matter, I hope, is not great, sir,

33
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.130
begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar.

34
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.900
My lady is within, sir.

35
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.170
I will construe to them whence you come;

36
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.470
who you are and what you would are out of my welkin,

37
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.470
I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.

38
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.270
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;

39
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.030
And to do that well craves a kind of wit:

40
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.000
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,

41
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.600
The quality of persons, and the time,

42
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.530
And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather

43
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.570
That comes before his eye. This is a practise

44
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.530
As full of labour as a wise man's art

45
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.100
For folly that he wisely shows is fit;

46
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.070
But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

47
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.630
Save you, gentleman.

48
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.100
And you, sir.

49
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.200
Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

50
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.230
Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.

51
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.400
I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.

52
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.500
Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous

53
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.630
you should enter, if your trade be to her.

54
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.600
I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the

55
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.900
list of my voyage.

56
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.070
Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.

57
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.570
My legs do better understand me, sir, than I

58
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.000
understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.

59
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.270
I mean, to go, sir, to enter.

60
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.170
I will answer you with gait and entrance.

61
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.370
Most excellent accomplished lady,

62
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.730
the heavens rain odours on you!

63
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.370
That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.

64
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.730
My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant

65
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.430
and vouchsafed ear.

66
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.930
'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:'

67
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.400
I'll get 'em all three all ready.

68
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.030
Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.

69
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.170
Give me your hand, sir.

70
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.600
My duty, madam, and most humble service.

71
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.670
What is your name?

72
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.430
Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

73
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.370
My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world

74
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.230
Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:

75
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.930
You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.

76
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.770
And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:

77
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.730
Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.

78
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.830
For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,

79
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.600
Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!

80
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.030
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts

81
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.030
On his behalf.

82
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.570
O, by your leave, I pray you,

83
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.730
I bade you never speak again of him:

84
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.130
But, would you undertake another suit,

85
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.030
I had rather hear you to solicit that

86
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.070
Than music from the spheres.

87
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.930
Dear lady,--

88
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.300
Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,

89
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.330
After the last enchantment you did here,

90
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.100
A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse

91
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.070
Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:

92
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.870
Under your hard construction must I sit,

93
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.930
To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,

94
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.530
Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?

95
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.900
Have you not set mine honour at the stake

96
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.730
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts

97
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.600
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving

98
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.900
Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,

99
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.430
Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.

100
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.670
I pity you.

101
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.830
That's a degree to love.

102
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.300
No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,

103
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.400
That very oft we pity enemies.

104
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.170
Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.

105
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.630
O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!

106
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.700
If one should be a prey, how much the better

107
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.230
To fall before the lion than the wolf!

108
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.530
(Clock strikes)

109
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.030
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.

110
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.670
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:

111
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.800
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,

112
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.870
Your were is alike to reap a proper man:

113
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.400
There lies your way, due west.

114
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.730
Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition

115
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.930
Attend your ladyship!

116
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.430
You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?

117
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.630
Stay:

118
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.130
I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.

119
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.270
That you do think you are not what you are.

120
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.770
If I think so, I think the same of you.

121
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.570
Then think you right: I am not what I am.

122
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.200
I would you were as I would have you be!

123
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.800
Would it be better, madam, than I am?

124
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.870
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

125
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.800
O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful

126
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.870
In the contempt and anger of his lip!

127
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.230
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon

128
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.170
Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.

129
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.530
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,

130
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.930
By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,

131
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.270
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,

132
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.700
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.

133
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.430
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,

134
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.870
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,

135
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.300
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,

136
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.330
Love sought is good, but given unsought better.

137
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.370
By innocence I swear, and by my youth

138
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.930
I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,

139
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.900
And that no woman has; nor never none

140
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.530
Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.

141
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.530
And so adieu, good madam: never more

142
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.630
Will I my master's tears to you deplore.

143
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.470
Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move

144
00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.730
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

145
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.200
No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.

146
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.600
Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.

147
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.500
You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.

148
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.330
Marry, I saw your niece do more favours

149
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.500
to the count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;

150
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.100
Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.

151
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.230
As plain as I see you now.

152
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.730
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.

153
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.500
'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?

154
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.970
I will prove it legitimate, sir,

155
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.400
upon the oaths of judgment and reason.

156
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.670
And they have been grand-jury-men

157
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.070
since before Noah was a sailor.

158
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.070
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only

159
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.830
to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour,

160
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.430
to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.

161
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.930
You should then have accosted her;

162
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.330
and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint,

163
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.270
you should have banged the youth into dumbness.

164
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:02.030
This was looked for at your hand, and this was balked:

165
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.170
the double gilt of this opportunity

166
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.030
you let time wash off,

167
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.370
and you are now sailed into the north of my lady's opinion;

168
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:09.100
where you will hang like an icicle

169
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.400
on a Dutchman's beard,

170
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.070
unless you do redeem it

171
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.070
by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.

172
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.670
An't be any way, it must be with valour;

173
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.870
for policy I hate:

174
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.500
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour.

175
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.200
Challenge me the count's youth to fight with him;

176
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.330
hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall take note of it;

177
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.330
and assure thyself, there is no love-broker in the world

178
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.830
can more prevail in man's commendation with woman

179
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.830
than report of valour.

180
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.270
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.

181
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.300
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?

182
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.670
Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;

183
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.500
it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun

184
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.470
of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:

185
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.370
if thou thou'st him some thrice,

186
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.800
it shall not be amiss;

187
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.800
and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper,

188
00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.070
although the sheet were big enough

189
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.970
for the bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.

190
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.470
Let there be gall enough in thy ink,

191
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:07.370
though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.

192
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.970
Where shall I find you?

193
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.330
We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.

194
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.200
This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.

195
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.770
I have been dear to him, lad,

196
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.000
some two thousand strong, or so.

197
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.300
We shall have a rare letter from him:

198
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.230
but you'll not deliver't?

199
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.000
Never trust me, then;

200
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.730
and by all means stir on the youth to an answer.

201
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.300
I think oxen and wainropes

202
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.700
cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were opened,

203
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.530
and you find so much blood in his liver

204
00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.670
as will clog the foot of a flea,

205
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.400
I'll eat the rest of the anatomy.

206
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.470
And his opposite, the youth,

207
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.300
bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty.

208
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.400
Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.

209
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.030
If you desire the spleen,

210
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.600
and will laugh yourself into stitches, follow me.

211
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.030
Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado;

212
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.030
for there is no Christian,

213
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.830
that means to be saved by believing rightly,

214
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.330
can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness.

215
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.300
He's in yellow stockings.

216
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:08.730
And cross-gartered?

217
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.500
Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school

218
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.770
i' the church. I have dogged him,

219
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.930
like his murderer. He does obey every point of the letter

220
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.100
that I dropped to betray him:

221
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.500
he does smile his face into more lines

222
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.000
than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies:

223
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.670
you have not seen such a thing as 'tis.

224
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.400
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.

225
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.870
I know my lady will strike him:

226
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.230
if she do, he'll smile and take't for a great favour.

227
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.900
Come, bring us, bring us where he is.

228
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.300
I would not by my will have troubled you;

229
00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.900
But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,

230
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.700
I will no further chide you.

231
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.530
I could not stay behind you: my desire,

232
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.100
More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;

233
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.770
And not all love to see you, though so much

234
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.170
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,

235
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.830
But jealousy what might befall your travel,

236
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.670
Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,

237
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.670
Unguided and unfriended, often prove

238
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.400
Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,

239
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.630
The rather by these arguments of fear,

240
00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.270
Set forth in your pursuit.

241
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.670
My kind Antonio,

242
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.200
I can no other answer make but thanks,

243
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.530
And thanks; and ever thanks oft good turns

244
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.800
Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:

245
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.770
But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,

246
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.930
You should find better dealing.

247
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.930
What's to do?

248
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.330
Shall we go see the reliques of this town?

249
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.770
To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.

250
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.000
I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:

251
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.370
I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes

252
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:42.070
With the memorials and the things of fame

253
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:43.770
That do renown this city.

254
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.000
Would you'ld pardon me;

255
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.130
I do not without danger walk these streets:

256
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.430
Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys

257
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.270
I did some service; of such note indeed,

258
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:54.700
That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.

259
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.870
Belike you slew great number of his people.

260
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.200
The offence is not of such a bloody nature;

261
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.670
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel

262
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.030
Might well have given us bloody argument.

263
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.830
It might have since been answer'd in repaying

264
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.700
What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,

265
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.430
Most of our city did: only myself stood out;

266
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:12.970
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,

267
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.370
I shall pay dear.

268
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.200
Do not then walk too open.

269
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.170
It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.

270
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.270
In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,

271
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.470
Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,

272
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.600
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge

273
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.570
With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.

274
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.600
Why I your purse?

275
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.030
Haply your eye shall light upon some toy

276
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.170
You have desire to purchase; and your store,

277
00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.230
I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

278
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.970
I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you

279
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.600
For an hour.

280
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.470
To the Elephant.

281
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.430
I do remember.

282
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.900
I have sent after him: he says he'll come;

283
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.970
How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?

284
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.900
For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.

285
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.000
I speak too loud.

286
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.300
Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,

287
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.500
And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:

288
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:11.730
Where is Malvolio?

289
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.430
He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner.

290
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.500
He is, sure, possessed, madam.

291
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.000
Why, what's the matter? does he rave?

292
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.930
No. madam, he does nothing but smile:

293
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.270
your ladyship were best to have some guard about you,

294
00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:26.300
if he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.

295
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:31.930
Go call him hither.

296
00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.370
I am as mad as he,

297
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:39.800
If sad and merry madness equal be.

298
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.770
How now, Malvolio!

299
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.070
Sweet lady, ho, ho.

300
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.200
Smilest thou?

301
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.530
I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.

302
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:54.970
Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some

303
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.270
obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering;

304
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.430
but what of that? if it please the eye of one,

305
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.900
it is with me as the very true sonnet is,

306
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.870
'Please one, and please all.'

307
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:09.100
Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?

308
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.830
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs.

309
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:20.100
It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed:

310
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:23.330
I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.

311
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.030
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?

312
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:31.470
To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.

313
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.370
God comfort thee!

314
00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:36.730
Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft?

315
00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.800
How do you, Malvolio?

316
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.530
At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.

317
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.330
Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness

318
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.500
before my lady?

319
00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.100
'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.

320
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.830
What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?

321
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.000
'Some are born great,'--

322
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.800
Ha!

323
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.000
'Some achieve greatness,'--

324
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.470
What sayest thou?

325
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.430
'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'

326
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.030
Heaven restore thee!

327
00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.670
'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--

328
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:02.200
Thy yellow stockings!

329
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.430
'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'

330
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.600
Cross-gartered!

331
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.830
'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--

332
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.470
Am I made?

333
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.000
'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'

334
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.430
Why, this is very midsummer madness.

335
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.230
Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is returned:

336
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.670
I could hardly entreat him back:

337
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.530
he attends your ladyship's pleasure.

338
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.200
I'll come to him.

339
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.930
Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to.

340
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.000
Where's my cousin Toby?

341
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.870
Let some of my people have a special care of him:

342
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.300
I would not have him miscarry

343
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.400
for the half of my dowry.

344
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.970
O, ho! do you come near me now?

345
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:47.070
no worse man than Sir Toby to look to me!

346
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:49.670
This concurs directly with the letter:

347
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.600
she sends him on purpose,

348
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.030
that I may appear stubborn to him;

349
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.830
for she incites me to that in the letter.

350
00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.270
'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;

351
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.270
'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;

352
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.700
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state;

353
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.470
put thyself into the trick of singularity;'

354
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:09.570
and consequently sets down the manner how;

355
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.730
as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue,

356
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.730
in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth.

357
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:23.030
I have limed her; but it is Jove's doing,

358
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:30.000
and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now,

359
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.270
'Let this fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio,

360
00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.600
nor after my degree, but fellow.

361
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.300
Why, every thing adheres together,

362
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.200
that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple,

363
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.270
no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumsta--

364
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.930
What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me

365
00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.000
and the full prospect of my hopes.

366
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.400
Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this,

367
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400
and he is to be thanked.

368
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.330
Which way is he, in the name of sanctity?

369
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.370
If all the devils of hell be drawn in little,

370
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.100
and Legion himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.

371
00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.600
Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?

372
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.730
how is't with you, man?

373
00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:33.070
Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go off.

374
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.700
Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him!

375
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.800
did not I tell you?

376
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.270
Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a care of him.

377
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.230
Ah, ha! does she so?

378
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:47.130
Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently with him:

379
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:51.430
let me alone. How do you, Malvolio?

380
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.600
how is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:

381
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.670
consider, he's an enemy to mankind.

382
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.300
Do you know what you say?

383
00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.170
La you, an you speak ill of the devil,

384
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.770
how he takes it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!

385
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.800
Carry his water to the wise woman.

386
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.500
Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I live.

387
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.600
My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.

388
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.530
How now, mistress!

389
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:11.670
O Lord!

390
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.030
Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way:

391
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.270
do you not see you move him? let me alone with him.

392
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:21.130
No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is rough,

393
00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:25.500
and will not be roughly used.

394
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.470
Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?

395
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:31.530
Sir!

396
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.930
Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby,

397
00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:33.970
get him to pray.

398
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:35.370
My prayers, minx!

399
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.300
No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.

400
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.800
Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow things:

401
00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.230
I am not of your element:

402
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.870
you shall know more hereafter.

403
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:54.630
(laughing)

404
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.170
Is't possible?

405
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.330
If this were played upon a stage now,

406
00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.330
I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.

407
00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:03.570
His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.

408
00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.270
Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.

409
00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.130
Why, we shall make him mad indeed.

410
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.270
The house will be the quieter.

411
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.000
Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound.

412
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.830
My niece is already in the belief that he's mad:

413
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.170
we may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,

414
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.130
till our very pastime, tired out of breath,

415
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.730
prompt us to have mercy on him:

416
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.630
at which time we will bring the device to the bar

417
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:28.130
and crown thee for a finder of madmen.

418
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:29.670
But see, but see.

419
00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.600
More matter for a May morning.

420
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.100
Here's the challenge, read it:

421
00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.970
warrant there's vinegar and pepper in't.

422
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:35.970
Is't so saucy?

423
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.800
Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.

424
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.430
Give me.

425
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:46.470
'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'

426
00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.600
Good, and valiant.

427
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.530
'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,

428
00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:53.170
why I do call thee so,

429
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.700
for I will show thee no reason for't.'

430
00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.370
A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.

431
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.000
'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my sight

432
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.500
she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat;

433
00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.570
that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'

434
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.830
Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.

435
00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:14.330
'I will waylay thee going home;

436
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.070
where if it be thy chance to kill me,'--

437
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.170
Good.

438
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.070
'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'

439
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:21.870
Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.

440
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.330
'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon

441
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.770
one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine;

442
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.670
but my hope is better, and so look to thyself.

443
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:34.230
Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,

444
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.330
ANDREW AGUECHEEK.

445
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.430
If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:

446
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.270
I'll give't him.

447
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:42.570
You may have very fit occasion for't:

448
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.970
he is now in some commerce with my lady,

449
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:45.200
and will by and by depart.

450
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.400
Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the orchard

451
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.100
like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest him,

452
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.670
draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible;

453
00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:57.500
for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath,

454
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.230
with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off,

455
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.770
gives manhood more approbation

456
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.700
than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away!

457
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.470
Nay, let me alone for swearing.

458
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:19.370
Now will not I deliver his letter:

459
00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.900
for the behavior of the young gentleman

460
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.530
gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding;

461
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.730
his employment between his lord and my niece

462
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.430
confirms no less:

463
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.930
therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant,

464
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.300
will breed no terror in the youth:

465
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.170
he will find it comes from a clodpole.

466
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:39.430
But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth;

467
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.900
set upon Aguecheek a notable report of valour;

468
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.530
and drive the gentleman, as I know his

469
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.630
youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous

470
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.970
opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.

471
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.070
This will so fright them both that they will kill

472
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.300
one another by the look, like cockatrices.

473
00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.600
I have said too much unto a heart of stone

474
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.470
And laid mine honour too unchary out:

475
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.170
There's something in me that reproves my fault;

476
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.300
But such a headstrong potent fault it is,

477
00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.800
That it but mocks reproof.

478
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:14.100
With the same 'havior that your passion bears

479
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.530
Goes on my master's grief.

480
00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:20.430
Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;

481
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:24.500
Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;

482
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.000
And I beseech you come again to-morrow.

483
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.800
What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,

484
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.600
That honour saved may upon asking give?

485
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.370
Nothing but this; your true love for my master.

486
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.270
How with mine honour may I give him that

487
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.630
Which I have given to you?

488
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.670
I will acquit you.

489
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.970
Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:

490
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.930
A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.

491
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.200
Gentleman, God save thee.

492
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.170
And you, sir.

493
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.970
That defence thou hast, betake thee to't:

494
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.870
of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not;

495
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.800
but thy intercepter, full of despite,

496
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.830
bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:

497
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.470
dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation,

498
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.030
for thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.

499
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.600
You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me:

500
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.770
my remembrance is very free

501
00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:21.430
and clear from any image of offence done to any man.

502
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.300
You'll find it otherwise, I assure you:

503
00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.670
therefore, if you hold your life at any price,

504
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.800
betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him

505
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.570
what youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.

506
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.900
I pray you, sir, what is he?

507
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.770
He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier

508
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:41.670
and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl:

509
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.030
souls and bodies hath he divorced three;

510
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:46.530
and his incensement at this moment is so implacable,

511
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.770
that satisfaction can be none

512
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.130
but by pangs of death and sepulchre.

513
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:56.130
Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.

514
00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.370
I will return again into the house

515
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.400
and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter.

516
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:05.030
I have heard of some kind of men

517
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.600
that put quarrels purposely on others, to taste their valour:

518
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.870
belike this is a man of that quirk.

519
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:12.130
Sir, no;

520
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.300
his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury:

521
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.300
therefore, get you on and give him his desire.

522
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.700
Back you shall not to the house,

523
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.770
unless you undertake that with me

524
00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.070
which with as much safety you might answer him:

525
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:27.730
therefore, on, or strip your sword stark naked;

526
00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.170
for meddle you must, that's certain,

527
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.570
or forswear to wear iron about you.

528
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:35.200
This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you,

529
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.530
do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight

530
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.870
what my offence to him is: it is something of my

531
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.400
negligence, nothing of my purpose.

532
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.530
I will do so.

533
00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:55.670
Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return.

534
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.730
Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?

535
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.930
I know the knight is incensed against you,

536
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.270
even to a mortal arbitrement;

537
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.470
but nothing of the circumstance more.

538
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.070
I beseech you, what manner of man is he?

539
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.100
Nothing of that wonderful promise,

540
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.300
to read him by his form,

541
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:33.870
as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour.

542
00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.730
He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,

543
00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:38.770
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly

544
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.030
have found in any part of Illyria.

545
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.530
Will you walk towards him?

546
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.270
I will make your peace with him if I can.

547
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.470
I shall be much bound to you for't:

548
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.700
I am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight:

549
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.930
I care not who knows so much of my mettle.

550
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.530
Why, man, he's a very devil;

551
00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.700
I have not seen such a firago.

552
00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.830
I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and all,

553
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.300
and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion,

554
00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.670
that it is inevitable; and on the answer,

555
00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:08.500
he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground

556
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.970
they step on.

557
00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.300
They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.

558
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.600
Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.

559
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.770
Ay, but he will not now be pacified:

560
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.670
Fabian can scarce hold him yonder.

561
00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.030
Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant

562
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:20.300
and so cunning in fence,

563
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.030
I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld have challenged him.

564
00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.270
Let him let the matter slip,

565
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.830
and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.

566
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:33.000
I'll make the motion:

567
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:40.800
stand here, make a good show on't:

568
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.670
this shall end without the perdition of souls.

569
00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.130
Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.

570
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.570
I have his horse to take up the quarrel:

571
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.530
I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.

572
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.730
He is as horribly conceited of him;

573
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.870
and pants and looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.

574
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.770
There's no remedy, sir;

575
00:26:57.770 --> 00:26:59.600
he will fight with you for's oath sake:

576
00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.430
marry, he hath better bethought him of his quarrel,

577
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:05.300
and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of:

578
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.830
therefore draw, for the supportance of his vow;

579
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.430
he protests he will not hurt you.

580
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.430
Pray God defend me! A little thing would

581
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.830
make me tell them how much I lack of a man.

582
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:20.700
Give ground, if you see him furious.

583
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.700
Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy;

584
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.870
the gentleman will,

585
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.930
for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;

586
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:27.930
he cannot by the duello avoid it:

587
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.000
but he has promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier,

588
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
he will not hurt you. Come on; to't.

589
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.330
Pray God, he keep his oath!

590
00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.700
I do assure you, 'tis against my will.

591
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.630
Put up your sword. If this young gentleman

592
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.830
Have done offence, I take the fault on me:

593
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.770
If you offend him, I for him defy you.

594
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.700
You, sir! why, what are you?

595
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.500
One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more

596
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.470
Than you have heard him brag to you he will.

597
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:23.400
Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.

598
00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:34.930
O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.

599
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.530
I'll be with you anon.

600
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:39.430
Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.

601
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.170
Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,

602
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:42.430
I'll be as good as my word:

603
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.670
he will bear you easily and reins well.

604
00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:49.030
This is the man; do thy office.

605
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.730
Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.

606
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:52.800
You do mistake me, sir.

607
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.900
No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,

608
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.930
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.

609
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.070
Take him away: he knows I know him well.

610
00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:03.400
I must obey.

611
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.570
This comes with seeking you:

612
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:10.530
But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.

613
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.470
What will you do, now my necessity

614
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.800
Makes me to ask you for my purse?

615
00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.230
It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you

616
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:19.030
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;

617
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.530
But be of comfort.

618
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.700
Come, sir, away.

619
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.500
I must entreat of you some of that money.

620
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.800
What money, sir?

621
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.830
For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,

622
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:35.200
And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,

623
00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.700
Out of my lean and low ability

624
00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.800
I'll lend you something: my having is not much;

625
00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.630
I'll make division of my present with you:

626
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.870
Hold, there's half my coffer.

627
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:47.070
Will you deny me now?

628
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.370
Is't possible that my deserts to you

629
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.200
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,

630
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.500
Lest that it make me so unsound a man

631
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.170
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses

632
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:55.270
That I have done for you.

633
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.600
I know of none;

634
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.730
Nor know I you by voice or any feature:

635
00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.370
I hate ingratitude more in a man

636
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.900
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,

637
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.070
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption

638
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.530
Inhabits our frail blood.

639
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.100
O heavens themselves!

640
00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.570
Come, sir, I pray you, go.

641
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:15.730
Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here

642
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.370
I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,

643
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.400
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,

644
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.130
And to his image, which methought did promise

645
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:27.270
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.

646
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:29.770
What's that to us? The time goes by: away!

647
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:33.400
But O how vile an idol proves this god

648
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.930
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.

649
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.330
In nature there's no blemish but the mind;

650
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.130
None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:

651
00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.430
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil

652
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:50.200
Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.

653
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.470
The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.

654
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.270
Lead me on.

655
00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:58.970
Methinks his words do from such passion fly,

656
00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.130
That he believes himself: so do not I.

657
00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:05.770
Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,

658
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.600
That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!

659
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.500
Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian:

660
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.500
He named Sebastian: I my brother know

661
00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.430
Yet living in my glass; even such and so

662
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.330
In favour was my brother, and he went

663
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:20.900
Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,

664
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.830
For him I imitate: O, if it prove,

665
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:32.270
Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.

666
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:38.200
A very dishonest paltry boy,

667
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.770
and more a coward than a hare:

668
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.000
his dishonesty appears in leaving his

669
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.170
friend here in necessity and denying him;

670
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.230
and for his cowardship, ask Fabian.

671
00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.970
A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.

672
00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:50.970
'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.

673
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:54.770
Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.

674
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:55.930
An I do not,--

675
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:56.970
Come, let's see the event.

676
00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:04.330
I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.

677
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.430
