00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.260
MAN: I often wonder

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.730
what man will do
with the mountains.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.300
Will he cut down all the trees
to make ships and houses?

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.930
If so, what will be the final
and far upshot?

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.530
Will a better civilization come
in accord with obvious nature,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.430
and all this wild beauty
be set to human poetry and song?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.560
What is the human part of
the mountains' destiny?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.700
John Muir.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.060
MAN: Yes, it's transcendent,
just as walking into a cathedral

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.130
is transcendent.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.660
But what could be more cathedral
in feel than Yosemite Valley

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.160
or the Grand Canyon?

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.200
I mean, John Muir--I think he

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.700
thought it was somewhat ironic

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.160
that there's a chapel

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.500
in Yosemite Valley

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.000
because you're building a church

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.160
in the greatest cathedral
in America.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.930
And I think that when people
go into these spaces,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.900
they find that
they have enough spirit

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.400
that they can fill the space

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.530
and they can be filled
by those spaces.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.960
PETER COYOTE: By 1914,
the national park idea

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.430
had expanded beyond
Yellowstone and Yosemite,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.900
where the notion of setting
aside special places

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.930
for all Americans had
first taken root

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.260
half a century earlier.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.100
Parks could now be found
surrounding

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.300
snowcapped Mount Rainier
in the Pacific Northwest;

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.960
at the ancient cliff dwellings
of Mesa Verde

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.800
in the Southwestern deserts;

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.700
within the dark caverns
of South Dakota's Wind Cave;

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.300
in the reflection
of the deep blue waters

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.560
of Crater Lake in Oregon;

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.730
and at half a dozen other
locations the nation had decided

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.400
to preserve,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.730
usually at the urging of
individual Americans

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.900
willing to turn their passion
for a particular landscape

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.460
into a crusade.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.160
MAN: There is no master plan
whatsoever for these parks.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.830
What's happening is that people
are identifying

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.360
interesting places that look

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.860
like they're under
some kind of threat

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.330
or look like they

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.830
might be worth preserving.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.300
And a law gets written,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.330
a park gets created, and, boom,
it's added to the set.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.960
But the set is not a system.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.460
The set has no coherence to it.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.260
There are no regular rules for
governing it all.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.900
It was pretty chaotic
in the early years.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.100
COYOTE: The Departments of
Agriculture, Interior, and War

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.960
each claimed some responsibility
for the parks.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.000
But in truth,
no one was in charge.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.430
Nothing proved it more

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.560
than the fact that
the city of San Francisco

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.530
had been given permission
to construct a dam

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.730
in Yosemite's
Hetch Hetchy Valley,

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:40.900
and submerge a scenic wonder
under a massive water reservoir.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.730
MAN: Hetch Hetchy was
a crucial turning point

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.400
in the history
of the national parks

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.330
because a valley was lost.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.030
A beautiful valley was lost.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.800
It was a pebble that dropped
in everybody's pool.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.660
To make them ask,

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.130
"What future do we want?

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.460
"Do we want there to be some
places where you go

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.130
"where things aren't necessarily
convenient

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:09.630
"and we don't measure

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.460
all of the greatness of the
United States in a ledger book?"

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.800
COYOTE: The battle over
Hetch Hetchy had been the last

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.630
for John Muir--the mountain
prophet who had done so much

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.400
to save the remaining vestiges
of pristine America.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.400
Now an unlikely alliance would
carry on in his name

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.860
and in his spirit.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.060
Railroad barons, who saw
in the parks

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.800
a chance to increase
their profits,

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.000
as well as some of the nation's
wealthiest men,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.400
who at a time when the disparity
between rich and poor

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.730
was growing as never before,
would heed a higher calling

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.460
and use their fortunes to
advance the public good.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.660
The national park idea
was nearly 50 years old,

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.260
but some of the nation's most
spectacular landscapes were

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.960
still unprotected,
vulnerable

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.800
to the acquisitive
and extractive energies

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.430
that 20th-century America
possessed in such abundance.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.700
Special places in every corner
of America were threatened.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.430
Volcanic islands in the Pacific,

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:25.160
where the most elemental forces
of nature were still on display,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.200
and along the Atlantic seaboard
of New England,

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.300
a much smaller island treasured
for its bucolic tranquility,

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.430
the continent's highest
mountain rising

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.300
from the tundra of Alaska--

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.100
the nation's most remote
territory...

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.730
and in the deserts of Arizona,
a mile-deep gash in the Earth,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.960
a canyon of equally
indescribable immensity

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.400
and beauty.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.330
In John Muir's absence, a new
leader would step forward--

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.300
an impulsive and seemingly
self-confident businessman,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.130
who would promote the parks
as never before,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:13.300
and then struggle to bring them
under a single management.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.830
Where Muir had changed things
with his words,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:20.600
he would do it with his wealth
and connections.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.230
Where Muir had emphasized
the ecstatic,

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.200
he would emphasize the economic
and patriotic.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.230
But even more than John Muir,
Stephen Mather had

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.200
his own intensely
personal reason

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.130
that drew him to the parks.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.000
WOMAN: Our national parks are
not only our best idea,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.160
but our highest ideal.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.230
I think that every time we walk
into a national park,

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.400
we make vows.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.430
We make vows that we will live
beyond ourselves.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.930
We make vows

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:04.260
that we will not just care about
short-term gains,

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.430
but long-term vistas.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.300
We remember

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.130
the sweetness of engagement,

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.700
that this is

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.460
the open space of democracy.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.930
And it is, as John Muir
has reminded us,

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.830
the beginning of creation.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:37.430
COYOTE: Not far from Longs Peak
in Colorado

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.730
in the heart of
the Rocky Mountains was an inn

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.560
owned and operated

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:46.160
by an aspiring nature writer
named Enos Mills.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:51.260
Mills had first come to
the Rockies from Kansas

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.560
at age 14 on doctor's orders
that without clean alpine air,

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.830
he would not live to adulthood.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.230
Thirty years later,
he was still there

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.160
traipsing alone from
one mountain peak to another.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.330
Three times a week,
Mills lectured his guests,

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.060
extolling the beauty
of the Rockies

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.560
and crusading to have
the Longs Peak region preserved,

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.430
not for the rich or royalty,
who for years had been buying up

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:26.630
the surrounding area, but
for everyone as a national park.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.100
For his inspiration,
Mills credited John Muir.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.800
"I owe everything to Muir,"
he said.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.830
It was Muir's writings
and the chance encounter

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.730
with the famous man himself
that had given Mills' life

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.630
new purpose and direction.

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.260
"I will glory in your success,"

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.260
a sick and aging Muir
had written to Mills

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.030
as the younger man pushed
for a national park

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.400
in the Colorado Rockies.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.430
"Strange," Muir added,
"that the government is so slow

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.600
"to learn the value of parks."

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.730
But as congressional hearings
began, word arrived

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.430
that John Muir had died.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.200
"It will be a great courtesy

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.900
to the memory of that
grand old man,"

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.400
one person testified,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.230
"if you gentlemen
unanimously recommend

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.560
"creation of this park."

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.400
Congress agreed.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.400
Enos Mills' dream came true.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.730
Rocky Mountain National Park was
finally established.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.400
And for the rest of his life,
Mills would be called

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.830
the John Muir of the Rockies.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.830
MAN: I remember one afternoon
when I was 25, probably.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.200
I was in
Rocky Mountain National Park.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.660
And I started walking.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.900
I started climbing up
through a pine forest.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:03.030
And I thought, What would happen
if I never turned back?

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.800
What would happen if I

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.800
just kept walking?

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.030
Where would I end up?

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.960
Where would this trail take me?

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.530
I had no matches, no flashlight,

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.260
no poncho.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:22.200
I did turn back.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.960
But I still wonder
what would have happened

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.560
if I hadn't turned back.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.160
[Train bell clanging]

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.400
MAN AS STEPHEN MATHER: We have
as yet no national park system.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.830
The parks have just happened.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.860
Nowhere in official Washington
can an enquirer

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.360
find an office
of the national parks

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.960
or a desk devoted solely
to their management.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.860
Uncle Sam has simply not waked
up about his precious parks.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.900
COYOTE: In the summer of 1914,

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.430
a vacationing millionaire
named Stephen Mather visited

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.230
Sequoia and Yosemite
National Parks in California

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.200
and was disgusted
by what he saw.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.130
With only the army periodically
policing the parks,

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.800
hiking trails were
in poor condition.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:19.060
Cattle could still be found
grazing there,

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.130
and speculators had managed
to file claims

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.530
on choice parcels of land,

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.030
planning to log the sequoias
that Mather believed

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.660
should be protected forever.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.800
Mather dashed off
an angry letter

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.860
to an old college schoolmate--

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.400
Franklin K. Lane,
the secretary of the interior,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.560
whose standing
among conservationists

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.800
was already low since Lane had
personally approved construction

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.000
of the Hetch Hetchy dam.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.760
MAN AS FRANKLIN K. LANE:
Dear Steve, if you don't like

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.560
the way the national parks
are being run,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.100
why don't you come down
to Washington

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.700
and run them yourself?

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.100
COYOTE: Soon enough, Mather
showed up in Lane's office

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.800
and agreed to serve
as one of his assistants,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.800
overseeing the national parks.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200
A nationwide search
could not have found

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.630
a better man for the job.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.260
Tall and athletic
with prematurely white hair

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.630
and piercing blue eyes, Mather
possessed what reporters called

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.060
"incandescent enthusiasm
and an 8-cylinder,

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.130
"60-mile-per-hour sort of
personality."

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.460
WOMAN: To describe Mr. Mather,
one must roll

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.430
all the matinee idols into one

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.500
and then put the red blood of
a real man into him.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.000
He has the kindest of blue eyes,
as clear and frank as a child's,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.900
but the mouth and chin of a man
who has fought his way in life.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.330
"Woman's Magazine."

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.230
COYOTE: Born in California

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.660
to a family with deep patrician
roots in New England,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.500
Mather had taken a job
as a reporter

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.300
for the "New York Sun"

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.560
and then
moved on as a sales manager

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.400
for the Pacific Coast
Borax company,

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.100
where his special genius
for promotion found

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.430
a national outlet.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:10.730
He produced a flood of publicity
by glamorizing

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:13.900
the company's beginnings
in California's Death Valley.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.360
MAN: He took Death Valley
and made it a romantic place.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.160
He took Borax,
this household material,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.300
gave it the romantic name
20-mule team Borax.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.060
He would write letters

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.560
to magazines posing

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.030
as a contented housewife,

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.530
talking about

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.830
how her life had been
transformed by the use of Borax.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.030
He wasn't meeting a demand
for Borax,

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.230
He was creating a demand
for Borax.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.560
COYOTE: Mather
had quickly realized

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.230
he could make more money working
for himself

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.160
and helped
start a competing company.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:58.030
By 1914 at age 47, he was rich
beyond belief

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.030
and restless for
a new challenge.

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.630
Years earlier during a climb
up Mount Rainier,

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:09.200
he had discovered that during
the darkest moments of his life,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.730
time in the great outdoors
seemed to calm

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.760
his sometimes fragile nerves

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.660
and revive
his prodigious energies.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.600
And he counted as one
of the highlights of his life

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.930
meeting the legendary John Muir

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.430
on a hike
in Sequoia National Park.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.230
Mather told Secretary Lane he
would work for him,

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.400
but for only one year.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.100
He was assigned
a legal assistant

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.060
in the secretary's office--

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.560
a fellow Californian
and Berkeley graduate

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.700
named Horace Albright,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.130
an earnest and ambitious
young man

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:46.800
who had arrived in Washington
a year earlier so poor,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.460
he wore a borrowed suit and took
a room at the local YMCA.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.860
Like Mather and so many others,
Albright had also been inspired

00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:00.330
by a personal encounter
with John Muir.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:03.960
But much of his work so far
had been spent responding

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.800
to angry letters protesting
the decision

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.600
to flood
the Hetch Hetchy Valley.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.630
MAN AS HORACE ALBRIGHT:
I had to learn to counterfeit

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:15.130
Lane's signature and sign
letters in reply,

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.630
trying to explain why the dam
should be built.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:23.460
I hated this job, for I was
in sympathy with the protests.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.760
COYOTE: Albright had been
intending to quit

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:29.330
and returned to California
to practice law, when Mather

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.800
entered his life and persuaded
him to stay for one more year.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.260
MAN AS ALBRIGHT:
I was knowledgeable

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.100
about Washington,
the Interior Department,

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.600
and the Congress,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.960
was quite good at detail
and administrative work,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.060
which he obviously hated,

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:47.900
and above all, was loyal
and conscientious.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:53.900
He was 47. I was only 24
and a bit in awe of him.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:56.930
MAN: Mather was a great
conceptualizer,

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:01.160
and Horace was
a great implementer.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:02.760
They complemented each other

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.130
like father, like son.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:09.630
I mean, he was the reverse side
of the same coin.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.000
COYOTE: After being sworn in,
Mather's first action was

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.260
to more than double
Horace Albright's yearly pay

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.460
with $2,400 from his own pocket.

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:23.230
Next, he hired
Robert Sterling Yard,

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.560
a gifted editor of
the "New York Herald"

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.860
to begin churning out a flurry
of publicity for the parks,

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:34.060
luring Yard to Washington with
the promise of $5,000 a year

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.960
and a personal secretary,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.500
all of it paid for by Mather,
not the government.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.400
MAN: Stephen Mather was
the right man in the right place

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.100
at the right time--

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.930
wildly enthusiastic about
the national parks,

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.230
plus a millionaire
who could speak

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.400
to all the millionaire
industrialists

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.860
who were developing the parks,
namely the railroads.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.030
Preservationists themselves
during the period

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:00.460
are asking for more cooperation

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.860
with the railroads,

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:03.660
more responsible development of
the national parks

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.000
to keep at bay the argument that
"nobody goes here."

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.700
Because the Hetch Hetchy Valley
had only 2,000 visitors a year,

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.360
the argument was used
against it.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.930
It was said that only effeminate
members of the Sierra Club camp

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.530
in Hetch Hetchy Valley,

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.960
but 500,000 people from
San Francisco could get

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:21.730
a drink out of it.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.060
And Stephen Mather understands
that if he doesn't get people

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:29.500
in the parks, if he doesn't get
500,000 people visiting a park

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.760
in his own right, he's going
to lose out to the arguments

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.900
when the dams and reservoirs
come down the pike.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.930
COYOTE: Mather wined and dined
congressmen and senators,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:45.300
newspaper
and magazine publishers,

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.260
pushed through legislation that
would allow private individuals

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.460
to make gifts of land and money
to the parks,

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.500
and began making plans
for a whirlwind inspection tour

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.330
of the national treasures now
entrusted to his care.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.860
MAN AS ALBRIGHT: With
ideas popping from Mather's head

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.700
every minute, he simply couldn't
sit still at a desk

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.660
and handle details.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:11.300
Talking over an idea
meant listening,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:15.600
while he restlessly paced,
gesturing to make his points,

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.500
his words barely keeping up with
his mile-a-minute brain.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.500
I thanked my stars I was young,
strong, and healthy.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.930
His energy would have killed
someone who wasn't.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.330
COYOTE: Before 1915 ended,
Mather and Albright would travel

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.960
nearly 35,000 miles.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.730
In Colorado, they were there
with Enos Mills

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:42.730
and a crowd of 300

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.900
for the dedication
of Rocky Mountain National Park.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.200
At Mount Rainier in
Washington State, Mather decided

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.860
the superintendent
was a political hack

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.100
and fired him on the spot.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.660
At Yosemite, he learned that
the 56-mile long Tioga Road,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.800
the only east-west road
through the park,

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.030
was still in private hands
and in terrible disrepair.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.100
Mather got out his checkbook
again, putting up

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.830
half of the $15,500 price tag

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:25.260
and raising an equal amount from
wealthy friends.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.260
Then he just
as quickly gave it away

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.700
to become part
of the park forever.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.600
And during a brief visit
with Horace Albright

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:39.360
to the Grand Canyon,
still only a national monument

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.200
and still under the control
of the Forest Service,

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.730
Mather became convinced that it
needed greater protection.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.630
"Make this unbelievable wonder
your next national park,"

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:51.930
he said.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.860
MAN AS ALBRIGHT: It seemed
impossible

00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:58.200
that every new national park
appeared more spectacular

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.300
than the last,
or at least more unusual.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.760
[Wind]

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.960
As I stood gaping at the awesome
beauty, Mather joined me.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.600
[Thunder]

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.330
Neither of us spoke
for some time.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.000
Then I heard him say, "Horace,
what God-given opportunity

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.230
"has come our way to preserve
wonders like these before us."

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:31.460
COYOTE: Mather invited a group
of 15 influential Americans--

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:35.130
prominent editors
and publishers, politicians,

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.900
leading businessmen,
and railroad builders--

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:41.830
to join him for two weeks in
the Sierra Nevada of California.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.460
He called it
his Mather mountain party.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.130
And he paid for it all, from
the newfangled air mattresses

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:11.530
placed under their sleeping bags

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.400
to a Chinese cook, who brought
along a sheet-metal stove

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.560
to prepare gourmet dinners.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.500
Breakfasts included fresh fruit,
steak, eggs, sausages,

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:25.200
and hot, freshly-baked rolls.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:26.730
Suppers were capped off

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:31.360
by English plum pudding with
brandy sauce, all of it served

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:36.030
on white linen tablecloths
with fine silverware and china.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.860
GEORGE HARTZOG: He had two
concepts--pressing the flesh.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.760
You got to go meet them
in person. Don't write to them.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.000
Go shake their hands.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.400
And secondly, go show it to them
because you don't get anywhere

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.730
just telling them about it.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.500
They got to experience it
like you have.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.600
And he made converts.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.830
And he took people,
not the parishioners

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:09.860
who were singing in the choir,

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.230
but the members
who didn't go to church yet.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.160
He was bringing them
to the parks

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.100
and putting them in the choir.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.960
COYOTE: Coming across
a campsite littered

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.400
with tin cans and paper, he got
his wealthy friends

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.560
to help pick up the mess.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.330
They spent a night
at Redwood Meadow,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:32.730
just outside the boundary
of Sequoia National Park,

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:36.100
amidst a privately-owned stand
of majestic trees

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.760
Mather could not bear to think
might be cut down.

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.600
He bought the grove and donated
it to the nation.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.660
Slowly, the group worked its way

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.760
up the western flank
of the Sierra,

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:53.430
fishing, hiking, and swimming in
cold mountain streams.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.830
Then the hardiest of the bunch
decided to ascend Mount Whitney.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:05.500
At 14,494 feet, the tallest
peak in the 48 states,

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.660
from which they could survey
the vast wilderness John Muir,

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.930
and now Mather,
wanted preserved.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.000
By the end of their two weeks
in the outdoors, Albright said,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.300
everyone in the party "looked
like a caveman,"

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.660
but his boss had converted
them all

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.160
into disciples for his cause.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.200
And when they gathered for their
last meal together,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.360
he sent them on their way
with an exhortation.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.430
MAN AS MATHER:
Now, I want you to know

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.060
that our job is not over.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:38.100
It is just beginning.

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:42.800
Remember that God has given us
these beautiful lands,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.930
but none of this will
mean anything unless we have

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.700
a safe haven
for these wilderness places.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.400
We must have
a National Park Service.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.930
Every one
of us must pull our oar,

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.160
go out and spread the gospel.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.000
DAYTON DUNCAN: He had met
John Muir,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.460
and he knew the ecstasy
that Muir had talked about.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.530
He knew the healing power
of nature, but he added to that

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.460
this notion of patriotism.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.360
He called the parks "vast
schoolrooms of Americanism,"

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.630
that if you bring a person
to a park, they will feel better

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.960
about the nation that was saving
this place.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.930
He was willing to wrap the park
idea in the American flag,

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.760
and perhaps somewhat justly so,

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.330
but he also saw it as
a tool to help promote the parks

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.130
and to get the political support
he needed

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:39.860
to do the things
he wanted to do.

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.730
MAN: Napi, the old man, came
down from his home in the sun,

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.360
to help his people,
the Blackfeet.

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:07.000
When his work was done, he went
up into the mountains,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.930
where he came to two lakes.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.700
There he said to himself,
"I believe I will go up

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.930
"on that highest mountain
and change myself into stone."

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:22.830
In the crevice in the mountain,
he lay down

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:27.360
with just his face peeking out
and turned himself into a rock.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.830
He is still there, watching for
people to come looking for him.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.360
COYOTE: On the border
of Montana and Canada

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.660
in the northern reaches
of the Rockies,

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.330
where glaciers could
still be found

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.200
sculpting and polishing
mountains

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.600
rising 10,000 feet into the sky

00:27:54.600 --> 00:28:00.500
and alpine cascades tumbled down
to form more than 650 lakes,

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:05.460
was Glacier National Park--
established by Congress in 1910.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.300
For centuries, the Blackfeet
Indians had claimed the land

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.230
as their own.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.330
But during a mining boom that
brought in

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.060
swarms of prospectors,
they had been pressured

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:21.000
into signing a new treaty,
giving up the mountain portion

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.230
of their reservation.

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.930
MAN: The mountains have been
my last refuge.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:32.900
Chief mountain is my head.
Now my head is cut off.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.200
White Calf.

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.960
MAN: When you walk
into any natural national park,

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.760
you're walking
into somebody's homeland.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.430
You're walking
into somebody's house.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:44.600
You're walking

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.930
into somebody's church.

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.360
You're walking

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.100
into somebody's place,
where they've lived

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.630
since the time the Creator made
it for them.

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.630
And so you're walking into
someplace that has been utilized

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:58.460
for generations upon generations
in every form you could imagine.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.860
This was our homeland.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.300
COYOTE: When Congress failed
to appropriate adequate funds

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.600
for Glacier National Park's
administration,

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:12.360
the Great Northern Railway felt
free to treat the park

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.360
as its own little
mountain kingdom.

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.600
From the very beginnings
of the park movement,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.900
long before Stephen Mather burst
upon the scene,

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.260
railroad companies had been
busily selling America's parks.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.700
More tourists riding the rails
meant more money for them.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.930
ALFRED RUNTE: The railroads make
scenery a national asset.

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.360
They make scenery
a national business.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.500
Every railroad tried to have
a national park that would be

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.860
its very own.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.460
So the Santa Fe develops
the Grand Canyon

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.430
and wants it to be
a full-fledged national park.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.360
Northern Pacific
is in Yellowstone.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.460
Union Pacific will come
to West Yellowstone.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.730
The Great Northern Railway will
go to Glacier.

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.860
Northern Pacific will also go
out to Mount Rainier.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:02.930
The Great Northern Railway will
follow it out to Mount Rainier.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:07.830
The Southern Pacific will
develop Yosemite and Sequoia.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:12.160
Their land agents, their people,
their passenger agents will be

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.030
in the halls of Congress,
cajoling Congress silently

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.700
from the wings.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.600
"Make national parks, so we can
have more tourists going

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.100
"to the national parks and have

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.060
"this new and wonderful
industry."

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:28.030
COYOTE: On every Great Northern
Railway brochure and timetable,

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:31.800
on every company press release
and billboard,

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:36.730
3 words were always attached,
"See America first."

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.630
Western boosters had been using

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.060
the slogan
for more than a decade,

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.030
part of a promotional campaign

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.700
aimed at a very specific
audience---

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:52.600
upper middle class
white Americans,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.600
predominantly
from the East Coast,

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.900
who were spending an estimated
$500 million each year

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.030
vacationing in Europe.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.200
RUNTE: "You want cathedrals?

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.360
"We've got them
in Yosemite Valley.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.900
"You want to see

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.230
"the architecture here?

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.430
"We've got it

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.260
"at the Grand Canyon.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.960
"Why are you Americans going to
Europe to spend

"your hard-earned dollars
over there

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:20.030
"when you have the Alps right
here in Glacier National Park?"

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.760
"Spend your dollars at home.
Be patriotic."

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.800
[Man yodeling on soundtrack]

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.930
COYOTE: The Great Northern liked
to promote Glacier National Park

00:31:31.930 --> 00:31:33.900
as America's Switzerland.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.000
When World War I broke out in
Europe in 1914, closing off

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.700
overseas travel, the railroads
saw a golden opportunity.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.130
The Great Northern dispatched
a group of Blackfeet Indians

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:06.860
to tour the East.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:08.360
They camped in teepees

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.500
on the roof of New York City's
McAlpin hotel,

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.830
rode the subway, and visited
the Brooklyn Bridge,

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:19.160
attracted huge crowds when they
performed war dances

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.330
at the annual
Travel and Vacation show.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.560
Everywhere they went, the press
referred to them

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.360
not as the Blackfeet

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.030
but as the Indians of
Glacier National Park.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.460
Blackfeet Indians were paid
to greet arriving passengers

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.060
in full regalia,

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.960
and they set up an array of
teepees for those who wanted

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.930
what the railroad called "an
authentic Western experience"

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.260
at 50 cents a night.

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.960
GERARD BAKER: In the early
days of the national parks,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.760
the Indians were brought back

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.900
not as a people who would tell
a story,

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:01.160
but as somebody who can dance
for the tourists,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.860
as somebody who
can sing for the tourists,

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.500
with their feathers,
their markings on their faces,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.260
their buckskin outfits,
their bells, their drums.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.600
They were expected to be
the Indian--to sing, to dance,

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.000
and to use the terms
that the tourists would be using

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.160
in those days.
For example, "How."

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.560
That's all they would say...

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.200
and then do their dances.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.830
COYOTE: While some park purists
worried that the railroads

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:34.230
already wielded too much
influence,

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:37.430
Stephen Mather saw them
as partners,

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.460
not only to promote the parks,
but to help him in his quest

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:44.030
to create
a separate park service.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.030
DUNCAN: If you think of Mather

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:49.160
as sort of an acolyte
of John Muir

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.330
but taking things into
a new direction.

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:55.400
He did remember from John Muir,
"Nothing dollarable is safe."

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.730
And so how do you make it safe?
You make it dollarable

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:06.030
by saying, "OK, there
is this value to national parks

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:09.060
"beyond the beauty,
beyond the sentimentality,

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.830
"beyond spirituality.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.160
"There's a dollar value to it.

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.100
"We've always had the railroads.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:19.130
"And if we attach that to it,
we can get chambers of commerce,

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.500
"and we can form this movement

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.230
"that will protect the parks."

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.700
And what's interesting about it
is while he's pushing

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:32.560
this sort of economic argument
as far and as hard as he can,

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.100
no one was an example
of the healing power,

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.660
the spiritual power,

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:40.100
the rejuvenation of being in
a national park

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:41.700
more than Stephen Mather.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.800
MAN AS MARK TWAIN: I turned
my eyes upon the volcano again.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.330
For a mile and a half
in front of us

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:15.500
and half a mile on either side,

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.760
the floor of the abyss
was magnificently illuminated.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.430
Like the campfires of a great
army far away,

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.460
it looked like
a colossal railroad map

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.800
of the state of Massachusetts
done in chain lightning

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.230
on a midnight sky.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:37.200
Imagine it.
Imagine a coal black sky

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:40.660
shivered into a tangled
network of angry fire.

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.500
I thought it possible that its
like had not been seen

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.930
since the children of Israel
wandered on their long march

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.430
through the desert

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:54.630
over a path illuminated by
the mysterious pillar of fire.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:00.660
And I was sure that I now had
a vivid conception

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.860
of what the majestic pillar of
fire was like,

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:07.460
which almost amounted
to a revelation.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.060
The smell of sulfur is strong,
but not unpleasant

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.000
to a sinner.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.430
Mark Twain.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:25.400
COYOTE: Back in 1866, a young
newspaper reporter writing

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.260
under the pen name
Mark Twain had been

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.560
among the first tourists to stay
at the new Volcano House

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.200
on the rim of Kilauea--

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.760
an active volcano on Hawaii's
big island,

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.300
the home, according to native
Hawaiians, of Pele--

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.100
the goddess of
destruction and creation.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.900
Twain's colorful descriptions
helped launch his career

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.560
and brought the islands'
attractions to the attention

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.300
of thousands of Americans.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.800
"Compared to the huge
caldera of Kilauea

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.260
"with its lakes of fire,"
Twain wrote,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.500
"Italy's Mount Vesuvius was just
a soup kettle."

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.460
The nearby Mauna Loa,
also an active volcano,

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.900
was even bigger, rising
56,000 feet

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:24.100
from the bottom of the Pacific--
13,679 of them above sea level--

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.260
the most massive mountain
on Earth.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.260
And on the island of Maui
was the dormant volcano called

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.360
Haleakala, the house of the sun.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.800
Twain climbed
to its 10,000-foot summit,

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.100
peered into
its vast and desolate crater,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.600
and with his companions,

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.600
spent the afternoon idly pushing
boulders off the edge,

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.560
simply to watch them tumble
thousands of feet

00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.060
to the crater's floor.

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.760
"It was magnificent sport,"
he wrote.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.900
"We wore ourselves out at it."

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:00.060
After camping
on the crater's edge,

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:03.330
they awoke early the next
morning with a blanket of clouds

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.160
far below their feet,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.160
stretching endlessly
across the Pacific

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.160
toward the rising sun.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.830
MAN AS TWAIN: I felt
like the last man,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:18.530
neglected of the judgment and
left pinnacled in mid-Heaven--

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.600
a forgotten relic of
a vanished world.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:31.760
COYOTE: By 1916, 50 years
after Twain's visit,

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.660
tourists were now coming in ever
greater numbers

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.830
to gawk at Kilauea's
fiery displays.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:42.260
As proof that they had
been there, some would break off

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:46.300
stalactites in the lava caves or
singe their post cards

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.800
by extending them
into the furnace-hot fissures.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.060
At Haleakala, the only place
in the world

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.030
where the distinctive
silver sword plant grows,

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:02.900
taking half a century to mature,
so many visitors

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.660
had gotten into the habit of
carrying them off as souvenirs

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.400
that the species was threatened
with extinction.

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:17.400
On August 1, 1916, after
more than a decade of lobbying

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.730
by a coalition of naturalists
and scientists,

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:22.500
businessmen and boosters,

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.100
and the enthusiastic support
of Stephen Mather,

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:28.460
Hawaii National Park was born.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:33.930
But Congress declined
to appropriate any money for it

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:36.760
on the belief,
one senator explained,

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.760
"that it should not
cost anything to run a volcano."

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:46.100
DUNCAN: I think one of the most
memorable moments of my life was

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.360
walking out onto the lava fields
at Hawaii Volcanoes.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.830
And this field off
in the distance had

00:39:54.830 --> 00:40:00.260
these glowing ribbons of light.

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.800
And we walked in the darkness
over the lava fields

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.560
and came over this rise.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.430
And there was
the coast of Hawaii.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:23.230
And over it was flowing
a waterfall of lava,

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.700
pouring over the top,

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.600
and creating steam down
in the bottom.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.700
And as the sun came up,
we walked farther and farther

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.800
until we got to that place.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.960
There was heat. There
was this acid smell in the air,

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.800
sometimes almost overpowering.

00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:50.760
But there you were watching
new land.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.500
For an Iowan...

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.660
you know, new land
is a great notion.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.200
I felt like I was in Earth's
maternity ward.

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.830
You know that euphoric rush you
get if you walk

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:09.300
into a maternity ward and see
all those little babies?

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:14.500
Well, here was, you know,
a little bit of land being made

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.160
where that lava met the sea.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:21.730
And unlike other
parts that preserve the place

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:24.030
where the monuments of erosion--

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:26.300
of things
that had been taken away,

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.000
where glaciers
have pushed through

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.600
or where water has cut
a Grand Canyon...

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.930
I was watching new land.

[Birds calling]

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:46.330
COYOTE: In 1604,
sailing off the coast

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.630
of what would one day become
the state of Maine,

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.700
the French explorer Champlain
had made special note

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.800
of an island he named
Mount Desert--

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.000
dominated by looming knobs
of bare granite,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.730
with tall peaks rising so close
to the Atlantic

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.830
that they catch the nation's
first rays of sunlight

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:07.330
each morning.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:10.860
For centuries, it
had been the home of the Micmac

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.530
and the Abenaki--
the people of the dawn.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:19.260
Then for the 150 years after
Champlain, the French claimed it

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.430
as part of their North American
possessions, calling it

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.700
Acadia, "earthly paradise"

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.560
before it passed to British
and then American hands.

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:35.200
The island was a sparsely
populated collection

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.960
of fishing villages until 1844,

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.700
when the celebrated landscape
artist Thomas Cole arrived

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.430
in search of new scenery
for his palette.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.530
Because of Cole's influence,
the island quickly became

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:52.100
the favorite summer locale for
other painters,

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.660
all of them drawing inspiration
from the rugged shorelines,

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:59.860
pristine lakes,
and tranquil forests.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.860
Wealthy easterners
began showing up, too,

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:30.300
to spend the summer far from
crowded and polluted cities

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.830
at the place the nation's top
artists had made fashionable.

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.600
To accentuate the island's early
connection to France,

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:41.900
some of the newcomers began
calling the island

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.300
"Mount Dessert."

their socially prominent
friends.

The proud owners had a special
name for their new dwellings.

They called them cottages.

He moves on all the choice sites
with calm and remorselessness.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.400
His march along the American
coast is nearly as resistless

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.860
as that of the hordes
who overthrew the Roman Empire.

come from immigrant backgrounds,

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.700
from different backgrounds
of white Protestant upper class.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.230
COYOTE: But now
one cottager worried

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:28.230
that too much of the island was
being locked up.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:32.030
As a boy, Charles Eliot
had spent many happy summers

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.960
vacationing with his family
on Mount Desert.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.330
After joining the landscape
architecture firm

00:45:37.330 --> 00:45:40.160
of Frederick Law Olmsted
in Boston,

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:44.200
Eliot had been inspired by
the great public spaces Olmsted

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.100
had helped create or preserve,

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.730
including New York's
Central Park

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.360
and Yosemite Valley.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.960
Eliot decided to do the same for
Mount Desert,

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.860
ambitiously drawing up a plan
to make more of the island

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.660
accessible to the public.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.460
But before he could put any of
his ideas to work,

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:11.500
Eliot contracted meningitis
and died suddenly at age 38.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:15.600
Going through his son's papers
to prepare a loving biography,

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.360
Eliot's grief-stricken father,
Charles W. Eliot,

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:22.630
came across his
namesake's idealistic dreams

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:24.800
for Mount Desert.

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:27.300
As president
of Harvard University

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.460
and one of
the most prestigious members

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.530
of the island's
summer community,

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.100
the elder Eliot was in
a position to do

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:38.500
everything possible to make
his son's dream come true.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.960
In the late summer of 1901, he
summoned his neighbors

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.500
and reminded them that many of
their favorite places

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.630
to hike and picnic and enjoy
a scenic vista were

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:54.460
now off-limits because
of new owners.

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.960
They established

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.960
the Hancock County Trustees
of Public Reservations

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:04.060
to acquire by gift or purchase
from the island's residents

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:08.660
land deemed important
for its scenic or historic value

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:13.130
and then hold on to it
and manage it for public use.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.000
MAN: I had seen the wreckage

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.030
of the great natural landscape
by the hotel builder

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.160
and the private owner.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.130
When President Eliot
brought out his plan

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.300
for the protection and saving of
our Mount Desert landscape,

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:32.100
it made a strong appeal to me.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:34.260
George Dorr.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.700
COYOTE: George Bucknam Dorr was
another cottager on the island.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.760
He was nearly
50 years old in 1901,

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.900
but had never needed to work
for a living,

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.100
thanks to a generous inheritance
from his parents,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.760
whose investments in the textile
industry had placed them

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.400
among New England's
social elite.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.460
Now he lived alone in his
family's grand house

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.000
in Bar Harbor,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.430
where he carried on the family
tradition of entertaining

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.000
prominent guests,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.700
and insisted on taking a swim

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.300
in the frigid waters
of the Atlantic every morning.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:16.160
What Dorr loved best was putting
a few crackers in his pockets

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.230
and taking long rigorous hikes.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:24.060
Many of the island's trails had,
in fact, been blazed by him.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.130
Dorr quickly became

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.300
the organization's
most dedicated worker,

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:34.730
slowly buying up important
scenic parcels of the land.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.430
Once the trustees had acquired

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.030
a significant
part of the island,

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.460
they began looking for a way
to protect it forever.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.360
MAN AS GEORGE DORR: To
the secretary of the interior:

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.760
Sir, on behalf

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:54.360
of the Hancock County Trustees
of Public Reservations,

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:59.260
state of Maine, I have the honor
to offer in free gift

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:03.460
to the United States a unique
and noble tract of land

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.200
upon our Eastern seacoast.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.800
Sincerely yours, George Dorr.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:14.530
[Car horn honks]

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:17.030
COYOTE: But in Washington,
Dorr learned

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:21.200
that even giving the land away
was going to be difficult.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.600
At the time, there were

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.600
no national parks
east of the Mississippi.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.100
And such an idea--to create one
from donated land--

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.400
had never been proposed.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.400
Horace Albright advised Dorr
that Congress could be bypassed

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.960
if President Woodrow Wilson
could be persuaded to use

00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:44.600
the Antiquities Act and issue
an executive order,

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.730
setting aside 5,000 acres
of the island

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:49.900
as a national monument.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.830
For 3 years, Dorr kept at it.

00:49:53.830 --> 00:49:56.960
And on July 8, 1916,

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.930
President Wilson finally signed
the proclamation.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.800
But George Dorr was still
not satisfied.

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.060
If a president could
unilaterally create

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.300
a national monument,
Dorr feared,

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:13.600
he could just as easily
take it away.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:17.760
Although his own inheritance was
becoming dangerously depleted,

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.460
Dorr vowed he wouldn't
rest until the national monument

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.330
became a congressionally
authorized, full-fledged,

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.700
permanent national park.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.060
MAN AS MATHER: The national
parks are an American idea,

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:01.030
the one thing we have not
imported.

00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:04.860
It came about because earnest
men and women became

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.360
violently excited

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.300
at the possibility
of these great assets passing

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:12.260
from the public control.

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.230
COYOTE: Years before Stephen
Mather arrived in Washington,

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:23.460
supporters had argued
that the haphazard collection

00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:26.330
of national parks needed to be
brought together

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.800
under a single federal agency.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:34.200
And yet, bill after bill to
create one had died in Congress,

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.300
the victim of quiet
but effective lobbying

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:39.430
by powerful
commercial interests,

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.960
hoping to exploit park lands,

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:45.700
and by John Muir's old nemesis,
Gifford Pinchot,

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.800
and his forest service.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.300
Pinchot believed
that conservation meant using,

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.400
not simply preserving,
natural resources,

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:57.830
and most certainly did not want
a potential rival

00:51:57.830 --> 00:51:59.260
within the government.

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:04.230
MAN AS MATHER: This nation is
richer in natural scenery

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:07.160
of the first order
than any other nation,

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.800
but it does not know it.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:14.100
It possesses
an empire of grandeur,

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.460
which it scarcely has heard of.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.200
It owns the most inspiring
playgrounds

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.960
and the best-equipped nature
schools in the world

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.430
and is serenely ignorant
of the fact.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:30.560
In its national parks it has
neglected

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:33.360
an economic asset of
incalculable value.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.800
[Piano playing on soundtrack]

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.800
COYOTE: Stephen Mather's
promotional crusade

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.800
for a national park service now
shifted into high gear.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.960
Washington had never
seen anything quite like it.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.100
All over the country, newspapers
and magazines ran

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:56.000
glowing feature stories
about the parks,

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.960
the result of
Mather's constant cultivation

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:01.200
of publishers and writers.

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.160
Schoolchildren were encouraged
to write essays about the parks

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.730
for cash prizes.

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:09.330
The General Federation
of Women's Clubs

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.060
and American Civic Association
launched

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.560
letter writing campaigns.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:17.360
The "National Geographic
Magazine" devoted

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:21.200
an entire issue to the scenic
wonders of America.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.330
And Mather made sure a copy
was placed

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:25.660
on every congressman's desk.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.630
Then he directed his publicist,
Robert Sterling Yard,

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:33.400
to produce
"The National Parks Portfolio,"

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.530
a hardbound book of several
hundred glossy pages filled

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.430
with photographs
of every national park

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:43.130
and every national monument
in the country.

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:45.560
The book was such a hit,

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.030
Mather ordered up a smaller
paperback version.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:53.700
2.7 million copies were sold
in the first year.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.430
Meanwhile, Mather convened
a group that drafted

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:02.200
the nuts and bolts language
of a bill to create

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:06.530
a separate parks bureau within
the Interior Department.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:10.400
Among them was
Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.,

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.300
who was asked to add a statement
of purpose meant

00:54:13.300 --> 00:54:16.200
to stand the test of time.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.500
It would also enshrine in words
the fundamental contradiction

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:24.560
that has always been a part of
the story of the national parks.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:30.630
"The new agency," he
wrote, "should manage the parks

00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:33.460
"for the enjoyment
of the American people

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.930
"and at the same time,
keep them unimpaired

00:54:36.930 --> 00:54:40.360
"for the enjoyment
of future generations."

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.530
MAN AS ALBRIGHT: We were aware
of and discussed

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:48.060
the paradox of use and enjoyment
of the parks by the people

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.960
versus their preservation
unimpaired.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.460
Of course, we knew there was
this paradox.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.460
We had finally come
to the belief

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.960
that with rational, careful,
and loving thought,

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.730
it could be done.

00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:03.460
Horace Albright.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.730
DUNCAN: Well, the statement of
purpose is broad,

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:13.200
I think deliberately so,
and I think magnificently so.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.060
If they had outlined in
great detail

00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.700
what was going to be permitted
and what wasn't,

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.800
it would be like if the founders
of our nation had said

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.800
what they meant by all men
being created equal and said,

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.230
"And by the way in case you
don't get it,

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:30.660
it's all white men of property
that are created equal,"

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.360
it wouldn't have been
the statement

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:36.900
that drew us into the future.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.700
And so with the parks'
Organic Act, as it's called,

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:45.230
being lofty and broad,
it allows us--each generation--

00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:46.800
to come to grips with it,

00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.530
just as we do
the meaning of liberty.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:57.460
COYOTE: On August 25, 1916,
President Woodrow Wilson

00:55:57.460 --> 00:56:02.460
signed into law an act creating
the National Park Service

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:05.700
to oversee 5 1/2 million acres

00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:08.430
of some of the most beautiful
scenery on Earth.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:29.800
Stephen Mather, whose relentless
energy had finally achieved

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.730
what so many people had been
fighting for for so many years,

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:36.460
was named the new agency's
first director.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:41.060
Horace Albright agreed to stay
on as his second in command.

00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:44.730
MAN AS MATHER:
The parks will have

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:48.030
a constantly enlarging,
revivifying influence

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:49.960
on our national life,

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.560
for which there is
no other public agency.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.500
They are our antidote for
national restlessness.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.430
They are national character
and health builders.

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:05.300
They are giving a new impetus
to sane living in this country.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.200
COYOTE: Five months later,

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:17.360
Mather convened a 5-day
conference in Washington, D.C.,

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.660
a gathering of park supporters
from across the country

00:57:20.660 --> 00:57:23.400
to celebrate the park movement.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:27.300
But as the conference went on,
Albright found himself having

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.760
to find someone
to fill in as presiding officer

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.300
because his boss

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.130
was mysteriously absent
from the proceedings.

00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:38.800
The night
after the conference ended,

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:42.130
Albright was summoned
to the Cosmos Club

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:44.060
and ushered into a private room,

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:48.330
where he found Mather surrounded
by a few of his closest friends.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.460
MAN AS ALBRIGHT: He was rocking
back and forth,

00:57:52.460 --> 00:57:55.460
alternately crying, moaning,

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:58.660
and hoarsely trying
to get something said.

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.760
I couldn't understand a thing.
He was incoherent.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:06.800
Suddenly, he broke out
of my hold, rushed for the door,

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.860
and, with an anguished cry,
proclaimed

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.460
he couldn't live any
longer feeling the way he did.

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.460
We all understood what he said
that time.

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:22.030
COYOTE: They contacted Mather's
wife, who asked them

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:25.130
to bring him to a family doctor
in Pennsylvania.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:28.430
She confided that her husband
had suffered a similar breakdown

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:30.300
in 1903.

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:33.460
Three subsequent episodes
had been prevented

00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:36.300
from spiraling out of control,
she added,

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:37.800
only by his retreating

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:40.460
into the wilderness
solitudes of the West--

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.800
the trips
which had originally inspired

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.560
his passion for the parks.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:48.860
After accompanying Mather
to the doctor,

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:51.360
Albright returned to Washington,

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:55.100
where he and interior secretary
Lane agreed

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.530
to keep Mather's
true condition secret

00:58:57.530 --> 00:59:01.700
until more could be learned
about his chances of recovery.

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.830
In his absence, Albright
would serve as acting director.

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.330
Mather, meanwhile, was sent

00:59:09.330 --> 00:59:11.900
to a sanitarium outside
Philadelphia.

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.360
His condition worsened at first.

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.360
Twice, he attempted
to kill himself.

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:21.700
But his wife believed he would
pull through,

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:23.630
as long as he could be convinced

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:27.300
he had something to look
forward to.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.960
On the wall
of his hospital room,

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.130
she permitted only two
decorations.

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:33.800
Both of them were

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:37.030
framed pictures
of Yosemite National Park.

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.800
MAN: When I first saw

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.530
this tremendous upheaval of
mountains, this range before me

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:59.960
with McKinley rising
in the center,

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.460
my impressions were exactly
the same as those given me

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.800
by looking down
into the Grand Canyon.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:11.200
One was nature carved down
into the surface of the Earth,

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.660
and the other was

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:15.400
the most magnificent upheaval of
nature above it.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.460
At such times, man feels

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.860
his atomic insignificance in
this universe.

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:25.700
Charles Sheldon.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.830
COYOTE: Among the participants
at the National Parks conference

01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:33.800
was Charles Sheldon,

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.960
a Vermont native,
who had made a fortune

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.400
in the railroad and mining
business, allowing him

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.230
to retire at age 35
and devote his energies

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:45.230
to his personal passion--

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:48.400
the study of
wild mountain sheep.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.730
Like his friend Stephen Mather,

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.830
Sheldon did not
do anything halfway.

01:00:53.830 --> 01:00:58.200
As an avid hunter and skilled
but amateur naturalist,

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.360
he embarked on field trips to
observe North American sheep

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.130
that took him
from the mountains of Mexico,

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:07.800
all the way up the Rockies
through Canada,

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.460
to the territory of Alaska

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:14.630
and the highest point on
the continent--Mount McKinley,

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:19.500
20,320 spectacular feet
above sea level.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:24.800
MAN: And there's something
distant and special

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:27.060
about that mountain.

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:29.060
Well, it's bigger than hell,

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.660
and it's colder
than hell on top.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.130
They said it was cold as

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:35.060
the heart of an elderly whore.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.000
I like it
because unlike Everest,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.960
which rises out of
a very high plateau--

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.360
I think the base camp
on Everest is

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:49.530
something like 16,000 feet high.

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:53.530
And here you see the whole
magnificence of this peak

01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.230
rising almost from sea level.

01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:57.900
It's very thrilling.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.030
COYOTE: The local Athabaskan
Indians reverently called

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:08.360
the perpetually icebound and
snow-covered mountain Denali,

01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.800
"the high one."

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.260
But in 1896 when the region
was still marked

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:17.260
as unexplored on official maps,

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.160
a failed businessman
turned prospector,

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.530
who had been arguing politics
with his companions,

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:27.030
dubbed it Mount McKinley
after the presidential candidate

01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:28.830
he happened to be supporting.

01:02:31.630 --> 01:02:35.630
By 1903, the allure of being
the first to scale

01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:39.000
the continent's tallest summit
had begun to attract

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.630
a handful of adventurers.

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:44.230
One of them, Frederick Cook,

01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:47.300
president of
the prestigious Explorers Club,

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.700
announced that
he had made it to the top

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.660
in a wild dash of 2 weeks,

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:55.800
and produced a photo
to support his claim.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:59.700
But a later expedition proved
that Cook had been lying--

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.860
by replicating his photo at one
of the mountain's lower peaks

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:05.630
as proof of his deceit.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:11.230
A few years later, 4 prospectors
in a bar near Fairbanks

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:13.760
decided they would claim
the honor of being

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.500
the first to conquer McKinley.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.960
Before setting off
on their dogsleds,

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:22.360
they promised to place
an American flag on the summit,

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.100
where their friends in the bar
might see it through telescopes.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:32.960
MAN: And with their bib overalls
and boots and canvas parkas

01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:36.660
and jug of hot chocolate
and a couple of doughnuts,

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.860
they headed up

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.760
from their 11,000-foot camp

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.800
and made it up in one day

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:43.700
to the north peak.

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.960
Modern climbers
just stand in awe

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.660
of this immense gallop up there,

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:55.430
because they went up there with
no climbing experience,

01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:58.960
no route except as they discover
it foot by foot,

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.230
and they got up there and they
got back in one day.

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:04.300
Two of them made it to the top.

01:04:06.030 --> 01:04:10.000
COYOTE: Many people simply
refuse to believe their story.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.960
Besides, it was pointed out,
the north peak is

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.960
actually 850 feet lower
than the south peak.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:23.430
Finally, in 1913, a team
led by Hudson Stuck,

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:25.600
Alaska's Episcopal archdeacon;

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:29.630
Harry Karstens, an experienced
local outdoorsman;

01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:31.030
and Walter Harper--

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:33.460
the half-Indian son of
a fur trapper,

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:36.560
made it all the way
to the top of the south peak.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.100
MAN: There was
no pride of conquest,

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.200
no gloating over good fortune
that had hoisted us

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.660
a few hundred feet higher

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:49.430
than others who had struggled
and been discomfited.

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.300
Rather was the feeling
that a privileged communion

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.130
with the high places
of the earth had been granted.

01:04:58.130 --> 01:05:01.100
And to cast our eyes
down from them,

01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:04.060
seeing all things as they
spread out

01:05:04.060 --> 01:05:06.000
from the windows
of heaven itself.

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:13.230
MAN AS CHARLES SHELDON: I have
often wondered in listening

01:05:13.230 --> 01:05:16.330
to descriptions of emotions
evoked by the scenery

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:18.460
of our national parks

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:22.660
why it was that animals are not
more mentioned.

01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:27.300
Does not, like the spire
in the civilized landscape,

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.730
a wild animal so adorn it

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:31.900
that we feel that it is
complete?

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:37.730
That feeling, the completeness
of all your feelings

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:40.460
aroused by such wild scenery,

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.300
will be constantly gratified

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:47.330
to the uttermost
in this proposed park.

01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:48.730
Charles Sheldon.

01:05:51.130 --> 01:05:53.500
COYOTE: For the naturalist
Charles Sheldon,

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.200
what made the region unique

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:58.360
was not just
the awe-inspiring mountain,

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.460
but the abundance of wildlife
teeming all around it.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:04.900
Grizzly bears
roaming unconcerned

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.330
about the presence
of any other animal,

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.900
including humans;

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.000
moose, which Sheldon described

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.860
as looking more
like prehistoric beasts

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:17.500
than any animal we have;

01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.630
"caribou," he said,
"that surrounded me

01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:22.960
"like cattle on a cattle ranch";

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.430
And the species that had drawn
him north in the first place--

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:29.060
the distinctive Dall sheep.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:31.960
Sheldon made 2 visits

01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:34.460
to the wilderness
around Mount McKinley--

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:38.330
one for an entire year
to observe the sheep,

01:06:38.330 --> 01:06:39.900
study their habits,

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:41.400
and collect specimens

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.860
for the American Museum
of Natural History.

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:50.000
Back in New York,
Sheldon began promoting

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.630
the idea of making McKinley
a national park

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:57.100
among his fellow members
of the Boone and Crockett Club,

01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:00.330
including the founders--
George Bird Grinnell

01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:03.860
and ex-President
Theodore Roosevelt.

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:06.000
Without protection,
he told them,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.200
the wildlife near Mount McKinley
would be slaughtered

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.400
by market hunters.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.560
DUNCAN: Charles Sheldon,
George Bird Grinnell,

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.000
Theodore Roosevelt--

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.860
they are the closest
thing that we had in America

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.260
to aristocracy--

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:26.660
really wealthy people who
because of their heredity were

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:29.360
freed oftentimes from having
to go out and make a living.

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.030
That's as close to royalty
as we could get.

01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:36.800
And while others like
them might be using that status,

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.660
using that wealth to accumulate
more for themselves,

01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.260
almost counterintuitively,

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:47.500
they were out there looking out
for everybody's benefit.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.800
They were patricians
but populists.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.960
They were guardians
of the greater good,

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.430
though it wasn't going to
necessarily benefit them

01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:58.800
personally.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.700
BILL BROWN:
The movement for the park

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:05.360
that Sheldon initiated
occurred at a time

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:10.260
when a clubby atmosphere
worked very well.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.730
It was a small power elite.

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:15.830
These people belonged
to the same clubs,

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:17.600
had gone to the same schools,

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.860
had innumerable
interties with one another.

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:26.000
I mean, it was a place where
about a dozen people counted,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.800
and you could round up those
dozen people

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.430
if you were a Charles Sheldon.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.660
MAN AS SHELDON: It has been said

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:36.130
that the mountains
would remain there.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:39.130
Why make it a national park now?

01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:42.100
The reason for doing it
immediately is

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.800
to save the magnificent
herds of game,

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.460
which are now threatened.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:51.000
They exist there as a link
connecting this life

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.100
with the life of the past ages,

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.030
just as the records in
the rocks show

01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:59.200
the records of the past ages
there before you.

01:09:02.230 --> 01:09:05.700
COYOTE: As they had once done
for Yellowstone's wildlife,

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:09.330
members of the Boone and
Crockett Club swung into action.

01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.860
With his friend Stephen Mather
confined to a sanitarium,

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:16.900
Sheldon moved to Washington,

01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:19.000
prowling the halls of
the Capitol

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.230
to push the bill through.

01:09:21.230 --> 01:09:26.530
On February 26, 1917,
he personally delivered it

01:09:26.530 --> 01:09:28.600
to President Wilson for signing.

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:33.900
His only disappointment
was that Congress,

01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.830
in creating
Mount McKinley National Park,

01:09:36.830 --> 01:09:40.660
had ignored his repeated pleas
to return the mountain

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:45.260
and its new park
to its original name--Denali.

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.930
In the coming decades,

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.960
the highest peak of
North America would continue

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.000
to attract, challenge, and awe

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.500
climbers from
all over the world,

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.500
including
Bradford and Barbara Washburn

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.630
from Lexington, Massachusetts.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.830
WOMAN: And a movie
company came to Brad

01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:12.060
and asked if he would lead
an expedition to Mount McKinley.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.700
And one of the people
from R.K.O. came to me and said,

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:19.000
"Mrs. Washburn, I understand
you've climbed the mountain.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.500
"Why don't you
come on this trip?"

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.630
And I said, "Well, I can't.
I've got 3 little children.

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:25.660
"I certainly can't do that."

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.900
And so then they got Brad

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.360
behind the scenes and said,

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.100
"If you could persuade your wife

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:33.230
"to go on this trip, it would
make a better movie

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.560
"to have a girl in it."

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.860
But anyway, I went,
and it wasn't that bad.

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.960
It was hard work, at least for
me, trudging up the mountain.

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.930
I had to be concentrating
to keep going

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:53.630
and not be a problem to anybody
and not have to take a rest.

01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:55.100
When you're on a rope
with other guys,

01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:57.130
you don't want to take a rest.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.500
BRADFORD WASHBURN: I think
one of the most exciting things

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:06.360
about having Barbara
on the trip was

01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.160
the fact that we were sharing
the beauty with each other.

01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:20.360
We snuggled in bed together at
night there in the mountain.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.730
And I remember a picture I got
of her that year

01:11:24.730 --> 01:11:28.300
at 18,000 feet looking down

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:29.900
the backside of McKinley.

01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:37.160
McKinley's an old pal,

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:40.000
but you have to set foot
on that mountain

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.530
almost with reverence

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:45.260
because if it wants
to, it can tear you to pieces.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:55.760
The view from
the top is wonderful.

01:11:57.660 --> 01:12:02.000
I know the fellow who made
the first ascent of McKinley,

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.160
and he was asked later on

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.060
what the view from the top of
McKinley was,

01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.730
and he hesitated for a moment.

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:13.930
He said, "That's like looking
out the windows of heaven."

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:17.830
I've never forgotten that.

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:23.500
When we left the last time,
we both cried.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.330
It was like leaving
a good friend.

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:40.860
MAN AS ALBRIGHT: Each idea I
have must be tested.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.130
Each fork of the trail
must be examined.

01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:47.300
Maybe it's
like constructing a house.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:51.460
I'm at the stage where
I'm laying the foundations.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:54.200
I have
no blueprints and no architect,

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.130
only the ideal and principles

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:59.300
for which the Park Service
was created.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.660
I think of myself as an explorer
in unknown territory.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.900
Horace Albright.

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.830
COYOTE: With his mentor
Stephen Mather

01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:11.560
still hospitalized,
the task of organizing

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:16.700
the brand-new National Park
Service fell to Horace Albright.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.230
At 27, he was
the youngest person

01:13:19.230 --> 01:13:21.530
in the fledgling organization,

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:25.500
2 years younger than
the department's messenger boy.

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:28.800
There was so much to be done--

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.830
testifying before Congress,

01:13:30.830 --> 01:13:35.160
embarking on a 10,000-mile
inspection of the western parks,

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:40.060
and fending off questions about
his boss' whereabouts.

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:44.530
Albright's task
became even more challenging

01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:47.360
in April of 1917.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:50.330
The United States entered
the Great War

01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:53.860
that had been raging in Europe
for almost 3 years.

01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.230
Western lumber and livestock
interests saw

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:01.530
the war mobilization as
an opportunity

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.600
to exploit the national parks.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.760
President Wilson was persuaded
to reduce the size

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.700
of Washington's Mount Olympus
national monument

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.360
by one half in order to open up
virgin stands of forest

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:17.060
for timber cutting.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:21.430
Ranchers eager to graze their
sheep and cattle in the parks

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:24.960
encouraged friendly newspapers
to editorialize

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.100
that soldiers need meat to eat,
not wildflowers.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.800
There were even proposals

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.630
that Yellowstone National Park's
elk and buffalo herds

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:39.830
be slaughtered for canned meat
to send to the troops overseas.

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:42.460
Albright did the best he could
to protect the parks

01:14:42.460 --> 01:14:43.960
from it all.

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.660
When Interior Secretary Lane
ordered him

01:14:46.660 --> 01:14:50.800
to let 50,000 sheep graze
in Yosemite Valley,

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:54.230
Albright stopped the plan
by threatening to resign.

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:02.430
During the war, Albright
accepted an invitation to visit

01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:05.360
southern Utah,
where the Virgin River carves

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.100
its way through a beautiful
canyon of sandstone cliffs.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:14.360
It had been set aside
as a national monument in 1909,

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.660
named Mukuntuweap, from
the Paiute word for "canyon,"

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.500
but had been virtually ignored
by the federal government

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:23.460
ever since.

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:27.460
Albright was the first official
from the Interior Department

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.060
to actually see it.

01:15:30.630 --> 01:15:32.530
MAN AS ALBRIGHT:
Local Utah people said

01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:35.900
that Yosemite was a Mukuntuweap
without color.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.260
But this didn't faintly prepare
me for the reality

01:15:38.260 --> 01:15:40.800
of the towering rock walls
splashed

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.460
with brilliant hues of tans and
reds interspersed with whites.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:48.260
It was love at first sight
for me.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:51.600
I was so impressed that
I determined we should expand

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.400
Mukuntuweap and have it made
a national park.

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:00.360
COYOTE: Albright's enthusiasm
was enough to persuade

01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.530
President Wilson
to expand the national monument

01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:06.160
and to change its name
from Mukuntuweap--

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.630
which Albright believed was

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:11.360
too hard to pronounce, spell,
and remember--

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.030
to the name the local Mormons
used for the canyon:

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:19.130
Zion, the new Jerusalem, set
aside by God

01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:21.530
for the pure at heart.

01:16:21.530 --> 01:16:27.060
At the end of 1919, Congress set
it aside as a national park.

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.960
MAN: I was
brought into the world

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.960
on January, 5, 1914,
by a midwife in a lumber shack

01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:36.960
on the family farm.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.830
That's just about where Zion
Park headquarters stands today.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:46.160
But as I grew up, of course, I

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.730
saw the park develop.

01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:49.060
I saw roads built.

01:16:49.060 --> 01:16:52.800
I saw the lodges
come into being.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.630
I can say that I and the park

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:57.900
more or less
did grow up together.

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:04.000
Later I became a dishwasher at
the Zion Lodge.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.130
Whenever I got the chance,
if I get my work done in time,

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:11.200
I'd go down and stand outside
the recreation hall

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.660
and listen to the naturalist
give his talk.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.000
And I was fascinated, of course,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.100
mostly by the fact that, gee,
here are these rangers

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.200
that are dressed nicely.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.630
They got a good job.

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:25.560
I'd like to be one of those.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:31.130
Well, after World War II, as I
came home from Europe,

01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:33.800
I was hired
as a seasonal naturalist.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.960
I loved it.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.530
I used to say, "Golly, I'd work
for nothing,"

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:41.060
except that I had to eat.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:47.300
I don't have any Indian genes in
me that I know of.

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.960
I wouldn't go so far as to say

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.930
that I consider the peaks
and the rocks have life

01:17:52.930 --> 01:17:54.800
and talk to you,

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:58.060
but it has something spiritual
about it.

01:17:59.430 --> 01:18:01.630
I did write a poem--

01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:04.200
where I talked to the mountain
and it talks back to me,

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.860
but that's fantasy, of course.

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:08.960
But why not dream a little bit?

01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.200
MAN AS ALBRIGHT: Mr. Mather's
doctor recommended

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.000
that I be
the one and only visitor

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.700
other than Mrs. Mather
for a while.

01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:25.230
"His life depends upon national
parks," the doctor said.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:29.960
"I think I can break him back
through the parks.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:32.830
"But without them, I don't know
what may happen."

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:40.030
COYOTE:
18 months after his collapse,

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:44.130
Stephen Mather
returned to his job.

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:48.400
He threw himself into his work
as if he had never been away.

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.600
MAN AS MATHER: The national
parks seem destined

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.060
to play a role in satisfying
the longings of the people

01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:16.530
in times of
great nervous tension

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:21.500
through the calming and
inspiring influence of nature.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.530
Anyone who has been
so fortunate as to witness

01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:27.400
their marvels
and spend quiet hours

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.660
in the inspiring contemplation
of their beauties

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.260
will surely return home with
a burning determination

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:40.860
to love and work for, and
if necessary fight and die for,

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:44.100
the glorious land which is his.

01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:47.860
TERRY TEMPEST WILLIAMS:
Our national parks are

01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.860
places of pilgrimage--

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.530
a place where we return
over and over again to be still,

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:58.100
to be contemplative.

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.460
And not only do we save

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:01.900
these lands

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.400
or save these national parks.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.960
They save us.

01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.030
There's something
about this wild continuity

01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:11.130
that gives us courage,

01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:15.860
that allows us to be the best
of who we are as human beings.

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:21.260
COYOTE: Reinvigorated
from his time in the parks,

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.130
Mather became enthusiastic

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:25.730
about the scenic attractions
of Utah

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:27.860
and the southwestern deserts.

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:31.960
He pushed for the creation
of Arches national monument,

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.730
the world's largest collection

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:37.430
of exquisite red sandstone
architecture sculpted

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:42.330
over the eons by wind,
rain, and ice.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:45.000
He also lobbied
for what eventually became

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.260
Great Basin National Park, home

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:51.160
of the tough
and gnarled bristlecone pines,

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.500
the oldest
living things on earth:

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.860
some growing
for nearly 5,000 years.

01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:02.560
And he was
instrumental in setting aside

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.260
a magnificent natural
amphitheater carved by erosion

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.600
from the side
of a mountain ridge,

01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:13.960
filled with eerie rock spires
and minarets called hoodoos:

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:17.200
Bryce Canyon National Park.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.730
It was named in honor
of an early settler,

01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:23.930
Ebenezer Bryce, who had long
since left the area

01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:26.060
after reportedly saying,

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.560
"It's a hell of a place
to lose a cow."

01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:36.530
But now Mather set his sights
on a even bigger canyon,

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:40.430
whose absence from his list of
national parks bothered him

01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:41.900
more than anything.

01:21:45.630 --> 01:21:48.700
MAN AS J.B. PRIESTLEY: There
is, of course, no sense at all

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.300
in trying
to describe the Grand Canyon.

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:53.760
Those who have not seen
it will not believe

01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.800
any possible description.

01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:00.700
Those who have seen it know that
it cannot be described.

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:06.100
It is not a showplace, a beauty
spot, but a revelation.

01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:10.030
The Colorado River made it,

01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:11.330
but you feel when you are there

01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:16.660
that God gave the Colorado River
its instructions.

01:22:16.660 --> 01:22:19.730
The thing is
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony

01:22:19.730 --> 01:22:23.330
in stone and magic light.

01:22:23.330 --> 01:22:26.960
I hear rumors of visitors who
were disappointed--

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.630
the same people who will be
disappointed

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:31.300
at the Day of Judgment.

01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.730
J.B. Priestley.

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:37.800
COYOTE: It is
the grandest canyon on earth--

01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:44.960
277 miles long, 10 miles wide,
a mile deep,

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.460
and getting a foot deeper
every thousand years

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:51.800
as the Colorado River
patiently cuts its way

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.400
through layer
upon layer of time.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.800
"A grand geological library,"
John Muir called it.

01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.530
"A collection of stone books,
tier on tier,

01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:06.530
"conveniently arranged
for the student."

01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:10.200
From limestone and sandstone
and shale,

01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:14.160
all the way down to some of the
oldest exposed rock on earth,

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:20.330
Precambrian Vishnu schist formed
1.7 billion years ago.

01:23:21.700 --> 01:23:25.700
The home over thousands of years
of the ancient Puebloans

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:29.460
and the Hopi, the Walapai,
and the Havasupai,

01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.460
the Paiute and the Navajo.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.630
It entered recorded history
in 1540,

01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:40.830
when Spanish conquistadors under
the command of Coronado

01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:44.500
peered into its depths and were
awed and staggered

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.230
by its immensity,

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:49.900
just as every visitor
who followed them would be.

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:58.400
In 1869, a one-armed Civil War
veteran and geology professor

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.530
named John Wesley Powell,

01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:03.200
hoping to fill in the biggest
remaining gap

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:07.330
of unknown territory in the maps
of the United States,

01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:09.330
set off down the Colorado.

01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:15.700
It was a costly, deadly trip.

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:19.700
He began with 9 men in
4 wooden boats

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:23.360
and emerged with 5 men
and 2 boats.

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.960
But Powell's expedition was
a huge success

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:30.430
and brought the Grand Canyon
to national attention.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:34.800
Proposals to make it a national
park dated

01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:37.800
all the way back to the 1880s.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.800
But they all had failed
in Congress

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.130
because of fierce opposition
from local ranchers,

01:24:43.130 --> 01:24:47.630
miners, and settlers who did not
want the federal government

01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:52.400
imposing restrictions on what
they could and could not do.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.960
Then President
Theodore Roosevelt had stretched

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.460
the limits of the newly passed
Antiquities Act,

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:02.360
and with the stroke of his pen
established

01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.600
the Grand Canyon
National Monument.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.560
"The Canyon," Roosevelt said,

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:10.660
"represented the most impressive
piece of scenery I

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:12.330
"have ever looked at,

01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:16.700
"the one great site which every
American should see.

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:22.430
"Leave it as it is," he had
advised the people of Arizona.

01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:24.560
No one had listened to him.

01:25:26.130 --> 01:25:29.260
A few rustic hotels
were already perched

01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.660
on the Canyon's precipice
when the Atchison, Topeka,

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:37.130
and Santa Fe Railway extended
its tracks to the South Rim

01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:41.460
and began construction of even
more buildings.

01:25:41.460 --> 01:25:45.500
Yearly visitation rose into
the tens of thousands.

01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:50.130
Among them was
an itinerant piano player

01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:55.260
and aspiring composer from
Los Angeles named Ferde Grofe,

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:58.130
who was so overwhelmed
by the experience

01:25:58.130 --> 01:26:01.160
that years later the memory
of it would inspire

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.330
his masterpiece,
the "Grand Canyon Suite."

01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:06.630
[Music playing on soundtrack]

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:16.500
Equally impressed was a humorist
from Paducah, Kentucky,

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.800
named Irvin S. Cobb.

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.300
MAN AS IRVIN S. COBB: I
think my preconceived conception

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:25.830
of the Canyon was the same
conception most people have

01:26:25.830 --> 01:26:28.300
before they come out to see
it for themselves--

01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:30.900
a straight up-and-down slit
in the earth.

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.200
It is no such thing.

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:40.630
Imagine the very heart
of the world laid bare

01:26:40.630 --> 01:26:42.960
before our eyes.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.500
There's nothing between
you and the undertaker

01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:51.400
except 6,000 feet, more or less,
of dazzling Arizona climate.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.830
Having seen the Canyon from
the top, the next thing to do is

01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:58.130
to go down into it.

01:27:06.460 --> 01:27:09.360
Down a winding footpath moves
the procession,

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.530
all as nervous as cats and some
holding to their saddle pommels

01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:14.960
with death grips.

01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.860
All at once, you notice

01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:20.200
that the person immediately
ahead of you

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:23.730
has apparently ridden right over
the wall of the Canyon.

01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:25.160
It is at this point

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:28.630
that some tourists tender
their resignations

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:30.700
to take effect immediately.

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:32.860
You reflect
that thousands of persons

01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:35.130
have already done this thing,

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:38.630
that thousands of others
are going to do it,

01:27:38.630 --> 01:27:42.800
and that no serious accident
has yet occurred,

01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:46.130
which is some comfort
but not much.

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:56.330
The natives will tell you
the tale of a man

01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:57.800
who made the trip

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.900
by crawling around the more
sensational corners

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:03.030
upon his hands and knees.

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:07.860
Presently, when you've begun to
piece together

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:10.030
the tattered fringes of
your nerves,

01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:13.230
you realize that this canyon is
even more wonderful

01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:16.800
when viewed from within than it
is when viewed from without.

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.860
Also, you begin to notice now

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:24.060
that it is most extensively
autographed.

01:28:25.530 --> 01:28:28.000
Apparently, about every other
person who came this way

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.660
remarked to himself, This canyon
was practically completed

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:35.830
and only needed his signature
as collaborator

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:37.230
to round it out.

01:28:40.330 --> 01:28:42.460
COYOTE: Of all the entrepreneurs
who descended

01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:46.200
upon the Grand Canyon
in the early 20th Century

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.960
hoping to earn a living
off its scenery,

01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:52.830
none worked harder than
2 brothers from Pennsylvania--

01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:55.560
Ellsworth and Emery Kolb.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:59.230
In 1902, they had opened
a photographic studio

01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:03.000
on the South Rim, at first
in a canvas tent

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.760
near one of the hotels,

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.030
and then in a wooden structure
they built

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:09.700
at the head
of Bright Angel Trail,

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:14.300
the principal route from the rim
to the river far below.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.530
Every morning, as
the mule-backed caravans began

01:29:17.530 --> 01:29:21.530
their descent, Emery Kolb would
take their photograph

01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:24.160
at a prearranged spot
near the trail head

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:26.900
with his 5-by-7 view camera

01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:31.330
and enter information about them
in his logbook.

01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:34.500
Then he would take off
down the trail himself,

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.460
carrying his glass plate
negatives as he ran

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:41.400
to a makeshift darkroom he
and his brother had constructed

01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:45.430
near a small spring halfway
between the rim and the river.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.800
Kolb would develop his pictures,

01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:52.460
then scurry back up the trail
in time to offer

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:55.660
the photos for sale when
the mule trains returned

01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.630
from the bottom.

01:29:57.630 --> 01:29:59.830
Each trip to the darkroom was

01:29:59.830 --> 01:30:04.530
4 1/2 miles
and 3,000 vertical feet down,

01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:09.260
4 1/2 miles
and 3,000 vertical feet back up.

01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:15.830
MAN AS COBB:
Just under the first terrace,

01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:17.330
a halt was made

01:30:17.330 --> 01:30:19.830
while the official photographer
took a picture.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:26.730
And when you get back, he has
your finished copy ready for you

01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:30.900
so you can see for yourself just
how pale and haggard

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:34.700
and walleyed and like a typhoid
patient you looked.

01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:43.230
COYOTE: During slow seasons,

01:30:43.230 --> 01:30:46.760
the Kolb brothers set off
to explore parts of the Canyon

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:49.060
tourists never experienced,

01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:52.560
always lugging their bulky
camera equipment

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:55.130
and often
taking great risks to find

01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:57.030
the perfect vantage point.

01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.300
They brought back some
of the most stunning photographs

01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:17.200
of the Grand Canyon
the world had ever seen,

01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:20.830
offered them for sale, and had
trouble keeping up

01:31:20.830 --> 01:31:22.600
with the demand for copies.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.930
And when that wasn't enough,
in 1911,

01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:38.830
they decided to retrace

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:43.160
John Wesley Powell's historic
boat trip down the Colorado

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.660
and record it not
only with still photographs,

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:48.430
but with
a motion-picture camera.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.630
The trip took 3 rough,
exhilarating months

01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:29.830
and included a number of close
calls on the turbulent river,

01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:33.530
including one in which Emery
insisted on filming

01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:35.730
his brother's precarious
situation

01:32:35.730 --> 01:32:38.430
before tossing
him a life preserver.

01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:42.930
They emerged with the world's
first moving pictures

01:32:42.930 --> 01:32:44.800
of the raging Colorado

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.660
and the majestic canyon
it had carved,

01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:50.260
took their finished product
on a lecture tour

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:53.930
to packed theaters all around
the East Coast,

01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:56.530
and then built an addition to
their studio

01:32:56.530 --> 01:33:00.430
on the Canyon's rim
to house a small auditorium,

01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:04.500
where every day Emery Kolb would
personally narrate the film

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:08.230
for tourists, who had come
thousands of miles

01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:10.900
to see the Grand Canyon
but preferred

01:33:10.900 --> 01:33:14.560
that at least part of
their experience be confined

01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.960
to a movie screen.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.860
MAN AS COBB: Nearly everybody

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:24.030
on taking a look at
the Grand Canyon comes right out

01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:27.730
and admits its wonders
are absolutely indescribable,

01:33:27.730 --> 01:33:29.460
and then proceeds to write

01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:33.600
anywhere from 2,000 to 50,000
words giving the full details.

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:40.160
In the presence
of the Grand Canyon,

01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.960
language just simply fails you,

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.430
and all the parts of speech
go dead lame.

01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:50.460
When the Creator made it,
He failed to make

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:52.830
a word to cover it.

01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:54.260
Irvin S. Cobb.

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:58.500
MAN AS MATHER: In
many of the foreign estimates

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:02.230
of the great natural spectacles
of America,

01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:05.900
the Grand Canyon stands
at the top.

01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:09.730
Its absence from the list of
our national parks, therefore,

01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:12.730
seems to belittle, in
foreign eyes,

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:15.900
our entire
national park system.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.930
What can the system
amount to, they ask,

01:34:18.930 --> 01:34:22.660
if it doesn't even
include the Grand Canyon?

01:34:24.700 --> 01:34:25.860
MAN AS ALBRIGHT:
Mather desperately wanted

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:29.160
the Grand Canyon
made into a national park.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:31.600
I felt it would be a tremendous
boost to his health

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.160
and well-being,

01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.330
so I put in an enormous amount
of time and energy

01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:36.760
in the project.

01:34:40.860 --> 01:34:42.960
COYOTE: In their quest
to add the Canyon

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.230
to the system of parks
they were building,

01:34:45.230 --> 01:34:48.830
Stephen Mather and
Horace Albright found themselves

01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:53.100
blocked at every turn by a man
who considered the Canyon

01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:55.530
his own private domain,

01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:58.500
and was unafraid to take
on the federal government,

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:02.660
the Santa Fe Railroad, or anyone
else who got in his way.

01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:07.230
MAN: I was exploring
the Grand Canyon

01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:11.300
before other men ever knew there
was a Grand Canyon.

01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.230
I went there to seek a fortune,

01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:15.860
which all prospectors
expect to make.

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.860
And I've always said that I
would make more money

01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:22.600
out of the Grand Canyon
than any other man.

01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:23.930
Ralph Henry Cameron.

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:28.500
COYOTE: Ralph Henry Cameron was
a prospector

01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:31.830
whose opinion of himself was as
grand as the canyon

01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:33.830
he planned to exploit.

01:35:33.830 --> 01:35:37.560
A few of Cameron's mines
actually yielded

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.000
some valuable ore,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:42.100
but the vast majority
of his claims seemed

01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.660
conveniently located

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:47.130
on the most scenic
spots along the South Rim,

01:35:47.130 --> 01:35:50.360
and he never seemed to do much
mining on them.

01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.330
At one claim near the head of
the Bright Angel Trail,

01:35:54.330 --> 01:35:57.260
which he preferred to call
the Cameron Trail,

01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:01.060
he built a cabin,
named it Cameron's Hotel,

01:36:01.060 --> 01:36:04.060
and dispatched employees
to hound tourists

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:07.900
getting off the train
to patronize it.

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:11.800
On the trail itself, he erected
a gate at the rim,

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.100
where his brother would collect
a toll of a dollar a person

01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:17.130
for its use.

01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:18.830
When Coconino County
was declared

01:36:18.830 --> 01:36:20.960
the trail's proper owner,

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:23.960
Cameron used his influence as
a county commissioner

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.200
to be awarded the franchise to
continue collecting the tolls.

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.130
Halfway down the trail

01:36:31.130 --> 01:36:34.060
at a small oasis
called Indian Gardens,

01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:37.160
he operated
a ramshackle tent camp,

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.430
where he charged passing
travelers outrageous prices

01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:42.160
for water,

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:45.330
then charged again
for the only outhouses

01:36:45.330 --> 01:36:47.200
between the rim and the river.

01:36:50.430 --> 01:36:54.330
Meanwhile, as Stephen Mather
steadily built support

01:36:54.330 --> 01:36:56.560
in Congress
for his park proposal,

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.330
federal officials ruled

01:36:58.330 --> 01:37:01.960
virtually all of Cameron's
claims invalid

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:04.600
because of their
lack of mineral value.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:09.560
The Secretary of the Interior
ordered him to abandon them.

01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:15.430
Cameron ignored it all,
and instead filed 55 new claims,

01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:20.730
bringing his total to 13,000
strategically placed acres.

01:37:20.730 --> 01:37:24.300
In a lawsuit working its
way toward the Supreme Court,

01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:26.500
his lawyers were even arguing

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:29.500
that Theodore Roosevelt's
executive order

01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:32.730
creating the national monument
had been illegal.

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.100
In 1919, Congress at last passed
a bill creating

01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.830
Grand Canyon National Park.

01:37:45.830 --> 01:37:48.360
A year later
when the Supreme Court

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.230
finally and unequivocally ruled
against Cameron,

01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:55.960
Mather and Albright figured that
their troubles with him were

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.000
over at last.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.500
They couldn't have been
more wrong.

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:04.200
In the election of 1920,

01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.560
Arizona sent him to Washington

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:09.560
as a United States senator.

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.360
"I feel like getting even,"

01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.400
Cameron had written a friend.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:14.900
"And if I live,

01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:16.360
"I certainly will."

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.530
MAN AS JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER JR.:
I never had any doubt

01:38:33.530 --> 01:38:36.660
about the existence
of a divine being.

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:39.500
To see a tree coming out
in the spring was

01:38:39.500 --> 01:38:44.160
enough to impress me
with the fact that God existed.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.960
John D. Rockefeller Jr.

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:50.930
COYOTE: John D. Rockefeller Jr.
was the only son

01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:55.060
of the richest and, some said,
most hated man in America--

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:57.830
John D. Rockefeller Sr.,

01:38:57.830 --> 01:39:01.400
the founder of the vast
Standard Oil trust--

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:05.260
which at the time refined more
than 90% of the oil

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:07.930
sold in America.

01:39:07.930 --> 01:39:10.760
John D. Jr. had been raised
in accordance

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:13.900
with his father's strict
Baptist creed--

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:17.060
to work hard,
to watch every penny,

01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:19.960
and remember to give to charity.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:23.260
In 1908, he had come
to Mount Desert Island

01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:25.830
with his wife
Abby, a New Englander

01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:30.230
who instilled in him an abiding
love of the Maine coast.

01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:34.500
Two years later, he purchased
an estate near Seal Harbor

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.830
on the quiet side of the island,

01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:39.930
where his growing family could
spend their summers

01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:42.160
in relative privacy and enjoy

01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:46.260
what he called one of
the greatest views in the world.

01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:51.130
That same year at age 36,

01:39:51.130 --> 01:39:54.330
Rockefeller had made
a momentous decision.

01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:55.830
He would step away

01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:59.160
from the pursuit of even greater
wealth and the management

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.500
of his father's
extensive business interests,

01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:06.500
and devote himself instead
to a single goal--

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:10.500
the social purposes, he said,
to which a great fortune

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.930
could be dedicated.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.500
Then he was introduced
to George Dorr,

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:21.300
who was still seeking funds
to acquire

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:24.000
even more land
on Mount Desert Island

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.100
and still hoping to turn the new
national monument

01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:31.100
into a national park.

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:33.430
MAN AS ROCKEFELLER JR:
George Dorr is an impulsive,

01:40:33.430 --> 01:40:37.760
enthusiastic, eager person
who works at high tension,

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:40.930
neglects his meals,
sits up too late at night,

01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:44.230
and rushes about from
one pressing thing to another.

01:40:44.230 --> 01:40:49.530
But he is very diligent, as well
as highly inventive.

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:54.930
COYOTE: Rockefeller soon became
Dorr's principal patron.

01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:57.630
As he quietly
began buying up land,

01:40:57.630 --> 01:40:59.260
Rockefeller also launched

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:03.160
the most ambitious network
of wilderness carriage roads

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:05.100
New England had ever seen,

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:10.260
not only paying for it all,
but overseeing every detail.

01:41:10.260 --> 01:41:13.260
Meant for the aesthetic
enjoyment of people

01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:17.160
riding in open carriages,
on horseback, or on a bicycle,

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.000
the paths were painstakingly
located to present

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.430
a series of scenic vistas
displaying

01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:26.300
Mount Desert at its best.

01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:29.330
Each bridge,
made of local granite

01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:31.660
so it would blend
into its setting,

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:35.360
was individually designed,
including one that was given

01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:39.730
a graceful curve to save 2
trees from being destroyed

01:41:39.730 --> 01:41:43.330
and oriented
so that a nearby waterfall was

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:47.360
in the same line of the sight
as the bridge's arch.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.500
By the time he was through,

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:53.830
Rockefeller had built 57 miles
of carriage roads weaving

01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:58.200
through the island,
donated 10,000 additional acres,

01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:02.100
and spent $3.5 million
for the dream

01:42:02.100 --> 01:42:05.960
that had begun as young
Charles Eliot's fanciful notion,

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.900
his father's noble tribute,

01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:11.360
and George Dorr's
magnificent obsession.

01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:16.760
Stephen Mather was enthusiastic
about the plans.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:19.060
Having a national park
in the East

01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:22.000
closer to the nation's major
population centers

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.630
would help build
support for the larger system

01:42:24.630 --> 01:42:27.500
he was trying to create.

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:30.500
It would also be a different
kind of park--

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:35.830
smaller, more intimate, and set
aside not from federal land,

01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:37.500
but as a gift

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.300
from some of the country's
wealthiest citizens.

01:42:45.630 --> 01:42:49.000
On February 26, 1919,

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.000
the same day the Grand Canyon
was brought into the system,

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.160
15,000 acres
of Mount Desert Island--

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.500
triple the original gift--

01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:04.060
also became a national park,
eventually named Acadia,

01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:07.000
the French word
for "heaven on earth."

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.630
MAN AS DORR: The present
generation will pass

01:43:12.630 --> 01:43:14.900
as my own has done.

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:18.560
But the mountains and the woods,
the coasts and streams

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:21.900
that have now passed through
the agency of the park

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.900
to the national government
will continue

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:30.100
as a national possession,
a public possession henceforth

01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:31.760
for all time to come.

01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:37.900
It never will be given
up to private ownership again.

01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:41.530
Then men in control will change,

01:43:41.530 --> 01:43:43.930
the government itself
will change,

01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:49.330
but its possession by the people
will remain.

01:43:49.330 --> 01:43:50.760
George Dorr.

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:56.160
COYOTE: George Dorr was now 65.

01:43:56.160 --> 01:43:57.700
Despite his age,

01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:00.660
he was immediately named
superintendent.

01:44:02.730 --> 01:44:06.660
He would remain in that
job for the next 25 years.

01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:13.260
He would continue badgering
more of his summertime neighbors

01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:15.230
to donate their property,

01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:17.400
and would so thoroughly
sacrifice

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.360
what remained of his inheritance
to the cause

01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:23.400
that when he died in 1944,

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:26.030
his estate had money
for his funeral

01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:31.500
only because its trustees
had secretly put $2,000 aside

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.260
to prevent Dorr
from giving it all away.

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:42.830
Circling over a part of the
island he had especially loved,

01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:45.930
friends scattered his ashes
from a plane.

01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:51.560
Two wealthy matrons enjoying
lunch on the terrace

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.930
of their summer cottage
looked up

01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:57.600
as some of the plane's wafting
cargo drifted down

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.830
into their teacups.

01:44:59.830 --> 01:45:02.730
"Oh, dear,"
one of them exclaimed.

01:45:02.730 --> 01:45:04.330
"It's Mr. Dorr."

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:16.430
DUNCAN: One of my
favorite Robert Frost poems is

01:45:16.430 --> 01:45:18.900
"West-Running Brook,"
where he describes

01:45:18.900 --> 01:45:21.360
this beautiful stream
coming down.

01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:24.160
And the narrator is pointing
out this one spot in the brook

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:28.330
where the water hits
a rock and is thrown backward,

01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:33.400
and the beauty of that spot
where it sparkles in the light.

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:37.160
And he says
it's from that that we spring.

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.000
It's going back

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.660
toward the source, toward,

01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:43.300
as he said, "the beginning
of the beginnings."

01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.700
And I think national parks
are a part of that--

01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:49.660
that sparkle in the water.

01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:53.000
Life pushes us forward.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:56.130
Our society moves forward
in a great rush,

01:45:56.130 --> 01:45:59.730
but the parks are that place
that throws us back

01:45:59.730 --> 01:46:01.230
a little bit.

01:46:01.230 --> 01:46:04.400
That makes us pause,
makes us reflect,

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:07.400
and points us
back to the source,

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:10.060
to the beginning of beginnings.

01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:12.660
And that's their value,
and that's their beauty.

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.300
COYOTE: National parks
could now be found

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:35.900
in the territories of
Hawaii and Alaska,

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:40.600
from the coast of Maine to
the canyons of Utah and Arizona.

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:44.830
And there was a new agency
trying to figure out

01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:46.260
how to care for them all.

01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:51.660
Stephen Mather could easily
claim victory

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:54.900
for setting it in motion
and step down.

01:46:54.900 --> 01:47:00.260
But he was feeling strong again
and bursting with more ideas,

01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:04.830
ideas that would bring even more
Americans to their parks.

01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:10.760
MAN AS MATHER: What is it
that inspires love of the flag,

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:13.560
that tunes the ear of
America to sing

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.630
"My Country 'tis of Thee"?

01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:21.560
Is it industrial efficiency,
irrigation statistics,

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:25.000
or trade output?

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.760
Is it the hideous ore dumps of
the sordid mining camp?

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:35.130
Is it the grim powerhouse
in which is harnessed Niagara?

01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:38.560
Is it the blackened waste that
follows the devastation

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:40.960
of much of our forest wealth?

01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.660
Is it the smoking
factory of the grimy mill town,

01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:49.160
the malodorous
wharves along navigable rivers?

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:52.330
Is it even the lofty
metropolitan skyscraper

01:47:52.330 --> 01:47:55.760
that shuts out the sun
and throws its dismal shadow

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.430
over all below?

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:08.330
No. Our devotion to the flag is
inspired by love of country.

01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:13.060
Patriotism is
the religion of the soil,

01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:17.160
and national parks
are our richest patrimony.
