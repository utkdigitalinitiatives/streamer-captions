WEBVTT

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
THESE PROTESTERS BELIEVE
 THEY ARE THE DEFENDERS

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
OF DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
OVER THE PAST DECADE,
 MILLIONS HAVE JOINED

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
THE ANTI-GLOBALIZATION
 MOVEMENT TO PREVENT

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
THE SPREAD OF
 GLOBAL CAPITALISM.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
WE ALL WANT A BETTER WORLD,
FREE FROM POVERTY AND INJUSTICE.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
BUT GOOD INTENTIONS DON'T MAKE
THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
IN THIS FILM, I'M GOING
TO EXPLAIN WHY I BELIEVE

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
THAT THE
ANTI-GLOBALIZATION MOVEMENT

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
IS IGNORANT
AND DANGEROUSLY WRONG.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
THE PROTESTERS CLAIM THAT
 GLOBALIZATION CREATES POVERTY.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
THEY ARE WRONG.
 ALL COUNTRIES USED TO BE POOR.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
IT'S ONLY IN THIS NEW ERA
 OF MODERNIZATION

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
THAT COUNTRIES HAVE STARTED
 TO ESCAPE DESTITUTION.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
IN THE PAST 50 YEARS, 3 BILLION
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LIFTED OUT

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
OF POVERTY -
THIS IS HISTORICALLY UNIQUE.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
FAR FROM MAKING THE WORLD
 A POORER AND MORE UNFAIR PLACE,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
MY RESEARCH AS A WRITER
 HAS CONVINCED ME THAT GLOBAL

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
CAPITALISM COULD MAKE THE
 WHOLE WORLD AS WEALTHY AND FREE

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
AS EUROPE IS TODAY -
 IF ONLY WE LET IT.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
IN FACT, POVERTY IS ON
 THE WAY OUT IN THOSE COUNTRIES

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
THAT HAVE INTEGRATED
 INTO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
150 YEARS AGO, MY COUNTRY,
 SWEDEN, WAS POORER

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
THAN MOST AFRICAN COUNTRIES
 ARE TODAY AND THIS BAY WAS

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
LITTLE MORE THAN A DUMP
 FOR STOCKHOLM'S EXCREMENT

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
AND GARBAGE.
 BUT WE EMBRACED GLOBALIZATION -

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
BY WHICH I MEAN A FREE MARKET
 ECONOMY BASED ON THE RIGHT

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
TO START A BUSINESS
 AND TRADE WITHOUT RESTRICTION.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
AND JUST LOOK
 AT OUR WEALTH TODAY.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'M SETTING OUT ON A
 JOURNEY FIRST TO TAIWAN TO SEE

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
HOW GLOBALIZATION LEADS
 TO WEALTH AND DEMOCRACY,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
SECOND TO VIETNAM TO FIND OUT
 WHAT MULTI-NATIONALS

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
ARE REALLY DOING TO DEVELOPING
 COUNTRIES AND FINALLY TO KENYA

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
TO TRY AND DISCOVER WHY AFRICA
 IS STILL SO DESPERATELY POOR.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
FAR FROM BEING
 A THREAT TO MANKIND,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I'M GOING TO SHOW THAT
 GLOBAL CAPITALISM IS ITS SAVIOR.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
TAIPEI, CAPITAL OF TAIWAN.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
JUST 30 YEARS AGO THIS TINY
 EAST ASIAN COUNTRY,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
WAS POORER
 THAN MANY AFRICANS TODAY.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
MALNUTRITION WAS WIDESPREAD AND
 THERE WERE NO NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
TODAY, ITS PEOPLE
 ARE AS RICH AS THE SPANISH.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
EVIDENCE OF TAIWAN'S WEALTH
 IS EVERYWHERE AND RISING.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
IN JUST TEN YEARS SINCE
 THEY BEGAN MODERNIZING,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
TAIWANESE POVERTY RATES
 WERE CUT BY MORE THAN HALF.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
TODAY, ABSOLUTE POVERTY
 IS VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT HERE

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
AND REAL WAGES ARE
 TEN TIMES HIGHER

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
THAN THEY WERE 40 YEARS AGO.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
THIS MIRACLE ONLY HAPPENED
 BECAUSE THE COUNTRY CONSCIOUSLY

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
EMBRACED GLOBAL CAPITALISM.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
BUT BEFORE A COUNTRY
 CAN DO THAT,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
IT MUST HAVE
 CAPITALISM AT HOME.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
AND THE FIRST STEP
 TOWARDS THAT IS LAND REFORM.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
IF PEOPLE DON'T OWN THEIR LAND,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE
 TO MAKE IT PROFITABLE.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
IN THE 1950'S THE TAIWANESE
 GOVERNMENT BEGAN BUYING LAND

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
FROM THE OLD ELITE AND
 GIVING IT TO THE POPULATION.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
YIELDS INCREASED RAPIDLY AND
 TAIWAN WAS SUPPLIED WITH FOOD,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
RELEASING MANPOWER FOR INDUSTRY.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
ONCE THIS WAS A FARMHOUSE
 SURROUNDED BY RICE PADDIES.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
IT'S WHERE MR. WANG ONCE
 LIVED AND HE STILL COMES HERE

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
TO PLAY MAH JONG
 WITH HIS FRIENDS.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
MR. WANG ILLUSTRATES HOW TAIWAN
 BENEFITED FROM LAND REFORM.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
HIS PARENTS WERE POOR FARMERS
 UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
THEIR LAND IN 1968.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
ONCE HE OWNED THE LAND
 MR. WANG'S FATHER

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
THOUGHT IT WORTHWHILE
 TO BUILD A MILL.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
TODAY, MR. WANG
 IS A MILLIONAIRE.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
HE TURNED HIS FATHER'S MILL
 INTO A FACTORY,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
MAKING THOSE CHEAP PLASTIC TOYS
 FOR WHICH TAIWAN BECAME KNOWN

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000
IN THE SIXTIES.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
HIS JOURNEY FROM
 RURAL BEGINNINGS

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
TO INDUSTRIAL WEALTH REFLECTS
 HOW TAIWAN HAS DEVELOPED.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
AT A NEARBY TEAHOUSE, I ASKED
 MR. WANG HOW IT ALL BEGAN.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
MR. WANG:
 TOYS, SUCH AS BARBIE DOLLS,
 CHILDREN'S BUILDING BRICKS,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
SPORTS GEAR LIKE
 SKATEBOARDS, STAINLESS
 STEEL SCISSORS

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
WITH PLAIC HANDLES.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
AT THE BEGINNING WE WERE WORKING
 24 HOURS A DAY IN SHIFTS.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
THE MACHINERY IN
 THE PAST WAS MORE LIKELY
 TO CAUSE ACCIDENTS.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
YOU HAD TO
 LEARN AND ABSORB SLOWLY.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
THAT'S WHAT CAUSED
 THE INJURIES TO MY FINGERS

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
NARRATOR: THESE EARLY FACTORIES
 WERE SWEATSHOPS, BUT BACK THEN

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
ALL TAIWAN HAD TO OFFER
 WAS CHEAP LABOR AND LONG HOURS.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
MR. WANG TOLD ME HOW
 THE GOVERNMENT'S PUSH

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
FOR INDUSTRIALIZATION DURING
 THE SIXTIES MEANT HIS PARENTS

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
WERE ENCOURAGED
 TO BUILD THEIR FACTORY.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
AT THAT TIME, THE THEN VICE
 PRESIDENT WAS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
TO GO INTO THE MANUFACTURING
 INDUSTRY BY TELLING US,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
"YOUR HOME IS A FACTORY" AND
 "THE LIVING ROOM IS A FACTORY".

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
ORIGINALLY,
 WE WERE GROWING CROPS.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
THE FIELD WE WERE CULTIVATING
 WAS GIVEN TO MY FATHER

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
BY THE GOVERNMENT.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
THE GOVERNMENT
 WAS REFORMING AT THE TIME.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
THEY WANTED TO ENCOURAGE
 SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED WHICH
 LAND WAS FOR INDUSTRIAL USE

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
WHICH MEANT YOU COULD BUILD
 A FACTORY THERE.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
MY FATHER WAS GIVEN THIS
 OPPORTUNITY AND SO, OF COURSE,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
WE MADE USE OF THE LAND

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
AND NOW OUR CHILDREN ARE
 GROWN-UP AND DOING THE SAME.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
NARRATOR: MR. WANG'S GENERATION
 GAVE TAIWAN SWEATSHOPS

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
CHURNING OUT CHEAP GOODS
 FOR WESTERN MARKETS.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
UGLY BLIGHTS ON THE LANDSCAPE,
 YES, BUT DON'T OPPOSE THEM.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
THEY WERE A TRANSITORY
 BUT CRUCIAL STAGE

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
ON TAIWAN'S ROAD TO RICHES.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
IF THE ANTI-GLOBALIZERS
HAD BEEN AROUND

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
WHEN TAIWAN WAS INDUSTRIALIZED,
THEY WOULD HAVE PROTESTED

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
AGAINST THE
FACTORIES AND TOLD US

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
WE WERE EXPLOITING
CHEAP LABOR.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
SURELY THEY WOULD
HAVE ORGANIZED A BOYCOTT.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
AND PERHAPS YOU WOULD
HAVE DECIDED NOT TO BUY THINGS

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
MADE IN TAIWAN.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
IF ENOUGH OF YOU
HAD DECIDED THAT

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
TAIWAN WOULD STILL
BE POOR TODAY.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
NARRATOR: AS MR. WANG AND HIS
 GENERATION BECAME SUCCESSFUL,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
MORE AND MORE FACTORIES
 SPRUNG UP WHICH MEANT

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
THERE WAS AN INCREASING
 DEMAND FOR LABOR.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
ONCE INDUSTRIALIZATION
 WAS WELL UNDERWAY,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
COMPETITION FOR LABOR
 MADE WAGES RISE,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
SO ONLY REALLY COMPETITIVE
 COMPANIES COULD SURVIVE.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
COMPANIES LIKE ACER FLOURISHED

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
BY RESPONDING TO
 COMPETITION WITH INNOVATION.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
STAN SHIH, ACER'S CHIEF
 EXECUTIVE OFFICER, IS KNOWN

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
FOR INVENTING TAIWAN'S
 FIRST DESKTOP CALCULATOR

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
AND THE WORLD'S FIRST PEN WATCH.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
TODAY ACER IS THE 7TH LARGEST
 IT PROVIDER IN THE WORLD.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
THIS IS THE FIRST MACHINE
WE EXPORTED

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET
SO THIS IS 1981.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
WE TRAINED ABOUT 3000
ENGINEERS IN TAIWAN BASED

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
ON THIS TYPE OF MACHINE.
SO I AM SO HAPPY ABOUT THAT.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
THIS IS REALLY GREAT.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
AND THIS IS THE FIRST COMPUTER.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
AT THE END OF 83,
WE INTRODUCED

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
ONE OF THE FIRST COMPATIBLE
COMPUTERS IN THE REGION.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
WHERE WAS THIS EXPORTED?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
ALMOST EVERYWHERE.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
NARRATOR: MR. SHIN
 INVITED ME TO JOIN HIM

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
AT HIS LUNCHTIME
 WORKOUT IN THE COMPANY GYM.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HE THOUGHT

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
WAS THE KEY
 TO TAIWAN'S SUCCESS.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
WAS IT EASIER TO START
A BUSINESS IN TAIWAN

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
THAN IN OTHER COUNTRIES?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
YES, I THINK SO.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
PEOPLE LIKE TO OWN THEIR
OWN BUSINESS, SO WE HAVE A JOKE

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
IN TAIPEI CITY THAT FOR
EVERY SIX PEOPLE ON THE STREET,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
THERE IS ONE CHAIRMAN.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
BUT ONE IN SIX PERSONS YOU MEET
ON THE STREETS HAVE A COMPANY.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
IS THERE LESS BUREAUCRACY
AND RESTRICTIONS

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
THAN IN OTHER COUNTRIES?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I THINK SO.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
THE GOVERNMENT REGULATION IS
REASONABLE AND EVEN MANY PEOPLE

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
START A BUSINESS WITHOUT
KNOWING ALL THE REGULATIONS.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
NARRATOR: A DEREGULATED ECONOMY
 PROVIDES THE IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
IN WHICH ACER CONTINUES
 TO THRIVE AND INNOVATE,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
CONSTANTLY IMPROVING
 PEOPLE'S LIVING STANDARDS.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
WHAT WILL BE THE PRODUCTS OF THE
FUTURE THAT YOU WILL PRODUCE?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
WE RECOGNIZE TODAY
WE HAVE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000
BUT HOW TO DO MORE APPLICATION
TO PACKAGE IN A WAY IS EASIER

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000
TO SERVE THE MORE POPULATION
I THINK IS OUR MISSION.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
AND MAKE IT LIKE OXYGEN.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
OK, YOU DON'T FEEL IT, BUT IT'S
SO IMPORTANT TO OUR DAILY LIFE.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
NARRATOR: ACROSS TAIWAN,
 FAMILIES REFLECT

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THE COUNTRY'S PROGRESSION.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
GRANDPARENTS WERE
 RURAL FARMERS, PARENTS,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
FACTORY WORKERS AND
 TODAY'S GENERATION,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
WELL-PAID SOFTWARE ENGINEERS
 AND BUSINESSMEN.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
FUH-JYI CHANG WORKS IN IT
 IN THE CAPITAL

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
AND HAS A TASTE
 FOR EXPENSIVE CARS.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
YET LIKE SO MANY
 OF HIS GENERATION,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
HIS ROOTS ARE FAR
 FROM THE CITY.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
TOGETHER WE DROVE TO TAI CHUNG,
 THE TOWN WHERE HE GREW UP.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
MY FATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
HE WORKED MUCH HARDER THAN
 US AND WAS EXHAUSTED EVERY DAY.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
HE SWEATED WHILE WORKING
 AND WAS ALWAYS REALLY TIRED.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
THIS IS BECAUSE OUR EDUCATION
 LEVELS ARE DIFFERENT.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
MY BROTHER AND
 I HAD HIGHER EDUCATION

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
AND I FINISHED
 A MASTER'S DEGREE.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
OUR WORK IS
 MAINLY OFFICE-BOUND,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
SO OUR JOBS
 ARE REALLY DIFFERENT

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
AS ONE IS BASED ON LABOR
 AND THE OTHER ON INTELLECT.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
WE USED TO BE VERY POOR
 BUT NOW WE ARE MIDDLE-CLASS,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
COMFORTABLY OFF.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
MOST OF MY GENERATION NOW WORKS
 IN THE HIGH TECH INDUSTRY.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
YOU SEE TAIWAN CHANGE
 IN THE LAST 20 TO 30 YEARS.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
NARRATOR: FUH-JYI'S MOTHER
 STILL WORKS IN A FACTORY.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
BUT FOR HER GENERATION THIS
 WAS A STEP UP FROM FARMING AND

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
MEANT PARENTS COULD AFFORD TO
 EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN PROPERLY.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
RISING PROSPERITY ALSO INCREASES
 THE RETURNS ON THEIR EDUCATION.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
MY PARENTS WERE FARMERS.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
BACK THEN, I REALLY,
 REALLY WANTED TO BE EDUCATED,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
BUT WHEN I FINISHED PRIMARY
 SCHOOL, MY PARENTS TOLD ME

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
THAT I WAS THE ELDEST SO HAD TO
 EARN EXTRA MONEY FOR THE FAMILY.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I USED TO MAKE SHOES.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I HAD TO EARN THE MONEY
 BECAUSE I HAD TWO KIDS.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
FUH-JYI AND HIS YOUNGER
 BROTHER NEEDED TO BE EDUCATED.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT
 HE HAS ACHIEVED SO FAR.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
HE IS A GOOD MAN
 ALWAYS STRIVING TO GET AHEAD.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
HE IS VERY GOOD TO ME.
 HOW CAN I PUT THIS?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
WELL, HE GOT MARRIED RECENTLY
 AND I WENT TO TAIPEI CITY.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
HIS GENERAL MANAGER AND
 THE DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
TOLD ME THAT MY SON
 WAS BRILLIANT.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I WAS SO HAPPY TO HEAR IT
 THAT I CRIED.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
THE PREVIOUS GENERATION
MADE PAPER BOXES.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
THE CURRENT ONE PRODUCES
THE GOODS THAT GO IN THEM.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
NARRATOR: IN CONTRAST
 TO AFRICAN COUNTRIES

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
THAT TRIED TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
AND PRODUCE EVERYTHING
 THEY NEEDED AT HOME,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
TAIWAN SPECIALIZED IN
 THOSE SECTORS WHERE THEY COULD

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
PRODUCE WELL AND IMPORTED
 THE REST.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
BECAUSE THEY WERE CONSTANTLY
 EXPOSED TO FOREIGN COMPETITION,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
COMPANIES HAD TO BE MORE
 PRODUCTIVE AND INNOVATIVE

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
IN ORDER TO SURVIVE AND GROW.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
FROM BICYCLES AND TOYS

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
TO CD'S AND COMPUTERS
IN ONE GENERATION,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I THINK THAT SUMS UP TAIWAN'S
JOURNEY FROM RAGS TO RICHES.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
NARRATOR: GLOBALIZATION
 MAKES A COUNTRY WEALTHY

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
AND IT'S THIS WEALTH WHICH
 BREEDS A MIDDLE CLASS

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
WITH A VESTED INTEREST IN
 ECONOMIC FREEDOM AN DEMOCRACY.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I BELIEVE DEMOCRACY IS
 ANOTHER HAPPY SIDE-EFFECT

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
OF GLOBALIZATION.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
TODAY, TAIWAN
 IS A DEMOCRACY LIKE BRITAIN.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
JUST 40 YEARS AGO,
 TAIWAN WAS A DICTATORSHIP

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
UNDER THE IRON RULE
 OF CHANG KAI SHEK.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I VISITED HIS MEMORIAL
 WITH JOHN WANG,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
WRITER AT LARGE
 FOR A BUSINESS MAGAZINE

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
AND A POLITICAL ACTIVIST
 WHO HAD TAKEN PART

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
IN THE PRO-DEMOCRACY
 DEMONSTRATIONS RIGHT HERE.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
AFTER PRESIDENT CHAING
KAI SHECK DIED IN 1975,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I THINK TAIWAN BEGAN
TO GO THROUGH A TRANSFORMATION.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
BECAUSE IN THE PAST,
IN THE 60'S AND 70'S,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
TAIWAN RELIED VERY HEAVILY ON
THIS LABOR-INTENSIVE INDUSTRY,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
SO IN THE 80'S WE STARTED
TO MAKE COMPUTER PARTS,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
REFRIGERATORS, AIR CONDITIONERS,
TV SETS, THINGS LIKE THAT...

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
MORE HIGH VALUE ADDED.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
THE IDEA OF MIDDLE CLASS STARTED
TO BECOME REALITY IN THE 80'S.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
SO TOGETHER WITH
THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
AND I THINK THE MIDDLE
CLASS WANT TO HAVE MORE FREEDOM

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
WHETHER IN
THEIR POLITICAL RIGHTS

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
OR IN THEIR ECONOMIC RIGHTS.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
SO WOULD YOU SAY THAT
GLOBALIZATION AND ECONOMIC

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
DEVELOPMENT PLAYED A DECISIVE
ROLE IN THE SHIFT TO DEMOCRACY?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
YES, DEFINITELY.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
NARRATOR: GLOBALIZATION
 AND THE ECONOMIC GROWTH

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
THAT SPRINGS
 FROM IT ARE THE ROCKS

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
ON WHICH DEMOCRACIES
 ARE FOUNDED.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE
 RICHEST COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
LIKE AMERICA
 AND EUROPEAN NATIONS

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
ARE THE MOST STABLE DEMOCRACIES.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
CRITICS OF GLOBALIZATION
 CLAIM THAT THIS PROCESS

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
OF DEMOCRATIZATION
 IS REALLY AMERICANIZATION.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
BUT IF PEOPLE IN OTHER
 CULTURES WANT TO DRINK STARBUCKS

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
OR EAT AT MCDONALD'S,
 WHY SHOULDN'T THEY?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
TOO OFTEN WE WANT CULTURES
 TO REMAIN FROZEN AND INTACT

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
SO WE CAN TREAT THEIR
 COUNTRIES LIKE EXOTIC MUSEUMS

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
WHICH WE VISIT FOR PLEASURE.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
BUT SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE
 THE SAME RIGHTS AS WE DO?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
BESIDES, IT'S NOT
 AS IF MCDONALD'S

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
IS EVER THE ONLY CHOICE.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
TAIWAN GOT RICH BY REWARDING
THOSE WHO USED THE BEST IDEAS

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
AND TECHNOLOGIES FROM ALL AROUND
THE WORLD AND THEY STILL DO.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
JUST LOOK AT THIS PLACE,
CHA FOR TEA.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
THEY BORROW THE LATEST
STARBUCKS CONCEPTS TO MAKE

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
THEIR OWN NATIONAL TEA
TRADITIONS POPULAR AND TRENDY

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
AND THEY ARE EXPANDING
WITH NEW TEA ROOMS

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
OPENING IN THE US AND JAPAN.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
NARRATOR: GLOBALIZATION BRINGS
 WEALTH AND FREEDOM TO EVERYONE,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
BUT THE ANTI-GLOBALIZATION
 MOVEMENT CLAIMS

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
THAT IT'S ONLY THE DANGEROUSLY
 POWERFUL MULTI-NATIONALS

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
REAPING THE REWARDS.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
*IF YOU WANT TO HEAR
 ABOUT SPORTING GEAR,*

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
*THEN DON'T BUY NIKE!

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
*NIKE ALWAYS WANTS TO TAKE
 ALL THE PROFITS IT CAN MAKE.*

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
*SHAME!
 NIKE'S RIPPING OFF ITS WORKERS.*

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
A COMPANY LIKE NIKE
IS OFTEN BRANDED

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
THE ENEMY OF DEMOCRACY
AND LIBERTY.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
BUT IT IS IN FACT A
HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO FREEDOM.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
NARRATOR: NEXT,
 I'M GOING TO VIETNAM

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
TO FIND OUT IF NIKE
 DOES DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
NARRATOR: VIETNAM, ONE
 OF THE WORLD'S POOREST NATIONS.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
THE VAST MAJORITY
 OF THE POPULATION STILL

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
LIVES OFF THE LAND.
 BUT THAT'S CHANGING.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
AND IT'S CHANGING
 BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS FULL

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
OF THOSE SWEATSHOPS
 THAT THE ANTI-GLOBALIZERS

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
ARE SO KEEN TO BOYCOTT.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
WE'VE COME TO THE CAPITAL,
 HO-CHI-MINH CITY, ONCE SAIGON.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY
 TO VISIT THE FLAGSHIP FACTORY

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
OF PERHAPS THE MOST NOTORIOUS
 OF THOSE MULTI-NATIONALS.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
SAY NIKE TO ANY ANTI-GLOBALIZER
AND THEY'LL SAY "SWEATSHOP".

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
OF COURSE, I WOULDN'T
WANT TO WORK IN ONE.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
BUT I'VE NEVER SAID THAT
GLOBALIZATION IS A SMOOTH RIDE.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
WHAT GLOBALIZATION DOES
IS PRODUCE LONG-TERM BENEFITS

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
WHICH THE PROTESTERS
KEEP IGNORING.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
NARRATOR: AND
 IT'S THESE SWEATSHOPS

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
WHICH ARE THE STEPPING-STONES
 TO PROGRESS.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
SWEDEN TOO HAD ITS FAIR SHARE
 OF THEM, AS DID TAIWAN.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
THEY'RE A NECESSARY STAGE IN
 ANY COUNTRY'S INDUSTRIALIZATION.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THE FACTORY'S GENERAL
 MANAGER, LALIT MONTEIRO,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
SHOWED ME AROUND.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
WHAT MANY PROTESTERS FORGET
IS MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
ARE MADE UP OF PEOPLE.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
AND PEOPLE TAKE PRIDE
IN WORKING FOR A COMPANY

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
AND THEY WANT TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
ONE OF THE NIKE'S MAXIMS IS,
"DO THE RIGHT THING",

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
AND OUR EMPLOYEES TAKE THAT
VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
SO WHEN PEOPLE PROTEST
THE BRAND,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
WE FEEL THAT THERE'S
A RESPONSIBILITY,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
NOT ONLY FROM AN ETHICAL
STANDPOINT TO INVESTIGATE

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
WHETHER THERE'S TRUTH BEHIND
THE ALLEGATIONS BUT ALSO,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
BECAUSE OUR BRAND
IS ONE OF OUR GREATEST ASSETS.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
FOR EXAMPLE, NIKE AS A RULE
DOES NOT EMPLOY ANY WORKERS

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
IN ANY OF OUR CONTRACT
FACTORIES UNDER THE AGE OF 18

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
FOR FOOTWEAR AND 16 FOR APPAREL.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
NARRATOR: VIETNAM OUTLAWED
 CHILD LABOR IN 1988,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
BUT THE ECONOMY WAS STILL WEAK
 AND PARENTS RELIED

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
ON THEIR CHILDREN WORKING
 IN ORDER TO SURVIVE.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
BUT, NOW, THE NUMBER
 OF VIETNAMESE CHILDREN IN WORK

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
HAS DROPPED BY 2.2 MILLION
 IN JUST TEN YEARS.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
PEOPLE CAN NOW AFFORD EDUCATION
 AND MORE VIETNAMESE CHILDREN

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
ARE IN SCHOOL THAN EVER BEFORE.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
THE IDEA OF MULTI-NATIONALS
 HIRING HORDES OF CHILDREN

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
TO SLAVE IN THEIR SWEATSHOPS
 IS AN OUTDATED MYTH.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
THERE'S NO INCENTIVE FOR
A FOREIGN-INVESTED COMPANY

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
TO HIRE CHILD LABOR.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
FIRST OF ALL, IT'S NOT THE
RIGHT THING, BUT SECOND OF ALL,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
IF A WORKER IS FOUND TO HAVE
A FAKE ID, SNUCK INTO A FACTORY,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
WE REQUIRE THE FACTORY TO PAY

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
FOR THE WORKER
TO COMPLETE SCHOOL

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
AND TO CONTINUE
PAYING THEM THEIR WAGE.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
THE AVERAGE AGE IN OUR
CONTRACT PARTNER FACTORIES

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
IS ABOUT 24 TO 25 YEARS OLD.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
BUT I ASSUME THEY WORK HERE
FOR A VERY LOW PAY.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
AND IS THIS A WAY OF EXPLOITING
CHEAP LABOR IN A POOR COUNTRY

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
AS MANY CRITICS WOULD SAY?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
THE AVERAGE PAY
HERE IS $54 A MONTH,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
WHICH COMPARES
TO A LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
OF 18 OR 19 DOLLARS A MONTH
FOR A STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISE.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
IN ADDITION, IF YOU COMPARE
THE WAGES TO THAT OF A DOCTOR

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
OR TEACHER,
THEY ARE NOT VERY FAR OFF.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
FOR MANY OF THESE WORKERS,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
THEY'VE COME FROM AN
AGRICULTURAL-BASED ECONOMY,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
THEY HAVE A CHANCE, INSTEAD
OF WORKING, 10 OR 14 HOURS A DAY

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
IN A FIELD TO WORKING IN
AN ENVIRONMENT THAT'S CLEAN,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
THAT'S SAFE, THAT PAYS THEM
A REGULAR WAGE.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
WHERE THEY GET FREE
OR SUBSIDIZED MEALS

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
AND WHERE BASICALLY THERE'S
AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
NARRATOR: BUT NIKE DOESN'T
 PAY ITS WORKERS MORE,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
SIMPLY BECAUSE ITS GENEROUS

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
BUT BECAUSE A MULTI-NATIONAL
 BRINGS FOREIGN MACHINERY,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
NEW MANAGEMENT IDEAS,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
A BIGGER MARKET AND
 EDUCATION FOR ITS WORKERS.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
THESE ASSETS ARE WHAT MAKE A
 MULTI-NATIONAL SO PRODUCTIVE

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
AND SO ABLE
 TO PAY HIGHER WAGES.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
IN THE CANTEEN I TALKED
 TO SOME OF THE WORKERS

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
DURING THEIR LUNCH BREAK.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
I WAS PLANNING TO GO
 TO KOREA SO I HAD A BREAK.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
AFTER TWO YEARS I DECIDED
 TO COME BACK TO THE FACTORY

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
BECAUSE THE COMPANY WAS GOOD
 AND PRODUCED GOOD HIGH QUALITY.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
THE MANAGEMENT WAS ALSO VERY
 GOOD SO I DECIDED TO STAY.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I WAS A TAXI DRIVER, BUT AFTER
 A WHILE, BUSINESS WASN'T GOOD.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
SO I DECIDED TO COME BACK
 AND WORK HERE.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
MY WIFE WORKS
 IN THE CUTTING DEPARTMENT

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
AND HER SALARY IS HIGHER
 THAN MINE.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
NARRATOR: IN FACT, TSI-CHI
 IS PAID THREE TIMES MORE

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
THAN HER HUSBAND BECAUSE
 SHE'S RISEN TO MANAGEMENT LEVEL.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
LATER, I VISITED HER AT HOME.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I AM THE MANAGER
 OF THE CUTTING DEPARTMENT

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
AND MY JOB IS TO SUPERVISE
 THE CUTTING IN ORDER TO MEET

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
OUR HIGH-QUALITY STANDARDS
 IN MAKING SHOES AND I MANAGE

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
WORKERS AND MAKE SURE
 THEY ARRIVE AT WORK ON TIME.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
MY LIFE HAS REALLY CHANGED

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
BECAUSE I DON'T WORK
 ON THE FARM ANY MORE.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
SINCE I JOINED THE COMPANY,
 MY LIFE HAS BECOME MUCH BETTER.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
BEFORE, ON THE FARM,
 PERHAPS HALF A MILLION DONG

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
WAS THE MOST I COULD EARN
 A MONTH.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
NOW I EARN ABOUT TWO AND A HALF
 MILLION AND LIFE IS BETTER NOW.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
THERE'S MY BEDROOM.
 I'VE JUST BOUGHT THE TV.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
NARRATOR: AT OVER £100 A MONTH,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
TSI-CHI'S SALARY IS NOW
 OVER FIVE TIMES WHAT IT WAS

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
AND SHE HAS USED THE EXTRA
 MONEY TO BUILD AN EXTENSION.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
I'M TRYING TO SAVE MONEY
 TO DECORATE

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
AND MAKE THE PLACE PRETTIER.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I ASKED HER WHAT HOPES
 SHE HAD FOR HER SON'S FUTURE.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I WANT TO BRING MY SON UP
 SO HE BECOMES A DOCTOR.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
NARRATOR: THE ANTI-GLOBALISTS
 URGE US TO BOYCOTT NIKE.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
IF ENOUGH OF YOU DO THAT,
 TSI-CHI LOSES HER JOB.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
WATCHING WORKERS PLAYING
 SPORTS DURING THEIR LUNCH-BREAK,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000
IT WAS HARD TO SEE

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000
WHAT THE ANTI-GLOBALISTS
 WERE SO STRESSED OUT ABOUT.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
WHEN I GO OUT INTO
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
I GET ASKED TWO QUESTIONS.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
ONE IS, "WHEN
ARE YOU GOING TO EXPAND

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
SO YOU CAN PROVIDE MORE JOBS?"

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
AND TWO IS, "CAN YOU PROVIDE
MY RELATIVE, A FRIEND,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
A JOB IN ONE OF YOUR FACTORIES?"

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
THERE IS A VERY HIGH DEMAND
FOR THESE JOBS IN VIETNAM

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW
IS WORKERS FROM OTHER PARTS

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
OF THE COUNTRY STARTING
TO MIGRATE DOWN TO THE SOUTH

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
LOOKING FOR JOBS LIKE THIS.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
NARRATOR: I WASN'T THE
 ONLY ONE TOURING THE FACTORY.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
WHILE I WAS TALKING TO LALIT,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
MR. KIET, THE OWNER
 OF A SMALLER, LOCAL SWEATSHOP,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
WAS ALSO VISITING.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
DORIS BUNGAG, CUSTOMS RELATIONS
 MANAGER, WAS SHOWING HIM AROUND.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
THIS IS A MINI PARK.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
WE CONSTRUCTED IT
FOR OUR WORKERS.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
THIS IS NOT RESERVATION
FOR THE NEW EXPANSION?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
NO, NO. IT'S REALLY DESIGNED
FOR OUR WORKERS TO STAY

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
AND RELAX DURING THEIR BREAK.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
THIS IS A PART OF OUR EXPRESSING
OUR GRATITUDE TO OUR WORKERS.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS
WE'VE TRIED TO DO

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
IS REALLY OPEN UP
TO OUTSIDE VISITORS.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
AND HAVE THEM MAKE UP
THEIR OWN MINDS

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
LAST YEAR, VIETNAM HAD OVER
A THOUSAND EXTERNAL VISITORS

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
TO OUR CONTRACT FACTORIES
AND THESE INCLUDED

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
COLLEGE STUDENTS, DIPLOMATS,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS,
OTHER BUSINESSES.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
SO WE HAVE A WHOLE PLETHORA
OF PEOPLE COMING THROUGH

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
ALL OUR FACTORIES TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE DO,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
TRYING TO LEARN FROM US
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE
AS A GLOBAL BRAND.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
SO, MR. KIET, THIS
IS OUR INNOVATION CLASS.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
IT OFFERS JOB TRAINING FOR
VIETNAMESE ASSISTANT MANAGERS.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
HOW LONG FOR
ONE TRAINING COURSE?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
ONE TRAINING COURSE
IS THREE MONTHS.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
NARRATOR: LATER
 I CAUGHT UP WITH MR. KIET.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
HIS FACTORY ALSO
 MAKES SHOES FOR EXPORT

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
AND I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
WHAT HE'D MADE
 OF HIS VISIT TO NIKE.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
BEFORE I VISIT SOME FOREIGN
FACTORY, ESPECIALLY NIKE,

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
WE HAVE A QUESTION.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
WHY THE FOREIGN FACTORY
HERE THEY WORK WELL

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
AND THEY CAN AFTER MUCH MORE?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
AND, ANYHOW, THEY ARE BETTER
AND WHY ARE THEY BETTER THAN US?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
AND AFTER I VISIT NIKE,
I KNOW THE ANSWER.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
MANAGEMENT FROM
THE NIKE FACTORY,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKE
THE WORKER HAPPY.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THE
PRODUCTIVITY NOT ONLY COMES

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000
FROM THE MACHINERY,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
BUT ALSO COMES FROM
SATISFACTION FROM THE WORKER.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
SO I MEAN FOR THE FUTURE
FACTORY, ONE OF THE POINTS

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
WE SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON
IS OUR WORKING CONDITION.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
SO YOU SEE THIS LAND
IS READY FOR CONSTRUCTION.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
NARRATOR: MR. KIET HAD ALREADY
 BEGUN BUILDING A NEW FACTORY.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
THE COMPETITION FOR LABOR THAT
 DRIVES UP WAGES AND CONDITIONS

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
IS ALREADY STARTING HERE
 IN VIETNAM.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000
LOCAL FACTORIES DON'T GO BUST
 WHEN A MULTI-NATIONAL MOVES IN

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
AS THE ANTI-GLOBALISTS FEAR.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
THEY IMPROVE AND GROW,
 THUS STIMULATING THE ECONOMY.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000
AND NIKE BENEFITS
 THE COMMUNITY IN OTHER WAYS.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
THE ROAD OUTSIDE
 THE NIKE FACTORY WAS EMPTY.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
JUST LOOK AT ALL THIS
COMMERCE CLOSE TO THE FACTORY.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
ALL THIS USED TO BE RICE FARMS.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
NIKE ALSO GIVES MICRO-LOANS
 TO LOCAL PEOPLE

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
WANTING TO START UP
 SMALL BUSINESSES.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000
I WENT TO SEE THI YEN
 AND HER MOTHER, CHI HAN.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
WITH A NIKE LOAN THEY
 HAD STARTED A BUSINESS

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
MAKING RICE PAPER.
 IT'S NOW THRIVING.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
BECAUSE OF THE PROTESTERS,
 IT'S PROBABLY THE CASE,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
THAT NIKE IS MORE CAREFUL
 THAN MOST MULTI-NATIONALS,

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
BUT ON AVERAGE, AMERICAN
 MULTI-NATIONALS PAY 8 TIMES MORE

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
THAN THE AVERAGE INCOME IN
 THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
SOME CRITICS WOULD SAY THAT,
YES, PERHAPS THE PRESENCE

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
OF NIKE HERE AND FOREIGN
INVESTMENT CAN CREATE

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN
THE SHORT-RUN, BUT THEN WAGES

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
WILL INCREASE AND REACH
THE POINT THAT BUSINESS

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
WILL LEAVE AND
GO TO ANOTHER COUNTRY

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000
WITH LOWER WAGES LIKE CHINA.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
AND WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN
TO VIETNAM THEN?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I WOULD CHALLENGE THOSE CRITICS
ON A COUPLE OF POINTS.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
ONE IS NIKE HAS BEEN
IN COUNTRIES LIKE THAILAND

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
AND INDONESIA
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
THE WAGES IN THOSE COUNTRIES,
IN THAILAND FOR INSTANCE,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
THE WAGE IS ALMOST DOUBLE
WHAT IS IN VIETNAM.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
NOW WHAT HAPPENS IS, AS YOU
STAY IN THE COUNTRY LONGER

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
YOUR PRODUCTIVITY INCREASES.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
AND YOU FIND THAT
THE WORKERS PRODUCE MORE,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
EVEN AS THEIR WAGES GO UP.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
WE EXPECT THE SAME
TO OCCUR IN VIETNAM.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
WE EXPECT WAGES WILL GO UP.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
WE ALSO EXPECT TO BE HERE
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
NARRATOR: ACTUALLY,
 IF NIKE DOES MOVE ON

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
BECAUSE WAGES HAVE GONE UP,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
IT'S A GREAT THING FOR VIETNAM
 BECAUSE NIKE WILL HAVE PLAYED

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
ITS PART IN DEVELOPING
 THE VIETNAMESE ECONOMY.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
THE ANTI-GLOBALISTS HAVE SCARY
VISIONS OF VAST MULTI-NATIONALS

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
RULING THE WORLD REGARDLESS
OF WHAT PEOPLE THINK OR WANT.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
BUT BIG IS BEAUTIFUL.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
WHAT WE HAVE TO FEAR
IS NOT SIZE BUT MONOPOLY.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
WHAT'S HAPPENED
 IN THE AGE OF GLOBALIZATION

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
IS THAT MULTINATIONALS
 HAVE GOTTEN LESS POWERFUL

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
BECAUSE FREE TRADE HAS MEANT
 THEY CAN NO LONGER BE IN CAHOOTS

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND HAVE
 TO BE EXPOSED TO COMPETITION.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
TODAY, THE CONSUMERS CONTROL
 THE CORPORATIONS.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
AND IT'S THOSE HATED
 MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATIONS

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000
AND SWEATSHOPS THAT ARE HELPING
 VIETNAM TO BECOME RICH.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
IN JUST 15 YEARS, THE
 VIETNAMESE ECONOMY HAS DOUBLED

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
AND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE LIVING
 IN ABSOLUTE POVERTY HAS HALVED.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
IN FACT, POVERTY THRIVES
 IN PRECISELY THOSE COUNTRIES

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
THAT FAIL TO
 EMBRACE GLOBALIZATION,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
LIKE MOST AFRICAN COUNTRIES.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
NEXT, I AM GOING TO KENYA
 TO SHOW YOU WHY.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
KENYA. EAST AFRICA.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
JUST 50 YEARS AGO,
 TAIWAN WAS AS POOR AS KENYA,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
BUT THE TAIWANESE
 ARE NOW TWENTY TIMES RICHER

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
WHEREAS ONE IN THREE PEOPLE HERE
 STILL LIVE IN ABSOLUTE POVERTY.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
PEOPLE HERE ARE POOR

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
BECAUSE KENYA CLOSED ITS DOORS
 TO GLOBALIZATION.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
MORE THAN HALF OF THE KENYAN
 POPULATION WORKS ON THE LAND.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
MOST FARMERS ARE STILL POOR
 BECAUSE THE KENYAN GOVERNMENT

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000
HAS NEVER GIVEN THEM
 PROPERTY RIGHTS.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
WHEREAS IN TAIWAN,
 GIVING PEOPLE THEIR OWN LAND

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
WAS THE FIRST STEP ON THE ROAD,
 TO INDUSTRIALIZATION AND GROWTH.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
HERE FARMERS LIKE SIMON WAMWAKE
 CAN'T EVEN HOPE TO EXPAND.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
SIMON IS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO
 BUILD ON HIS LAND AND, ANYWAY,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
IT WOULD BE POINTLESS
 TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT AS,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
WITHOUT OWNERSHIP, HE WOULDN'T
 BE ABLE TO REAP THE REWARDS.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
SIMON: THIS LAND STILL BELONGS
 TO THE GOVERNMENT.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
I'M FARMING IT ONLY
 FOR A SHORT TIME.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
EVEN IF YOU ARE CULTIVATING
THE LAND, THE LAND STILL BELONGS

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000
TO THE GOVERNMENT, AND SO WE DO
IT AS IF WE ARE MOVING, MOVING.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
WE JUST FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL
FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
NARRATOR: SO YOU WILL NEVER GET
A PROPERTY RIGHT?

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
SIMON: YOU WILL NEVER GET
THE PROPERTY RIGHT, NEVER.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
NARRATOR: HOW DO YOU THINK
AGRICULTURE WOULD CHANGE

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
IN KENYA IF ALL OF YOU
GOT PROPERTY RIGHTS?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
IF WE WERE ALLOWED
TO DO SO, KENYA WILL BE

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:23.000
A VERY HIGH-EARNING,
VERY PROSPEROUS COUNTRY.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
NARRATOR: BUT
 KENYA IS NOT PROSPEROUS.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
HAMPERED BY BUREAUCRACY AT HOME
 AND EXPORT RESTRICTIONS ABROAD.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
KIBERA IS A SHANTY TOWN

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
CLINGING TO THE EDGE
 OF THE CAPITAL, NAIROBI.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
HERE, NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE
 ARE CRAMMED TOGETHER

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
WITHOUT RUNNING WATER,
 SANITATION OR ELECTRICITY.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
THERE ARE PLENTY
 OF ENTREPRENURES HERE,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
BUT FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK
 THE PEOPLE HERE ARE POOR.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
SO WHY CAN'T
 THEIR BUSINESSES THRIVE?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
YET AGAIN, IT'S ABOUT LAND.
 NO ONE OWNS THEIR PLOT.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
NARRATOR: WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
IF YOU HAD A PROPERTY RIGHT
TO THIS SHOP AND THIS LAND?

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
WOMAN: IF I CAN LEND CAPITAL,
ENOUGH CAPITAL,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
TO START A BUSINESS LIKE
THE OTHER ONE, I CAN MAKE IT.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
NARRATOR: COULD
YOU GET HELP FROM...?

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
YOU CAN'T GET HELP FROM
NOWHERE. IT WILL BE A PROBLEM.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
NARRATOR: IF YOU
 DON'T OWN YOUR LAND,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
YOU CAN'T EXPAND
 OR SECURE A LOAN.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
ON TOP OF THAT, TRADERS HERE
 HAVE TO BUY A LICENSE.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
ACCORDING TO THE WORLD BANK,
 IT TAKES 11 PROCEDURES,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
68 DAYS, AND HALF
 A YEAR'S INCOME TO GET ONE.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
IT'S NO WONDER THAT
 HALF OF ALL KENYANS

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
WORK ON THE BLACK MARKET.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
WHAT THE PEOPLE HERE DEMONSTRATE
 IS THAT KENYA CAN'T GROW.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
GIVEN THE BARRIERS THEY
 FACE, NONE OF THEM CAN BUILD

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
THEIR BUSINESSES,
 SO CAPITALISM CAN'T TAKE ROOT.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
WOMAN: IF YOU HAVE NO MONEY,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
THE GOVERNMENT
WON'T GIVE YOU A LICENSE.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM MONEY AND
THEN THEY GIVE YOU A LICENSE,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
BUT THAT MONEY IS NEEDED
TO BUILD THINGS LIKE A ROOF

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
OVER MY HEAD AND OTHER THINGS.
EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON MONEY.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000
IF I OBTAINED A LICENSE, I
COULD BUILD, I COULD BUY BOXES.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
DO YOU SEE THIS DUST?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
IF I HAD BOXES I COULD
SELL FROM NOW 'TIL NIGHT.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
MAN: YOU CAN'T GET MONEY TO
START A BUSINESS LIKE THIS

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
IF YOU HAVE NO MEANS.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
IT'S HARD TO GET MACHINES
LIKE THIS IF YOU HAVE NO MONEY.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
IF I HAD MONEY TO START
A BUSINESS,

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000
I WOULD OPEN MY OWN BARBERSHOP.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
NARRATOR: IS THE PROBLEM HERE
 LACK OF ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
NO.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
IS IT STARVATION?
 NO.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
IS IT LAZINESS?
 DEFINITELY NOT.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:19.000
NO, IT'S POVERTY DUE TO LACK OF
 GROWTH, DUE TO LACK OF REFORM.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
EVERYTHING ELSE IS
JUST A SYMPTOM OF THAT.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
IN FACT, EVEN THE
BIGGEST HORRORS, FAMINE AND
WAR HAVE POLITICAL CAUSES.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
NO DEMOCRACY HAS EVER
BEEN AFFLICTED BY FAMINE

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
AND NO TWO DEMOCRACIES HAVE
EVER MADE WAR ON EACH OTHER.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
AFRICA HAS BEEN SUBJECTED
TO SOCIALISM,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
GANGSTER RULE AND PROTECTIONISM.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
AFRICA HAS NOT
BEEN TOO GLOBALIZED.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
IT HAS BEEN TOO MARGINALIZED.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000
NARRATOR: OPPRESSIVE
 AND CORRUPT POLITICIANS

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
HAVE SYSTEMATICALLY SHATTERED
 THE KENYA'S POTENTIAL.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
BUT THERE ARE SIGNS OF CHANGE.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
IN DECEMBER, 2002,
 A NEW PRESIDENT WAS ELECTED,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
OUSTING THE NOTORIOUSLY
 CORRUPT REGIME

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
OF PRESIDENT DANIEL ARAP MOI.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
THE NEW GOVERNMENT
 IS BREEDING NEW HOPE

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
AND THE MOOD IN THE COUNTRY
 IS BUOYANT.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
JUNE ARUNYA, A 21-YEAR-OLD
 ECONOMICS STUDENT,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
IS PASSIONATE
 AND IDEALISTIC

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
ABOUT HER COUNTRY'S
 POTENTIAL TO GROW.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
THE KIND OF KENYA I'D LIKE TO
SEE IS WHERE PEOPLE'S IDEAS

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
COULD BE TURNED INTO REALITY,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
WHERE IDEAS WOULD BE GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
SO THAT ALL THE TALENT WE HAVE
DOESN'T GO TO THE GRAVE.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
A KENYA WHERE ALL THE OTHER
IDEAS OUT THERE THAT EVERYBODY

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
HAS ACCESS TO
ARE ALLOWED HERE.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
A KENYA WHERE
IF YOU'RE BILL GATES

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
AND WINDOWS IS IN YOUR MIND
YOU CAN BECOME A BILLIONAIRE.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
NARRATOR:
 THIS IS AN OUTDOOR MARKET
 ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF NAIROBI

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
KNOWN AS THE JUA KALI, SWAHILI
 FOR UNDER THE FIERCE SUN.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
ALL KINDS
 OF GOODS FROM POTS
 AND PANS TO HUBCAPS,

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
TRUNKS AND TOYS ARE
 CONJURED OUT OF SCRAP METAL.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
PEOPLE HERE
 ARE CLEARLY TALENTED

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
AND AS MOTIVATED
 AND HARD-WORKING

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
AS THE TAIWANESE
 OR VIETNAMESE

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
BUT WHAT MULTI-NATIONAL
 WOULD WANT TO SET UP SHOP

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
AND HIRE THESE PEOPLE
 IN SUCH A HOSTILE
 BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
THESE BUSINESSES ARE DOOMED TO
 REMAIN INFORMAL AND SMALL-SCALE.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
FOR NOW JUNE'S DREAM FOR
 KENYA REMAINS AN ELUSIVE UTOPIA.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
BUT IT NEEDN'T BE LIKE THIS.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT
 RELAXED RESTRICTIONS

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
ON MOBILE PHONE INDUSTRY,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
SALES SOARED AND NOW CHEAP
 MOBILES HAVE REVOLUTIONIZED

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS
 OF KENYANS.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
THE MOBILE PHONE INDUSTRY
 IS BOOMING

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
AND MANY KENYANS
 CAN'T AFFORD EXPENSIVE,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
STATE-CONTROLLED LAND-LINES
 NOW OWN MOBILES.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000
JUNE:
MY GRANDFATHER, WE COULD ONLY
VISIT HIM ONCE A YEAR BEFORE

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
BECAUSE HE LIVES VERY FAR
AWAY AND MY MOTHER HAD TO SAVE

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
THE
WHOLE YEAR TO BE ABLE TO FERRY
THE WHOLE FAMILY TO SEE HIM.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
AND HE'S VERY SICKLY.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
BUT SINCE THE COMING OF MOBILE
PHONES SHE COULD BUY A PHONE

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
VERY CHEAPLY, GIVE IT TO HIM AND
NOW WE CAN CALL HIM ANY TIME.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
NARRATOR:
 JUNE TOOK ME TO A VAST SECOND
 HAND CLOTHES MARKET IN NAIROBI.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
PEOPLE HERE SELL CHEAP CLOTHES
 IMPORTED IN BULK FROM ABROAD.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
LIKE THE MOBILE PHONE INDUSTRY,
 ITS EXPOSURE TO GLOBALIZATION

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
HAS MADE THIS MARKET
 A MASSIVE SUCCESS.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
JUNE:
WE COULD OVERNIGHT NOT TELL
THE DIFFERENCE ON THE STREET

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
BETWEEN A RICH PERSON
AND POOR PERSON

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
BECAUSE IT WAS
SO OBVIOUS BEFORE.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
WHEN I GREW UP, PEOPLE
HAD MOSTLY FOUR OUTFITS:

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
THEIR SUNDAY BEST
WHICH THEY WOULD WEAR TO CHURCH,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
THEIR SCHOOL UNIFORM
AND THEN TWO OTHER OUTFITS

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
THAT THEY WOULD WEAR AT HOME.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
BUT SINCE THE COMING
OF THESE CLOTHES, YOU KNOW,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
I CAN CHANGE MY CLOTHES
AS MANY TIMES AS I WANT,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
GET THEM IN
THE DIFFERENT COLORS I WANT.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
NARRATOR: STEPHEN IS
 TYPICAL OF A STALLHOLDER

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
WHO HAS PROFITED
 FROM THIS BOOMING NEW MARKET.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
STEPHEN: THE SECOND-HAND CLOTHES
BUSINESS HAS HELPED ME A LOT.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
IF I HADN'T HAD THIS BUSINESS,
I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
ANY OTHER WAY OF EARNING
BECAUSE I HAVE NO EDUCATION.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
SO IT'S HELPED ME A
LOT TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE FOR ME

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
AND MY FAMILY
WITH OUR FOUR CHILDREN.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
WE'VE BEEN ABLE
TO BUILD A FINE HOUSE

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
AND NOW I HAVE A LIFE
THAT SUITS ME.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
IF IT WEREN'T FOR THIS,
I'D PROBABLY BE A LABORER.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
NARRATOR:
 A FEW YEARS AGO, THE GOVERNMENT
 INTRODUCED A TAX ON THE CLOTHES

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
AND RECENTLY THEY HAVE
 RAISED THAT TAX CONSIDERABLY.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
SO IMPORT DUTIES ARE YET AGAIN
 KEEPING GLOBALIZATION AT BAY

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
AND THREANING ONE
 OF KENYA'S FEW SUCCESS STORIES.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
HE SAID THAT
IF THIS INDUSTRY WAS CLOSED,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
HE KNOWS FOR SURE THERE'LL BE
LOTS OF CHILDREN WALKING NAKED.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
HE SAYS HE KNOWS MANY WOMEN
WHO HAVE UP TO TEN CHILDREN

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
AND THESE ARE THE ONLY
CLOTHES THEY'VE EVER WORN.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
NARRATOR:
 EVEN IF KENYA DID AWAY WITH
 ALL ITS RESTRICTIONS AT HOME,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
THERE REMAINS ANOTHER
 VAST BARRIER STANDING

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
BETWEEN IT AND THE PROSPERITY
 THAT GLOBALIZATION COULD BRING.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
WEALTHY COUNTRIES HAVE IMPOSED
 HIGH TARIFFS ON ALMOST ALL

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
 KENYA COULD EXPORT TO THEM,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
 SOME VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
IN THE CASE OF FLOWERS,
 THE EUROPEAN UNION AGREED

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
TO KEEP TARIFFS ON KENYA'S
 FLOWER EXPORTS LOW. THE RESULT?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
KENYA HAS BECOME
 THE LEADING EXPORTER

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
OF CUT FLOWERS TO EUROPE.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
JANE: CURRENTLY WE ARE SELLING
TO THE EUROPEAN UNION MOSTLY.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
THAT IS IN THE NETHERLANDS,
GERMANY, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
AND THE UK ALSO.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000
WE ALSO
SELL TO THE UNITED EMIGRATES
AND ALSO TO THE AMERICAS.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
JANE IS THE EXPORT MANAGER HERE.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I ASKED HER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
 IF THE EUROPEAN UNION STOPPED

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
GIVING THE FLOWER INDUSTRY
 SPECIALLY-LOW TARIFFS.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
JANE: THAT MEANS THAT
THE FARMS WOULD ALL PERISH.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I MEAN IT'S A DISASTER
TO THE INDUSTRY.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE MARGINS
WE ARE HAVING ARE VERY SMALL

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
AND WHATEVER WE ARE ENJOYING
RIGHT NOW IS BECAUSE OF THE DUTY

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
THAT HAS BEEN REDUCED FOR US.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
THAT MEANS IF YOU PUT THE DUTY,
THAT THE FARMS WOULD CERTAINLY

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
NOT OPERATE,
THEY'LL ALL CLOSE DOWN

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
AND THE SOCIAL IMPACT
ON THAT IS TERRIBLE.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
NARRATOR: THE EUROPEAN UNION
HAS REDUCED TARIFFS ON FLOWERS.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY
REDUCED AND ABOLISHED TARIFFS

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
FOR ALL OTHER GOODS
AND ALLOWED ALL OF THEM
INTO THE EUROPEAN MARKET?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
THEN THE ECONOMY IN KENYA
WOULD DO SO WELL.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
NARRATOR: BUT
 KENYA ISN'T DOING WELL

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
DESPITE THESE ISOLATED
 SUCCESS STORIES.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S PARTLY
 BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
DOING IS EVEN WORSE
 THAN JUST TRYING TO KEEP

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
KENYAN AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS OUT.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
THE EUROPEAN UNION PROTECTS
 OUR FARMERS BY SUBSIDIZING FOOD

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
FOR EXPORT TO COUNTRIES
 LIKE KENYA. THE RESULTS?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
FORMERLY THRIVING
 COMMERCIAL FARMS,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.000
LIKE PETER MWANGI'S,
 ARE SUFFERING.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
IN FACT, OVER THE LAST
 FEW YEARS, PETER HAS HAD TO STOP

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000
CULTIVATING LARGE PARTS
 OF HIS LAND.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
SOME PEOPLE IN EUROPE
THINK THEY ARE ACTUALLY HELPING

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000
A COUNTRY LIKE KENYA WHEN THE
TAXPAYERS ARE SUBSIDIZING WHEAT

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
AND SO ON AND DUMPING IT HERE.
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
PETER: NO THEY
ARE NOT HELPING KENYA

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
BECAUSE THEY BRING WHEAT
WHEN WE DON'T NEED IT.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
THEY SHOULD BRING
WHEN WE ASK THEM TO BRING;

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
WHEN WE HAVE DROUGHT.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
MAYBE THEY COULD TAKE IT TO A
COUNTRY LIKE ETHIOPIA OR SOMALIA

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
WHERE THEY DON'T GROW WHEAT,
BUT WHEN WE NEED IT,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
AT THE RIGHT TIME,
THEY CAN BRING.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
BUT NOT WHEN WE ARE HARVESTING
OR WHEN WE HAVE A BUMPER CROP.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
I'M HAVING A CROP,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
SOMEONE BRINGS ANOTHER CROP
FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
DUMPS IT HERE,
AND I WANT TO HARVEST.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
MY WHEAT IS NOT BOUGHT.
IT'S NOT FAIR AT ALL.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
NARRATOR: SO THE EU SUBSIDIZES
 OUR FOOD EXPORTS

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
AND HARD-WORKING FARMERS
 LIKE PETER SUFFER.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
AND THEN, WHEN THERE'S
 A FOOD SHORTAGE A FEW YEARS

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
DOWN THE LINE WE SEND
 MORE WHEAT - AS FOOD AID.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
KENYANS ARE GOOD AT FARMING,
 BOTH CROPS AND LIVESTOCK.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
THEY DON'T NEED AID.
 THEY NEED THE CHANCE TO COMPETE.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
WHEN RICH COUNTRIES DROP
THEIR PROTECTIONISM,
PROFITS CAN SOAR.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
YET THE EU
IS OFTEN UNWILLING

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
TO OPEN ITS DOORS
TO FOREIGN COMPETITION.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
WITH TARIFFS,
WE KEEP THEIR GOODS OUT.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
WITH SUBSIDIES WE DESTROY
THEIR MARKETS HERE.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
WE SPEND HALF OF THE ENTIRE
EU BUDGET ON OUR FARMERS,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
THE COMMON
AGRICULTURAL POLICY.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
NARRATOR: WE SPEND
 SO MUCH ON FARMING THAT
 EACH OF OUR 20 MILLION COWS

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
COULD FLY ROUND THE
 WORLD ONCE EVERY YEAR.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
HOW CAN KENYAN DAIRY

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
OR BEEF FARMERS POSSIBLY
 COMPETE WITH THAT?

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
BUT IF WE ALLOWED
KENYA TO EXPORT THEM

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
AND IF KENYA DID AWAY
WITH ITS RESTRICTIONS
AND RED TAPE,

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
KENYA COULD SERIOUSLY
COMPETE WITH US.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
NARRATOR: IT'S NOT THAT
 WE IN THE WEST ARE TRYING
 TO TRICK POOR COUNTRIES

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
INTO GLOBAL CAPITALISM.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
THE PROBLEM IS WE ARE
 SHUTTING THEM OUT FROM IT.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
THE TWO AREAS WHERE
 THE POOREST COUNTRIES

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
COULD COMPETE
 MOST STRONGLY

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
AND SO BECOME RICH ARE
 FARMING AND TEXTILES.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
BUT THESE ARE PRECISELY
 THE GOODS IN WHICH RICH

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
COUNTRIES REFUSE
 TO TRADE FREELY.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
THE EUROPEAN UNION, FOR
 EXAMPLE, HAS 10,794 TARIFFS,

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
QUOTAS AND SUBSIDIES
 TO PROTECT OUR FARMERS
 AND MANUFACTURERS.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
IMAGINE THE AMOUNT
 OF BUREAUCRACY DEALING

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000
WITH ALL THAT PAPERWORK.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
ONCE UPON A TIME,
WE ESCAPED POVERTY
BECAUSE WE GLOBALIZED.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
WE PRODUCED
AND TRADED FREELY.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
NOW THAT WE ARE RICH,
WE ARE WITHHOLDING

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
THOSE SAME OPPORTUNITIES
FROM POOR COUNTRIES.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
IF WE DROPPED OUR
 SUBSIDIES AND TARIFFS

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
WE COULD MASSIVELY REDUCE
 POVERTY IN AFRICA.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
THE UNITED NATIONS
 HAS CALCULATED
 THAT IF WE DID THIS,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
 COULD MAKE AS MUCH
 AS £450 BILLION A YEAR

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
FROM EXPORTS.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
THAT'S 14 TIMES MORE THAN
 THEY RECEIVE IN AID TODAY.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
OUR WORLD ISN'T
AT ALL TOO GLOBALIZED.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
IN FACT IT HAS FAR TOO
LITTLE GLOBALIZATION.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
WHEREVER THE DOORS
HAVE BEEN OPENED,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
WE'VE SEEN
AMAZING RESULTS.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
THEREFORE ONE OF THE WORST
ENEMIES OF THE POOR TODAY

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
IS THE ANTI-GLOBALIZATION
MOVEMENT.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
THEY ARE ENCOURAGING THE EU
AND THE US TO HAVE MORE,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
NOT LESS RESTRICTIONS.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
THESE PEOPLE ARE
WRONG AND DANGEROUS.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE
 WORLD'S WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
ARE TRYING TO AGREE
 TO REDUCE PROTECTIONISM.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000
IF THIS HAPPENS,
 IT WILL MAKE IT MUCH
 EASIER FOR POOR COUNTRIES

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
TO TRADE THEIR WAY
 TO PROSPERITY.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
BUT THE ANTI-GLOBALIZATION
 PROTESTERS,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
HOWEVER WELL-INTENTIONED,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
HAVE GIVEN OUR GOVERNMENTS
 AN EXCUSE TO BACK AWAY

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
FROM THESE REFORMS.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
SO TODAY,
 WE ALL FACE A CHOICE:

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
DO WE LOBBY OUR GOVERNMENTS
 AGAINST GLOBALIZATION

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000
OR DO WE CAMPAIGN AGAINST
 THE BARRIERS TO GLOBALIZATION

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
THAT STILL EXIST?

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
WORLD POVERTY
 IS NOT INEVITABLE.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
GLOBAL CAPITALISM
 CAN END THAT POVERTY.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
IT HAS DONE SO WHEREVER
 IT'S BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
IN EUROPE,
 NORTH AMERICA, EAST ASIA.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
THE ISSUE AT STAKE IN
 THE GLOBALIZATION DEBATE IS

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000
WHETHER THE WORLD'S
 EXCLUDED ARE GOING
 TO GET THAT SAME CHANCE.
