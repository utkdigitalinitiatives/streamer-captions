00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.030

00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.570


3
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.970
whom we see have sided in hisbehalf.

4
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.300
Now we've shown our power,

5
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.500
let us seem humbler after it isdone

6
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.700
than when it was a-doing.

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.700
Here comes his mother.

8
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.800
Let's not meet her.

9
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.070
- Why? - They say she's mad.

10
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.770
They have taken note of us; keepon your way.

11
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.030
O, ye're well met.

12
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.430
The hoarded plague of the godsrequite your love.

13
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.070
Peace, peace; be not so loud.

14
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.730
If that I could for weeping, youshould hear

15
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.300
Nay, and you shall hear some.

16
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.400
Will you be gone?

17
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.670
You shall stay too.

18
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.900
I would I had the power to sayso to my husband.

19
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.170
Are you mankind?

20
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.130
Ay, fool; is that a shame?

21
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.670
Note but this, fool.

22
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.300
Was not a man my father?

23
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.800
Hadst thou foxship to banish him

24
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.600
that struck more blows for Romethan thou has spoken words?

25
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.100
O, blessed heavens.

26
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.800
More noble blows than ever thouwise words,

27
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.730
and for Rome's good.

28
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.670
I'll tell thee what.

29
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.830
Yet go.

30
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.270
Nay, thou shalt stay too.

31
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.400
I would my son were in Arabia,and thy tribe before him,

32
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.670
his good sword in his hand.

33
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.400
- What then? - What then?

34
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.300
He'd make an end of thyposterity.

35
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.030
Bastards and all.

36
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.830
Good man, the wounds that hedoes bear for Rome.

37
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.400
O, come, come, peace.

38
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.470
I would he had continued to hiscountry as he began

39
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.070
and not unknit himself the nobleknot he made.

40
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.100
I would he had.

41
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.230
"I would he had."

42
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.800
'Twas you incensed the rabble.

43
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.600
Cats that can judge as fitly ofhis worth

44
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.270
as I can of those mysteries

45
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.300
which heaven will not have Earthto know.

46
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.570
Pray, let's go.

47
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.870
Now, pray, sir, get you gone.

48
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.700
You have done a brave deed.

49
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.670
Ere you go, hear this:

50
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.270
As far as doth the capitol

51
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.430
exceed the meanest house inRome, so far my son,

52
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.870
this lady's husband here, this,do you see,

53
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.870
whom you've banished does exceedyou all.

54
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.830
Well, well; we'll leave you.

55
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.930
Why stay we to be baited withone that wants her wits?

56
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.530
Take my prayers with you.

57
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.000
I would the gods had nothingelse to do

58
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.670
but to confirm my curses.

59
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.870
Could I meet them but once aday,

60
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.270
it would unclog my heart withwhat lies heavy to it.

61
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.570
You have told them home,

62
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.700
and, by my troth, you havecause.

63
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.030
You'll sup with me?

64
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.730
Anger's my meat.

65
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.370
I sup upon myself

66
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.270
and so shall starve withfeeding.

67
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.830
Come, let's go.

68
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.070
Leave this faint puling andlament as I do,

69
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.570
in anger, Juno-like.

70
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.530
Come.

71
00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.600
Come.

72
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.630
Come.

73
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.770
There hath been in Rome strangeinsurrections,

74
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.670
the people against the senators,patricians, and nobles.

75
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.130
Hath been?

76
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.970
Is it ended then?

77
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.230
Our state thinks not so.

78
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.670
They are in most warlikepreparation

79
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.230
and hope to come upon them inthe heat of their division.

80
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.400
The main blaze of it is past,

81
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.830
but a small thing would make itflame again,

82
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.830
for the nobles receive so toheart

83
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.400
the banishment of that worthyCoriolanus

84
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.200
that they are in a ripe aptness

85
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200
to take all power from thepeople

86
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.500
and to pluck from them theirtribunes forever.

87
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.170
This lies glowing, I can tellyou,

88
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.570
and is almost mature for theviolent breaking out.

89
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.370
Coriolanus banished?

90
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.770
Banished, sir.

91
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.130
You will be welcome with thisintelligence.

92
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.770
The day serves well for themnow.

93
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:04.830
I've heard it said,

94
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.400
the fittest time to corrupt aman's wife

95
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.630
is when she's fallen out withher husband.

96
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.300
Your noble Tullus Aufidius willappear well in these wars,

97
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.700
his great opposer, Coriolanus,

98
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.930
being now in no request of hiscountry.

99
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.000
A goodly city is this Antium.

100
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.470
City, 'tis I that made thywidows.

101
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.030
Many an heir of these fairedifices

102
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.830
'fore my wars have I heard groanand drop.

103
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.600
Then know me not,

104
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.330
lest that thy wives with spitsand boys with stones

105
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.630
in puny battle slay me.

106
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.630
Save you, sir.

107
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.500
And you.

108
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.600
Direct me, if it be your will,where great Aufidius lies.

109
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.500
Is he in Antium?

110
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500
He is.

111
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.230
Which is his house, beseech you?

112
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.030
This here before you.

113
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.600
I'll thank you, sir.

114
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.600
Farewell.

115
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.030
O, world, thy slippery turns.

116
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.700
Friends now fast sworn,

117
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.270
whose double bosom seems to wearone heart,

118
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.200
whose hours, whose bed, whosemeal and exercise

119
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.530
are still together,

120
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.470
who twin, as 'twere, in loveunseparable,

121
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.930
shall, within this hour, on adissension of a doit,

122
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.670
break out to bitterest enmity.

123
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.530
So, fellest foes, whose passionsand whose plots

124
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.600
have broke their sleep to takethe one the other,

125
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.830
by some chance, some trick notworth an egg,

126
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.230
shall grow dear friends andinterjoin their issues.

127
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.200
So with me.

128
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.670
My birthplace hate I,

129
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:28.870
and my love's upon this enemytown.

130
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.430
I'll enter.

131
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.370
If he slay me, he does fairjustice.

132
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:49.800
If he give me way, I'll do hiscountry service.

133
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.530
Whence comest thou?

134
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.600
What wouldst thou?

135
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.100
Thy name?

136
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.500
Why speak'st not?

137
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.770
Speak, man; what's thy name?

138
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.970
If, Tullus, not yet thou knowestme,

139
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.130
and, seeing me,

140
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.900
does not think me for the man Iam,

141
00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.830
necessity commands me namemyself.

142
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.830
What is thy name?

143
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.730
A name unmusical to the Volscianears

144
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.770
and harsh in sound to thine.

145
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.970
Say, what's thy name?

146
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.630
Thou hast a grim appearance,

147
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.430
and thy face bears a command init,

148
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.930
though thy tackle's torn.

149
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.370
Thou show'st a noble vessel.

150
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.500
What's thy name?

151
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.030
Prepare thy brow to frown.

152
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.170
Know'st thou me yet?

153
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.030
I know thee not.

154
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.830
Thy name?

155
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:58.270
My name is Caius Marcius

156
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.970
who hath done to theeparticularly

157
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:07.800
and to all the Volsces greathurt and mischief;

158
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:13.530
thereto witness may my surname,Coriolanus.

159
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.130
The painful service, the extremedangers,

160
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.100
and the drops of blood shed formy thankless country

161
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.700
are requited but with thatsurname,

162
00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.870
a good memory,

163
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.170
and witness of the malice anddispleasure

164
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.200
which thou shouldst bear me.

165
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:40.330
Only that name remains.

166
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.130
The cruelty and envy of thepeople,

167
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.200
permitted by our dastard nobles,who have all forsook me,

168
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.870
hath devoured the rest andsuffered me

169
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:59.400
by the voice of slaves to bewhooped out of Rome.

170
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.370
Now this extremity hath broughtme to thy hearth,

171
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.730
not out of hope, mistake me not,to save my life,

172
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.770
for if I had feared death,

173
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:14.230
of all the men in the world, Iwould have 'voided thee,

174
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.400
but in mere spite,

175
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.870
to be full quit of those mybanishers,

176
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.470
stand I before thee here.

177
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.730
Then if thou hast a heart ofwreak in thee,

178
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.170
that will revenge thine ownparticular wrongs

179
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.000
and stop those maims of shameseen through thy country,

180
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.270
speed thee straight

181
00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.630
and make my misery serve thyturn.

182
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.830
So use it that my revengefulservices

183
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.170
may prove as benefits to thee,

184
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:48.970
for I will fight against mycankered country

185
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.770
with the spleen of all the underfiends.

186
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.170
But if so be thou darest notthis

187
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:00.730
and that to prove more fortunesthou art tired,

188
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:07.500
then, in a word, I also amlonger to live most weary,

189
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:13.670
and present my throat to theeand to thy ancient malice,

190
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.000
which not to cut would show theebut a fool,

191
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.130
since I have ever followed theewith hate,

192
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.570
drawn tuns of blood from thycountry's breast,

193
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.570
and cannot live but to thyshame,

194
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:31.330
unless it be to do thee service.

195
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.330
O, Marcius, Marcius.

196
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:45.070
Each word thou hast spoke hathweeded from my heart

197
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.330
a root of ancient envy.

198
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.130
If Jupiter should from yondcloud speak divine things

199
00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.230
and say, "Tis true,"

200
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.630
I'd not believe them more thanthee,

201
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.770
all noble Marcius.

202
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:05.000
Let me twine mine arms aboutthat body

203
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.370
where against my grained ash anhundred times hath broke

204
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.900
and scarred the moon withsplinters.

205
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.830
Here I clip the anvil of mysword

206
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.900
and do contest as hotly and asnobly with thy love

207
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:26.230
as ever in ambitious strength Idid contend against thy valor.

208
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.830
Know thou first, I loved themaid I married;

209
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.300
Never man sighed truer breath

210
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:37.370
but that I see thee here, thounoble thing,

211
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:40.300
more dances my rapt heart thanwhen I first

212
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.170
my wedded mistress saw bestridemy threshold.

213
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:49.930
Why, thou Mars.

214
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.970
I tell thee, we have a power onfoot,

215
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.400
and I had purpose once more

216
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.170
to hew thy target from thy brawn

217
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.430
or lose mine arm for it.

218
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:07.400
Thou hast beat me out twelveseveral times,

219
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.700
and I have nightly since dreamtof encounters

220
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.970
'twixt thyself and me.

221
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.430
We've been down together in mysleep,

222
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.730
unbuckling helms, fixing eachother's throats,

223
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.330
and waked half dead withnothing.

224
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.500
Worthy Marcius.

225
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.200
Had we no other quarrel else toRome

226
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.400
but that thou art thencebanished,

227
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.130
we would muster all from twelveto seventy

228
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.100
and pouring war into the bowelsof ungrateful Rome

229
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.300
like a bold flood o'er-bear it.

230
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.700
Come, go in

231
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.130
and take our friendly senatorsby the hands

232
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.400
who now are here,

233
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.970
taking their leaves of me,

234
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.770
who am prepared against yourterritories,

235
00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.730
though not for Rome itself.

236
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.930
You bless me, gods.

237
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.070
Therefore, most absolute sir,

238
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.400
if thou wilt have the leading ofthine own revenges,

239
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.370
take the one half of mycommission

240
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:15.130
and set down, as best thou artexperienced,

241
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.830
since thou know'st thy country'sstrength and weakness,

242
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.200
thine own ways,

243
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.230
whether to knock against thegates of Rome

244
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.530
or rudely visit them in partsremote,

245
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.470
to fright them, ere destroy.

246
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.970
But come in.

247
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.570
Let me commend thee first

248
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.100
to those that shall say yea tothy desires.

249
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.330
A thousand welcomes

250
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.100
and more a friend than ever anenemy,

251
00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.500
yet, Marcius, that was much.

252
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.970
We hear not of him, neither needwe fear him.

253
00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.070
His remedies are tame.

254
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.700
The present peace and quietnessof the people,

255
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.430
which before were in wild hurry,

256
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:09.470
here do we make his friendsblush that the world goes well,

257
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.030
who rather had,

258
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.700
though they themselves didsuffer by it,

259
00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:18.730
behold dissentious numberspestering streets

260
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.130
than see our tradesmen singingin their shops

261
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.770
and going about their functionsfriendly.

262
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.900
We stood to it in good time.

263
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.370
Is this Menenius?

264
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:32.830
'Tis he; 'tis he.

265
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.100
Hail sir.

266
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.030
Hail to you both.

267
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:41.870
Your Coriolanus is not muchmissed

268
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.330
but with his friends.

269
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.370
The commonwealth doth stand,

270
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:51.000
and so would do, were he moreangry at it.

271
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.170
Where is he, hear you?

272
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.200
No, I hear nothing.

273
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.300
His mother and his wife hearnothing from him.

274
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.300
Worthy tribunes,

275
00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:01.130
there is a slave whom we haveput in prison,

276
00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:04.570
reports the Volsces with twoseveral powers

277
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.530
are entered in the Romanterritories,

278
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.800
and with the deepest malice ofthe war

279
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.730
destroy what lies before them.

280
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.300
'Tis Aufidius who, hearing ofour Marcius' banishment,

281
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.800
thrusts forth his horns againinto the world

282
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.700
which were inshelled whenMarcius stood for Rome

283
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.600
and durst not once peep out.

284
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.730
Come, what talk you of Marcius?

285
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.700
Go, see this rumorer whipped.

286
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.670
It cannot be the Volsces darebreak with us.

287
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:30.600
Cannot be.

288
00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.970
I have record that very well itcan,

289
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.530
and three examples of the likehave been within my age.

290
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.530
Tell not me.

291
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.600
I know this cannot be.

292
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.870
Not possible.

293
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.730
The nobles in great earnestness

294
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.130
are coming all to the senatehouse.

295
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.000
Some news there is that stirstheir countenances.

296
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.270
Well, 'tis this slave.

297
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.430
Go, whip him 'fore the people'seyes.

298
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.570
His raising, nothing but hisreport.

299
00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.470
The slave's report is seconded,

300
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:55.830
and more, more fearful isdelivered.

301
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.470
What more fearful?

302
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.030
It is spoke freely out of manymouths,

303
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.730
how probably, I do not know,

304
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.170
that Marcius, joined withAufidius,

305
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.400
leads a power against Rome andvows revenge as spacious

306
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.670
as between the youngest andoldest thing.

307
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.570
O, you have made good work.

308
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.130
What news?

309
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.230
If Marcius should be joined withthe Volsciansó

310
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.830
If?

311
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.430
He is their god.

312
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:21.700
He leads them like a thing madeby some other deity

313
00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.870
than nature that shapes manbetter,

314
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.200
and they follow him against usbrats,

315
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.670
with no less confidence

316
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.530
than boys pursuing summerbutterflies

317
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.000
or butchers killing flies.

318
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.930
You have made good work, you andyour apron-men

319
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.470
that stood so much upon thevoice of occupation

320
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.430
and the breath of garlic eaters.

321
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.270
All the regions do smilinglyrevolt

322
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.800
and who resist are mocked forvaliant ignorance

323
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.330
and perish constant fools.

324
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.870
Who is it can blame him?

325
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.400
Your enemies and his findsomething in him.

326
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.300
We are all undone unless thenoble man have mercy.

327
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.230
Who shall ask it?

328
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.300
The tribunes cannot do it forshame.

329
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.030
The people deserve such pity ofhim

330
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.930
as the wolf does of theshepherds.

331
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.430
For his best friends, if theyshould say,

332
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.600
"Be good to Rome,"

333
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.170
they charged him even as thoseshould do that

334
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.930
had deserved his hate, andtherein showed like enemies.

335
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.930
'Tis true.

336
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.030
If he were putting to my house

337
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.470
the brand that should consumeit,

338
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.670
I have not the face to say,"Beseech you, cease."

339
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.830
You have brought a tremblingupon Rome.

340
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.130
Say not we brought it.

341
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.800
How; was it we?

342
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.730
We loved him but, like beastsand cowardly nobles,

343
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:29.330
gave way unto your clusters

344
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.870
who did hoot him out of thecity.

345
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.130
But I fear they'll roar him inagain.

346
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.500
Tullus Aufidius, the second nameof men,

347
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.730
obeys his points as if he werehis officer.

348
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:41.900
Desperation is all the policy,strength, and defense

349
00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.530
that Rome can make against them.

350
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.130
Here come the clusters

351
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.670
that made the air unwholesome

352
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.370
when you cast your stinking,greasy caps

353
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.970
in hooting at Coriolanus' exile.

354
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.030
Faith, we hear fearful news.

355
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.200
For mine own part, when I said,"Banish him,"

356
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.200
I said 'twas pity.

357
00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.200
And so did I.

358
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.270
And so did I,

359
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.200
and, to say the truth, so didvery many of us.

360
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.470
That we did, we did for thebest,

361
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.530
and though we willinglyconsented to his banishment,

362
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.930
yet it was against our will.

363
00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.830
You're goodly things, youvoices.

364
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.030
You have made good work, you andyour cry.

365
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.330
Do they still fly to the Roman?

366
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.770
I do not know what witchcraft'sin him,

367
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:23.670
but your soldiers use him as thegrace 'fore meat,

368
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.870
their talk at table, and theirthanks at end,

369
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.230
and you are darkened by thisaction, sir,

370
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:32.330
even by your own.

371
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:34.770
I cannot help it now,

372
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:40.530
unless, by using means, I lamethe foot of our design.

373
00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.030
He bears himself more proudlier,even to my person,

374
00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.770
than I thought he would whenfirst I did embrace him.

375
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.870
Yet his nature in that's nochangeling;

376
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:52.830
and I must excuse what cannot beamended.

377
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:56.670
Yet I wish, sir I mean for yourparticular

378
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:59.500
you had not joined in commissionwith him,

379
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.430
but either had borne the actionof yourself

380
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.070
or else to him had left itsolely.

381
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.400
I understand thee well, and bethou sure,

382
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.730
when he shall come to hisaccount,

383
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.870
he knows not what I can urgeagainst him.

384
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.730
Although it seems, and so hethinks,

385
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.800
and is no less apparent to thevulgar eye,

386
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.770
that he bears all things fairly

387
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.600
and shows good husbandry for theVolscian state,

388
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.870
fights dragon-like

389
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.230
and does achieve as soon as drawhis sword,

390
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.400
yet he hath left undone thatwhich shall break his neck

391
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.800
or hazard mine whenever we cometo our account.

392
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:41.400
Sir, I beseech you, think youhe'll carry Rome?

393
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.970
All places yield to him ere hesits down

394
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.030
and the nobility of Rome arehis.

395
00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.800
The senators and patricians lovehim too.

396
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.370
The tribunes are no soldiers,

397
00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.330
and their people will be as rashin the repeal,

398
00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.930
as hasty to expel him thence.

399
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.130
I think he'll be to Rome as isthe osprey to the fish

400
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.030
who takes it by sovereignty ofnature.

401
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.970
First he was a noble servant tothem,

402
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.970
but he could not carry hishonors even.

403
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.430
Whether 'twas pride,

404
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:19.730
which, out of daily fortune,ever taints the happy man;

405
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.930
whether defect of judgment,

406
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:25.130
to fail in the disposing ofthose chances

407
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.770
which he was lord of;

408
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:30.530
or whether nature,

409
00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.530
not to be other than one thing,

410
00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.870
not moving from the casque tothe cushion

411
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.400
but commanding peace even withthe same austerity and garb

412
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.900
as he controlled the war;

413
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.870
but one of these, as he hathspices of them all

414
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:47.900
not all, for I dare so far freehimó

415
00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:54.430
made him feared, so hated, andso banished.

416
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:58.670
But he has a merit to choke itin the utterance.

417
00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:04.770
So our virtues lie in theinterpretation of the time.

418
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.670
And power, unto itself mostcommendable,

419
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.970
hath not a tomb so evident

420
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.670
as a chair to extol what it hathdone.

421
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:24.130
One fire drives out one fire;one nail, one nail;

422
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.030
rights by rights falter,

423
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.200
strengths by strengths do fail.

424
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:41.070
