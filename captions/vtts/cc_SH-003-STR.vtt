00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:51.330


2
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.030
Two households, both alike in dignity,

3
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.530
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

4
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.500
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

5
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.900
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

6
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.770
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

7
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.230
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

8
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.500
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows

9
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.030
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.

10
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,

11
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.170
And the continuance of their parents' rage,

12
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.730
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,

13
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.230
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;

14
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.830
The which if you with patient ears attend,

15
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.700
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

16
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.830
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

17
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.330
No, for then we should be colliers.

18
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.300
I strike quickly, being moved.

19
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.270
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

20
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.970
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant:

21
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.270
when I have fought with the men,

22
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.500
I will be civil with the maids, and cut off their heads.

23
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.830
The heads of the maids?

24
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.500
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;

25
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
take it in what sense thou wilt.

26
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.730
They must take it in sense that feel it.

27
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.630
Me they shall feel whilst I am able to stand:

28
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.800
and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

29
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.570
Draw thy tool!

30
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.970
Here come two of the house of the Montagues.

31
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.700
Quarrel, I'll back thee.

32
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.800
How! Turn thy back and run?

33
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.930
Fear me not.

34
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.130
No, marry; I fear thee!

35
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.570
Let us take the law of our sides;

36
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.670
let them begin.

37
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.930
I will frown as I pass by,

38
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.200
and let them take it as they list.

39
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.500
Nay, as they dare.

40
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.830
I will bite my thumb at them;

41
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.200
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

42
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.700
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

43
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.930
I do bite my thumb, sir.

44
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.570
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

45
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.230
Is the law of our side, if I say ay?

46
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.430
No.

47
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.500
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,

48
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.700
but I do bite my thumb, sir.

49
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.930
Do you quarrel, sir?

50
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.470
Quarrel sir!

51
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.530
No, sir.

52
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.670
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

53
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.930
No better?

54
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.200
Say 'better:' here comes one of our master's kinsmen.

55
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.430
Yes, better, sir.

56
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.030
You lie.

57
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.370
Gregory!

58
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.770
Remember thy swashing blow.

59
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.570
Part, fools!

60
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.070
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

61
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.730
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

62
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.070
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,

63
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.270
Or manage it to part these men with me.

64
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.100
What, drawn, and talk of peace!

65
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.200
I hate the word,

66
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.300
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.

67
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.000
Down with the Capulets!

68
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.830
Down with the Montagues!

69
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.830
What noise is this?

70
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.900
Give me my long sword, ho!

71
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.130
A crutch, a crutch!

72
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.030
Why call you for a sword?

73
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.300
My sword, I say!

74
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.400
Old Montague is come,

75
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.930
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

76
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.870
Thou villain Capulet,-- Hold me not, let me go.

77
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.900
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

78
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.970
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,

79
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.330
Profaners of this neighbour- stained steel,--

80
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.570
Will they not hear?

81
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.670
What, ho!

82
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.700
You men, you beasts,

83
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.730
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage

84
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.500
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,

85
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.270
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands

86
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.300
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,

87
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.300
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.

88
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.970
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,

89
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.600
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,

90
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.200
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,

91
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.500
And made Verona's ancient citizens

92
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.000
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,

93
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.800
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,

94
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.670
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:

95
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.200
If ever you disturb our streets again,

96
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.030
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.

97
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.830
For this time, all the rest depart away:

98
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.100
Capulet, you shall go along with me:

99
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.700
Montague, come you this afternoon,

100
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.430
To hear our further pleasure in this case,

101
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.800
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

102
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.870
O, where is Romeo?

103
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.070
Saw you him to-day?

104
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.470
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

105
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.900
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun

106
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.770
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,

107
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.670
A troubled mind drew me to walk abroad;

108
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.170
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore

109
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.770
That westward rooteth from the city's side,

110
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.600
So early walking did I see your son:

111
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.100
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me

112
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.630
And stole into the covert of the wood.

113
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.330
Many a morning hath he there been seen,

114
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.500
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew.

115
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.870
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;

116
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.930
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun

117
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.900
Should in the furthest east begin to draw

118
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.530
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,

119
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.070
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,

120
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.470
And private in his chamber pens himself,

121
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.100
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out

122
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.870
And makes himself an artificial night:

123
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.530
Black and portentous must this humour prove,

124
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.830
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

125
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.330
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

126
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.270
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

127
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.570
Have you importuned him by any means?

128
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.270
Both by myself and many other friends.

129
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.230
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,

130
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.730
We would as willingly give cure as know.

131
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.300
Trust me, my lord: so please you, step aside;

132
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.070
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

133
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.130
Good-morrow, cousin.

134
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.870
Is the day so young?

135
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.530
But new struck nine.

136
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.700
Ay me!

137
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.830
Sad hours seem long.

138
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.270
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

139
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.870
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

140
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.970
In love?

141
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.070
Out--

142
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.170
Of love?

143
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.800
Out of her favour, where I'm in love.

144
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.830
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,

145
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.830
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

146
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.030
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,

147
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.700
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!

148
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.300
Where shall we dine?

149
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.500
O me!

150
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.070
What fray was here?

151
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.570
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.

152
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.370
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.

153
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.230
Why, then, O brawling love!

154
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.170
O loving hate!

155
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.270
O any thing, of nothing first create!

156
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.900
O heavy lightness!

157
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.130
Serious vanity!

158
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.800
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

159
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.500
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!

160
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.570
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.

161
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.570
Dost thou not laugh?

162
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.700
No, coz, I rather weep.

163
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.870
Good heart, at what?

164
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.870
At thy good heart's oppression.

165
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.300
Why, such is love's transgression.

166
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.030
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;

167
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.530
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;

168
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.370
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovering tears:

169
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.930
What is it else? a madness most discreet,

170
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.170
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.

171
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.400
Farewell, my coz.

172
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.730
Soft!

173
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.430
I will go along;

174
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.400
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

175
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.170
I've lost myself; I'm not here;

176
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.800
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

177
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.870
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

178
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.470
What, shall I groan and tell thee?

179
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.570
Groan, why, no.

180
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.570
But sadly tell me who.

181
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.930
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

182
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.370
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

183
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.470
A right good mark-man!

184
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.670
And she's fair I love.

185
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.070
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

186
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.430
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit

187
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.770
With Cupid's arrow.

188
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.030
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

189
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.870
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.

190
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.700
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow

191
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.700
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

192
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:16.800
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

193
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.900
Teach me how I should forget to think.

194
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.070
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;

195
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.400
Examine other beauties.

196
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.830
He that is strucken blind cannot forget

197
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.800
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:

198
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.900
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,

199
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.670
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note

200
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.730
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?

201
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.930
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

202
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.470
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

203
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.670
But Montague is bound as well as I,

204
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.770
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,

205
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.900
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

206
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.600
Of honourable reckoning are you both;

207
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.570
And pity 'tis you've lived at odds so long.

208
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.830
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

209
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.000
But saying o'er what I have said before:

210
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.600
My child is yet a stranger to the world;

211
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.030
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.

212
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.730
Let two more summers wither in their pride,

213
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.800
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

214
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.100
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

215
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.200
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

216
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.500
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,

217
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.600
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:

218
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.770
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,

219
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.530
My will to her consent is but a part;

220
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.070
An she agree, within her scope of choice

221
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.000
Lies my consent and fair according voice.

222
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.970
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,

223
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.900
Whereto I have invited many a guest,

224
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.900
Such as I love; and you, among the store,

225
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.670
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.

226
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.230
At my poor house look to behold this night

227
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.470
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:

228
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.530
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel

229
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.400
When well-apparell'd April on the heel

230
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.430
Of limping winter treads, even such delight

231
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.700
Among fresh female buds shall you this night

232
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.530
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,

233
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.030
And like her most whose merit most shall be.

234
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.300
Come, go with me.

235
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.300
Go, sirrah, trudge about

236
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.970
Through fair Verona; find those persons out

237
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.330
Whose names are written there, and to them say,

238
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.100
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

239
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.970
Find them out whose names are written here!

240
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.200
It is written,

241
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.700
that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard,

242
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:51.170
and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil,

243
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.230
and the painter with his nets;

244
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.030
but I am sent to find those persons

245
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.400
whose names are here writ, and can never find what names

246
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.730
the writing person hath here writ.

247
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.330
I must to the learned.-- In good time.

248
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.570
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,

249
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.800
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;

250
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.530
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;

251
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.930
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:

252
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.530
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,

253
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.100
And the rank poison of the old will die.

254
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.670
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

255
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.830
God-den, good fellow.

256
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.130
God gi' god-den.

257
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.330
I pray, sir, can you read?

258
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.170
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

259
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.800
Perhaps you have learned it without book:

260
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.030
but, I pray, can you read any thing that you see?

261
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.030
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

262
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.530
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

263
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.570
Stay, fellow; I can read.

264
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.630
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;

265
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.130
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters;

266
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.600
the lady widow of Vitravio;

267
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.170
Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;

268
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.630
Mercutio and his brother Valentine;

269
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.970
mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters;

270
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.670
my fair niece Rosaline and Livia;

271
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.030
Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,

272
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.470
Lucio and the lively Helena.'

273
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.670
A fair assembly: whither should they come?

274
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.770
Up.

275
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.870
Whither?

276
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.970
To supper at our house.

277
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.070
Whose house?

278
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.170
My master's.

279
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.830
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

280
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.500
Now I'll tell you without asking:

281
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.870
my master is the great rich Capulet;

282
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.200
and if you be not of the house of Montague,

283
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.900
come and crush a cup of wine.

284
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.700
Rest you merry!

285
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.170
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's

286
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.470
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,

287
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.000
With all the admired beauties of Verona:

288
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.030
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,

289
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.170
Compare her face with some that I will show,

290
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.770
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

291
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.070
One fairer than my love!

292
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.330
The all-seeing sun

293
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.530
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

294
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.470
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,

295
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.670
Herself poised with herself in either eye:

296
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.270
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd

297
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.670
Your lady's love against some other maid

298
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.430
That I will show you shining at this feast,

299
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.300
And she shall scant show well that now seems best.

300
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.070
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,

301
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.770
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

302
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.400
Nurse, where's my daughter?

303
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.270
Call her forth to me.

304
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.930
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve years old,

305
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.770
I bade her come.

306
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.800
What, lamb!

307
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.830
What, ladybird!

308
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.930
God forbid!

309
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.200
Where's this girl?

310
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.300
What, Juliet!

311
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.530
How now! Who calls?

312
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.530
Your mother.

313
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.230
Madam, I am here.

314
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.530
What is your will?

315
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.500
This is the matter:-- Nurse, give leave awhile,

316
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.930
We must talk in secret:--

317
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.470
Nurse, come back again;

318
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.300
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.

319
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.830
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

320
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.800
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

321
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.900
She's not fourteen.

322
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.000
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--

323
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.900
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--

324
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.000
She's not fourteen.

325
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
How long is it now To Lammas-tide?

326
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.600
A fortnight and odd days.

327
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.070
Even or odd, of all days in the year,

328
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.000
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.

329
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.770
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--

330
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.070
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;

331
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.200
She was too good for me: but, as I said,

332
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.530
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;

333
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.300
I remember it well.

334
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.630
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;

335
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.900
And on that day, of all days of the year,

336
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.170
that she was weaned; I never shall forget it.

337
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.800
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,

338
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.770
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;

339
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.770
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--

340
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.700
Nay, I do bear a brain:-- but, as I said,

341
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.330
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple

342
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.600
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty retch,

343
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.170
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!

344
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.630
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,

345
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.830
To bid me trudge:

346
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.270
And since that time it is eleven years;

347
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.000
And then she could stand high alone; nay, by the rood,

348
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.970
She then could run and waddle all about;

349
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.030
For e'en the day before, she broke her brow:

350
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:27.470
And then my husband-- O, God rest his soul!

351
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.500
He was a merry man-- took up the child:

352
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.930
"Yea," quoth he, "fallst thou upon thy face?

353
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.830
"Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;

354
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.470
Wilt thou not, Jule?"

355
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.200
And, by my holidame,

356
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.830
The pretty wretch left crying and said "Ay."

357
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.470
To see, now, how a jest might come about!

358
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.430
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,

359
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.700
I never should forget it: "Wilt thou not, Jule?"

360
00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:00.300
Quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted and said "Ay."

361
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.530
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

362
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.670
Yes, madam.

363
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.770
Juliet--

364
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.000
I cannot choose but laugh,

365
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.270
To think it should leave crying and say "Ay."

366
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.230
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow

367
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.800
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;

368
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.570
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:

369
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.000
"Yea," quoth my husband, "fall'st upon thy face?

370
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
"Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;

371
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.370
Wilt thou not, Jule?"

372
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:31.400
Pretty fool, it stinted and said "Ay."

373
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.200
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

374
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.730
Peace, I have done.

375
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.930
God mark thee to his grace!

376
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.930
Thou wast the prettiest babe as e'er I nursed:

377
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.970
An I might live to see thee married once,

378
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.070
I'd have my wish.

379
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.430
Marry, that 'marry'

380
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.830
is the very theme I came to talk of.

381
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.930
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

382
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.100
How stands your disposition to be married?

383
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.770
It is an honour that I dream not of.

384
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.870
An honour!

385
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.770
Were not I thine only nurse,

386
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.130
I'd say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

387
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.430
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,

388
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.270
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,

389
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.030
Are made already mothers: by my count,

390
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.870
I was your mother much upon these years

391
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.130
That you are now a maid.

392
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Thus then in brief:

393
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.800
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

394
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.030
A man, young lady!

395
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.200
Lady, such a man

396
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.170
As all the world-- oh, he's a man of wax.

397
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.730
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

398
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.070
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

399
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.600
What say you?

400
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.200
Can you love the gentleman?

401
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.970
This night you shall behold him at our feast;

402
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.400
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,

403
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.670
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;

404
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.400
Examine every married lineament,

405
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.430
And see how one another lends content

406
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.500
And what obscured in that fair volume lies

407
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.800
Find written in the margent of his eyes.

408
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.470
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,

409
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.930
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:

410
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.470
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride

411
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.300
For fair without the fair within to hide:

412
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:16.900
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,

413
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.870
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;

414
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.100
So shall you share all that he doth possess,

415
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.900
By having him, making yourself no less.

416
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.070
No less!

417
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.830
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.

418
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.430
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

419
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.470
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:

420
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.830
But no more deep will I endart mine eye

421
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.330
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

422
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.900
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called,

423
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.330
my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry,

424
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.370
and every thing in extremity.

425
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.570
I must hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

426
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.700
We follow thee.

427
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.130
Juliet, the county stays.

428
00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:03.230
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

429
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.530
Shall we on without a apology?

430
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.400
The date is out of such prolixity.

431
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.400
But let them measure us by what they will;

432
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.100
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

433
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.330
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;

434
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.030
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

435
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.930
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

436
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.930
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes

437
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.970
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead

438
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.900
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

439
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.500
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,

440
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.970
And soar with them above the common bound.

441
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.830
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft

442
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.870
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,

443
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.530
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:

444
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.030
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

445
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.700
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;

446
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.870
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

447
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.070
Is love a tender thing?

448
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.430
It is too rough,

449
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.030
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

450
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.930
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;

451
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.430
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.

452
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.630
Give me a case to put my visage in:

453
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.030
A visor for a visor!

454
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.170
What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities?

455
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.030
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

456
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.800
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,

457
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.500
But every man betake him to his legs.

458
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.330
And we mean well in going to this mask;

459
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.900
But 'tis no wit to go.

460
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.270
Why, may one ask?

461
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.870
I dreamt a dream to-night.

462
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.630
And so did I.

463
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.730
Well, what was yours?

464
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.230
That dreamers often lie.

465
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.370
Ay, in bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

466
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.100
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

467
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.770
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes

468
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.300
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone

469
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.730
On the fore-finger of an alderman,

470
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.200
Drawn with a team of little atomies

471
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.770
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;

472
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.630
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,

473
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.370
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,

474
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.100
The traces of the smallest spider's web,

475
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.230
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,

476
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:08.270
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,

477
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.270
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,

478
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.800
Not half so big as a round little worm

479
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.670
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;

480
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.530
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut

481
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.570
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,

482
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.170
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.

483
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.400
And in this state she gallops night by night

484
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.900
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;

485
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.670
O'er courtiers' knees, who dream on court'sies straight,

486
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.130
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,

487
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.570
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,

488
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.730
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,

489
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:54.900
Because their breath with sweetmeats tainted are;

490
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.730
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,

491
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.000
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;

492
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.900
Sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail

493
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.770
Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep,

494
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.800
Then dreams, he of another benefice:

495
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.170
Sometime she gallops o'er a soldier's neck.

496
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.930
Then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,

497
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.700
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,

498
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.030
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon

499
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:26.430
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,

500
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.570
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two

501
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.770
And sleeps again.

502
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.430
This is that very Mab

503
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.100
That plats the manes of horses in the night,

504
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.170
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,

505
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.270
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:

506
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:47.930
This is the hag that, when maids lie on their backs,

507
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.000
Presses them and learns them first to bear,

508
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Making them women of good carriage:

509
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.130
This is she--

510
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.400
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!

511
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.600
Thou talk'st of nothing.

512
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.670
True, I talk of dreams,

513
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.270
Which are the children of an idle brain,

514
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.500
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,

515
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.530
Which is as thin of substance as the air

516
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.900
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes

517
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.070
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,

518
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.430
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,

519
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.500
Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.

520
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.230
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;

521
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.130
Supper is done, and we will come too late.

522
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:32.100
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives

523
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.500
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars

524
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.970
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date

525
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.630
With this night's revels and expire the term

526
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.900
Of a despised life closed in my breast

527
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.270
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

528
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.430
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,

529
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.170
Direct my sail!

530
00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.730
On, lusty gentlemen!

531
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.530
Strike, drum!

532
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.000
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?

533
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.630
Antony, and Potpan!

534
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.730
Ay, boy, ready.

535
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.030
You are looked for and called for,

536
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.830
asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.

537
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.900
We cannot be here and there too.

538
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.670
Cheerly, boys; be brisk awhile; the longer liver takes all.

539
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.330
Look to the plate; look to the plate.

540
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.130
Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes

541
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.430
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.

542
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.770
Ah ha, my mistresses!

543
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.770
Which of you all will now deny to dance?

544
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.300
She that makes dainty,

545
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:14.170
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?

546
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.370
Welcome, gentlemen!

547
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.430
I have seen the day

548
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.270
That I have worn a visor and could tell

549
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.430
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,

550
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:29.270
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:

551
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.830
You are welcome, gentlemen!

552
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.730
Come, musicians, play.

553
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.300
A hall, a hall!

554
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.530
Give room!

555
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.800
And foot it, girls.

556
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.270
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,

557
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.270
And quench the fire, the room's grown too hot.

558
00:29:55.270 --> 00:30:01.000
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.

559
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.800
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;

560
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.770
For you and I are past our dancing days:

561
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.530
How long is't now since last yourself and I

562
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.900
Were in a mask?

563
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.230
Oh, by'r lady, thirty years.

564
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.330
'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much:

565
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.030
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,

566
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.930
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,

567
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:35.300
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

568
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.870
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;

569
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.330
His son is thirty.

570
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.730
Will you tell me that?

571
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.070
His son was but a ward two years ago.

572
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.670
Thirty.

573
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.730
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand

574
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.830
Of yonder knight?

575
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.270
I know not, sir.

576
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:48.030
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

577
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.470
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

578
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.970
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

579
00:32:53.970 --> 00:33:00.730
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!

580
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.800
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,

581
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.570
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.

582
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.230
Did my heart love till now?

583
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.970
Forswear it, sight!

584
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.370
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

585
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:28.130
Fetch me my rapier, boy.

586
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.530
What dares the slave

587
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.370
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,

588
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.700
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

589
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.730
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,

590
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.630
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

591
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.230
Why, how now, kinsman!

592
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.330
Wherefore storm you so?

593
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.970
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,

594
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.670
A villain that is hither come in spite,

595
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.400
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

596
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.630
Young Romeo is it?

597
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:54.900
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

598
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.370
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;

599
00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:57.970
He bears him like a portly gentleman;

600
00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.670
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him

601
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.330
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:

602
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.830
I would not for the wealth of all this town

603
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.500
Here in my house do him disparagement:

604
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.700
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:

605
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.870
It is my will, the which if you respect,

606
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.900
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,

607
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.730
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

608
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.030
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:

609
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.130
I'll not endure him.

610
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.500
He shall be endured: What, goodman boy!

611
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.570
I say, he shall: go to;

612
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.770
Am I the master here, or you?

613
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.230
Go to.

614
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.630
You'll not endure him!

615
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.870
God shall mend my soul!

616
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.330
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!

617
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.430
You will set cock-a-hoop!

618
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:33.530
You'll be the man!

619
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.630
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

620
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.730
Go to, go to;

621
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.170
You are a saucy boy:

622
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.470
is't so, indeed?

623
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.800
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:

624
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.600
You must contrary me!

625
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.700
Marry, 'tis time.

626
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.200
Well said, my hearts!

627
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.800
You are a princox; go: Be quiet, or--

628
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.400
More light, more light!

629
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.670
For shame!

630
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.900
I'll make you quiet.

631
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.930
What--cheerly, my hearts!

632
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.330
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting

633
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.900
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.

634
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.530
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall

635
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.970
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

636
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.830
If I profane with my unworthiest hand

637
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.970
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:

638
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:14.500
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

639
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.170
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

640
00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.630
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,

641
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:33.100
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

642
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.230
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,

643
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.830
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

644
00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.870
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

645
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:05.100
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

646
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.370
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;

647
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.030
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

648
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.600
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

649
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.530
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.

650
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.970
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.

651
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.970
Then have my lips the sin that they have took?

652
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.770
Sin from my lips?

653
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.330
O trespass sweetly urged!

654
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.170
Give me my sin again.

655
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.700
You kiss by the book.

656
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.000
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

657
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.070
What is her mother?

658
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.800
Marry, bachelor, her mother is the lady of the house,

659
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.000
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.

660
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.030
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;

661
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.600
I tell you, he that can lay hold on her

662
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.800
Shall have the chinks.

663
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.570
Is she a Capulet?

664
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.900
O dear account!

665
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.070
My life is my foe's debt.

666
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.630
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

667
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.600
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

668
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:39.430
Oh, nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;

669
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.630
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.

670
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.530
Is it e'en so?

671
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.030
Well, I thank you all.

672
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.100
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.

673
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.170
More torches here!

674
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.100
Come hither, nurse.

675
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.930
What is yond gentleman?

676
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.630
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

677
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.570
Whee!

678
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.070
What's he that now is going out of door?

679
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.670
That, I think, be young Petrucio.

680
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.270
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

681
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:35.570
I know not.

682
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.870
Go ask his name:

683
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.500
if he be married,

684
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.130
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

685
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:03.400
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;

686
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.330
The only son of your great enemy.

687
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.230
My only love sprung from my only hate!

688
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.170
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

689
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.570
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,

690
00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.470
That I must love a loathed enemy.

691
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.000
What's this? What's this?

692
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.930
A rhyme I learn'd even now Of one I danced withal.

693
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:26.570
Come, let's away.

694
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:57.230
Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,

695
00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.630
And young affection gapes to be his heir;

696
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.930
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,

697
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:08.300
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.

698
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.200
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,

699
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.200
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,

700
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.870
But to his foe supposed he must complain,

701
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:21.670
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:

702
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:25.070
Being held a foe, he may not have access

703
00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:29.000
To use those vows as lovers use to swear;

704
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.330
And she as much in love, her means much less

705
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:35.100
To meet her new-beloved any where:

706
00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:39.930
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet

707
00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:45.200
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

708
00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.800
Can I go forward when my heart is here?

709
00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:10.130
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

710
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.370
My cousin Romeo!

711
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:23.130
Romeo!

712
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.300
He is wise;

713
00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.670
And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.

714
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.830
He ran this way, and leap'd that orchard wall:

715
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:32.300
Call, good Mercutio.

716
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.770
Nay, I'll conjure too.

717
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.700
Romeo!

718
00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.630
Humours!

719
00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.430
Madman!

720
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:48.030
Passion!

721
00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.630
Lover!

722
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:53.930
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:

723
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.500
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;

724
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.470
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'

725
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.470
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,

726
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:12.030
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir.

727
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:20.700
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;

728
00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.470
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.

729
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:31.270
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,

730
00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:33.900
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,

731
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:39.370
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh

732
00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:42.030
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,

733
00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:46.170
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

734
00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:48.700
And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

735
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.900
This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him

736
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.800
To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle

737
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.830
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand

738
00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:02.470
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;

739
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.130
That were some spite: my invocation

740
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:07.630
Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name

741
00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:13.300
I conjure only but to raise up him.

742
00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.130
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,

743
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:21.730
To be consorted with the humorous night:

744
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.570
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

745
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:27.800
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.

746
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.600
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,

747
00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.830
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit

748
00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:42.000
That maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.

749
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:51.000
O, Romeo, that she were, O, that she were

750
00:44:51.000 --> 00:45:00.530
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!

751
00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:06.900
Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;

752
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.730
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:

753
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.400
Come, shall we go?

754
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.370
Go, then; for 'tis in vain

755
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:24.270
To seek him here that means not to be found.

756
00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.400
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

757
00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:39.800
But, soft!

758
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:47.870
What light through yonder window breaks?

759
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:56.130
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

760
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.930
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

761
00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.230
Who is already sick and pale with grief,

762
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:06.070
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:

763
00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:10.330
Be not her maid, since she is envious;

764
00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.770
Her vestal livery is but sick and green

765
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:17.800
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.

766
00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.900
It is my lady,

767
00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.470
O, it is my love!

768
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:29.130
O, that she knew she were!

769
00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:34.630
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?

770
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:38.870
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.

771
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:42.630
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:

772
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:46.570
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,

773
00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:48.770
Having some business, do entreat her eyes

774
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:52.470
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.

775
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:56.500
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?

776
00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:00.270
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,

777
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:03.770
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven

778
00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.200
Would through the airy region stream so bright

779
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:11.030
That birds would sing and think it were not night.

780
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:16.130
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!

781
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:19.000
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,

782
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.200
That I might touch that cheek!

783
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:22.830
Ay me!

784
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:28.070
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!

785
00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:30.270
For thou art

786
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:33.000
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head

787
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.870
As is a winged messenger of heaven

788
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.630
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes

789
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.630
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him

790
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:45.570
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds

791
00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:49.270
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

792
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:53.130
O Romeo, Romeo!

793
00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:55.800
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

794
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.170
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;

795
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.170
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,

796
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:04.570
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

797
00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:06.900
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

798
00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.130
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;

799
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.670
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

800
00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.230
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,

801
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.930
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part

802
00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:20.870
Belonging to a man.

803
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.430
O, be some other name!

804
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:26.330
What's in a name? that which we call a rose

805
00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:29.330
By any other name would smell as sweet;

806
00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:33.100
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,

807
00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.070
Retain that dear perfection which he owes

808
00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:36.400
Without that title.

809
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.500
Romeo, doff thy name,

810
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.430
And for that name which is no part of thee

811
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.170
Take all myself.

812
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:44.970
I take thee at thy word:

813
00:48:44.970 --> 00:48:46.900
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;

814
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.100
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

815
00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.070
What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night

816
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.670
So stumblest on my counsel?

817
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.670
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am:

818
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.530
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,

819
00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:58.570
Because it is an enemy to thee;

820
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:01.100
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

821
00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.670
My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words

822
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:08.170
Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound:

823
00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:11.630
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

824
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:13.700
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.

825
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.830
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?

826
00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.800
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,

827
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.800
And the place death, considering who thou art,

828
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.470
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

829
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:26.700
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;

830
00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.530
For stony limits cannot hold love out,

831
00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.500
And what love can do that dares love attempt;

832
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.370
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

833
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:34.970
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

834
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:36.830
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye

835
00:49:36.830 --> 00:49:39.400
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,

836
00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.030
And I am proof against their enmity.

837
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:43.100
I would not for the world they saw thee here.

838
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.570
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes;

839
00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.500
And but thou love me, let them find me here:

840
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.370
My life were better ended by their hate,

841
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.630
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

842
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.970
By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

843
00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.600
By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;

844
00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.270
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.

845
00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:01.730
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far

846
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.830
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,

847
00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:06.630
I should adventure for such merchandise.

848
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.830
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,

849
00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.270
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek

850
00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:14.470
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.

851
00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:18.030
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny

852
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:21.400
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!

853
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.600
Dost thou love me?

854
00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:25.730
I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'

855
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:28.430
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,

856
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.370
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries

857
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.270
They say, Jove laughs.

858
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:36.000
O gentle Romeo,

859
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.070
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:

860
00:50:39.070 --> 00:50:42.000
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,

861
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.670
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,

862
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:50.200
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.

863
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.430
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,

864
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:55.770
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:

865
00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.670
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true

866
00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.970
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.

867
00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:04.830
I should have been more strange, I must confess,

868
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:07.100
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,

869
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.330
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,

870
00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.470
And not impute this yielding to light love,

871
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.270
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

872
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:17.670
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow

873
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:19.770
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

874
00:51:19.770 --> 00:51:22.100
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,

875
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.070
That monthly changes in her circled orb,

876
00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:26.470
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

877
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:27.930
What shall I swear by?

878
00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:29.500
Do not swear at all;

879
00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.270
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,

880
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.870
Which is the god of my idolatry.

881
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.630
If my heart's dear love--

882
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.570
Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,

883
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:40.400
I have no joy of this contract to-night:

884
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.000
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;

885
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.170
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be

886
00:51:46.170 --> 00:51:48.730
Ere one can say 'It lightens.'

887
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:51.100
Sweet, good night!

888
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.170
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,

889
00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:57.570
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.

890
00:51:57.570 --> 00:52:02.430
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest

891
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:05.630
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

892
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:08.230
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

893
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.600
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

894
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.600
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

895
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.400
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:

896
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.500
And yet I would it were to give again.

897
00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.630
Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?

898
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.530
But to be frank, and give it thee again.

899
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:25.030
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:

900
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:27.800
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,

901
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.470
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,

902
00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:34.100
The more I have, for both are infinite.

903
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:38.300
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!

904
00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.830
Anon, good nurse!

905
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:41.270
Sweet Montague, be true.

906
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:42.930
Stay but a little, I will come again.

907
00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:50.470
O blessed, blessed night!

908
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:51.630
I am afeard,

909
00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.000
Being in night, all this is but a dream,

910
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.930
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

911
00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.930
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.

912
00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.670
If that thy bent of love be honourable,

913
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:02.870
Thy purpose marriage--

914
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:03.970
Yes.

915
00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:05.270
send me word to-morrow,

916
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.200
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,

917
00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.470
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;

918
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:12.300
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay

919
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.500
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

920
00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:15.770
Madam!

921
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:17.170
I come, anon.

922
00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.570
But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--

923
00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:21.030
Madam!

924
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.730
By and by, I come:--

925
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.400
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:

926
00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.770
To-morrow will I send.

927
00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:27.930
So thrive my soul.

928
00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:29.230
A thousand times good night!

929
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.700
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.

930
00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:43.730
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books,

931
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:48.870
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

932
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.530
Hist! Romeo, hist!

933
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:53.400
O, for a falconer's voice,

934
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.100
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!

935
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:59.170
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;

936
00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:01.830
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,

937
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.200
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,

938
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.670
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

939
00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:07.830
Romeo!

940
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:13.330
It is my soul that calls upon my name:

941
00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:16.170
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,

942
00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:18.470
Like softest music to attending ears!

943
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:19.630
Romeo!

944
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:24.230
My sweet.

945
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:25.770
At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?

946
00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:27.000
By the hour of nine.

947
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I shall not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.

948
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.130
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

949
00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:36.630
Let me stand here till thou remember it.

950
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:38.900
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,

951
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:40.300
Remembering how I love thy company.

952
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.870
And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,

953
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.400
Forgetting any other home but this.

954
00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:47.900
'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:

955
00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:50.900
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;

956
00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:52.570
That lets it hop a little from her hand,

957
00:54:52.570 --> 00:54:54.970
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,

958
00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:57.500
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,

959
00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.230
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

960
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:02.170
I would I were thy bird.

961
00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:04.270
Sweet, so would I:

962
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.970
But I should kill thee with much cherishing.

963
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:13.500
Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow,

964
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.500
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

965
00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:28.470
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!

966
00:55:28.470 --> 00:55:35.100
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!

967
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:08.500
The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,

968
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:11.400
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,

969
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.330
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels

970
00:56:14.330 --> 00:56:19.530
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:

971
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.130
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,

972
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.100
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,

973
00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:28.600
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours

974
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:34.670
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.

975
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:40.400
The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;

976
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.630
What is her burying grave that is her womb,

977
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:47.370
And from her womb children of divers kind

978
00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:51.430
We sucking on her natural bosom find.

979
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:54.870
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies

980
00:56:54.870 --> 00:57:00.330
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities:

981
00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:03.900
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live

982
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:07.500
But to the earth some special good doth give,

983
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:11.400
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use

984
00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:16.330
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.

985
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:24.100
Within the infant rind of this weak flower

986
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.100
Poison hath residence and medicine power:

987
00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:33.370
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;

988
00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:39.800
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.

989
00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.700
Two such opposed kings encamp them still

990
00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:50.270
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;

991
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:52.930
And where the worser is predominant,

992
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:57.170
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

993
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:59.270
Good morrow, father.

994
00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:01.870
Benedicite!

995
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:05.800
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?

996
00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.130
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head

997
00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:11.830
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.

998
00:58:11.830 --> 00:58:13.930
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,

999
00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:16.370
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

1000
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:18.430
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

1001
00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:21.170
God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

1002
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:24.930
With Rosaline, my ghostly father?

1003
00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:28.500
No; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

1004
00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:31.170
That's my good son: where hast thou been, then?

1005
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:35.670
I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.

1006
00:58:35.670 --> 00:58:39.130
I have been feasting with mine enemy,

1007
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.270
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,

1008
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.870
That's by me wounded: both our remedies

1009
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:46.730
Within thy help and holy physic lies:

1010
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:49.070
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,

1011
00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:51.370
My intercession likewise steads my foe.

1012
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:53.330
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;

1013
00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:56.030
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

1014
00:58:56.030 --> 00:59:00.430
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set

1015
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:03.500
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:

1016
00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:06.200
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;

1017
00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.230
And all combined, save what thou must combine

1018
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:11.130
By holy marriage: when and where and how

1019
00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:12.930
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,

1020
00:59:12.930 --> 00:59:15.200
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,

1021
00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.270
That thou consent to marry us to-day.

1022
00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:21.730
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!

1023
00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:25.330
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,

1024
00:59:25.330 --> 00:59:27.030
So soon forsaken?

1025
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.330
Young men's love then lies

1026
00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:30.800
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.

1027
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.230
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine

1028
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:36.070
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!

1029
00:59:36.070 --> 00:59:38.170
How much salt water thrown away in waste,

1030
00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:40.970
To season love, that of it doth not taste!

1031
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:43.730
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit

1032
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:46.130
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:

1033
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:49.870
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,

1034
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:52.970
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:

1035
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:54.130
And art thou changed?

1036
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:55.700
Pronounce this sentence then,

1037
00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.000
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

1038
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.270
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

1039
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:03.170
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

1040
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:04.530
And bad'st me bury love.

1041
01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:05.770
Not in a grave,

1042
01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:07.630
To lay one in, another out to have.

1043
01:00:07.630 --> 01:00:09.870
I pray thee, chide me not; her I love now

1044
01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.830
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;

1045
01:00:11.830 --> 01:00:12.930
The other did not so.

1046
01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:14.230
O, she knew well

1047
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:16.270
Thy love did read by rote that could not spell.

1048
01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:23.230
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,

1049
01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:25.730
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;

1050
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.570
For this alliance may so happy prove,

1051
01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:31.400
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

1052
01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:36.870
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

1053
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:41.500
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

1054
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:45.730
Where the devil should this Romeo be?

1055
01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:48.130
Came he not home to-night?

1056
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:51.130
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

1057
01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:57.170
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,

1058
01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:01.100
Torments him so, he will sure run mad.

1059
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:06.430
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,

1060
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:08.270
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

1061
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:10.000
A challenge, on my life.

1062
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.530
Romeo will answer it.

1063
01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:15.500
Any man that can write may answer a letter.

1064
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.370
Nay, he will answer the letter's master,

1065
01:01:17.370 --> 01:01:19.100
how he dares, being dared.

1066
01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.830
Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead;

1067
01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:25.830
stabbed with a white wench's black eye;

1068
01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:28.970
run through the ear with a love-song;

1069
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:30.770
the very pin of his heart cleft

1070
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.530
with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft:

1071
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.470
and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

1072
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.430
Why, what is Tybalt?

1073
01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:41.730
More than prince of cats.

1074
01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:44.530
O, he's the courageous captain of compliments.

1075
01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:46.730
He fights as you sing prick-song,

1076
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:49.170
keeps time, distance, and proportion;

1077
01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.170
rests me his minim rests, one, two,

1078
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:54.270
and the third in your bosom:

1079
01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:58.970
the very butcher of a silk button,

1080
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:04.000
a duellist, a duellist;

1081
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.700
a gentleman of the very first house,

1082
01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:11.200
of the first and second cause: ah, the immortal passado!

1083
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:12.430
The punto reverso!

1084
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:13.530
The hay!

1085
01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:14.770
The what?

1086
01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:18.430
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes.

1087
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:21.070
Water! Fresh well water!

1088
01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:24.900
These new tuners of accents!

1089
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:29.030
By Jesu, a very good blade!

1090
01:02:29.030 --> 01:02:30.930
A very tall man!

1091
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:32.670
A very good whore!

1092
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:36.070
Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire,

1093
01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:37.630
that we should be thus afflicted

1094
01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:41.800
with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,

1095
01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.730
these pardone-moi's,

1096
01:02:43.730 --> 01:02:45.770
that stand so much on the new form,

1097
01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:48.870
that they cannot sit at ease on an old bench?

1098
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:51.470
O, their bones, their bones!

1099
01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.170
Here comes Romeo.

1100
01:02:56.570 --> 01:02:58.030
Here comes Romeo.

1101
01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.770
Without his roe, like a dried herring:

1102
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.700
flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified!

1103
01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.570
Signor Romeo, bon jour!

1104
01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:13.700
There's a French salutation to your French slop.

1105
01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:14.970
Good morrow to you both.

1106
01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:17.400
You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.

1107
01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.600
What counterfeit did I give you?

1108
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.870
The slip, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

1109
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:23.930
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great;

1110
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:26.000
and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

1111
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.200
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours

1112
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.800
constrains a man to bow in the hams.

1113
01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.900
Meaning, to court'sy.

1114
01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:33.600
Thou hast most kindly hit it.

1115
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.830
A most courteous exposition.

1116
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:35.930
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

1117
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:37.030
Pink for flower.

1118
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.370
Right.

1119
01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:40.370
Why, then is my pump well flowered.

1120
01:03:40.370 --> 01:03:44.230
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wit faints.

1121
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:49.070
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?

1122
01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:53.000
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo;

1123
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.070
now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:

1124
01:03:57.070 --> 01:04:00.130
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,

1125
01:04:00.130 --> 01:04:03.800
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

1126
01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.500
Stop there, stop there.

1127
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.530
Oh, clumsy--

1128
01:04:07.530 --> 01:04:09.500
Here's goodly gear!

1129
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.070
A sail, a sail!

1130
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:12.430
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

1131
01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:13.570
Peter!

1132
01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:14.670
Anon!

1133
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:16.270
My fan, Peter.

1134
01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:19.700
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer .

1135
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:22.600
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

1136
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.330
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

1137
01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:26.700
Is it good den?

1138
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:28.400
It is no less, I tell you,

1139
01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.630
for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of .

1140
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:36.170
Out upon you! what a man are you!

1141
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:37.270
One, gentlewoman,

1142
01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:38.700
that God hath made for himself to mar.

1143
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.630
By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,' quoth a?

1144
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.800
Gentlemen, can any of you tell me

1145
01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.130
where I may find the young Romeo?

1146
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:52.470
I can tell you;

1147
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:53.930
but young Romeo will be older when you have found him

1148
01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:55.230
than he was when you sought him:

1149
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:57.030
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

1150
01:04:57.030 --> 01:04:58.870
You say well.

1151
01:04:58.870 --> 01:05:00.430
Yea, is the worst well?

1152
01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:02.930
very well took, i' faith; wisely, wisely.

1153
01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:08.730
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.

1154
01:05:08.730 --> 01:05:11.030
She will indite him to some supper.

1155
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:14.070
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!

1156
01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:15.430
So ho!

1157
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:16.530
What hast thou found?

1158
01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:17.630
No hare, sir;

1159
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:18.770
unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,

1160
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:20.730
which is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.

1161
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.570
An old hare hoar, And an old hare hoar,

1162
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:24.770
Is very good meat in lent But a hare that is hoar

1163
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:29.130
Is too much for a score, When it hoars ere it be spent.

1164
01:05:29.130 --> 01:05:32.430
Romeo, will you come to your father's?

1165
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:33.530
We'll to dinner, thither.

1166
01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:34.530
I will follow you.

1167
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:40.900
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell.

1168
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:46.070
'Lady, lady.'

1169
01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.370
I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this,

1170
01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:50.030
that was so full of his ropery?

1171
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:52.000
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,

1172
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.800
and will speak more in a minute

1173
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.470
than he will stand to in a month.

1174
01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:57.900
An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him down,

1175
01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.430
an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such Jacks;

1176
01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.870
and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.

1177
01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:08.230
Scurvy knave!

1178
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:14.930
I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates.

1179
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:16.230
And thou must stand by too,

1180
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:18.470
and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

1181
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:20.730
I saw no man use you at his pleasure;

1182
01:06:20.730 --> 01:06:22.730
if I had, my weapon should quickly have been out,

1183
01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:23.830
I warrant you:

1184
01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:25.630
I dare draw as soon as another man,

1185
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.370
if I see occasion in a good quarrel,

1186
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:29.270
and the law on my side.

1187
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:36.270
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, every part about me quivers.

1188
01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:39.430
Scurvy knave!

1189
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:44.300
Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you,

1190
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.230
my young lady bid me inquire you out;

1191
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:50.700
what she bid me tell you, I'll keep to myself:

1192
01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.330
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her

1193
01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:56.800
into a fool's paradise, as they say,

1194
01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:01.400
that were a very gross sort of behavior, as they say.

1195
01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.630
Bid her devise

1196
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:04.200
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;

1197
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:06.570
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell

1198
01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.170
Be shrived and married.

1199
01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.530
Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:

1200
01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:17.470
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

1201
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:21.030
Now God in heaven bless you, sir.

1202
01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:23.230
Hark you, sir;

1203
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:25.900
my mistress is the sweetest lady.

1204
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.870
O Lord, Lord!

1205
01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:30.000
when 'twas a little prating thing:--

1206
01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.300
There is a nobleman in town, one Paris,

1207
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.900
that would fain lay knife aboard;

1208
01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.070
but she, good soul,

1209
01:07:37.070 --> 01:07:41.030
had as lief see a toad, a very toad, as see him.

1210
01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:42.970
I anger her sometimes and tell her

1211
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:46.070
that Paris is the properer man; but, Lord, when I say so,

1212
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.100
I'll warrant you, she looks as pale

1213
01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.170
as any clout in the versal world.

1214
01:07:50.170 --> 01:07:51.400
Commend me to thy lady.

1215
01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:57.330
Ay, ay, a thousand times.

1216
01:07:57.330 --> 01:07:59.130
Peter!

1217
01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:00.470
Anon!

1218
01:08:12.530 --> 01:08:16.370
The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;

1219
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.670
In half an hour she promised to return.

1220
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:26.900
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.

1221
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.030
O, she is lame!

1222
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:30.930
Love's heralds should be thoughts,

1223
01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:33.830
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,

1224
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:36.770
Driving back shadows over louring hills.

1225
01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:39.200
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill

1226
01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.100
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve

1227
01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.870
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.

1228
01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:49.400
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,

1229
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.370
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;

1230
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:55.530
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,

1231
01:08:55.530 --> 01:08:57.470
And his to me:

1232
01:08:57.470 --> 01:09:01.570
But old folk, many feign as they were dead;

1233
01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:05.130
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

1234
01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:07.800
O God, she comes!

1235
01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.430
O honey nurse, what news?

1236
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.630
Hast thou met with him?

1237
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:12.270
Send thy man away.

1238
01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:15.270
Peter, stay at the gate.

1239
01:09:15.270 --> 01:09:21.600
Now, good sweet nurse,-- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?

1240
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.730
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;

1241
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:27.670
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news

1242
01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:30.230
By playing it to me with so sour a face.

1243
01:09:30.230 --> 01:09:33.930
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:

1244
01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:38.630
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

1245
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:41.870
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:

1246
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:45.730
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

1247
01:09:45.730 --> 01:09:49.830
Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?

1248
01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:52.770
Do you not see I am out of breath?

1249
01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.400
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath

1250
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.600
To say to me that thou art out of breath?

1251
01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.300
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay

1252
01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:02.400
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.

1253
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.330
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;

1254
01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:10.400
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:

1255
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.700
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

1256
01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:17.630
Well, you have made a simple choice;

1257
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:20.430
you know not how to choose a man: Romeo!

1258
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:25.630
no, not he; though his face be better than any man's,

1259
01:10:25.630 --> 01:10:29.130
yet his leg excels all men's;

1260
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:31.170
and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,

1261
01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:34.000
though they be not to be talked on,

1262
01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.400
yet are they past compare:

1263
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.230
o, he's not the flower of courtesy,

1264
01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:41.400
yet I'll warrant as gentle as a lamb.

1265
01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:45.100
Go thy ways, wench; serve God.

1266
01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.430
What, have you dined at home?

1267
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:49.630
No, no: but all this did I know before.

1268
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:52.100
What says he of our marriage? what of that?

1269
01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:58.170
O Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!

1270
01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:00.570
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.

1271
01:11:00.570 --> 01:11:04.930
My back o' t' other side,-- O, my back, my back!

1272
01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:07.030
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,

1273
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:10.030
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

1274
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:12.130
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.

1275
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:17.930
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

1276
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:22.570
Your love says, like an honest gentleman,

1277
01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:28.800
and a kind, and a courteous, and a handsome,

1278
01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.370
and, I warrant, a virtuous,-- Where is your mother?

1279
01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:36.430
Where is my mother! why, she is within;

1280
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:37.830
Where should she be?

1281
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:39.730
How oddly thou repliest!

1282
01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:41.230
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,

1283
01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.370
Where is your mother?'

1284
01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:44.370
O God's lady dear!

1285
01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:47.170
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;

1286
01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:50.200
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?

1287
01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.470
Henceforward do your messages yourself.

1288
01:11:53.470 --> 01:12:00.200
Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

1289
01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:05.800
Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

1290
01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.230
I have.

1291
01:12:07.230 --> 01:12:09.930
Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;

1292
01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:14.900
There stays a husband to make you a wife:

1293
01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:18.130
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,

1294
01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:20.670
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.

1295
01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.870
Hie you to church; I must another way,

1296
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:26.100
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love

1297
01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.300
Shall climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:

1298
01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.270
I'm the drudge and toil in your delight,

1299
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:35.470
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.

1300
01:12:35.470 --> 01:12:39.130
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

1301
01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:42.330
Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

1302
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:46.700
So smile the heavens upon this holy act,

1303
01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.900
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

1304
01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.970
Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,

1305
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:54.700
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy

1306
01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.100
That one short minute gives me in her sight:

1307
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.970
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,

1308
01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:01.370
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;

1309
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:03.470
It is enough I may but call her mine.

1310
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:05.870
These violent delights have violent ends.

1311
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:09.870
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so.

1312
01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:13.800
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot

1313
01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.930
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:

1314
01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.630
A lover may bestride the gossamer

1315
01:13:19.630 --> 01:13:22.200
That idles in the wanton summer air,

1316
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:25.670
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

1317
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:28.130
Good even to my ghostly confessor.

1318
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:30.570
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

1319
01:13:39.970 --> 01:13:43.730
Come, come here to me, and we will make short work;

1320
01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:47.670
For, by your leave, you shall not stay alone

1321
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:51.330
Till holy church incorporate two in one.

1322
01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:56.600
Deus Israel...

1323
01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:14.630
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:

1324
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:17.530
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,

1325
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:20.070
And, if we meet, we shall not 'scape a brawl;

1326
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:22.700
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

1327
01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:25.430
Thou art like one of these fellows

1328
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:28.130
that when he enters the confines of a tavern

1329
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.000
claps me his sword on the table

1330
01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.800
and says 'God send me no need of thee!'

1331
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:35.000
and by the operation of the second cup

1332
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.670
draws it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

1333
01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:39.900
Am I like such a fellow?

1334
01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.200
Come, come,

1335
01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.370
thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy,

1336
01:14:45.370 --> 01:14:46.670
and as soon moved to be moody,

1337
01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:48.070
and as soon moody to be moved.

1338
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:49.770
And what to?

1339
01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:53.830
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,

1340
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:56.030
for one would kill the other.

1341
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:59.300
Thou! why, thou wouldst quarrel

1342
01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.730
with a man that hath a hair more, or a hair less,

1343
01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.700
in his beard, than thou hast:

1344
01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.030
thou would quarrel with a man for cracking nuts,

1345
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:09.130
having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes:

1346
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:14.630
what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?

1347
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:18.870
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat,

1348
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:20.770
and yet thy head has been beaten

1349
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:23.430
as addle as an egg for quarrelling:

1350
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:26.030
thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street,

1351
01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:27.870
because he hath wakened you dog

1352
01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:29.900
that hath lain asleep in the sun:

1353
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.370
didst thou not fall out with a tailor

1354
01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:35.130
for wearing his new doublet before Easter?

1355
01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:39.500
with another, for tying his new shoe with old riband?

1356
01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:42.900
Ah, ah, yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

1357
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:47.600
By my head, here comes the Capulet.

1358
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.500
By my heel, I care not.

1359
01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.930
Follow close, for I will speak to them.

1360
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:15.400
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

1361
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:19.630
And but one word with one of us?

1362
01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:24.670
couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

1363
01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:27.670
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir,

1364
01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:28.970
an you will give me occasion.

1365
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:31.730
Could you not take some occasion without the giving?

1366
01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:35.000
Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

1367
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.470
Consort!

1368
01:16:37.470 --> 01:16:41.100
God, dost thou make us minstrels?

1369
01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.530
An thou make minstrels of us,

1370
01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:44.470
look to hear nothing but discords:

1371
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:46.670
here's my fiddlestick;

1372
01:16:46.670 --> 01:16:49.000
here's that shall make you dance.

1373
01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.330
'Zounds, consort!

1374
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:51.930
We talk here in the public haunt of men:

1375
01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:53.630
Either withdraw unto some private place,

1376
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:55.200
And reason coldly of your grievances,

1377
01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.500
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

1378
01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:00.830
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;

1379
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:03.330
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

1380
01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:10.630
Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

1381
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:13.870
But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:

1382
01:17:13.870 --> 01:17:16.800
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;

1383
01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.900
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

1384
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.500
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford

1385
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:30.300
No better term than this,-- thou art a villain.

1386
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:38.000
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee

1387
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.730
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage

1388
01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:43.470
To such a greeting: villain am I none;

1389
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:47.230
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

1390
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:51.030
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries

1391
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:53.530
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

1392
01:17:55.870 --> 01:18:00.230
I do protest, I never injured thee,

1393
01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:03.330
But love thee better than thou canst devise,

1394
01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:05.300
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:

1395
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:09.730
And so, good Capulet,-- which name I tender

1396
01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:15.330
As dearly as mine own,-- be satisfied.

1397
01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:18.700
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!

1398
01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.970
Alla stoccata carries it away.

1399
01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:27.600
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

1400
01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.000
What wouldst thou have with me?

1401
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.830
Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine lives;

1402
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:38.170
which I mean to make bold withal,

1403
01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:41.200
and as you shall use me hereafter,

1404
01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.270
drybeat the rest of the eight.

1405
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:48.900
Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears?

1406
01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:54.670
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.

1407
01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:57.230
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up!

1408
01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:23.600
Come, sir, your passado.

1409
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:31.930
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons!

1410
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.830
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath

1411
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:44.370
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets.

1412
01:21:34.900 --> 01:21:37.500
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

1413
01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:48.430
I am hurt.

1414
01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:53.200
A plague o' both your houses!

1415
01:21:56.230 --> 01:21:58.900
I'm sped.

1416
01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.500
What, is he gone, and hath nothing?

1417
01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:02.870
What, art thou hurt?

1418
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:09.170
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.

1419
01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:12.700
Where is my page?

1420
01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:15.770
Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

1421
01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:17.100
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

1422
01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:20.630
No, 'tis not so deep as a well,

1423
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:29.670
nor so wide as a church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve:

1424
01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:32.000
ask for me to-morrow,

1425
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.430
and you shall find me a grave man.

1426
01:22:37.630 --> 01:22:43.070
I am peppered, I warrant, for this world.

1427
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:45.970
A plague o' both your houses!

1428
01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:50.500
'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat,

1429
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.730
to scratch a man to death!

1430
01:22:52.730 --> 01:22:56.430
a braggart, a rogue, a villain,

1431
01:22:56.430 --> 01:23:00.530
that fights by the book of arithmetic!

1432
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:04.570
Why the devil came you between us?

1433
01:23:04.570 --> 01:23:07.130
I was hurt under your arm.

1434
01:23:07.130 --> 01:23:08.670
I thought all for the best.

1435
01:23:14.430 --> 01:23:16.270
Help me into some house, Benvolio,

1436
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:17.670
Or I shall faint.

1437
01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:28.100
A plague o' both your houses!

1438
01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:31.670
They have made worms' meat of me:

1439
01:23:31.670 --> 01:23:36.500
I have it, And soundly too:

1440
01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.700
your houses!

1441
01:23:57.870 --> 01:23:59.630
O sweet Juliet,

1442
01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:02.770
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate

1443
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:07.570
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

1444
01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:19.000
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio is dead.

1445
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:25.270
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,

1446
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:28.030
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

1447
01:24:31.470 --> 01:24:36.330
This day's black fate on more days doth depend;

1448
01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:41.770
This but begins the woe that others must end.

1449
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:43.270
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

1450
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:46.730
Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!

1451
01:24:46.730 --> 01:24:50.270
Away to heaven, respective lenity,

1452
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:55.630
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

1453
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:23.070
Tybalt, take the villain back again,

1454
01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:25.270
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul

1455
01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:27.300
Is but a little way above our heads,

1456
01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:31.200
Staying for thine to keep him company:

1457
01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.430
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

1458
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:42.970
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,

1459
01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:45.130
Shalt with him hence.

1460
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:46.800
This shall determine that.

1461
01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.070
Romeo, away, be gone!

1462
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:38.830
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.

1463
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:41.370
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,

1464
01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:44.770
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

1465
01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:51.100
O, I am fortune's fool!

1466
01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.270
Why dost thou stay?

1467
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:56.600
Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?

1468
01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.100
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

1469
01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.500
There lies that Tybalt.

1470
01:27:06.130 --> 01:27:09.770
Up, sir, go with me;

1471
01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:13.230
I charge thee in the prince's name, obey.

1472
01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.500
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

1473
01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:18.200
O noble prince, I can discover all

1474
01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.130
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:

1475
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:25.700
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,

1476
01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:28.600
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

1477
01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:30.870
Tybalt, my cousin!

1478
01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:35.400
O, the blood is spilt o' my dear kinsman!

1479
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.330
Prince, as thou art true,

1480
01:28:38.330 --> 01:28:41.430
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.

1481
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:44.400
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

1482
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:50.670
Tybalt, now slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay.

1483
01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:53.900
He is a kinsman to the Montague;

1484
01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.470
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:

1485
01:28:58.470 --> 01:29:02.630
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,

1486
01:29:02.630 --> 01:29:06.730
And all those twenty could but kill one life.

1487
01:29:06.730 --> 01:29:12.600
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;

1488
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:18.030
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

1489
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:23.100
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;

1490
01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:27.370
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

1491
01:29:27.370 --> 01:29:29.500
Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;

1492
01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.570
His fault concludes but what the law should end,

1493
01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:32.670
The life of Tybalt.

1494
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:35.000
And for that offence

1495
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.200
Immediately we do exile him hence.

1496
01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:44.930
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,

1497
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:51.470
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;

1498
01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:56.230
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine

1499
01:29:56.230 --> 01:29:59.900
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:

1500
01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:02.670
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;

1501
01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:05.930
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:

1502
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:10.870
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,

1503
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:16.100
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.

1504
01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:18.770
Attend our will:

1505
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:25.130
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

1506
01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:32.900
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,

1507
01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.430
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner

1508
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:37.070
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,

1509
01:30:37.070 --> 01:30:39.330
And bring in cloudy night immediately.

1510
01:30:39.330 --> 01:30:43.400
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,

1511
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.730
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo

1512
01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:49.100
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.

1513
01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:52.900
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites

1514
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:56.330
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,

1515
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:58.870
It best agrees with night.

1516
01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.800
Come, civil night,

1517
01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:03.230
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,

1518
01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:05.770
And learn me how to lose a winning match,

1519
01:31:05.770 --> 01:31:08.230
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:

1520
01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:11.170
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,

1521
01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:14.730
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,

1522
01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:17.830
Think true love acted simple modesty.

1523
01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:23.470
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;

1524
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:26.400
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night

1525
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:29.770
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.

1526
01:31:29.770 --> 01:31:34.970
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,

1527
01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:40.630
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,

1528
01:31:40.630 --> 01:31:44.000
Take him and cut him out in little stars,

1529
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.370
And he shall make the face of heaven so fine

1530
01:31:47.370 --> 01:31:49.900
That all the world will be in love with night

1531
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:53.730
And pay no worship to the garish sun.

1532
01:31:53.730 --> 01:31:56.370
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,

1533
01:31:56.370 --> 01:31:58.700
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,

1534
01:31:58.700 --> 01:32:02.900
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day

1535
01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:04.430
As is the night before some festival

1536
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:06.400
To an impatient child who hath new robes

1537
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.730
And may not wear them.

1538
01:32:08.730 --> 01:32:11.230
Now, nurse, what news?

1539
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:12.630
What hast thou there? the cords

1540
01:32:12.630 --> 01:32:14.770
That Romeo bid thee fetch?

1541
01:32:14.770 --> 01:32:19.570
Ay, ay, the cords.

1542
01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:25.700
Ay me! What news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

1543
01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:33.000
We are undone, lady, we are undone!

1544
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.700
Alack the day!

1545
01:32:35.700 --> 01:32:37.930
He's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

1546
01:32:37.930 --> 01:32:41.270
Can heaven be so envious?

1547
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:43.370
Romeo can, Though heaven cannot:

1548
01:32:43.370 --> 01:32:46.170
O Romeo, Romeo!

1549
01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:47.270
Who ever would have thought it?

1550
01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.500
Romeo!

1551
01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:52.730
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?

1552
01:32:52.730 --> 01:32:56.400
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.

1553
01:32:56.400 --> 01:33:00.470
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but "I,"

1554
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:03.070
And that bare vowel "I" shall poison more

1555
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:05.400
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.

1556
01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:09.530
If he be slain, say "I"; or if not, no:

1557
01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:12.470
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

1558
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:15.900
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes--

1559
01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:18.770
God save the mark!-- here on his manly breast:

1560
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:22.930
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;

1561
01:33:22.930 --> 01:33:26.530
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,

1562
01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:30.900
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

1563
01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:40.170
O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!

1564
01:33:40.170 --> 01:33:44.400
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!

1565
01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.030
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;

1566
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:52.300
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

1567
01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:56.800
Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!

1568
01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:00.670
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!

1569
01:34:00.670 --> 01:34:03.570
That ever I should live to see thee dead!

1570
01:34:03.570 --> 01:34:07.800
What storm is this that blows so contrary?

1571
01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:11.370
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?

1572
01:34:11.370 --> 01:34:15.070
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?

1573
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:19.070
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!

1574
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:22.030
For who is living, if those two are gone?

1575
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:25.770
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;

1576
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:29.270
Romeo that slew him, he is banished.

1577
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:34.900
O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

1578
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:38.500
It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

1579
01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:43.170
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!

1580
01:34:43.170 --> 01:34:46.830
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?

1581
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:50.130
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!

1582
01:34:50.130 --> 01:34:53.470
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!

1583
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:57.530
Despised substance of divinest show!

1584
01:34:57.530 --> 01:35:01.830
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,

1585
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:06.130
A damned saint, an honourable villain!

1586
01:35:06.130 --> 01:35:09.600
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,

1587
01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.000
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend

1588
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.470
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?

1589
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:18.030
Was ever book containing such vile matter

1590
01:35:18.030 --> 01:35:20.100
So fairly bound?

1591
01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:23.770
O that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous palace!

1592
01:35:23.770 --> 01:35:25.600
There's no trust,

1593
01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:29.170
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,

1594
01:35:29.170 --> 01:35:33.930
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.

1595
01:35:33.930 --> 01:35:38.400
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:

1596
01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.500
These woes, these griefs, these sorrows make me old.

1597
01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.170
Shame come to Romeo!

1598
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:47.100
Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish!

1599
01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.900
He was not born to shame:

1600
01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:53.430
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;

1601
01:35:53.430 --> 01:35:55.770
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd

1602
01:35:55.770 --> 01:35:58.670
Sole monarch of the universal earth.

1603
01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:01.470
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

1604
01:36:01.470 --> 01:36:03.300
Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

1605
01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:06.500
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?

1606
01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:11.330
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,

1607
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:14.700
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?

1608
01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:18.900
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?

1609
01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:23.600
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:

1610
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:28.470
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;

1611
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:30.870
Your tributary drops belong to woe,

1612
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:33.770
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.

1613
01:36:33.770 --> 01:36:37.030
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;

1614
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:41.530
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:

1615
01:36:41.530 --> 01:36:47.030
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?

1616
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:52.070
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,

1617
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:56.100
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;

1618
01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:59.000
But, O, it presses to my memory,

1619
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.530
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:

1620
01:37:02.530 --> 01:37:09.530
"Tybalt is dead, and Romeo...banished;"

1621
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:13.400
That "banished," that one word "banished,"

1622
01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:15.930
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts.

1623
01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.630
Tybalt's death

1624
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:20.470
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.

1625
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:23.070
Why follow'd not, when she said "Tybalt's dead,"

1626
01:37:23.070 --> 01:37:29.270
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both?

1627
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:35.600
"Romeo is banished," to speak that word,

1628
01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:38.770
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,

1629
01:37:38.770 --> 01:37:42.770
All slain, all dead.

1630
01:37:42.770 --> 01:37:45.800
"Romeo is banished!"

1631
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.930
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,

1632
01:37:48.930 --> 01:37:54.670
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.

1633
01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:01.800
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

1634
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:05.670
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:

1635
01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:07.800
Will you go to them?

1636
01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.530
I will bring you thither.

1637
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:13.870
Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,

1638
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:16.600
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.

1639
01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:23.370
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,

1640
01:38:23.370 --> 01:38:28.200
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:

1641
01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.870
He made you for a highway to my bed;

1642
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:35.930
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.

1643
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:43.100
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;

1644
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:46.130
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

1645
01:38:49.070 --> 01:38:52.430
Romeo.

1646
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:57.800
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:

1647
01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.870
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,

1648
01:38:59.870 --> 01:39:03.230
And thou art wedded to calamity.

1649
01:39:03.230 --> 01:39:07.700
Father, what news?

1650
01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:10.330
what is the prince's doom?

1651
01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:13.400
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,

1652
01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.530
That I yet know not?

1653
01:39:14.530 --> 01:39:15.670
Too familiar

1654
01:39:15.670 --> 01:39:17.570
Is my dear son with such sour company:

1655
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:20.470
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

1656
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:23.430
What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

1657
01:39:23.430 --> 01:39:25.700
A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,

1658
01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.670
Not body's death, but body's banishment.

1659
01:39:31.230 --> 01:39:33.900
Banishment?

1660
01:39:33.900 --> 01:39:36.170
be merciful, say "death."

1661
01:39:36.170 --> 01:39:38.830
Here from Verona art thou banished:

1662
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:41.230
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

1663
01:39:41.230 --> 01:39:45.170
There is no world without Verona walls,

1664
01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:56.900
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.

1665
01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:58.870
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,

1666
01:39:58.870 --> 01:40:02.330
And world's exile is death: then banished,

1667
01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:05.830
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,

1668
01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:07.800
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,

1669
01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.370
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

1670
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:12.930
O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!

1671
01:40:12.930 --> 01:40:15.570
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,

1672
01:40:15.570 --> 01:40:17.730
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,

1673
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:20.970
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:

1674
01:40:20.970 --> 01:40:23.400
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

1675
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.030
'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,

1676
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:27.630
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog

1677
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:29.130
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,

1678
01:40:29.130 --> 01:40:30.530
Live here in heaven and may look on her;

1679
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:35.700
But Romeo may not: more validity,

1680
01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:37.600
More honourable state, more courtship lives

1681
01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.070
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they may seize

1682
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:44.270
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's flesh

1683
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:46.330
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,

1684
01:40:46.330 --> 01:40:48.230
But Romeo may not; he is banished:

1685
01:40:48.230 --> 01:40:50.770
This may flies do, when I from this must fly:

1686
01:40:50.770 --> 01:40:54.230
They are free men, but I am banished.

1687
01:40:54.230 --> 01:40:56.930
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?

1688
01:40:56.930 --> 01:41:01.170
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,

1689
01:41:01.170 --> 01:41:03.470
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,

1690
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:08.600
But "banished" to kill me?-- "banished"?

1691
01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.070
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;

1692
01:41:13.070 --> 01:41:15.030
Howling attends it: how hast thou the heart,

1693
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:16.800
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,

1694
01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.000
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,

1695
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.800
To mangle me with that word "banished"?

1696
01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.200
Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.

1697
01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.430
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

1698
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:28.400
I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:

1699
01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.230
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,

1700
01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:32.700
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

1701
01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.570
Yet "banished"? Hang up philosophy!

1702
01:41:34.570 --> 01:41:36.200
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,

1703
01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.370
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,

1704
01:41:38.370 --> 01:41:40.700
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

1705
01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:42.330
O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

1706
01:41:42.330 --> 01:41:43.970
How can they, when that wise men have no eyes?

1707
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:46.130
Let me dispute with thee of thine estate.

1708
01:41:46.130 --> 01:41:49.170
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:

1709
01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:52.430
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,

1710
01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:53.930
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,

1711
01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:55.800
Doting like me and like me banished,

1712
01:41:55.800 --> 01:42:00.470
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,

1713
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:02.830
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,

1714
01:42:02.830 --> 01:42:06.730
Taking the measure of an unmade grave!

1715
01:42:06.730 --> 01:42:08.330
Romeo, hide thyself.

1716
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:10.530
Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,

1717
01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:13.500
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

1718
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.630
Hark, how they knock!

1719
01:42:14.630 --> 01:42:17.470
Romeo, arise; Thou wilt be taken.

1720
01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:19.170
Stay awhile!

1721
01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:21.830
Stand up; Run to my study.

1722
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:23.100
By and by!

1723
01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:26.870
God's will, What simpleness is this!

1724
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:29.530
I come, I come!

1725
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:31.970
Who knocks so hard? whence come you?

1726
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:33.670
what's your will?

1727
01:42:33.670 --> 01:42:36.570
Let me come in, and you shall know my errand;

1728
01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:38.670
I come from Lady Juliet.

1729
01:42:38.670 --> 01:42:40.230
Welcome, then.

1730
01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:43.270
O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,

1731
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:46.030
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

1732
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:49.230
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

1733
01:42:49.230 --> 01:42:52.730
O, he is even in my mistress' case,

1734
01:42:52.730 --> 01:42:55.100
Just in her case!

1735
01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.600
O woeful sympathy!

1736
01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:58.900
Piteous predicament!

1737
01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.370
Even so lies she,

1738
01:43:00.370 --> 01:43:04.200
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.

1739
01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:09.630
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:

1740
01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:13.730
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;

1741
01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:16.070
Why should you fall into so deep an O?

1742
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:17.770
Nurse!

1743
01:43:17.770 --> 01:43:20.430
O sir! o sir!

1744
01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:23.030
Well, death's the end of all.

1745
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.930
Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?

1746
01:43:25.930 --> 01:43:28.370
Doth she not think me an old murderer,

1747
01:43:28.370 --> 01:43:30.230
Now that I have stain'd the childhood of our joy

1748
01:43:30.230 --> 01:43:33.000
With blood removed but little from her own?

1749
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.430
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says

1750
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:37.700
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

1751
01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:40.670
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;

1752
01:43:40.670 --> 01:43:44.230
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,

1753
01:43:44.230 --> 01:43:47.730
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,

1754
01:43:47.730 --> 01:43:51.230
And then down falls again.

1755
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:54.730
As if that name, murder her; as that name's cursed hand

1756
01:43:54.730 --> 01:43:57.130
Murder'd her kinsman.

1757
01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:58.930
O, tell me, friar, tell me,

1758
01:43:58.930 --> 01:44:00.570
In what vile part of this anatomy

1759
01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:04.500
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack

1760
01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.470
The hateful mansion.

1761
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:08.170
Hold thy desperate hand:

1762
01:44:08.170 --> 01:44:11.200
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:

1763
01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:13.570
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote

1764
01:44:13.570 --> 01:44:17.730
The unreasonable fury of a beast.

1765
01:44:17.730 --> 01:44:21.070
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,

1766
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:23.130
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.

1767
01:44:23.130 --> 01:44:26.370
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?

1768
01:44:26.370 --> 01:44:28.500
And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,

1769
01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:31.730
By doing damned hate upon thyself?

1770
01:44:31.730 --> 01:44:36.330
What, rouse thee. thy Juliet is alive,

1771
01:44:36.330 --> 01:44:39.830
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;

1772
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:42.430
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,

1773
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:44.700
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:

1774
01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:47.170
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend

1775
01:44:47.170 --> 01:44:49.630
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:

1776
01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:51.870
A pack of blessings lights up on thy back;

1777
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:54.070
Happiness courts thee in her best array;

1778
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:56.470
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,

1779
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:58.800
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:

1780
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:04.130
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.

1781
01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.700
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,

1782
01:45:14.700 --> 01:45:17.330
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:

1783
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:19.430
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,

1784
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:21.170
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;

1785
01:45:21.170 --> 01:45:24.270
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time

1786
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:26.600
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,

1787
01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:29.400
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back

1788
01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:32.070
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy

1789
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:35.970
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.

1790
01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:39.130
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;

1791
01:45:39.130 --> 01:45:40.730
bid her hasten all the house to bed,

1792
01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:42.700
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:

1793
01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.300
Romeo is coming.

1794
01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:46.800
O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night

1795
01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.070
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!

1796
01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:54.200
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

1797
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:56.500
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

1798
01:45:56.500 --> 01:46:00.470
Here, here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:

1799
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:04.900
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

1800
01:46:04.900 --> 01:46:06.970
How well my comfort is revived by this!

1801
01:46:06.970 --> 01:46:10.630
Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:

1802
01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:13.030
Either be gone before the watch be set,

1803
01:46:13.030 --> 01:46:16.070
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:

1804
01:46:16.070 --> 01:46:18.500
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,

1805
01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:19.870
And he shall signify from time to time

1806
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:22.530
Every good hap to you that chances here:

1807
01:46:22.530 --> 01:46:31.430
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

1808
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:33.870
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,

1809
01:46:33.870 --> 01:46:37.070
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee:

1810
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:38.400
Farewell.

1811
01:46:52.630 --> 01:46:55.070
Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,

1812
01:46:55.070 --> 01:47:00.300
That we have had no time to move our daughter:

1813
01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.430
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,

1814
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:09.100
And so did I-- Well, we are born to die.

1815
01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:20.600
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:

1816
01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:22.430
I promise you, but for your company,

1817
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:25.330
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

1818
01:47:25.330 --> 01:47:28.930
These times of woe afford no time to woo.

1819
01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:36.300
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

1820
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:38.970
I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;

1821
01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:41.500
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

1822
01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:47.400
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender

1823
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.370
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled

1824
01:47:50.370 --> 01:47:52.830
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.

1825
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:55.000
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;

1826
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.570
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;

1827
01:47:57.570 --> 01:48:01.200
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--

1828
01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.270
But, soft! what day is this?

1829
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:04.400
Monday, my lord.

1830
01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.170
Monday! Well, Wednesday is too soon,

1831
01:48:06.170 --> 01:48:09.100
O' Thursday be it then: o' Thursday, tell her,

1832
01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:12.700
She shall be married to this noble earl.

1833
01:48:12.700 --> 01:48:15.630
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?

1834
01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:19.170
We'll keep no great ado-- a friend or two;

1835
01:48:19.170 --> 01:48:21.670
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,

1836
01:48:21.670 --> 01:48:24.630
It may be thought we held him carelessly,

1837
01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:28.800
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:

1838
01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:31.270
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,

1839
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:32.370
And there an end.

1840
01:48:32.370 --> 01:48:33.530
But what say you to Thursday?

1841
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:35.270
My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

1842
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:39.400
Well, get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.

1843
01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.330
Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,

1844
01:48:42.330 --> 01:48:44.430
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.

1845
01:48:44.430 --> 01:48:46.770
Farewell, my lord.

1846
01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:48.700
Light to my chamber, ho!

1847
01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:50.470
Afore me!

1848
01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:56.370
It is so very very late,

1849
01:48:56.370 --> 01:49:00.830
That we may call it early by and by.

1850
01:49:00.830 --> 01:49:02.970
Good night.

1851
01:49:31.670 --> 01:49:33.200
Wilt thou be gone?

1852
01:49:42.970 --> 01:49:45.030
it is not yet near day:

1853
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:47.470
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,

1854
01:49:47.470 --> 01:49:50.170
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;

1855
01:49:50.170 --> 01:49:53.000
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:

1856
01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.430
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

1857
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:57.970
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,

1858
01:49:57.970 --> 01:50:01.300
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks

1859
01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:04.270
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:

1860
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:07.730
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day

1861
01:50:07.730 --> 01:50:10.570
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.

1862
01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:14.200
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

1863
01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:18.530
Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:

1864
01:50:18.530 --> 01:50:22.230
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,

1865
01:50:22.230 --> 01:50:24.600
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,

1866
01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:26.800
And to light thee on thy way to Mantua:

1867
01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.900
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

1868
01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:35.830
Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;

1869
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:38.400
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

1870
01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:41.800
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,

1871
01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:44.600
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;

1872
01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:46.700
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat

1873
01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:50.770
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:

1874
01:50:50.770 --> 01:50:56.170
I have more care to stay than will to go:

1875
01:50:56.170 --> 01:51:02.700
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.

1876
01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:06.030
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

1877
01:51:06.030 --> 01:51:11.030
It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!

1878
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:14.030
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,

1879
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:17.170
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.

1880
01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:19.600
Some say the lark makes sweet division;

1881
01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:23.530
This doth not so, for she divideth us:

1882
01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:27.600
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,

1883
01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:30.930
O, now I would they had changed voices too!

1884
01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:33.600
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,

1885
01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:36.900
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,

1886
01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:40.430
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

1887
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:43.670
More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

1888
01:51:45.570 --> 01:51:46.800
Nurse?

1889
01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.400
Madam, your lady mother is coming to your chamber:

1890
01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:52.130
The day is broke; be wary, look about.

1891
01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:58.300
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

1892
01:51:58.300 --> 01:52:02.000
Farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

1893
01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:13.730
Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!

1894
01:52:13.730 --> 01:52:15.600
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,

1895
01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.900
For in a minute there are many days:

1896
01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:19.900
O, by this count I shall be much in years

1897
01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:21.400
Ere I again behold my Romeo!

1898
01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:22.500
Farewell!

1899
01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.370
I will omit no opportunity

1900
01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:26.530
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

1901
01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:29.030
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

1902
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:32.130
I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve

1903
01:52:32.130 --> 01:52:34.330
As sweet discourses in our time to come.

1904
01:52:34.330 --> 01:52:39.970
O God, I have an ill-divining soul!

1905
01:52:39.970 --> 01:52:42.570
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,

1906
01:52:42.570 --> 01:52:45.130
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:

1907
01:52:45.130 --> 01:52:48.230
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

1908
01:52:48.230 --> 01:52:51.470
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:

1909
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:53.730
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.

1910
01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:56.830
Adieu!

1911
01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:00.770
adieu!

1912
01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:09.070
O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:

1913
01:53:09.070 --> 01:53:12.000
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him

1914
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.130
That is renown'd for faith?

1915
01:53:14.130 --> 01:53:16.430
Be fickle, fortune;

1916
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:18.630
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,

1917
01:53:18.630 --> 01:53:22.170
But send him back.

1918
01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:24.830
Ho, daughter! are you up?

1919
01:53:33.730 --> 01:53:35.270
Why, how now, Juliet!

1920
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:37.200
Madam, I am not well.

1921
01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.030
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?

1922
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:45.070
What, wilt you wash him from his grave with tears?

1923
01:53:45.070 --> 01:53:47.870
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;

1924
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:51.870
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;

1925
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:55.370
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

1926
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:58.030
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

1927
01:53:58.030 --> 01:54:01.030
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend

1928
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:02.770
Which you weep for.

1929
01:54:02.770 --> 01:54:03.870
Feeling so the loss,

1930
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:06.000
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

1931
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.800
Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,

1932
01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.030
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

1933
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:14.030
What villain, madam?

1934
01:54:14.030 --> 01:54:17.000
That same villain, Romeo.

1935
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.900
Villain and he be many miles asunder.

1936
01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:22.170
God Pardon him!

1937
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:23.970
I do, with all my heart;

1938
01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:26.930
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

1939
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:30.400
That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

1940
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:33.730
Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:

1941
01:54:33.730 --> 01:54:36.400
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

1942
01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.230
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:

1943
01:54:40.230 --> 01:54:43.000
weep no more.

1944
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.600
I'll send to one in Mantua,

1945
01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.370
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,

1946
01:54:48.370 --> 01:54:50.530
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,

1947
01:54:50.530 --> 01:54:53.300
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:

1948
01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:56.300
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

1949
01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:58.200
Indeed, I never shall be satisfied

1950
01:54:58.200 --> 01:55:03.000
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead.

1951
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.100
Madam, if you could find out but a man

1952
01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.470
To bear a poison, I would temper it;

1953
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:09.530
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,

1954
01:55:09.530 --> 01:55:11.700
Soon sleep in quiet.

1955
01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:13.570
O, how my heart abhors

1956
01:55:13.570 --> 01:55:16.070
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.

1957
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:18.730
Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.

1958
01:55:18.730 --> 01:55:24.370
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

1959
01:55:24.370 --> 01:55:26.230
And joy comes well in such a needy time:

1960
01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:28.230
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

1961
01:55:28.230 --> 01:55:33.900
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;

1962
01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:36.630
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,

1963
01:55:36.630 --> 01:55:39.070
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,

1964
01:55:39.070 --> 01:55:41.870
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

1965
01:55:41.870 --> 01:55:43.870
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

1966
01:55:43.870 --> 01:55:47.870
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,

1967
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:50.330
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,

1968
01:55:50.330 --> 01:55:52.530
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,

1969
01:55:52.530 --> 01:55:55.370
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

1970
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:57.370
Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,

1971
01:55:57.370 --> 01:55:59.700
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.

1972
01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:03.300
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed

1973
01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:06.130
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.

1974
01:56:06.130 --> 01:56:08.530
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,

1975
01:56:08.530 --> 01:56:11.630
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,

1976
01:56:11.630 --> 01:56:14.230
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,

1977
01:56:14.230 --> 01:56:16.030
Rather than Paris.

1978
01:56:16.030 --> 01:56:18.300
These are news indeed!

1979
01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:21.030
Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,

1980
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:23.470
And see how he will take it at your hands.

1981
01:56:23.470 --> 01:56:27.170
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;

1982
01:56:27.170 --> 01:56:28.630
But for the sunset of my brother's son

1983
01:56:28.630 --> 01:56:31.170
It rains downright.

1984
01:56:31.170 --> 01:56:36.300
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?

1985
01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:38.500
Evermore showering?

1986
01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:40.600
In one little body

1987
01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:42.900
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;

1988
01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:45.700
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,

1989
01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:49.130
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,

1990
01:56:49.130 --> 01:56:53.670
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;

1991
01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:55.830
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,

1992
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:57.700
Without a sudden calm, will overset

1993
01:56:57.700 --> 01:56:59.900
Thy tempest-tossed body.

1994
01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:01.730
How now, wife!

1995
01:57:01.730 --> 01:57:04.100
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

1996
01:57:04.100 --> 01:57:07.430
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.

1997
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:09.470
I would the fool were married to her grave!

1998
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:13.570
Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.

1999
01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:17.070
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?

2000
01:57:17.070 --> 01:57:20.270
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,

2001
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:22.800
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought

2002
01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:24.770
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

2003
01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:27.330
Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:

2004
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:29.700
Proud can I never be of what I hate;

2005
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:31.630
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

2006
01:57:31.630 --> 01:57:32.900
How now, how now, chop-logic!

2007
01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.200
What is this?

2008
01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:35.970
"Proud," and "I thank you," and "I thank you not;"

2009
01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:38.070
And yet "not proud," mistress minion, you,

2010
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:40.230
Thank me no thankings, and proud me no prouds,

2011
01:57:40.230 --> 01:57:42.470
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,

2012
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:44.330
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,

2013
01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:46.070
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.

2014
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:48.730
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!

2015
01:57:48.730 --> 01:57:50.000
You tallow-face!

2016
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.400
Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

2017
01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.930
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,

2018
01:57:53.930 --> 01:57:55.570
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

2019
01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:57.800
Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!

2020
01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.100
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,

2021
01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:01.400
Or never after look me in the face:

2022
01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:04.230
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;

2023
01:58:06.170 --> 01:58:08.130
My fingers itch.

2024
01:58:08.130 --> 01:58:09.970
Wife, we scarce thought us blest

2025
01:58:09.970 --> 01:58:11.770
That God had lent us but this only child;

2026
01:58:11.770 --> 01:58:13.400
But now I see this one is one too much,

2027
01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.100
And that we have a curse in having her:

2028
01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:16.600
Out on her, hilding!

2029
01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:18.900
God in heaven bless her!

2030
01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.300
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

2031
01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:21.530
Hold your tongue,

2032
01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:22.970
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

2033
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:24.500
I speak no treason.

2034
01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:25.630
O, God ye god-den.

2035
01:58:25.630 --> 01:58:26.730
May not one speak?

2036
01:58:26.730 --> 01:58:28.130
Peace, you mumbling fool!

2037
01:58:28.130 --> 01:58:29.770
Utter your gravity over a gossip's bowl;

2038
01:58:29.770 --> 01:58:30.870
For here we need it not.

2039
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:31.970
You are too hot.

2040
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:35.030
God's bread! it makes me mad:

2041
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:39.630
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,

2042
01:58:39.630 --> 01:58:42.330
Alone, in company, still my care hath been

2043
01:58:42.330 --> 01:58:44.830
To have her match'd: and having now provided

2044
01:58:44.830 --> 01:58:46.500
A gentleman of noble parentage,

2045
01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:49.100
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,

2046
01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:51.400
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,

2047
01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.530
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;

2048
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:55.930
And then to have a wretched puling fool,

2049
01:58:55.930 --> 01:58:58.270
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,

2050
01:58:58.270 --> 01:59:00.630
To answer "I'll not wed; I cannot love,

2051
01:59:00.630 --> 01:59:02.970
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me."

2052
01:59:02.970 --> 01:59:05.030
But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you:

2053
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:07.470
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:

2054
01:59:07.470 --> 01:59:10.770
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.

2055
01:59:10.770 --> 01:59:14.430
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:

2056
01:59:14.430 --> 01:59:16.270
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;

2057
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:19.130
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,

2058
01:59:19.130 --> 01:59:21.270
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,

2059
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:22.930
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:

2060
01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:26.430
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

2061
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:29.270
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,

2062
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:31.470
That sees into the bottom of my grief?

2063
01:59:34.300 --> 01:59:36.830
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!

2064
01:59:36.830 --> 01:59:40.200
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;

2065
01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:42.170
Or, if thou do not, make the bridal bed

2066
01:59:42.170 --> 01:59:44.200
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

2067
01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:47.870
Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:

2068
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:50.830
Do as thou wilt, I've done with thee.

2069
01:59:50.830 --> 01:59:57.000
O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?

2070
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.500
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;

2071
02:00:00.500 --> 02:00:03.170
How can that faith return again to earth,

2072
02:00:03.170 --> 02:00:05.230
Unless that husband send it me from heaven

2073
02:00:05.230 --> 02:00:10.800
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.

2074
02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:15.230
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems

2075
02:00:15.230 --> 02:00:18.570
Upon so soft a subject as myself!

2076
02:00:18.570 --> 02:00:22.270
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?

2077
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:24.200
Some comfort, nurse.

2078
02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:27.500
Faith, here it is.

2079
02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:30.970
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,

2080
02:00:30.970 --> 02:00:33.670
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge thee;

2081
02:00:33.670 --> 02:00:36.270
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.

2082
02:00:36.270 --> 02:00:39.200
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,

2083
02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:42.330
I think it best you married with the county.

2084
02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:45.430
O, he's a lovely gentleman!

2085
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:49.970
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,

2086
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:54.570
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye as Paris hath.

2087
02:00:54.570 --> 02:00:55.770
Beshrew my very heart,

2088
02:00:55.770 --> 02:00:57.470
I think you are happy in this second match,

2089
02:00:57.470 --> 02:01:00.370
For it excels your first: or if it did not,

2090
02:01:00.370 --> 02:01:03.270
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,

2091
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:05.530
As living here and you no use of him.

2092
02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:08.770
Speakest thou from thy heart?

2093
02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:12.370
Ay, and from my soul too; Or else beshrew them both.

2094
02:01:12.370 --> 02:01:13.500
Amen!

2095
02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:14.700
What?

2096
02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:18.770
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.

2097
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:23.230
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,

2098
02:01:23.230 --> 02:01:26.030
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,

2099
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:28.470
To make confession and to be absolved.

2100
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:34.130
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

2101
02:01:38.130 --> 02:01:41.230
Ancient damnation!

2102
02:01:41.230 --> 02:01:43.570
O most wicked fiend!

2103
02:01:43.570 --> 02:01:46.070
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,

2104
02:01:46.070 --> 02:01:48.530
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue

2105
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:50.330
Which she hath praised him with above compare

2106
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:53.170
So many thousand times?

2107
02:01:53.170 --> 02:01:55.230
Go, counsellor;

2108
02:01:55.230 --> 02:01:59.070
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.

2109
02:01:59.070 --> 02:02:03.270
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:

2110
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:09.270
If all else fail, myself have power to die.

2111
02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:14.800
Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

2112
02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:16.800
My father Capulet will have it so;

2113
02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:20.000
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

2114
02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.500
You say you do not know the lady's mind:

2115
02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.400
Uneven is the course, I like it not.

2116
02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:27.000
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,

2117
02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.470
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;

2118
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:33.000
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.

2119
02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:37.070
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous

2120
02:02:37.070 --> 02:02:39.700
That she do give her sorrow so much sway,

2121
02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:42.170
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,

2122
02:02:42.170 --> 02:02:44.630
To stop the inundation of her tears;

2123
02:02:44.630 --> 02:02:47.730
Which, too much minded by herself alone,

2124
02:02:47.730 --> 02:02:51.400
May be put from her by society:

2125
02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:54.430
Now do you know the reason of this haste.

2126
02:02:54.430 --> 02:02:57.730
I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.

2127
02:02:57.730 --> 02:03:01.300
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.

2128
02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:07.300
Happily met, my lady and my wife!

2129
02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:10.570
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

2130
02:03:10.570 --> 02:03:15.070
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

2131
02:03:15.070 --> 02:03:17.770
What must be shall be.

2132
02:03:17.770 --> 02:03:19.030
That's a certain text.

2133
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:22.770
Come you to make confession to this father?

2134
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:25.730
To answer that, I should confess to you.

2135
02:03:25.730 --> 02:03:29.800
Do not deny to him that you love me.

2136
02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:32.700
I will confess to you that I love him.

2137
02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:36.070
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

2138
02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:38.430
If I do so, it will be of more price,

2139
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:41.430
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

2140
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:43.200
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;

2141
02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.670
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

2142
02:03:44.670 --> 02:03:46.530
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.

2143
02:03:46.530 --> 02:03:49.130
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

2144
02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:51.330
God shield I should disturb devotion!

2145
02:03:51.330 --> 02:03:56.070
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:

2146
02:03:56.070 --> 02:04:02.470
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

2147
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:15.430
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,

2148
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:20.470
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

2149
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:22.130
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;

2150
02:04:22.130 --> 02:04:24.900
It strains me past the compass of my wits:

2151
02:04:24.900 --> 02:04:27.570
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,

2152
02:04:27.570 --> 02:04:30.600
On Thursday next be married to this county.

2153
02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:33.100
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,

2154
02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:35.700
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:

2155
02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:39.070
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,

2156
02:04:39.070 --> 02:04:41.830
Do thou but call my resolution wise,

2157
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:45.100
And with this knife I'll help it presently.

2158
02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:48.800
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;

2159
02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:51.330
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,

2160
02:04:51.330 --> 02:04:53.730
Shall be the label to another deed,

2161
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:55.930
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt

2162
02:04:55.930 --> 02:05:00.500
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:

2163
02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:04.070
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,

2164
02:05:04.070 --> 02:05:07.930
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,

2165
02:05:07.930 --> 02:05:09.900
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife

2166
02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:12.400
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that

2167
02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.300
Which the commission of thy years and art

2168
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:17.130
Could to no issue of true honour bring.

2169
02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:23.370
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,

2170
02:05:23.370 --> 02:05:27.000
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

2171
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,

2172
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Which craves as desperate an execution

2173
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.900
As that is desperate which we would prevent.

2174
02:05:35.900 --> 02:05:37.870
If, rather than to marry County Paris,

2175
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:39.730
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,

2176
02:05:39.730 --> 02:05:41.670
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake

2177
02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:45.630
A thing like death to chide away this shame.

2178
02:05:45.630 --> 02:05:47.600
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,

2179
02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:49.470
From off the battlements of any tower;

2180
02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:52.430
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk

2181
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:54.630
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;

2182
02:05:54.630 --> 02:05:57.170
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,

2183
02:05:57.170 --> 02:06:00.330
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,

2184
02:06:00.330 --> 02:06:03.000
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;

2185
02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.170
Or bid me go into a new-made grave

2186
02:06:05.170 --> 02:06:07.330
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;

2187
02:06:07.330 --> 02:06:12.000
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;

2188
02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.270
And I will do it without fear or doubt,

2189
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:18.470
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

2190
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:21.400
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent

2191
02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:25.070
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:

2192
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:28.570
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;

2193
02:06:28.570 --> 02:06:31.070
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:

2194
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:36.030
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,

2195
02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:39.630
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;

2196
02:06:39.630 --> 02:06:42.330
When presently through all thy veins shall run

2197
02:06:42.330 --> 02:06:46.100
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse

2198
02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:49.070
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:

2199
02:06:49.070 --> 02:06:53.030
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;

2200
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:55.100
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade

2201
02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:58.770
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,

2202
02:06:58.770 --> 02:07:01.400
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;

2203
02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:04.470
Each part, deprived of supple government,

2204
02:07:04.470 --> 02:07:08.770
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:

2205
02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:11.970
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death

2206
02:07:11.970 --> 02:07:14.830
Shalt thou continue two and forty hours,

2207
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:17.530
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

2208
02:07:17.530 --> 02:07:20.130
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes

2209
02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:23.770
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:

2210
02:07:23.770 --> 02:07:26.370
Then, as the manner of our country is,

2211
02:07:26.370 --> 02:07:28.930
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier

2212
02:07:28.930 --> 02:07:31.600
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault

2213
02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:34.370
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.

2214
02:07:34.370 --> 02:07:35.670
In the mean time,

2215
02:07:35.670 --> 02:07:39.270
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,

2216
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:42.030
And hither shall he come: and he and I

2217
02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:44.970
Will watch thy waking, and that very night

2218
02:07:44.970 --> 02:07:48.030
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.

2219
02:07:48.030 --> 02:07:50.930
And this shall free thee from this present shame;

2220
02:07:50.930 --> 02:07:55.000
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,

2221
02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Abate thy valour in the acting it.

2222
02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.230
O give me, give me!

2223
02:07:59.230 --> 02:08:01.100
O, tell not me of fear!

2224
02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:03.230
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous

2225
02:08:03.230 --> 02:08:05.930
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed

2226
02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:07.800
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

2227
02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:12.300
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.

2228
02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:14.500
Farewell, dear father!

2229
02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:26.530
Samson!

2230
02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:28.170
My fan.

2231
02:08:28.170 --> 02:08:31.570
Before, and at pace.

2232
02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:41.400
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

2233
02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:43.700
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin

2234
02:08:43.700 --> 02:08:45.300
Of disobedient opposition

2235
02:08:45.300 --> 02:08:47.570
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd

2236
02:08:47.570 --> 02:08:49.600
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,

2237
02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:52.900
To beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!

2238
02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:55.400
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

2239
02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.130
Send for the county; go tell him of this:

2240
02:08:59.130 --> 02:09:01.670
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

2241
02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:04.300
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;

2242
02:09:04.300 --> 02:09:05.700
And gave him what becomed love I might,

2243
02:09:05.700 --> 02:09:07.870
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

2244
02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:11.070
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:

2245
02:09:11.070 --> 02:09:13.530
This is as't should be.

2246
02:09:15.630 --> 02:09:17.130
Let me see the county;

2247
02:09:17.130 --> 02:09:20.300
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.

2248
02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:22.800
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,

2249
02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:26.030
And all our whole city is much bound to him.

2250
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:29.130
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,

2251
02:09:29.130 --> 02:09:30.300
To help me sort such needful ornaments

2252
02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:32.230
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

2253
02:09:32.230 --> 02:09:34.830
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

2254
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:36.870
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

2255
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:39.030
We shall be short in our provisions:

2256
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:40.300
'Tis now near night.

2257
02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:41.770
Tush, I will stir about,

2258
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:43.470
And all things will be well, I warrant thee, wife:

2259
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:46.000
Go thou with Juliet, help to deck up her;

2260
02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:49.100
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;

2261
02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:51.730
I'll play the housewife for this once.

2262
02:09:51.730 --> 02:09:53.270
What, ho!

2263
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:56.300
They are all forth.

2264
02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:57.900
Well, I will walk myself

2265
02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.730
To County Paris, and prepare up him

2266
02:09:59.730 --> 02:10:03.230
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,

2267
02:10:03.230 --> 02:10:08.070
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

2268
02:10:14.330 --> 02:10:18.600
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,

2269
02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.300
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,

2270
02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:23.800
For I have need of many orisons

2271
02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:26.370
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,

2272
02:10:26.370 --> 02:10:29.070
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

2273
02:10:29.070 --> 02:10:32.630
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

2274
02:10:32.630 --> 02:10:34.700
No, madam; we have cull'd necessaries

2275
02:10:34.700 --> 02:10:36.900
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:

2276
02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:39.830
So please you, let me now be left alone,

2277
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:42.000
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;

2278
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.300
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,

2279
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:45.970
In this so sudden business.

2280
02:10:45.970 --> 02:10:50.070
Good night:

2281
02:10:50.070 --> 02:10:54.430
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

2282
02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:05.830
Farewell!

2283
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:10.030
God knows when we shall meet again.

2284
02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:13.570
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,

2285
02:11:13.570 --> 02:11:17.500
That almost freezes up the heat of life:

2286
02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:21.700
I'll call them back again to comfort me: Nurse!

2287
02:11:26.730 --> 02:11:30.970
What should she do here?

2288
02:11:30.970 --> 02:11:33.600
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.

2289
02:11:35.530 --> 02:11:37.000
Come, vial.

2290
02:11:40.370 --> 02:11:43.600
What if this mixture do not work at all?

2291
02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:45.730
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?

2292
02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:55.670
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

2293
02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:02.730
What if it be a poison, which the friar

2294
02:12:02.730 --> 02:12:05.100
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,

2295
02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:07.430
Lest in this marriage he be dishonour'd,

2296
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:09.900
Because he married me before to Romeo?

2297
02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:15.100
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,

2298
02:12:15.100 --> 02:12:18.530
For he hath still been tried a holy man.

2299
02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:22.970
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,

2300
02:12:22.970 --> 02:12:24.770
I wake before the time that Romeo

2301
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:30.130
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!

2302
02:12:30.130 --> 02:12:32.200
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,

2303
02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:34.430
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,

2304
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:37.770
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?

2305
02:12:37.770 --> 02:12:42.530
Or, if I live, is it not very like,

2306
02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:45.030
The horrible conceit of death and night,

2307
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:48.370
Together with the terror of the place--

2308
02:12:48.370 --> 02:12:53.530
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,

2309
02:12:53.530 --> 02:12:56.600
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones

2310
02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:59.770
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:

2311
02:12:59.770 --> 02:13:02.900
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,

2312
02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:06.500
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,

2313
02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:09.400
At some hours in the night spirits resort--

2314
02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:12.730
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,

2315
02:13:12.730 --> 02:13:14.630
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,

2316
02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:16.770
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,

2317
02:13:16.770 --> 02:13:19.730
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad--

2318
02:13:19.730 --> 02:13:22.000
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,

2319
02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.630
Environed with all these hideous fears?

2320
02:13:24.630 --> 02:13:27.100
And madly play with my forefather's joints?

2321
02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:29.400
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?

2322
02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.630
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,

2323
02:13:31.630 --> 02:13:34.800
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?

2324
02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:43.330
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost

2325
02:13:43.330 --> 02:13:45.870
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body

2326
02:13:45.870 --> 02:13:51.670
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!

2327
02:14:00.300 --> 02:14:09.130
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

2328
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:29.700
Gregory.

2329
02:14:29.700 --> 02:14:33.670
Nurse, take these keys, and fetch more spices.

2330
02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:35.930
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

2331
02:14:35.930 --> 02:14:37.830
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,

2332
02:14:37.830 --> 02:14:39.800
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:

2333
02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:43.030
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:

2334
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:44.230
Spare not for the cost.

2335
02:14:44.230 --> 02:14:47.130
Go, you cot-quean, go, Get you to bed; faith,

2336
02:14:47.130 --> 02:14:49.270
You'll be sick to-morrow For this night's watching.

2337
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:50.400
No, not a whit.

2338
02:14:50.400 --> 02:14:51.670
I have watch'd ere now

2339
02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:53.470
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

2340
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:56.470
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;

2341
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:59.330
But I'll watch you from such watching now.

2342
02:14:59.330 --> 02:15:01.970
Jealous hood, a jealous hood!

2343
02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:03.200
Well, fellow, what is there?

2344
02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.030
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

2345
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:06.270
Make haste, make haste.

2346
02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:07.370
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:

2347
02:15:07.370 --> 02:15:08.530
Peter will show thee where they are.

2348
02:15:08.530 --> 02:15:10.300
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,

2349
02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:12.030
And never trouble Peter for the matter.

2350
02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:14.200
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!

2351
02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:15.470
Thou shalt be logger-head.

2352
02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:22.730
Good faith, 'tis day:

2353
02:15:22.730 --> 02:15:24.600
The county will be here with music straight,

2354
02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:27.000
For so he said he would: I hear him near.

2355
02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.130
Nurse! Wife! What, ho!

2356
02:15:29.130 --> 02:15:30.400
What, nurse, I say!

2357
02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:32.700
Go waken Juliet, help to trim her up;

2358
02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:36.300
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,

2359
02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:39.170
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:

2360
02:15:39.170 --> 02:15:41.230
Make haste, I say.

2361
02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:49.800
Mistress!

2362
02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:52.470
what, mistress!

2363
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:55.870
Juliet!

2364
02:15:55.870 --> 02:15:58.270
fast, I warrant her, she:

2365
02:15:58.270 --> 02:16:06.600
Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!

2366
02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:14.000
Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!

2367
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:18.130
What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;

2368
02:16:18.130 --> 02:16:21.270
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,

2369
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:23.300
The County Paris hath set up his rest,

2370
02:16:23.300 --> 02:16:26.700
That you shall rest but little.

2371
02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:29.430
God forgive me, Marry, and amen,

2372
02:16:32.170 --> 02:16:34.430
how sound is she asleep!

2373
02:16:34.430 --> 02:16:36.670
I needs must wake her.

2374
02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:41.230
Madam, madam, madam!

2375
02:16:41.230 --> 02:16:43.800
Ay, let the county take you in your bed;

2376
02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.270
He'll fright you up, i' faith. will it not be?

2377
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:52.600
What, dress'd! and in your clothes!

2378
02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.870
and down again?

2379
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:58.600
I needs must wake you;

2380
02:17:01.430 --> 02:17:04.300
Mada--

2381
02:17:10.430 --> 02:17:12.600
Lady!

2382
02:17:16.670 --> 02:17:20.500
Alack! alack, my lady's dead!

2383
02:17:20.500 --> 02:17:22.870
Help, help!

2384
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:27.500
O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!

2385
02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:28.600
Some aqua vitae, ho!

2386
02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:32.700
My lord! my lady!

2387
02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:33.800
What noise is here?

2388
02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:34.930
O lamentable day!

2389
02:17:34.930 --> 02:17:36.030
What's the matter?

2390
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:37.130
Look, look!

2391
02:17:37.130 --> 02:17:38.770
O heavy day!

2392
02:17:42.730 --> 02:17:47.970
My child, my only life,

2393
02:17:47.970 --> 02:17:52.170
Revive, look up,

2394
02:17:53.530 --> 02:17:55.530
or I will die with thee!

2395
02:17:58.430 --> 02:18:01.900
Help, help!

2396
02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:03.130
Call help.

2397
02:18:03.130 --> 02:18:05.370
For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

2398
02:18:05.370 --> 02:18:10.100
She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

2399
02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:16.370
Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

2400
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:19.330
Ha! let me see her:

2401
02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:26.600
out, alas! she's cold:

2402
02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:30.370
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;

2403
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:33.900
Life and these lips have long been separated:

2404
02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:38.300
Death lies on her like an untimely frost

2405
02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:40.670
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

2406
02:18:40.670 --> 02:18:43.630
O lamentable day!

2407
02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:48.430
O woeful time!

2408
02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:52.430
Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,

2409
02:18:52.430 --> 02:18:56.770
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

2410
02:19:21.130 --> 02:19:24.700
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

2411
02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:29.370
Ready to go, but never to return.

2412
02:19:29.370 --> 02:19:33.670
O son! the night before thy wedding-day

2413
02:19:33.670 --> 02:19:37.230
Hath Death lain with thy wife.

2414
02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:39.270
There she lies,

2415
02:19:39.270 --> 02:19:44.830
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.

2416
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:51.900
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;

2417
02:19:51.900 --> 02:19:56.770
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,

2418
02:19:56.770 --> 02:20:03.270
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

2419
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:06.830
Have I thought long to see this morning's face,

2420
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:09.600
And doth it give me such a sight as this?

2421
02:20:09.600 --> 02:20:15.630
Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!

2422
02:20:15.630 --> 02:20:19.870
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw

2423
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:23.670
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!

2424
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:32.370
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,

2425
02:20:32.370 --> 02:20:36.670
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,

2426
02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:42.300
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

2427
02:20:42.300 --> 02:20:44.100
O woe!

2428
02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:47.500
O woeful, woeful, woeful day!

2429
02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:51.770
Most lamentable day, most woeful day,

2430
02:20:51.770 --> 02:20:55.770
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!

2431
02:20:55.770 --> 02:20:59.530
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now

2432
02:20:59.530 --> 02:21:03.230
To murder, murder our solemnity?

2433
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:09.170
O child! O child!

2434
02:21:09.170 --> 02:21:13.630
my soul, but not my child!

2435
02:21:13.630 --> 02:21:19.300
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;

2436
02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:22.430
And with my child my joys are buried.

2437
02:21:22.430 --> 02:21:26.100
Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not

2438
02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:28.770
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself

2439
02:21:28.770 --> 02:21:32.100
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,

2440
02:21:32.100 --> 02:21:34.430
And all the better is it for the maid:

2441
02:21:34.430 --> 02:21:36.970
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary

2442
02:21:36.970 --> 02:21:39.800
On this fair corse; and, as our custom is,

2443
02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:42.400
In all her best array bear her to church:

2444
02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:45.770
For though fond nature bids us all lament,

2445
02:21:45.770 --> 02:21:48.800
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

2446
02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:51.670
All things that we ordained festival,

2447
02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:54.630
Turn from their office to black funeral;

2448
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:58.370
Our instruments to melancholy bells,

2449
02:21:58.370 --> 02:22:01.930
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,

2450
02:22:01.930 --> 02:22:06.200
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,

2451
02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:11.500
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,

2452
02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:15.730
And all things change them to the contrary.

2453
02:22:15.730 --> 02:22:20.330
Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;

2454
02:22:20.330 --> 02:22:24.270
And go, Sir Paris; all of you prepare

2455
02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:26.930
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:

2456
02:22:26.930 --> 02:22:33.100
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;

2457
02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:37.330
Move them no more by crossing their high will.

2458
02:22:59.600 --> 02:23:02.400
Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

2459
02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:07.370
Musicians, O, musicians, "Heart's ease," "Heart's ease:"

2460
02:23:07.370 --> 02:23:10.170
O, an you will have me live, play "Heart's ease."

2461
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:11.870
Why "Heart's ease?"

2462
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:14.970
O, musicians, because my heart itself plays

2463
02:23:14.970 --> 02:23:17.600
"My heart is full of woe:"

2464
02:23:17.600 --> 02:23:20.330
O, play me some merry dump, to comfort me.

2465
02:23:20.330 --> 02:23:23.970
Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

2466
02:23:28.570 --> 02:23:31.400
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,

2467
02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:34.900
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:

2468
02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:37.730
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;

2469
02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:39.570
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit

2470
02:23:39.570 --> 02:23:42.700
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.

2471
02:23:42.700 --> 02:23:45.800
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--

2472
02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:49.170
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!--

2473
02:23:49.170 --> 02:23:52.130
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,

2474
02:23:52.130 --> 02:23:55.100
That I revived, and was an emperor.

2475
02:23:55.100 --> 02:24:00.870
News from Verona! How now, Balthasar!

2476
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:02.930
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?

2477
02:24:02.930 --> 02:24:05.400
How doth my lady?

2478
02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:06.500
Is my father well?

2479
02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:08.700
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;

2480
02:24:08.700 --> 02:24:10.270
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

2481
02:24:10.270 --> 02:24:14.100
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:

2482
02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:17.700
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,

2483
02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:22.100
And her immortal part with angels lives.

2484
02:24:22.100 --> 02:24:23.800
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,

2485
02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:26.570
And presently took post to tell it you:

2486
02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:29.130
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,

2487
02:24:29.130 --> 02:24:31.870
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

2488
02:24:34.930 --> 02:24:36.870
Is it even so?

2489
02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:49.200
then I defy you, stars!

2490
02:24:51.470 --> 02:24:54.700
Go hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

2491
02:24:54.700 --> 02:24:56.700
I do beseech you, sir, have patience:

2492
02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:58.400
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import

2493
02:24:58.400 --> 02:24:59.500
Some misadventure.

2494
02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:00.700
Tush, thou art deceived:

2495
02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:03.430
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.

2496
02:25:08.470 --> 02:25:11.970
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

2497
02:25:11.970 --> 02:25:14.770
No, my good lord.

2498
02:25:14.770 --> 02:25:16.870
No matter: get thee gone,

2499
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:18.930
I'll go hence tonight.

2500
02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:34.230
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.

2501
02:25:37.970 --> 02:25:40.030
Let's see for means:

2502
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:48.800
O mischief, thou art swift

2503
02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:52.630
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!

2504
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:55.500
What, ho! apothecary!

2505
02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:59.370
Who calls so loud?

2506
02:25:59.370 --> 02:26:06.270
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:

2507
02:26:06.270 --> 02:26:10.730
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have

2508
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:13.430
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear

2509
02:26:13.430 --> 02:26:15.370
As will disperse itself through the veins

2510
02:26:15.370 --> 02:26:17.570
That the life-weary taker may fall dead.

2511
02:26:17.570 --> 02:26:20.530
Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law

2512
02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:22.830
Is death to any he that utters them.

2513
02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:24.700
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,

2514
02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:27.800
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,

2515
02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:30.470
Need and oppression starveth in thy eyes,

2516
02:26:30.470 --> 02:26:32.400
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;

2517
02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:34.200
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;

2518
02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:35.700
The world affords no law to make thee rich;

2519
02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:37.800
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

2520
02:26:39.730 --> 02:26:43.230
My poverty, but not my will, consents.

2521
02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:48.070
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

2522
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:50.730
Put this in any liquid thing you will,

2523
02:26:50.730 --> 02:26:52.300
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength

2524
02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:57.300
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

2525
02:26:57.300 --> 02:27:02.930
There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,

2526
02:27:02.930 --> 02:27:05.270
Doing more murder in this loathsome world,

2527
02:27:05.270 --> 02:27:08.130
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.

2528
02:27:08.130 --> 02:27:12.630
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.

2529
02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:24.330
Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

2530
02:27:24.330 --> 02:27:26.970
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?

2531
02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:29.730
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

2532
02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:36.530
Going to find a bare-foot brother out

2533
02:27:36.530 --> 02:27:38.730
One of our order, to associate me,

2534
02:27:38.730 --> 02:27:42.270
Here in this city visiting the sick,

2535
02:27:42.270 --> 02:27:45.800
And finding him, the searchers of the town,

2536
02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:48.100
Suspecting that we both were in a house

2537
02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:49.970
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,

2538
02:27:49.970 --> 02:27:53.600
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;

2539
02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:55.470
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

2540
02:27:55.470 --> 02:27:57.230
Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

2541
02:27:57.230 --> 02:27:58.670
I could not send it-- here it is again--

2542
02:27:58.670 --> 02:28:00.930
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,

2543
02:28:00.930 --> 02:28:03.830
So fearful were they of the infection.

2544
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:07.570
Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,

2545
02:28:07.570 --> 02:28:09.530
The letter was not nice but full of charge

2546
02:28:09.530 --> 02:28:12.400
Of dear import, and the neglecting it

2547
02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:14.470
May do much danger.

2548
02:28:14.470 --> 02:28:16.230
Friar John, go hence;

2549
02:28:16.230 --> 02:28:18.500
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight

2550
02:28:18.500 --> 02:28:19.700
Unto my cell.

2551
02:28:19.700 --> 02:28:23.730
Brother-- I'll go and bring it thee.

2552
02:28:23.730 --> 02:28:26.270
Now must I to the monument alone;

2553
02:28:26.270 --> 02:28:30.070
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake:

2554
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:32.130
She will beshrew me much that Romeo

2555
02:28:32.130 --> 02:28:34.570
Hath had no notice of these accidents;

2556
02:28:34.570 --> 02:28:37.100
But I will write again to Mantua,

2557
02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:41.100
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;

2558
02:28:43.170 --> 02:28:48.870
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

2559
02:29:04.230 --> 02:29:09.300
Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof.

2560
02:29:22.800 --> 02:29:27.830
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew--

2561
02:29:27.830 --> 02:29:33.270
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones--

2562
02:29:33.270 --> 02:29:36.600
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,

2563
02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:40.770
Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:

2564
02:29:40.770 --> 02:29:43.730
The obsequies that I for thee will keep

2565
02:29:43.730 --> 02:29:49.730
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

2566
02:29:52.800 --> 02:29:55.930
The boy gives warning; something doth approach.

2567
02:29:55.930 --> 02:29:58.070
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,

2568
02:29:58.070 --> 02:30:01.100
To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?

2569
02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:05.600
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

2570
02:30:16.270 --> 02:30:17.270
Give me the light:

2571
02:30:22.370 --> 02:30:24.230
upon thy life, I charge thee,

2572
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:27.870
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,

2573
02:30:27.870 --> 02:30:31.370
And do not interrupt me in my course.

2574
02:30:31.370 --> 02:30:34.030
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry

2575
02:30:34.030 --> 02:30:36.330
In what I further shall intend to do,

2576
02:30:36.330 --> 02:30:39.230
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint

2577
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:42.970
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:

2578
02:30:42.970 --> 02:30:47.030
The time and my intents are savage-wild,

2579
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:49.300
More fierce and more inexorable far

2580
02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:52.570
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

2581
02:30:52.570 --> 02:30:55.400
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

2582
02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:58.400
Take thou that:

2583
02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:02.130
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

2584
02:31:10.600 --> 02:31:14.170
For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:

2585
02:31:14.170 --> 02:31:18.100
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

2586
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:30.400
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,

2587
02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:34.570
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,

2588
02:31:34.570 --> 02:31:38.170
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,

2589
02:31:38.170 --> 02:31:43.200
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

2590
02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:48.400
This is that banish'd haughty Montague,

2591
02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:51.170
That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,

2592
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:53.130
It is supposed, the fair creature died;

2593
02:31:53.130 --> 02:31:55.700
And now is come to do some villanous shame

2594
02:31:55.700 --> 02:31:59.330
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.

2595
02:32:01.370 --> 02:32:04.470
Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!

2596
02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:07.470
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?

2597
02:32:07.470 --> 02:32:10.300
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:

2598
02:32:10.300 --> 02:32:12.370
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

2599
02:32:12.370 --> 02:32:15.930
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.

2600
02:32:15.930 --> 02:32:21.100
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;

2601
02:32:21.100 --> 02:32:22.770
Put not another sin upon my head,

2602
02:32:22.770 --> 02:32:27.230
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!

2603
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:30.000
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;

2604
02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:33.130
For I come hither arm'd against myself:

2605
02:32:33.130 --> 02:32:37.700
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,

2606
02:32:37.700 --> 02:32:40.470
A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

2607
02:32:42.670 --> 02:32:44.630
I do defy thy conjuration,

2608
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:46.630
And apprehend thee for a felon here.

2609
02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:48.330
Wilt thou provoke me?

2610
02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:54.470
then have at thee, boy!

2611
02:33:01.470 --> 02:33:04.900
O, I am slain!

2612
02:33:04.900 --> 02:33:06.500
If thou be merciful,

2613
02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:10.130
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

2614
02:33:13.370 --> 02:33:15.930
Let me peruse this face.

2615
02:33:21.200 --> 02:33:25.570
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!

2616
02:33:25.570 --> 02:33:28.170
What said my man, when my betossed soul

2617
02:33:28.170 --> 02:33:30.670
Did not attend him as we rode?

2618
02:33:30.670 --> 02:33:33.630
I think he said Paris should have married Juliet:

2619
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:36.070
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?

2620
02:33:36.070 --> 02:33:37.570
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,

2621
02:33:37.570 --> 02:33:40.800
To think it was so?

2622
02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:47.300
Give me thy hand,

2623
02:33:47.300 --> 02:33:51.200
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!

2624
02:33:51.200 --> 02:33:55.430
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.

2625
02:33:57.700 --> 02:34:00.230
I will go call the watch.

2626
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:04.570
A grave?

2627
02:34:08.170 --> 02:34:13.130
Oh, no, a lantern, slaughter'd youth,

2628
02:34:13.130 --> 02:34:17.470
for here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes

2629
02:34:17.470 --> 02:34:21.630
This vault a feasting presence full of light.

2630
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:27.770
O my love!

2631
02:34:32.530 --> 02:34:33.900
my wife!

2632
02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:39.330
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,

2633
02:34:39.330 --> 02:34:44.070
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:

2634
02:34:44.070 --> 02:34:49.100
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet

2635
02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:52.370
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,

2636
02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:55.200
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

2637
02:35:04.470 --> 02:35:12.800
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?

2638
02:35:15.830 --> 02:35:17.630
O, what more favour can I do to thee,

2639
02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:20.030
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain

2640
02:35:20.030 --> 02:35:24.470
To sunder his that was thine enemy?

2641
02:35:24.470 --> 02:35:26.830
Forgive me, cousin!

2642
02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:38.170
Ah, dear Juliet,

2643
02:35:38.170 --> 02:35:43.730
Why art thou yet so fair?

2644
02:35:43.730 --> 02:35:45.030
shall I believe

2645
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:47.330
That unsubstantial death is amorous,

2646
02:35:47.330 --> 02:35:49.730
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps

2647
02:35:49.730 --> 02:35:53.330
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?

2648
02:35:53.330 --> 02:35:57.300
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;

2649
02:35:57.300 --> 02:36:02.570
And never from this palace of dim night depart.

2650
02:36:02.570 --> 02:36:07.500
Here, here will I stay

2651
02:36:07.500 --> 02:36:12.570
With worms that are thy chamber-maids.

2652
02:36:12.570 --> 02:36:15.230
Here will I set up my everlasting rest,

2653
02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:17.770
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars

2654
02:36:17.770 --> 02:36:20.270
From this world-wearied flesh.

2655
02:36:24.470 --> 02:36:29.170
Eyes, look your last!

2656
02:36:29.170 --> 02:36:33.130
Arms, take your last embrace!

2657
02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:39.730
and, lips, O you

2658
02:36:39.730 --> 02:36:43.570
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss

2659
02:36:43.570 --> 02:36:46.470
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!

2660
02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:58.400
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!

2661
02:37:02.130 --> 02:37:03.930
Here's to my love!

2662
02:37:20.370 --> 02:37:26.030
Thus with a kiss...

2663
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:28.200
I die.

2664
02:37:31.330 --> 02:37:33.700
Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night

2665
02:37:33.700 --> 02:37:36.000
Have my old feet stumbled at graves!

2666
02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:37.370
Who's there?

2667
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:39.970
Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

2668
02:37:39.970 --> 02:37:41.170
Bliss be upon you!

2669
02:37:41.170 --> 02:37:42.470
Tell me, good my friend,

2670
02:37:42.470 --> 02:37:44.630
What torch is yond, that vainly lends its light

2671
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:47.770
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,

2672
02:37:47.770 --> 02:37:49.500
It burneth in the Capel's monument.

2673
02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:52.400
It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,

2674
02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:53.700
One that you love.

2675
02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:54.830
Who is it?

2676
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:56.230
Romeo.

2677
02:37:56.230 --> 02:37:58.330
How long hath he been there?

2678
02:37:58.330 --> 02:38:00.170
Full half an hour.

2679
02:38:00.170 --> 02:38:01.530
Go with me to the vault.

2680
02:38:01.530 --> 02:38:03.030
I dare not, sir.

2681
02:38:03.030 --> 02:38:04.530
My master knows not but I am gone hence;

2682
02:38:04.530 --> 02:38:06.030
And fearfully did menace me with death,

2683
02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:07.570
If I did stay to look on his intents.

2684
02:38:07.570 --> 02:38:09.400
Stay, then; I'll go alone.

2685
02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:11.730
Fear comes upon me:

2686
02:38:11.730 --> 02:38:17.370
O, much I fear some ill unthrifted thing.

2687
02:38:17.370 --> 02:38:21.230
Alack, alack, what blood is this, that stains

2688
02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:24.300
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?

2689
02:38:24.300 --> 02:38:27.070
What mean these masterless and gory swords

2690
02:38:27.070 --> 02:38:31.230
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?

2691
02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:36.570
Romeo!

2692
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:44.770
O, pale!

2693
02:38:44.770 --> 02:38:49.730
Who else? what, Paris too?

2694
02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:51.530
And steep'd in blood?

2695
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:53.130
Oh, what an unkind hour

2696
02:38:53.130 --> 02:38:56.030
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!

2697
02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:58.870
The lady stirs.

2698
02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:08.500
O comfortable friar! where is my lord?

2699
02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:10.800
I do remember well where I should be,

2700
02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:12.800
And there I am.

2701
02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:14.770
Where is my Romeo?

2702
02:39:14.770 --> 02:39:17.070
I hear some noise.

2703
02:39:17.070 --> 02:39:18.200
Lady, come from that nest

2704
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:20.970
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:

2705
02:39:20.970 --> 02:39:23.630
A greater power than we can contradict

2706
02:39:23.630 --> 02:39:26.030
Hath thwarted our intents.

2707
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:27.670
Come, come away.

2708
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:31.400
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;

2709
02:39:33.070 --> 02:39:35.300
And Paris too.

2710
02:39:35.300 --> 02:39:36.930
Come, I'll dispose of thee

2711
02:39:36.930 --> 02:39:38.530
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:

2712
02:39:38.530 --> 02:39:42.170
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;

2713
02:39:42.170 --> 02:39:47.170
Come, go, good Juliet.

2714
02:39:47.170 --> 02:39:50.330
I dare no longer stay.

2715
02:39:50.330 --> 02:39:55.400
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

2716
02:39:57.270 --> 02:40:03.970
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?

2717
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:10.700
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:

2718
02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:17.970
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop

2719
02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:20.700
To help me after?

2720
02:40:20.700 --> 02:40:23.730
I will kiss thy lips;

2721
02:40:23.730 --> 02:40:27.130
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,

2722
02:40:27.130 --> 02:40:29.270
To make die with a restorative.

2723
02:40:34.430 --> 02:40:36.070
Thy lips are warm.

2724
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:41.230
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

2725
02:40:41.230 --> 02:40:44.130
Yea, noise.

2726
02:40:44.130 --> 02:40:46.330
Then I'll be brief.

2727
02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:52.670
O, happy dagger,

2728
02:40:52.670 --> 02:40:55.970
this is thy sheath.

2729
02:40:55.970 --> 02:40:59.900
There rust, and let me die.

2730
02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:14.870
The ground is bloody;

2731
02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:18.770
search about the churchyard:

2732
02:41:18.770 --> 02:41:22.870
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.

2733
02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:27.100
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

2734
02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:32.130
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

2735
02:41:36.030 --> 02:41:38.000
What misadventure is so early up,

2736
02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.630
That calls our person from our morning rest?

2737
02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:51.870
What should it be, that is so shrieked abroad?

2738
02:41:51.870 --> 02:41:54.630
The people in the streets cry Romeo,

2739
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:56.400
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,

2740
02:41:56.400 --> 02:41:58.670
With open outcry toward our monument.

2741
02:42:04.170 --> 02:42:07.670
What fear is this that startles in our ears?

2742
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:13.030
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;

2743
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:17.300
Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,

2744
02:42:17.300 --> 02:42:19.030
Warm and new kill'd.

2745
02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:26.930
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,

2746
02:42:26.930 --> 02:42:29.570
Till we can clear these ambiguities.

2747
02:42:29.570 --> 02:42:34.670
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

2748
02:42:34.670 --> 02:42:36.530
Where are the parties of suspicion?

2749
02:42:36.530 --> 02:42:40.930
I am the greatest, able to do least.

2750
02:42:40.930 --> 02:42:43.730
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge

2751
02:42:43.730 --> 02:42:47.000
Myself condemned and myself excused.

2752
02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.230
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

2753
02:42:50.230 --> 02:42:55.030
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet.

2754
02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:03.200
O heavens, O wife,

2755
02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:05.300
Look how our daughter bleeds.

2756
02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:08.370
This dagger is mista'en-- for, lo, his house

2757
02:43:08.370 --> 02:43:09.870
Is empty on the back of Montague--

2758
02:43:09.870 --> 02:43:12.330
and it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

2759
02:43:12.330 --> 02:43:18.530
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,

2760
02:43:18.530 --> 02:43:22.970
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

2761
02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:28.070
Come, Montague; for thou art early up

2762
02:43:28.070 --> 02:43:31.870
To see thy son and heir more early down.

2763
02:43:31.870 --> 02:43:37.030
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;

2764
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:40.870
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.

2765
02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:43.770
What further woe conspires against my age?

2766
02:43:45.230 --> 02:43:48.570
Look, and thou shalt see.

2767
02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:16.030
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?

2768
02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:18.500
To press before thy father to a grave?

2769
02:44:24.170 --> 02:44:29.170
Where be these enemies?

2770
02:44:29.170 --> 02:44:30.470
Capulet?

2771
02:44:31.930 --> 02:44:33.800
Montague.

2772
02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:37.570
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,

2773
02:44:37.570 --> 02:44:42.570
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.

2774
02:44:42.570 --> 02:44:45.070
And I for winking at your discords too

2775
02:44:45.070 --> 02:44:48.730
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

2776
02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:55.270
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:

2777
02:44:55.270 --> 02:44:59.800
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more

2778
02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:01.600
Can I demand.

2779
02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:03.170
But I can give thee more:

2780
02:45:03.170 --> 02:45:07.700
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;

2781
02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:10.600
That whilst Verona by that name is known,

2782
02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:13.530
There shall no figure at such rate be set

2783
02:45:13.530 --> 02:45:15.930
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

2784
02:45:15.930 --> 02:45:20.770
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;

2785
02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:23.430
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

2786
02:45:23.430 --> 02:45:28.100
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;

2787
02:45:28.100 --> 02:45:32.370
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:

2788
02:45:32.370 --> 02:45:36.970
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;

2789
02:45:36.970 --> 02:45:41.470
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:

2790
02:45:41.470 --> 02:45:43.930
For never was a story of more woe

2791
02:45:43.930 --> 02:45:47.830
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

2792
02:48:00.230 --> 02:48:03.230
