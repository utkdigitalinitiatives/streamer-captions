00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
CLIMATE CHANGE...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
THE OZONE HOLE...

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
DESERTIFICATION...

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
OVERPOPULATION...

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
POLLUTION.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY IS
THE FIELD OF SCIENCE THAT

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
INVOLVES THE STUDY OF THE
GEOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
INCLUDING THE LITHOSPHERE
- THE SOLID PLANET;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
THE HYDROSPHERE
- ALL THE WATER;

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
THE ATMOSPHERE - THE
PLANET'S ENVELOPE OF AIR;

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
AND THE BIOSPHERE - ALL
THE LIFE ON THE PLANET.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
AND THIS FIELD EXPLORES
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
THESE SPHERES AND THE
IMPACT THAT HUMANS HAVE

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
ON OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I THINK THAT WE FORGET
SOMETIMES HOW MUCH OF

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
AN IMPACT WE HAVE
ON THE ENVIRONMENT

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
BECAUSE WE ARE USED TO
THINKING OF THE ENVIRONMENT

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
AS THIS HUGE
THING, YOU KNOW?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
WE THINK "ENVIRONMENT", WE
THINK "OH, TREES, FORESTS",

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
YOU KNOW? YOU DON'T REALLY
PLACE YOURSELF IN THAT.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
YOU DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND
HOW WHAT YOU CONSUME,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
THE PRODUCTS OF
YOUR CONSUMPTION,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
WHERE DO THEY END UP,
WHERE DO THEY GO?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
WE JUST KIND OF PUT OUR
THINGS IN A TRASH CAN

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
AND DON'T HAVE TO
DEAL WITH IT ANYMORE.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
THE RESULT IS THAT WE OVER
USE AND WE OVER CONSUME

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
AND WE PRODUCE
A LOT OF WASTE.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
THE EARTH IS BECOMING
MORE AND MORE POPULATED

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
SO THERE'S MORE DEMAND
ON THE RESOURCES.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
YEAH, I MEAN, ALL THE
RESOURCES WE UTILIZE

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
AS A SPECIES COMES
FROM PLANET EARTH.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
WE DON'T, YOU KNOW,
MINE ASTEROIDS;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
WE DON'T GO TO JUPITER FOR
OUR HYDROGEN AND HELIUM.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
EVERYTHING WE GET, WE GET
FROM THE CRUST OF THE EARTH.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
ALL THE MINIMAL RESOURCES
THAT WE USE FOR METALS

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
AND THE STEEL IN BUILDINGS,
THE GLASS WE HAVE

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
IN SKY SCRAPERS, THIS
COMES FROM SILICA SAND.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
EVEN THE MOST HIGH
TECH PLASTIC, YOU KNOW,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
COMPUTER PART OR TOY OR
WHAT HAVE YOU, THESE ARE

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
RAW MATERIALS THAT WE
HAVE TO SURVEY, WE HAVE TO

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
IDENTIFY, AND WE HAVE
TO RESPONSIBLY EXPLOIT

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
FROM THE EARTH IN
ORDER TO MAINTAIN

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
THE TYPE OF CIVILIZATION
WE HAVE TODAY.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
OUR FAST-PACED,
TECHNOLOGICAL,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
CONSUMER-BASED AND EVER
GROWING CIVILIZATION RELIES

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
HEAVILY ON THE NATURAL
RESOURCES FROM THE EARTH.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
AND AS THE POPULATION
GROWS, THE DEMAND GROWS,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
AND AS A RESULT
WE ARE IN DANGER

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
OF DEPLETING THESE
NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
HUMAN ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO
HAVING TREMENDOUS IMPACTS

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
ON THE OCEANS, ON THE SOILS
OF THE EARTH, ON ITS FORESTS.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
WE'RE CUTTING DOWN
TREES; THE OCEAN IS THE

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
CLASSIC EXAMPLE, WE'RE JUST
OVER FISHING THE OCEAN.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
THE NEED FOR FOOD,
ENERGY AND MATERIALS

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
IS GROWING AT AN
ASTOUNDING RATE.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
AND WHILE WE ARE DEPLETING
THE EARTH'S RESOURCES,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
WE ARE ALSO
ADDING POLLUTANTS.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
THE FUELS FOR CARS AND
INDUSTRIES IS POLLUTING

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
OUR AIR WITH
SMOG AND ACID RAIN,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
AND MANY OF THE
MATERIALS WE USE

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
END UP AS WASTE,
FILLING UP LANDFILLS.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
WE ARE POLLUTING THE
OCEANS WITH GAS AND OIL,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
CONTAMINATING OUR FRESH
WATER WITH PESTICIDES

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
AND SEWAGE... AND THE
LIST IS GROWING.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
HUMAN ACTIVITIES ARE
HAVING THESE KINDS OF

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
IMPACTS ON THE EARTH.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'M NOT SAYING ALL
ACTIVITIES ARE BAD,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
BUT MANY OF THEM ARE
BEGINNING TO HAVE

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
PROFOUND INFLUENCES
ON THE EARTH'S SURFACE.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE
ENJOYING THE SCENIC WONDERS

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
OF OUR WORLD THROUGH
TOURISM AND RECREATION.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
WHILE THIS CAN HAVE GREAT
ECONOMIC VALUE FOR THE

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
REGION, AND BE FUN AND
EDUCATIONAL FOR THE

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
VISITORS, THESE SITES CAN
SUFFER FROM OVEREXPOSURE.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
CARLSBAD CAVERNS NATIONAL
PARK IN NEW MEXICO

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
PRESERVES MORE THAN
100 KNOWN CAVES

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
IN A PERMIAN-AGE
FOSSIL REEF.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
ALTHOUGH THE CAVES ARE A
DELICATE RESOURCE, THEY

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
ARE A CONTINUAL SOURCE OF
EXPLORATION AND DISCOVERY

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
FOR MORE THAN 500,000
VISITORS A YEAR.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
ALL PARKS ESSENTIALLY
ARE BALANCING VISITATION

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
VERSUS PROTECTING
THE RESOURCE.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE,
YOU KNOW, THE VISITORS

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
HAVE HAD AN IMPACT ON
CARLSBAD CAVERN....

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
ALSO JUST THE
DEVELOPMENT ITSELF.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
PUTTING IN PAVED TRAILS,
YOU HAD TO MOVE ROCKS.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
YOU CHANGED EVEN HOW ANIMALS
MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE CAVE

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE
A VERY FAST PATHWAY,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
ESSENTIALLY THIS
NICE WIDE HIGHWAY

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
THAT THEY CAN GO
UP AND DOWN WITH.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
BUT ANOTHER ASPECT OF
THE PARK IS, BY ALLOWING

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
PEOPLE TO EXPERIENCE THE
RESOURCE, IT GIVES PEOPLE

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
A MUCH BETTER APPRECIATION
OF NOT JUST CARLSBAD CAVERN

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
BUT CAVES IN GENERAL AND
REALLY HELPS US A LOT

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
TO PROTECT OTHER CAVES.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER
CAVES IN THE PARK THAT ARE

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC
AND HAVING CARLSBAD OPEN

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
GIVES US A CHANCE TO
EXPLAIN WHY CAVES LIKE THAT

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
AREN'T OPEN, YOU KNOW,
LOOKING AT THE IMPACTS

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
THAT PEOPLE HAVE
ON THE RESOURCES.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
BUT WITHOUT EDUCATING
THE PEOPLE ON IT,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
THEY WOULD NEVER
SUPPORT US IN

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
PROTECTING
OTHER RESOURCES.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
PROTECTING OUR NATIONAL
FORESTS, PRESERVES,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
AND WILD LANDS IS VITAL,
SO TREADING LIGHTLY IS

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
IMPORTANT IN SUSTAINING
THESE RESOURCES FOR WILDLIFE,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
AND THE ENJOYMENT OF PRESENT
AND FUTURE GENERATIONS.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
AIR POLLUTION...

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
WATER POLLUTION...

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
THE LOSS OF WETLANDS
AND RAIN FORESTS

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
ARE ALL CONCERNS FOR
EARTH SCIENTISTS

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
AND ALL OF
US ON EARTH,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
BUT SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS
IS NOT A SIMPLE ONE.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
PEOPLE USED TO FOCUS
ON ONE LITTLE TOPIC

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
AND NOW WE REALIZE THAT
THERE'S SO MANY INFLUENCES

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THAT YOU CAN'T JUST
FOCUS ON ONE THING.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT
THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
THE IMPORTANT THING
TO NOTE ABOUT EACH OF

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
THESE SYSTEMS IS THEY
ALL WORK TOGETHER.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
NO ONE SYSTEM
WORKS IN ISOLATION.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
THE IMPORTANT THING TO
REALIZE IS THAT IF YOU

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
AFFECT ONE SYSTEM, YOU IN
TURN AFFECT ALL OTHERS.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
YOU CAN'T POLLUTE THE
ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT IN TURN

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
AFFECTING THE OCEANS
AND AFFECTING LIFE AND

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
EVENTUALLY AFFECTING
THE LITHOSPHERE.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
HUMAN BEINGS NOW, BECAUSE
OF THE TECHNOLOGY

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
WE POSSESS, ARE ABLE TO
LITERALLY TRANSFORM

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
ENORMOUS AREAS.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
OFTEN IT'S THE CASE
THAT WHEN YOU DO THIS,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
YOU DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
OF THESE KINDS OF
CHANGES MIGHT BE.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
WHILE BUILDING HOUSES
AND CITIES IS NECESSARY

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
AND CAN IMPROVE OUR
LIFESTYLES, MUCH WASTE

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
CAN BE ASSOCIATED
WITH CONSTRUCTION,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
INCLUDING UNUSED AND
EXCESS MATERIALS.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
LARGER CITIES CAN ALSO
AFFECT THE SOUND QUALITY...

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
THE AIR QUALITY...

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
AND THE WATER SUPPLY.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
AS CITIES GET
BIGGER AND BIGGER,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
OBVIOUSLY MOST PEOPLE
DON'T GET THEIR WATER

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
FROM LOTS OF
RIVERS AND THINGS.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
YOU LOOK AT PLACES
LIKE PHOENIX WHERE

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
THERE'S ESSENTIALLY
NO SURFACE WATER

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
AND ALMOST ALL
THOSE PLACES ARE,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
YOU KNOW, PUMPING WATER
OUT OF THE GROUND,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
WHICH IS A MAJOR ISSUE AS
OUR POPULATION GETS BIGGER

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
BECAUSE THE
AVAILABILITY OF CLEAN,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
FRESH WATER IS
ACTUALLY GOING DOWN.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
WE'RE REALLY
OUTSTRIPPING OUR SUPPLY.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
LANDSCAPING AND FARMING
CAN ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
ON THE WATER SUPPLY.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
WE ACTUALLY WASTE
A LOT OF WATER -

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
EVERYBODY WANTING TO HAVE
NICE, LUSH BLUEGRASS LAWNS,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
WHICH ARE FINE IF YOU
ACTUALLY LIVE IN KENTUCKY

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
AND IT RAINS ENOUGH.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A PLACE
LIKE DENVER OR SOME PLACE

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
THAT'S ACTUALLY A
DESERT, YOU JUST DON'T

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO
SUPPORT THAT NATURALLY.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
SO WE'RE REPLACING THESE
LUSH LAWNS WITH EITHER

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
NATIVE GRASSES THAT
ARE ACTUALLY BETTER AT

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
SURVIVING UNDER MORE
DROUGHT CONDITIONS

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
OR, EVEN BETTER,
DOING XERISCAPING

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
USING ALL NATIVE PLANTS
AS A WAY TO CONSERVE,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
YOU KNOW, SPREADING
OUT WATER.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
WATER POLLUTION IS
ALSO A MAJOR CONCERN.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
THE WATER USED IN
FARMING AND AGRICULTURE

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
CAN HAVE SERIOUS AND LONG
LASTING CONSEQUENCES.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WATER
IS SUPPLIED TO FARM LAND

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
IT'S ACTUALLY PICKING UP
THINGS LIKE FERTILIZER

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
AND HERBICIDES AND THINGS
LIKE THAT WHICH ARE HARD TO

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
GET BACK OUT OF THE WATER,
SO IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
LET IT EVAPORATE AND IT
RE-ENTERS THE WHOLE SYSTEM

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
AND IS CLEANED UP.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
CONTAMINATED WATER RE-ENTERS
THE SYSTEM IN OUR RIVERS

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
AND STREAMS, AFFECTING
LIFE IN THE WATER,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
AND SOMETIMES
THE WATER WE DRINK.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
CITY SEWAGE AND INDUSTRIAL
WASTE DISCHARGED INTO THE

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
RIVERS ARE MAJOR CULPRITS
OF WATER POLLUTION.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
THE EFFECTS OF WATER
POLLUTION ARE NOT ONLY

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
DEVASTATING TO PEOPLE, BUT
ALSO TO ANIMALS, FISH,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
AND BIRDS.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL
ISSUE THAT INVOLVES

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
BALANCING THE GROWING NEED
FOR NATURAL RESOURCES WITH

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
DEPLETION AND POLLUTION
IS DEFORESTATION.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
DEFORESTATION IS THE
PERMANENT DESTRUCTION OF

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
OUR INDIGENOUS FORESTS AND
WOODLANDS, AND ONE OF THE

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
MAJOR CONCERNS IS THE RATE
AT WHICH DEFORESTATION IS

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE
WORLD LARGELY DUE TO THE

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
GROWING NEEDS FOR FARMING,
RANCHING AND MINING.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
THERE ARE MANY
TYPES OF FORESTS:

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
TEMPERATE FORESTS

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
RAINFORESTS

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
MANGROVE SWAMPS

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
AND THEY ALL HAVE MANY
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
THEY PROVIDE HABITAT FOR
MANY IMPORTANT SPECIES,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
HELP REPLENISH
NUTRIENTS IN THE LAND,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
PROVIDE US IMPORTANT TIMBER
AND WOOD BASED PRODUCTS,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
HELP PREVENT EROSION
AND LANDSLIDES,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
AND THEY PRODUCE OXYGEN
WHILE TRAPPING CARBON

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
AND OTHER POLLUTANTS
IN THE AIR.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT
80% OF THE WORLD'S

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
ORIGINAL FOREST HAS BEEN
CLEARED OR DEGRADED.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
AND WHILE NEW AWARENESS
IS BEGINNING TO PROTECT

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
MANY FORESTS, IRRESPONSIBLE
CLEAR CUTTING CONTINUES

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
AT AN ALARMING RATE.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
BY REMOVING THE FOREST
THROUGH CLEAR CUTTING

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
YOU BEGIN TO DRAMATICALLY
CHANGE THOSE SLOPES.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
YOU DRAMATICALLY CHANGE
THE RESPONSE TO RAINFALL,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
TO EROSION, YOU BEGIN TO
STRIP SOME OF THE SOILS.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
SOILS TAKE THOUSANDS
TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OR

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
YEARS TO FORM SO IF YOU

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
REMOVE THEM BY STRIPPING
AN AREA OF ITS VEGETATION,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
ENHANCING EROSION, THIS IS
NOT A SYSTEM - THAT IS,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
A SOIL - THAT'S GOING TO
COME BACK VERY QUICKLY

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
EVEN IF YOU WERE TO ALLOW
THE FORESTS TO GROW AGAIN

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
BECAUSE SOILS TAKE
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
OF YEARS TO FORM.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
WITHOUT THE NUTRIENT-RICH
SOIL AND TREES,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
THE BALANCE OF THIS
ECOSYSTEM IS DISRUPTED.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
IF THE REGION CANNOT
HOLD AS MUCH WATER,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
MANY OF THE PLANTS
AND ANIMALS THAT

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
DEPEND ON THE FOREST
CAN GO EXTINCT.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
NORMAL "GIVE AND TAKE"
CYCLES THAT YOU HAVE

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
IN FORESTED AREAS
WHERE THERE'S PLANTS

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
THAT ARE TAKING
NUTRIENTS BUT

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
THEY'RE ALSO GIVING
NUTRIENTS BACK.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
IN THESE AREAS THERE'S
NO PLANTS AND THERE'S

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
NO WATER SO THE CYCLE
CAN'T TAKE PLACE AND

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
EVENTUALLY IT'S JUST
UNABLE TO SUPPORT LIFE

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
AND IT BECOMES THIS
DRY AND BARREN PLACE.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
RAINFORESTS CURRENTLY
PROVIDE SOURCES FOR

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
ONE-FOURTH OF TODAY'S
MEDICINES, AND THEY ALSO

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
CONTAIN IMMENSE
UNDISCOVERED RESOURCES

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
THAT MAY HOLD THE KEY TO
UNLOCKING FUTURE CURES.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
HOWEVER, IT IS ESTIMATED
THAT NEARLY HALF OF

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
THE WORLD'S SPECIES
OF PLANTS, ANIMALS,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
AND MICROORGANISMS WILL
BE DESTROYED OR SEVERELY

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
THREATENED OVER THE
NEXT QUARTER-CENTURY

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
DUE TO RAINFOREST
DEFORESTATION.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
WE KNOW THAT, FOR EXAMPLE,
MANY, MANY SPECIES

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
ARE BECOMING EXTINCT SO
RAPIDLY THAT WE MAY BE

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
LOOKING AT ONE OF THE
GREATEST WAVES IN THE

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
EXTINCTION OF LIFE, OR
AT LEAST MANY SPECIES

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
IN THE LAST 25, PERHAPS
50 MILLION YEARS.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
THAT'S 50,000
SPECIES A YEAR.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
ANOTHER MAJOR RESULT
OF DEFORESTATION IS IN

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
THE DISRUPTION OF
THE CARBON CYCLE.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
WITH FEWER TREES,
LESS CO2 IS ABSORBED

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
AND, IN FACT, WHEN
THEY ARE BURNED OR ROT,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
CARBON DIOXIDE IS RELEASED
BACK INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
THE FOCUS REALLY IS
NOW ON CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
PEOPLE LOOKING AT THAT.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
GLOBAL WARMING IS WITHOUT
DOUBT THE MOST SERIOUS

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL
CONCERN THAT WE HAVE TODAY.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
WE HAVE SEEN CHANGES
IN THE CLIMATE IN A

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,
IN A DECADE OR SO,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
IT'S THE TOPIC OF A LOT
OF RESEARCH AND IT'S

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
THE CAUSE FOR ALL THE
DEBATE AND DISCUSSION

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
CLIMATE CHANGE
REPRESENTS A CHANGE

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
IN LONG-TERM
WEATHER PATTERNS.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
THEY CAN BECOME WARMER OR
COLDER; WETTER OR DRIER.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
GLOBAL WARMING REFERS
TO AN AVERAGE INCREASE

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
IN THE EARTH'S
TEMPERATURE,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
WHICH IN TURN CAUSES
CHANGES IN CLIMATE.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
THE EARTH'S SURFACE
TEMPERATURE HAS RISEN

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
BY ABOUT ONE
DEGREE FAHRENHEIT

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
IN THE PAST CENTURY, AND
SCIENTISTS EXPECT IT TO

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
INCREASE AN ADDITIONAL
TWO TO SIX DEGREES

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
OVER THE NEXT
HUNDRED YEARS.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE
CLIMATE IS GETTING WARMER

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
ACROSS MUCH OF THE EARTH.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
OUR TEMPERATURE DATA
ARE PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
TO DETERMINE THAT
THAT'S HAPPENING.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
HOWEVER, WE ALSO KNOW THAT
THE CLIMATE HAS WARMED UP

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
AND COOLED OFF A LOT IN
PREVIOUS GEOLOGICAL PERIODS.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
THE FLUCTUATIONS OF
CLIMATE ARE QUITE DRASTIC

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
AND IT'S ONLY IN THE LAST
100 MILLION YEARS OR SO

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN
QUITE STABLE AND THAT'S

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
PROBABLY WHY HUMANS
HAVE REALLY FLOURISHED,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
AND LIFE IN GENERAL
HAS REALLY FLOURISHED.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT MECHANISMS

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE PLANET
TO GET WARMER AND COOLER

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
AND DIFFERENTIATING
ONE CAUSE FROM ANOTHER

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
AND THERE'S A

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
VERY ACTIVE DEBATE
OVER HOW MUCH OF THAT

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
MAY BE DUE TO THE
ACTIVITIES OF PEOPLE.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
SCIENTISTS ARE NOT EXACTLY
SURE WHY CLIMATES CHANGE,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
PERHAPS PERIODS OF
INCREASED HEAT FROM THE SUN

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
MAY HAVE HELPED MAKE
THE EARTH BECOME WARMER.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
BUT MANY OF THE WORLD'S
LEADING CLIMATOLOGISTS

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
THINK THAT HUMAN
ACTIVITIES HAVE ALTERED

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION
OF THE ATMOSPHERE

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
THROUGH THE BUILDUP
OF GREENHOUSE GASES.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT
IS WHAT REGULATES

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
THE TEMPERATURE
OF OUR PLANET.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
AS THE SUN'S RAYS STRIKE
THE EARTH'S SURFACE,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
HEAT IS RADIATED BACK
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
SOME HEAT ESCAPES INTO
SPACE, BUT THE REMAINING

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
HEAT IS TRAPPED BY
GREENHOUSE GASES

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
SUCH AS METHANE, NITROUS
OXIDE AND CARBON DIOXIDE.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
WITHOUT A NATURAL
GREENHOUSE EFFECT,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH
WOULD BE ABOUT ZERO DEGREES

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
FAHRENHEIT INSTEAD OF
ITS PRESENT 57 DEGREES.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
SO, THE CONCERN IS NOT
WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
A GREENHOUSE EFFECT, BUT
WHETHER HUMAN ACTIVITIES

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
ARE LEADING TO AN ENHANCEMENT
OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
INCREASED AGRICULTURE...

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
DEFORESTATION...

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
LANDFILLS...

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION...

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
AND MINING ALL CONTRIBUTE
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
OF METHANE AND NITROUS
OXIDE, AND ESPECIALLY

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
MOST OF THOSE CARBON
IS LOCKED UP IN THE

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
GEOSPHERE, LIKE 80%,
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
IS THAT WE'RE
MESSING WITH THAT.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
WE'RE TAKING CARBON OUT
AS OIL AND GAS AND WE'RE

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
BURNING IT AND WE'RE PUTTING
IT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
SO WE'RE KIND OF MESSING
WITH THE CARBON CYCLE

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
AND THAT'S WHAT'S
DRIVING GLOBAL WARMING.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
WELL, THE FIRST THING TO
UNDERSTAND IS HOW MUCH CO2

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
WE'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20
AND 50 TRILLION POUNDS

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
OF CO2 A YEAR COME OUT
OF OUR EXHAUST PIPES

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
AND OUR FACTORIES'
CHIMNEYS EVERY YEAR,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
AND THE NUMBER IS
INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
BECAUSE WE ARE CONSUMING
MORE AND MORE FOSSIL FUELS.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
THAT'S A LOT OF CO2,
AND THAT'S ENOUGH CO2,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
WHICH IS A GREENHOUSE
GAS, TO REALLY START

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AFFECTING THE CLIMATE
OF OUR PLANET.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
A FEW DEGREES MAY NOT
SOUND LIKE MUCH, BUT IT

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
COULD CHANGE THE EARTH'S
CLIMATE DRASTICALLY.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE PEAK
OF THE LAST ICE AGE

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
ABOUT 18,000 YEARS AGO, THE
TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
WAS ONLY SEVEN DEGREES
FAHRENHEIT COLDER

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
THAN IT IS TODAY.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
THERE ARE MANY CONSEQUENCES
OF THIS WARMING,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
SUCH AS HEAT WAVES
AND THE MELTING OF

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
THE POLAR ICE CAPS
AND THE GLACIERS.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
BY MELTING THEM, WE'RE
PUTTING MORE WATER

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
INTO THE OCEANS.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
IT'S GOING TO RAISE SEA
LEVEL, THE ANIMALS THAT

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
LIVE ON THE ICE
ARE UNDER THREAT.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
RISING SEA LEVELS CAN
RESULT IN COASTAL FLOODING

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
AND CAN EFFECT THE
LOCATION AND POPULATION

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
OF PLANT AND ANIMAL LIFE
THAT MUST ADAPT OR MOVE

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
TO SURVIVE THE
CHANGING CONDITIONS.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
GLOBAL WARMING CAN ALSO
AFFECT WEATHER PATTERNS.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
WITH MORE
POWERFUL STORMS,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
INCREASED DROUGHTS
AND FIRES,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
POLLUTION AND DISEASES.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
AND THESE ARE JUST A
FEW OF THE POTENTIAL

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS
FROM GLOBAL WARMING

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
COULD BE REALLY QUITE
CATASTROPHIC IN TERMS

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
OF CHANGING COMPLETELY
THE WEATHER PATTERNS

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
AND IF OR HOW
WE DO BUSINESS.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
SO IF YOU HAVE HURRICANES,
SERIOUS HURRICANES,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
REPEATED HURRICANES
EVERY YEAR IN FLORIDA,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
THAT CHANGES THE WAY PEOPLE
DO BUSINESS IN FLORIDA.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
MASSIVE FIRES IN THE WEST
- THAT CAUSES A LOT OF

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
MONETARY DAMAGE AS WELL AS
DAMAGE TO OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
IF A PARTICULAR REGION
IS USED TO GROWING

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
A PARTICULAR CROP AND
SUDDENLY THAT CROP...

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
IT'S TOO DRY OR TOO COLD
OR TOO HOT FOR THAT CROP

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
AND EVERYTHING
HAS TO BE CHANGED,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
THAT'S A BIG COST.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
THESE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES
ARE REALLY SEVERE.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I THINK THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
WE FACE AS A SPECIES

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
IS OVERPOPULATION.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I THINK THAT IF WE KEEP OUR
POPULATION, OR AT LEAST

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
BE COGNIZANT OF OUR
POPULATION IN SUCH A WAY

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
THAT WE WORK IN HARMONY
WITH OUR OWN PLANET;

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
THAT WE DON'T
EXHAUST THE RESOURCES

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
THAT ARE NEEDED TO
SUSTAIN US AS A SPECIES.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
BUT THAT'S GOING TO BE
THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
FOR OUR FUTURE
SURVIVABILITY.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
WE COULD DO TO ALLEVIATE

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
THE STRESS THAT WE PUT
ON THE ENVIRONMENT,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
THE STRESS THAT OUR WASTE
AND OVER USE PRODUCES,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
IS BY EDUCATING
PEOPLE A LITTLE MORE.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO
WOULD NOT CHOOSE TO BUY

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
AN ENERGY EFFICIENT
APPLIANCE IF THEY COULD.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
IT'S JUST THAT THEY
DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
THEY DON'T REALIZE
WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
AND THEY DON'T THINK
THAT THEIR ONE SODA CAN

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
CAN AFFECT A LANDFILL.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
REDUCE, REUSE AND RECYCLE.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
WE HAVE LEARNED THAT WE
NEED TO MAKE SACRIFICES

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
TO SAVE THE PLANET.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
THE SIMPLEST
ONE IS JUST THAT

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THAT BIG CAR YOU'RE
DRIVING, MAYBE YOU'D

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
HAVE TO DRIVE A CAR THAT
HAS BETTER FUEL EFFICIENCY.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
WE HAVE TO BUILD OUR HOMES
WITH BETTER FUEL EFFICIENCY,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
AND WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE
WAY WE'RE GETTING OUR ENERGY

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
FROM THE CONTINUED
USE OF FOSSIL FUELS

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
TO GETTING ENERGY FROM
RENEWABLE RESOURCES

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
SUCH AS FROM WIND POWER,
SOLAR POWER,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
HYDROELECTRIC POWER.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE
POSSIBLE AND THEY'RE

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
THINGS THAT CAN
BE DONE RIGHT NOW.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
IT IS EARTH SCIENTISTS
THAT ARE BEGINNING TO

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
RECOGNIZE SOME OF
THESE CHANGES AND WE'RE

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
BEGINNING TO TRY TO
UNDERSTAND BETTER

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
WHAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE
IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
AND THAT'S WHAT'S
EXCITING, I THINK,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
ABOUT THE EARTH SCIENCES,
THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
IS WE'RE THE ONES OUT
THERE STUDYING THESE AREAS

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
AND TRYING TO FIGURE
OUT JUST EXACTLY

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000
WHAT THOSE
IMPACTS WILL BE.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
IT'S NOT VERY
EASY BECAUSE

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
OFTENTIMES IT'S
VERY COMPLICATED.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
BUT WITH ENOUGH TIME,
EFFORT, AND ENERGY

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
AND ENTHUSIASM, YOU
CAN LEARN A LOT.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
AS WE CONTINUE TO LEARN
AND DEVELOP NEW WAYS

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
TO CONSERVE, WE ALSO
LOOK TOWARD A FUTURE

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
WHEN OUR DEMANDS WILL
NOT TIP THE BALANCE

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
OF OUR DELICATE
PLANET EARTH.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:06.000
*

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:17.000
*

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:25.000
*
