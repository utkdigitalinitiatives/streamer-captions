00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(MUSIC)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
LIFE SEEMS DIFFERENT NOW,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'M ELEVEN YEARS-OLD.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I DATE BAD GIRLS,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
SEVEN INCHES BICEPS,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I GET MAD OVER
STUPID STUFF.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I AM A LADIES MAN.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
LIFE SEEMS DIFFERENT,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(MUSIC)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
HELLO

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.000
HEY

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.000
HEY

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
HEY

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
YOU RECORDING?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
TEEN SPECIES HAS
 SPENT TWO YEARS WATCHING

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
TEENAGERS GROW-UP.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
WE'VE SEEN HUGE EMOTIONAL
 AND PHYSICAL CHANGES.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
(SCREAM)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
WITNESSED BEHAVIOR BAD
 AND GOOD AND EXPLORED THE

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
TRAUMATIC PASSAGE FROM
 CHILD TO ADULT IN FINE

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
SCIENTIFIC DETAIL

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(MUSIC)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
TEENAGERS HAVE TALKED
 TO US WITH UNPARALLELED

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
FRANKNESS AND INTIMACY

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
NO COMMENT.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
TONIGHT WE
 EXAME THE BOYS.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
WE FILMED FIVE VOLUNTEERS
 BETWEEN THE AGES OF ELEVEN

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
AND SIXTEEN.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
THE OLDEST IS JESSIE.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
WHY DO TEENAGE BOYS
 BECOME OBSESSED WITH SEX.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
GIRLS VOICE:
LEAVE ME ALONE.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
IN MY MIND ITS LIKE
GIRLS I CAN'T EVEN CONCENTRATE.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
THE YOUNGEST IS ANDY.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
I'M GOING TO GROW UP

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
MARK'S THIRTEEN BUT
HE DOESN'T LOOK IT .

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
WHY AM I SO SHORT?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
THIS SMALL LITTLE MIDGET.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I CAT GROW.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
WHAT DAMAGE DOES BEING
 THIS SHORT DO TO A TEENAGE

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
BOY.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
NARRATOR: CAN DOMINICK
 STOP HIS VOICE FROM BREAKING

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
AT LEAST FOR A YEAR OR SO.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
JUST SLOW DOWN.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
OR WILL THE EMOTIONAL
 CHANGES OF PUBERTY TRIP

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
HIM UP.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
OH, THAT'S SUCH BULL OX.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
WE GET THE INSIDE STORY
 ON THE TEENAGE CRIME WAVE

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
FROM MATTHEW AND FOR THE
 REAL LOW DOWN ON BOYS WE

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
TURN TO THE EXPERTS.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
THE GIRLS ARE CONSTANTLY
CHECKING OUT THE BOYS.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
BOYS ARE
HORRIBLE BECAUSE,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
BOYS ARE
DISGUSTING, THEY SMELL,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
THEY'LL PICK THEIR
NOSETHEY'LL BRAG,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I THINK THEY'RE JUST
THMALE OF THE SPECIES

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
AND THAT'S JUST
THE WAY THEYRE.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
FIRST WE MEET ANDY.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I AM ANDY WEISENFELD,
I'M ELEVEN YEARS OLD,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I LIVE IN MANHATTAN, I
LOVE THE SIMPSON'S, DOH,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
WHEN I WAS FIRST CHOSEN
FOR THIS SHOW I DIDN'T

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
KNOW HOW MUCH IN MY
LIFE THEY WOULD GET.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
BUT, NOW I UNDERSTAND
HOW IT IS AND I'M LOOKING

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
FORWARD TO IT A LOT.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
IS IT RUNNING?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
DOH

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
ANDY IS JUST BEGINNING
 THE JOURNEY THROUGH

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
ADOLESCENCE.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
IN THE MEANTIME HIS
 INTERESTS ARE PICAL OF

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000
ANY ELEVEN YEAR-OLD BOY.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
COMPUTERS, COMPUTERS,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
BOY, IEALLY LIKE
COMPUTERS, ROCKETRY SCIENCE,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
IN ROCKETRY, UM

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
WE BUILD ROCKETS,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
IT'S CALLED THE
GIANT FLUFFY BUNNY,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
A FRIEND AND I DESIGNED
IT TWO YEARS AGO.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
WE LAUNCHED IT AND
IT WENT UP PERFECTLY,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
THE PARACHUTE EJECTED AND
IT HAD A GREAT LANDING IN

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
A TREE.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'LL ASK THAT EVERY ONE
GETS BEHIND THIS FOR

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
SAFETY REASONS.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
GETTING HURT.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,AUNCH,
3,2,1, LAUNCH, LAUNCH, LAUNCH.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, LAUNCH,
3,2,1, LAUNCH, LAUNCH, LAUNCH.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
IT'S GOING TO WORK
THIS TIME I'M POSITIVE.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
AT ELEVEN LIKE MOST
 MODERN CHILDREN ANDY HAS

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
BEEN WELL BRIEFED ABOUT
 WHAT TO EXPECT FOR

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
PUBERTY.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
WELL, I'LL PROBABLY
GET TALLER, AND HEAVIER,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
MATES START VERY
GRADUALLY AT MY AGE 11.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
OR MAYBE EVEN 13.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
POSSIBLY EVEN 16.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
AT THE GREATEST MAYBE,
A BOY WILL GO THROUGH A

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
GROWTH SPURT AND MAYBE
GET ACNE OR FACIAL HAIR.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
AH, AH

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I KW, ALL
OF THAT HAPPENS.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I HAVE FRIENDS
THAT ARE GIRLS.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
THERE ARE SEVEN GIRLS IN
MY CLASS AND FIVE BOYS

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
INCLUDING MYSELF.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
PHYSICALLY THE GIRLS ARE
MATURING MUCH FASTER THEN

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
THE BOYS.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
IF YOU LOOK AT ANY GROUP
 OF ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS YOU

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
COULD BE FORGIVEN FOR
 THINKING THATHE BOYS ARE

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
YEARS BEHIND IN THE
 RACE TO ADULTHOOD.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
BUT, THEY'RE NOT.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
THEY START PUBERTY ONLY A
 FEW MONTHSFTER GIRLS AND

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
THEY DEVELOP AT
 A SIMILAR SPEED.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
IT'S JUST THAT EARLY
 CHANGES IN FEMALE SHAPES

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
ARE MORE OBVIOUS.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
AT ELEVEN IT'S ALL STARTED
 TO HAPPEN FOR ANDY,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
IT'S JUST THAT THE
 CHANGES ARE OUT OF SIGHT.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
THE CHANGES IN PUBERTY
 IN BOYS AND GIRLS ARE

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
DRIVEN BY THE POWERFUL
 CHEMICALS THAT'S CALLED

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.000
HORMONES.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
DISSOLVED IN THE BLOOD
 THEY'RE INVISIBLE.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
BUT, THEY MAKE
 BEAUTIFUL CRYSTALS.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
IN A BOY THE MOST
 IMPORTANT IS TESTOSTERONE.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
IN THE BLOOD STREAM
 THE CONCENTRATION OF

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
TESTOSTERONE INCREASES
 THROUGH-OUT PUBERTY AS IT

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
DOES SO IT CHANGES
 THE WAY BOYS LOOK,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
THE WAY THEY SOUND,
 EVEN THE WAY THEY THINK.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
BUT THE FIRST THING IT
 DOES IS TO TRIGGER GROWTH

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
IN A VERY PRIVATE PLACE.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I'D RATHER
LEAVE THAT OUT.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
IN BOYS THE EARLIEST
 CHANGE TESTOSTERONE CAUSES

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
IS GROWTH OF
 THE TESTICLES.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
AS THEY GROW THE TEXTURE
 OF THE SKIN BECOMES

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
ROUGHER AND THERE IS A
 WISPY GROWTH OF PUBLIC

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.000
HAIR.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
PUBERTY IN BOYS STARTS
 HAPPENING ANYTIME BETWEEN

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
TEN AND FOURTEEN
 YEARS-OLD.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
OK, COULD YOU
 JUST GET LIMBERED UP.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE
 STARTED BY THE TIME THEY

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
ARE THIRTEEN, BUT NOT ALL.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
THESE BOYS ARE
 ALL THIRTEEN,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
BUT THERE IS A WIDE RANGE
 IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO
 BE LOOKING AT THE STRADDLE

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
VAULT, WHICH I KNOW MOST
 OF YOU HAVE DONE BEFORE.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
WE'LL TAKE IT SLOWLY TO
 START WITH AND WE'LL SEE

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.000
WHAT AREAS WE
 CAN IMPROVE ON.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
FOR THE LITTLE ONE'S THE
 MOST OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE IS

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
HEIGHT.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I FELT LIKE I WAS
LOOKING UP AT SOME

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
SKYSCRAPERS.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I'M STILL SMALL I HAVEN'T
EVEN REALLY GOT FACIAL

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
HAIR ?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
AT THE SIDES A BIT
THERE A LITTLE BIT,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
YOU CAN SEE THE
LITTLE BLACK BITS,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
AND UM I HAVEN'T GOT
ANY HAIRS, PUBIC HAIRS,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
AND UM I HAVEN'T GROWN
OBVIOUSLY AND MY VOICE

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
HASN'T BROKEN.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I'VE JUST STAYED THE
SAME, IT GETS ME CHOKED UP

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
REALLY CAUSE I WANT
TO GROW BUT, I WANT,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I WANT TO GROW.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
"I DON'T WANT TO BE
LITTLE LIKE YOU" HE SAYS.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
ADULT HEIGHT IS MOSTLY
 DETERMINED BY GENES. MARK'S

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
MOTHER MIGHT BE SMALL BUT
 HIS DAD IS 5 FOOT 10,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
1 METER 70, MARK SHOULD
 END UP AT LEAST 1, 65

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
BUT HE HASN'T EVEN
 STARTED GROWING YET,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
DOES IT REALLY MATTER?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
IT DOES TO SOME.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
IT'S A BIT WEIRD, IT
FEELS LIKE A REAL TALL

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
GIRL WITH A SHORT MAN.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
ANNOYING LITTLE GUYS
LIKE THAT DRIVE ME MADE.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I TRIED TO
BEAT ONE UP ONCE.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
BUT HE TRIPPED ME UP.
BECAUSE HE IS SO SMALL.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
MARK IS STILL TRYING TO
 LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
WHEN YOU'RE SMALL YOU
CAN RUN, YOU CAN JUMP,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
YOU CAN FLIP EVEN IF YOU
WANTED TO LAND PERFECTLY

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
WELL DONE.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
TALL PEOPLE
FALL, DOWN THEY GO.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
AND AS THEY SAY, "THE BIGGER
THEY ARE THE HARDER THEY FALL".

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
MUSIC

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
SO WHEN WILL IT
ALL HAPPEN FOR MARK.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
WHEN HE DOES START GROWING
THERE WILL BE ONE SURE

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
SIGN, HIS FEET.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
MUSIC

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
ANDY'S A YEAR YOUNGER
THAN MARK AND TODAY HE'S

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
SHOPPING FOR SHOES, AGAIN.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
EVERY ONCE AND A WHILE
MY MOM WILL GO "ANDY YOUR

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
FEET HAVE GROWN
LONGER AND WIDER."

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
ANDY'S FAST GROWING
 FEET ARE A SIGN THAT HE IS

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
ENTERING A VIGOROUS GROWTH
 SPURT THAT WILL TURN HIM

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
INTO A MAN.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
I'VE FOUND THAT I'VE
GROWN A BIT STRONGER

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
BECAUSE IF MY MOM SO MUCH
AS DARES TO ARM WRESTLE

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
ME, I CAN CRUSH HER.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
ANDY, WAIT UP AND LOOK
AT THE SOME OF THE SHOES.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
ANDY'S LOOKING FOR SHOES
 FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I DON'T THINK THIS
 IS THE RIGHT PLACE.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
OKAY, 7 1/2.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
SHOE SIZE IS
 A GIVE AWAY,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
BECAUSE TEENAGE BODIES ALL
 GROW IN THE SAME WAY FROM

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
THE OUTSIDE IN.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
BE RIGHT BACK.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
FIRST THE FEET AND HANDS
 GROW TO ADULT SIZE.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
SIX MONTHS LATER THE ARMS
 AND LEGS TAKE OFF AND BOYS

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
CAN GROW TEN
 CENTIMETERS IN ONE YEAR.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
THEY LOOK GANGLY AND
 AWKWARD AND GROW OUT OF

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
TROUSERS AT AN
 ALARMING RATE.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
ONLY AT THE END OF THE
 GROWTH SPURT DO THE CHEST

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
AND TORSO CATCH UP.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
BUT, ANDY'S NOT
 QUITE THERE YET.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
HOW DO THEY FEEL ANDY?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
THEY FEEL NICE BUT,
I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.000
THIS ONE.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
LET ME SEE,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
STAND STRAIGHT.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THEY LOOK VERY NICE.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I AGREE.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
THEY REALLY DO.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
DO YOU WANT
TO GET THEM?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
YEAH

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
OK

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
THE NEW SHOES STAYED
 IN PRISTINE CONDITION.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
ANDY ONLY WORE THEM TWICE
 BEFORE THEY WERE TO SMALL.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
ITS THREE O'CLOCK IN
 THE MORNING AND DOMINIC IS

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
HAVING HIS BREAKFAST.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
THIS WEEKS BEEN A
BIT BORING BUT THERE'S

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
SOMETHING REALLY COOL
GOING TO COME UP SOON.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
FIRST OF MAY MORNING..

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
DOMINIC IS TWELVE HE HAS
 ONE SPECIAL TALENT AND ITS

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
UNDER THREAT.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I'M GOING TO GO
TO COLLEGE REALLY, EARLY

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
AT SIX O'CLOCK I'VE
GOT TO GO UP THE TOWER AND

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
THEN SING AND THEN COME
BACK DOWN AND THEY WON'T...

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
SHIT...

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
DOMINIC'S A CHOIR BOY
 WITH ONE OF THE BEST

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
CHOIRS IN ENGLAND.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
ON THE FIRST OF MAY EVERY
 YEAR MORVAN COLLEGE CHOIR

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
SINGS TO THE RISING SUN.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
(CHOIR SINGING)

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS
 DOMINIC HAS PRACTICED

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
SINGING FOR TWENTY
 HOURS EVERY WEEK.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I LIKE SINGING MUSIC THAT
GOES LIKE HIGH AND STUFF.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
(CHOIR SINGING)

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
MY ROLE IS
JUST GENERALLY

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
TO MAKE A
LOT OF NOISE

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
AND ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY
ELSE TO SING REAL LOUD.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I LIKE HOW MY VOICE IS
NOW. I THINK ITS QUITE GOOD.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
HE'S A VERY GOOD
 SINGER HE'S GOT A NICE

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
SHAPE TO THE MOUTH, HE
 OPENS MOUTH WELL AND THE

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
JAW SHAPE IS VERY
 GOOD FOR A SINGER.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
THERE ARE LOTS AND LOTS OF
 GOOD QUALITIES ABOUT IT.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
AS TO EXACTLY WHAT WILL
 HAPPEN TO IT FROM NOW ON

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
IS DIFFICULT TO TELL.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
(CHOIR SINGING)

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
DOMINIC HAS A PURE HIGH
 VOICE, BUT IT WON'T LAST.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
(CHOIR SINGING)

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
BEHIND THE ADAMS APPLE,
 ABOUT FIVE CENTIMETERS

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
DOWN FROM THE BACK OF
 THE TONGUE LIE THE VOCAL

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.000
CORDS.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
AS THE BOY GROWS THE
 MUSCLES STRETCHED ACROSS THE

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
WINDPIPE GROW LONGER
 AND THE VOICE GETS VERY

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
UNRELIABLE AND
 FINALLY DEEPER.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
BEHIND A MAN'S ADAMS APPLE
 LIE VOCAL CORDS HALF AS

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
LONG AGAIN AS A BOYS.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
SO WHEN WILL DOMINIC'S
 VOICE FORCE HIM OUT OF THE

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
CHOIR HE LOVES.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY
 YEARS AGO MOST BOYS STAYED

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
UNTIL THEY WERE WELL OVER
 FOURTEEN YEARS OLD AND

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
SOME UNTIL THEY
 WERE SIXTEEN.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
IN TODAY'S CHOIR MOST ARE
 GONE BY THE TIME THEY'RE

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
FOURTEEN LET
 ALONE SIXTEEN.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
BOY'S VOICES ARE BREAKING
 EARLIER THEN EVER BEFORE

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
BECAUSE PUBERTY'S STARTING
 YOUNGER WITH EACH GENERATION.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
ITS PROBABLY BECAUSE
 TODAY KIDS EAT MORE,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
BUT DOMINIC'S ONLY TWELVE
 AND A HALF AND SHOULD HAVE

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000
SOME TIME YET.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
WHEN DOMINIC'S VOICE DOES
 GO THE OUTCOME WILL BE

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
A LOTTERY, HE MIGHT END UP
 A LOVELY DEEP BASS OR HE

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
MIGHT LOSE HIS SINGING
 VOICE ALTOGETHER.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
NOW, UNFORTUNATELY THE
 SUMMER HOLIDAYS ARE HERE

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
AND TEENAGERS DEVELOP
 FASTER IN THE SUMMER THEN

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
ANY OTHER TIME
 OF THE YEAR.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
DADDY, I NEED MORE MUD,
I'M MAKING THE BIKE JUMP.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
DAMN IT.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
A DIET OF PLAYING,
 SLEEPING AND EATING MAKES

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.000
HIM GROW MORE.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
THAT WAS PERFECT.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
CHIN UP A LITTLE BIT.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
DOMINIC IS NO EXCEPTION.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
ITS SEPTEMBER AND
 HE'S IN HOSPITAL,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
HIS VOCAL CORDS ARE BEING
 EXAMINED WITH A SPECIAL

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
CAMERA.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
GIVE ME A LOW SOUND E

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
EEEEEH

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
SUPER, CAN YOU SING THE
 SCALE FOR ME STARTING LOW

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.000
GOING UP.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
(SINGS SCALE)

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I CAN'T SING
ANYTHING LIKE I USE TO,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I USE TO SING A TOP C BUT, I
CAN'T DO THAT ANY MORE AND

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
UM EVERY TIME I SING A TOP
NOTE FOR A LONG TIME JUST

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
NOTHING COMES
OUT AFTER AWHILE.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
TRY MID-RANGE NOW.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
AAAAAAAA

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
DOMINIC'S VOCAL CORDS
HAVE STARTED TO GROW

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
HIGHER NOTE

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
AAAAA

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
DIFFICULTY HITTING
THAT ONE... OKAY,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
DOMINIC'S GOT VERY
RAPID CHANGES GOING ON

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
IN THE VOICE BOX
AND HE REALLY HAS TO LEARN

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
TO ADAPT AND USE HIS VOICE
HE'S HAD A LOT OF TRAINING

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
IN SINGING VOICE AND
THAT'S GOING TO HELP HIM.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
BUT, THE RATE OF CHANGE
IS HARD TO COPE WITH.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
IT'S A COMPLETE NEW
BIT OF KID IN A WAY.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
IT'S LIKE LEARNING A
MUSICAL INSTRUMENT,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE AT
IT SO THE COORDINATION ISN'T

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
THERE YET.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
COME DOWN.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
(SINGS SCALES DOWN)

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:43.000
(DOMINIC SINGS A LONG NOTE
AND THEN SINGS A SONG)

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
AMAZINGLY, DOMINIC
 HAS A CHOICE,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
VOICE BREAKING IS THE ONLY
 PART OF PUBERTY THAT CAN

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
BE DELAYED, BUT ONLY BY
 HARD WORK AND WILL POWER.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
WITH BOY TREBLES, IT'S
THE DESIRE TO CARRY ON,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
THE WILL TO WANT TO SING.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
WHEN THEY GET TO THIS STAGE
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IF

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
THEY DON'T I THINK THE
VOICE CAN JUST GO STRAIGHT

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
AWAY.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
SO THAT'S VERY MUCH
ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTER

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
AND TEMPERAMENT OF
THE INDIVIDUAL CHORISTER.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
JUST AT THE END OF THE
PHRASE BEFORE HIS PRESENTS

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000
YOU JUST SLIGHTLY LOST IT.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
WHEN YOU RETURN TO THE NOTE...
AND JUST START IT...

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
TROUBLE IS IN THE MIDDLE
 OF PUBERTY THE TEENAGE

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
TEMPERAMENT IS ABOUT AS RELIABLE
 AS A BOY'S SINGING VOICE.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
ITS QUITE STRESSFUL
BEING IN THE CHOIR,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
BECAUSE IF I WANT TO STAND
A CHANCE OF BEING ONE OF

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
THE MOST SENIOR BOYS IN
THE CHOIR I HAVE TO BE REALLY

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
WELL BEHAVED.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
WHICH WOULD BE
A BIG TASK.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
HEY, THIS IS MY ROOM,
THIS WHERE I KINDA GO,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
YOU KNOW, AFTER
THE SCHOOL DAY.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE LOTS
OF PRESSURES IN SCHOOL AND

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
EVERYTHING, SO YOU KNOW
I JUST LIE ON THE BED AND

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
REFLECT ON THE DAY, JUST
LISTEN TO MY TUNES AND

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
THINK ABOUT STUFF.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
JUST FIGHT.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
LOOK AT HIS MOVES
HIS FAST AGILITY

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
JESSIE IS FOURTEEN HE'S
ALREADY GOT THE DEEP VOICE

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
OF A MAN AND HIS BODY
IS WELL INTO THE GROWTH

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
SPURT.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
JESSIE, THE WINNER.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I THINK WHAT I
LIKE BEST SO FAR

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
ABOUT THE CHANGING

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
IN MY BODY IS UH
PROBABLY THE HEIGHT

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
OR UH THE
MASCULINITY,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
THE RISING LEVELS OF
 TESTOSTERONE IN JESSIE'S

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
BLOOD ARE DRIVING HIM TO
 THE NEXT STAGE OF PUBERTY.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
HIS MUSCLES ARE CHANGING .

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
UNDER THE SKIN MUSCLES ARE
 MADE UP OF THOUSANDS OF

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
HAIR-LIKE FIBERS
 THAT WORK TOGETHER.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
TESTOSTERONE MAKES EACH
 FIBER GROW BROADER AND

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
LONGER AND THE EFFECTS OF
 THE HORMONES ARE MASSIVELY

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
INCREASED BY EXERCISE.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
THOUGH THE NUMBER OF
 FIBERS DOESN'T CHANGE.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
JESSIE HAS THE SAME NUMBER
 OF MUSCLE FIBERS TODAY AS

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
HE DID WHEN HE WAS BORN.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
BUT, ITS NOT JUST MUSCLES
 THAT ARE CHANGING THE

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
SYSTEM THAT POWERS
 THEM IS GROWING TOO.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
IN HIS LUNGS THERE ARE
 EVERMORE AIR SACS TO

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
CHANNEL OXYGEN
 INTO THE BLOOD.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
IN THE BLOOD THE
 CONCENTRATION OF RED CELLS

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
GOES UP BY A QUARTER SO
 MORE OXYGEN CAN BE CARRIED

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
AND THE HEART ITSELF
 DOUBLES IN VOLUME.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
EACH BEAT SENDS MORE
 OXYGEN AROUND THE BODY TO

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:03.000
FUEL HIS MUSCLES.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
THIS MEANS JESSIE'S
 STRENGTH AND STAMINA ARE

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
HE'S READY FOR ANYTHING.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:20.000
(MUSIC)

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
(MUSIC)

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
JESSIE AND HIS FRIENDS
 NEW STRENGTH HAS GIVEN

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
THEM GREAT CONFIDENCE.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
BUT, PUBERTY DOESN'T
 ALWAYS RUN SO SMOOTHLY.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
IT'S SIX MONTHS
 SINCE WE LAST SAW MARK,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
AT THIRTEEN AND A HALF, ONLY
 SIX MONTHS YOUNGER THAN

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
JESSIE HE'S WELL INTO THE
 AGE WHEN MOST BOYS ARE

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
GROWING FAST.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
BUT MARK HAS
 STILL NOT STARTED.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
IT'S EATING ME UP INSIDE.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I'M NOT GROWING...
AND I WANT TO GROW.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
CAUSE, IF I GROW, I
MIGHT BE MORE LIKED.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
I MIGHT NOT BE KNOWN
AS THE LITTLE MIDGET

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
IN 9K. I MIGHT BE KNOWN AS
THE BOY FROM 9K CALLED MARK..

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
HOW MUCH ARE THE CRISPS.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
EVEN IF MARK CATCHES
 UP IN A FEW YEARS BEING A

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
LATE DEVELOPER MAY WELL LEAVE
 LASTING MAY WELL LEAVE

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
LASTING EMOTIONAL SCARS.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
HEY GUESS WHAT...

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
YOU CAN GET MUGGED. YOU CAN
GET BULLIED.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
THEY'RE ALFECOME AROUND ON

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
THEIR BIKES. LOOK AT EVERY
ONE, AND THINK

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
I'M THE KING, YOU
MOVE OUT OF MY WAY.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
THEY LOOK OUT FOR THE SMALLER
PEOPLE, AND THEY GO FOR THE

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
SMALLER PEOPLE, AND IF THEY
SEE THAT YOU ARE AN EASY

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
TARGET, YOU'RE DONE FOR.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
BULLYING WAS NOT
 THE ONLY PROBLEM.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
LATE DEVELOPERS USUALLY
 DO WORSE AT SCHOOL THEY'RE

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
LESS POPULAR THAN OTHER
 BOYS AND THEY LACK ANOTHER

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
FUNDAMENTAL
 TEENAGE TALENT.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WHAT
DO YOU PREFER TO BE?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE SHORT OR

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
WOULD YOU PREFER TO BE TALL.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
OK THIS IS WHAT ITS
LIKE TO WAKE JESSIE UP IN

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
THE MORNING

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
NINETY PERCENT OF
TEENAGERS FIND IT HARD TO

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
GET UP IN THE MORNING.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
HEY,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
SMALL WONDER WHEN YOU
 CONSIDER WHAT HAPPENS AT

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
NIGHT.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I COULD STAY UP PRETTY
LATE AND LIKE NOT FEEL SLEEPY,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
GENERALLY, I LIKE,
I JUST STAY UP LATE AND

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
WATCH MOVIES AND JUST FALL
ASLEEP WHENEVER YOUR TIRED.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000
HEY GET UP.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000
TURN IT OFF?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000
GET UP
THERE AND JUMP ON HIM.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
(WHISTLE, WHISTLE)

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
THERE YOU GO.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
MARY CARSKADON IS A
LEADING AUTHORITY ON

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000
TEENAGE SLEEP.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
THE PERFECT SLEEPERS
ARE PROBABLY EIGHT OR NINE

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
YEAR OLDS.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
WHO SLEEP JUST
SOLID ALL NIGHT LONG.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
WHEN THEY WAKE-UP THEY'RE
AWAKE AND ALERT ALL DAY

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
LONG AND THEN WHEN IT'S BEDTIME
THEY'RE READY FOR SLEEP

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
AND THEY GO RIGHT TO SLEEP AND
SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
WHAT WE FIND IN THE
TEENAGERS IS THAT

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
SOMETHING MAY BE HAPPENING
THAT'S CHANGING THE TIMING

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
MECHANISM INSIDE
THE BRAIN.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
A DINGY UNDERGROUND
 CELLAR IS NOT TO

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
EVERYONE'S TASTE.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
BUT THE BOYS
 ARE IN HEAVEN,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
HERE THEY CAN SLEEP AS
 LONG AS THEY LIKE.. THE

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
ONLY DRAW BACK IS THAT
 MARY AND HER TEAM WILL BE

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
WATCHING THEIR EVERY MOVE
 AND RECORDING THEIR BRAIN

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
WAVES THROUGHOUT
 THE NIGHT.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
NOW, GET INTO A
 COMFORTABLE SLEEPING

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
POSITION.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
WHEN WE TURN OFF YOUR
 LIGHTS PLEASE LIE QUIETLY

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
KEEP YOUR EYES CLOSED
 AND TRY TOALL ASLEEP.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.000
GOOD NIGHT.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
EVEN THOUGH THERE AREN'T
 ANY DISTRACTIONS AT 10:30

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
THE BOYS ARE FINDING
 IT HARD TO SETTLE.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
THERE IS A CLUE TO
 WHY IN THEIR SALA.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
THE TEAM ARE LOOKING
 FOR TRACES OMELATONIN.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
THE HORMONE OF
 DARKNESS, IT'S THE HORMONE

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
THAT TELLS THE BRAIN
 ITS NIGHT TIME.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
IN THE YEARS BEFORE
 PUBERTY CHILDREN RELEASE

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000
MELATONIN INTO THE BLOOD
 STREAM AT AROUND NINE IN

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
THE EVENING BY TEN O'CLOCK
 MOST OF THEM ARE SOUND

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000
ASLEEP AND THEY'LL STAY
 THAT WAY FOR A FULL TEN

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.000
HOUR

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
WHEN PUBERTY KICKS IN
 THINGS CHANGAND NOT

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
ENTIRELY FORHE BETTER.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
IN A TEENAGERS BRAIN THE
 BODY CLOCKS SHIFT TO THE

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
ADULT TIME MELATONIN IS
 NOT RELEASED UNTIL TEN

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
THIRTY WHICH MEANS THAT
 THEIR BODIES ARE NOT READY

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
FOR SLEEP UNTIL
 AFTER ELEVEN.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
THE TROUBLE IS WHILE
 THEY'RE GROWING TEENAGERS

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
STILL NEED A FULL
 TEN HOURS SLEEP.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
SO, WHEN THE WORLD SAYS
 ITS TIME TO GET UP THEIR

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
BRAINS STILL THINK IT'S
 THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
JESSIE YOU GOTTA GET UP
 ITS LIKE WAY AFTER SIX.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000
I'M UP.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
YOUR NOT UP,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000
TURN THE CAMERA OFF

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
UP IS LIKE STANDING UP,  TELL
 HIM MAX, TELL HIM GET UP.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
FIVE NIGHTS A WEEKHEIR
SLEEPING ONE AND HALF,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
TO TWO AND HALF EVEN THREE
HOURS A NIGHT LESS THEN

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
THEY NEED.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
AS A RESULT, THEY
PILE-UP AN ENORMOUS SLEEP

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
DEBT AND ITS LIKE
WALKING AROUND WITH THIS

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
BIG GRAY CLOUD
AROUND THEIR HEAD.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
TURN THE CAMERAFF OR
I'LL THROW A SHOE AT YOU.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
DON'T HIT THE CAMERA
 NOW, OW...

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
GOOD MORNING JESSIE.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
JESSIE'S NOW STARTED
HIGH SCHOOL WHICH MEANS

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
THAT AT 7 O'CLOCK
IN THE MORNING,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
LIKE TEENAGERS ALL OVER
THE USA HE'S ON HIS WAY TO

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
SCHOOL.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
(MUSIC)

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
IT'S HARD,T'S JUST
LIKE YOU'RE SO TIRED

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
HAVE YOU TURNED IN YOUR

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
PAPERS FOR MATH?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
YOU WAKE UP,
YOU GET READY,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
AND BEFORE TO LONG YOU'RE
LIKE IYOUR CSS,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000
YOUR FIRST PERIOD CLASS
AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
AND YOU GET LIKE YOU
JUST CAN'TAKE IT.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
ITS MISERABLE SOMETIMES
BUT, YOU KNOW,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
YOU GOTTA GET
THROUGH THE DAY.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
ITS AN OPEN CIRCLE, IN
WHICH DIRECTION DOES THE

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000
LINE GO.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
WHEN MARY CARSKADON
 PERSUADED THE SCHOOLS

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
IN ONE STATE TO START AN
 HOUR AND A HALF LATER,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
NOT ONLY DID THE
 STUDENTS SHOW-UP

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
FOR CLASS MORE OFTEN,
 THEIR GRADES IMPROVED.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
THE EXTRA SLEEP ALSO HAD
 A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
STUDENTS MOODS LACK
 OF SLEEP PLAYS A BIG PART

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
IN TEENAGERSAD MOODS.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
EVEN MORVAN'S COLLEGE
 CHOIR HAS ONE EXAMPLE OF A

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
IRRITABLE TEENAGER.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
WHEN PEOPLE SHOUT AT ME,
YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BACK

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000
AT ALL.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
AND I USE TO BE FINE WITH
THAT BUT NOW IT'S HARD NOT

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
TO SAY ANYTHING.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
DOMINIC IS NOW THIRTEEN
 AND HE'S NOT GETTING ON AS

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
WELL AS HE USE TO.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
WHEN HE WAS LITTLE
HE DIDN'T NOTICE THE

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
DISCIPLINE IT WAS WH
HE DID NOW HE STARTING TO

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
QUESTION IT AS
HE'S GETTING OLDER.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
AND, AS HE QUESTIONS IT HE
REALIZES ITS NOT WHAT HE

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
WANTS OR WHAT HE'S
COMFORTABLE WITH.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
THE CHOIR MASTER
HAD A GO AT ME.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
I SANG A BIT WRONG AND HE
JUST WENT SKITS AT ME AND

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
SHOUTED AT ME.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
AND, SO I ANSWERED
BACK TO HIM,

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
AND HE WENT APE, AND
HE REALLY GOT MAD.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
AS I GOT OLDER... LESS AND
LESS SCARED OF HIM, SEE.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
MUST BE I'M GROWING
UP OR SOMETHING.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
EVEN THOUGH DOMINIC'S
 VOICE HAS NOT FINISHED

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
BREAKING EVERY ONE AGREES
 ITS TIME FOR HIM TO LEAVE

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
THE CHOIR.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
TONIGHT IS HIS
 LAST SERVICE.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
ITS VERY MUCH AN
END OF AN ERA FOR DOM,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
IT'S THE END OF
AN ERA FOR US.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
YES, YES I'LL CRY.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
(MUSIC)

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
LEAVING THE CHOIR MADE
 A MASSIVE CHANGE TO

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
DOMINIC'S LIFE AFTER ALL
 HE'S DEDICATED TWENTY

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
HOURS A WEEK TO IT FOR
 THE PAST FOUR YEARS.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
AT FIRST NOT HAVING
 ANYTHING TO DO WAS REALLY

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
QUITE STRANGE AND THE
 FIRST SATURDAY WHEN I

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
DIDN'T GO IN TO SING WAS
 LIKE WHAT SHOULD I DO?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
BUT I'VE WORKED OUT
 HOW TO USE MY TIME.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:03.000
(MUSIC)

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:16.000
(MUSIC)

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:28.000
(MUSIC)

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
AWAY FROM THE DISCIPLINE
OF THE CHOIR DOMINIC

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
SWIFTLY LOST CONTROL
OF HIS VOICE.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
WHEN SOMEONE LAUGHS AT YOU.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
(LOUD SQUEAK)

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
IT'S JUST LIKE A REALLY
LOAD SQUEAK AND ITS

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
OK, COME ON
GET TOGETHER, SMILE

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
ENJOYING YOURSELVES.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
WHEN DOMINIC'S VOICE
FINALLY SETTLES DOWN IT'S

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
QUALITY WILL DEPEND ON
MORE THEN JUST HIS VOCAL

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
CORDS.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
THE SHAPE OF HIS FACE
WILL ALSO PLAY A PART.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.000
OPEN YOUR
EYES, LOOK UP,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
OK, I'LL TAKE
A PICTURE NOW.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000
DOMINIC HAS COME TO
 LONDON WITH THE FAMILY TO

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
HAVE HIS FACE SCANNED
 AT THE EASTMAN DENTAL

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
INSTITUTE.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
HERE THEY CAN PREDICT WHAT
 HE WILL LOOK LIKE AS HE

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000
DEVELOPS INTO A MAN.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:28.000
(MUSIC)

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
SO THIS IS OUR SCAN WE
HAVE JUST TAKEN, HERE IT IS

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
JUST LIKE THE REST OF
THE BODY A BOY'S FACE

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
GOES THROUGH A
GROWTH SPURT.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
FIRST, THE JAW GROWS WIDER
AS THEY DEVELOP A FULL SET OF

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
ADULT TEETH THEN TESTOSTERONE
WORKS ON THE BONES IN THE

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
NOSE AND JAW.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
THEY GROW TWICE AS FAST
AS THE REST OF THE FACE.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
THE COMPUTER CAN
LOOK INTO THE FUTURE.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
SO, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO DOMINIC'S FACE?

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
THIS IS HOW HE WILL
LOOK AT TWENTY.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
AHHH

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
DURING PUBERTY HE WILL
DEVELOP THE LONGER FACE

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
AND THE CHISELED
JAW OF A YOUNG MAN.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
ADD A FEW WRINKLES AND
SOME STUBBLE AND HE'S EVEN

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
OLDER.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
THAT'S RAW

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
THAT'S SCARY.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000
THAT'S REALLY QUITE ODD.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
THAT'S WEIRD...

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE
DAD, IT'S JUST FUNNY.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
WRINKLES AROUND THE
EYES AND THE FOREHEAD.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF
YOU WOUND-UP LOOKING LIKE

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
THAT?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
OH, I GUESS I
COULD LOOK WORSE COULDN'T I?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
I GUESS THAT IS FAIR.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
WERE YOU PLANNING
TO GROW A BEARD?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
NOT ANY MORE.  HA, HA, HA

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
HEY I GOT HAIR
ON MY LEGS NOW,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
NO YOU DON'T,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
I'VE STARTED NOTICING
HAIR IN WEIRD PLACES,

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
(MUSIC)

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
THAT'S RIGHT, HEY...
ARE YOU SITTING AT HOME.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
YEAH WISH YOU
WERE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
LIKE OUT ON A DATE.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
OR DO YOU HAVE
WOMAN PROBLEMS?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
(MUSIC)

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
THE WHOLE POINT OF
 PUBERTY IS TO PREPARE

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
TEENAGERS TO REPRODUCE.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000
THEY LIKE A SIX PACK

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
THEY LIKE THE MUSCLES

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
BECAUSE ALL OF THE
GIRLS THAT I TALK TO...

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
BECAUSE IT
JUST SO HAPPENS, THAT I AM...

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
THAT'S RIGHT, A LADIES MAN.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
BY THE AGE OF FIFTEEN
 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
GONE INSIDE A
 BOYS BODY.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
THE GENITALS HAVE FINISHED
 DEVELOPING AND THE VOLUME

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
OF THE TESTICLES
 HAS GONE UP BY 400%.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
INSIDE HAVE GROWN A
 TANGLE OF TINY TUBES,

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
MINIATURE FACTORIES THAT
 TURN OUT SPERM ON A

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
MASSIVE SCALE, A
 THOUSAND EVERY SECOND.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
WITH A THERMAL CAMERA YOU
 CAN SEE WHY THE TESTES ARE

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
WHERE THEY ARE.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
THE RED OF THE STOMACH
 SHOWS THAT ITS HOT,

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
THE BITS COLORED GREEN
 AND BLUE ARE COOLER.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
SPERM PRODUCTION
 WORKS BEST AT LOWER

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
TEMPERATURES WHICH IS WHY
 THE TESTES ARE DESIGNED TO

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
HANG LOW.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
AND, ITS AT THIS TIME THAT
 THE PENIS DEVELOPS A MIND

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
OF ITS OWN.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
WHEN YOU SEE A HOT GIRL
ON TV YOU SHOOT UP FROM FOUR

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
INCHES TO SEVEN INCHES
IN FIVE SECONDS.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
I REMEMBER A FEW TIMES IN
EIGHTH GRADE WE'D BE GOING OUT

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
THERE AND WE WERE WEARING
OUR SWEATS AND STUFF,

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
OH MY GOD, IT WOULD BE
LIKE... THERE'D BE GIRLS

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:32.000
OUT THERE AND STUFF AND I'D BE
LIKE OH CRAP ITS COMING I GOT

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
TO TUCK THAT IN SOMEWHERE..

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
YOU'D WAKE UP WITH ONE
AND YOUR MOM'S LIKE

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
GET IN THE SHOWER,
FIVE MORE MINUTES,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
I HAVE TO WAIT...
WAIT FOR WHAT?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
UM, NOTHING...

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
YOU'RE WALKING IN
LIKE, SIDE WAYS, LIKE...

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
THE ERECTIONS ARE HARDLY
 A MATTER OF CHOICE,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
INSIDE THE PENIS IS MADE
 OF SPONGY TISSUE THAT'S

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
FILLED WITH THOUSANDS
 OF TINY BLOOD VESSELS.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
USUALLY, BLOOD FLOWS IN
 AND OUT AT A NORMAL RATE.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
DURING AN ERECTION BLOOD
 FLOW INTO THE PENIS

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
INCREASES DRAMATICALLY.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
THE BLOOD VESSELS AT THE
 BASE GET SQUEEZED SO WHILE

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
BLOOD CAN FLOW IN IT
 CANNOT AS EASILY FET OUT.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000
THE PRESSURE
 BUILDS-UP INSIDE.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
THE THERMAL CAMERA SHOWS
 THE HEAT PRODUCED BY ALL

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
THAT EXTRA TRAPPED BLOOD.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
NOW, THE EQUIPMENT IS
 ALL IN PLACE ITS READY TO

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
OPERATE.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
THE FIRST TIME THAT
 HAPPENS IS USUALLY AT

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
NIGHT.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HAD HAPPENED,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
I WOKE UP AND MY
BOXERS WERE DAMP,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
AND I WAS LIKE... WHAT'S GOING
ON... IT'S LIKE... IT'S LIKE...

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I DIDN'T WET
MYSELF, I KNOW THAT,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
IT'S JUST LIKE, OH WELL, JUST
THROW IT IN THE WASH AND

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
EVERYTHING'S TAKEN CARE OF.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
LIKE WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENS
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
RIGHT, SO YOU CAN CONTROL
YOUR BODILY FUNCTIONS

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
OR WHATEVER, YOU KNOW WHAT
TO DO NOW AND, YOU SHOULD,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
YOU KNOW THAT IT IS NOT
GOING TO BE AN ACCIDENT

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
NO-MORE OR WHATEVER..

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
ARE YOUR TRYING TO TELL
 ME THAT YOU'VE STARTED TO

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
MASTURBATE?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
YES THAT
WHAT I'M SAYING.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
THEY JUST THINK
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME,

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I KNOW FOR A FACT THEY
THINK ABOUT IT A LOT OF

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
THE TIME BECAUSE I
HAVE TWO BROTHERS.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
OH MY GOD. WE'RE EATING AND
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT SEX.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM A
 QUARTER OF TEENAGERS HAVE

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
HAD SEX BEFORE
 THEY'RE SIXTEEN.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
IN THE UNITED STATES
 ALMOST HALF OF THEM HAVE.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
BUT, BOY-GIRL
 RELATIONSHIPS ARE NOT JUST

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
ABOUT SEX THE EMOTIONAL
 SIDE CHANGES AS WELL.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
AT HIGH SCHOOL ITS
 STARTING TO HAPPEN FOR

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
JESSIE.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
HAVE YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000
NO COMMENT.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
I'M NOT TIED DOWN.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.000
YEAH HE IS.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
YEAH YOU ARE,
YOU'RE WHIPPED DUDE.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
AT FIFTEEN JESSIE'S NATURAL
 INCLINATIONS ARE LEADING

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
HIM TOWARDS THE
 ADULT WORLD BUT,

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
WILL THE ADULT
 SOCIETY LET HIM IN.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
DO TEENAGERS GET THE
 CHALLENGES THEY NEED.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
YOU CAN'T DO MUCH CAN
YOU WHEN YOUR ONLY SIXTEEN?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
YOU CAN'T GET A JOB BECAUSE
YOUR STILL IN SCHOOL,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
WHEN YOU WANT A PROPER JOB THAT
PAYS A DECENT WAGE SO YOU CAN

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
GO OUT TO THE CLUBS...

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
YOU CAN'T DRIVE... AND YOU
WON'T BE ABLE TO DRIVE...

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
GET ME OWN CAR...
AND GO ALL OVER.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000
MATTHEW LIKE MANY
 FIFTEEN YEAR OLDS

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
IS BOTH PHYSICALLY
 DEVELOPED AND ANGRY,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
PERHAPS WITH GOOD REASON.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
 TEENAGERS HAVE BEEN

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
ALLOWED TO LESS AND LESS,
 AND TEENAGE CRIME RATES

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
HAVE ROCKETED.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
TODAY 80 PERCENT OF
 ADOLESCENTS ADMIT TO SOME

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
CRIME OR OTHER.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000
WE'RE LIKE HIP
HOP KIDS, YOU KNOW,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
GO TO UNDERGROUND
PARTIES, DRUGS, ALCOHOL.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.000
EVERYONE DRINKS UNDERAGE.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
SOMETIMES THEY
TAKE THINGS, LIKE DRINKS.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
THERE'S AT THREE
FIGHTS EVERY DAY.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
WE TAKE, CHOCOLATE
BARS, TAKE CHEWING GUM

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
IT'S JUST LIKE, ITS THERE,
EVERYBODY'S LIKE "HEY THIS IS

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
COOL" AND YOUR LIKE I'M
JUST GOING TO TRY IT ONCE,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
AND THAT'S IT JUST
TO SEE WHAT ITS LIKE.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO
IT OVER, AND OVER,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
AND OVER UNTIL
YOU'VE TRY IT.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000
SHUT UP MAN.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
CHILDREN THAT FAIL
TO GET INTO ANY TROUBLE

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
DURING ADOLESCENTS ARE
AN INFINITESIMALLY SMALL

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
MINORITY.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
IN ACTUAL FACT THE YOUNG
PEOPLE WHO MAKE IT ALL THE

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
WAY THROUGH ADOLESCENCE
WITHOUT ENGAGING IN ANY

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
KIND OF ILLEGAL, ILLICIT
BEHAVIOR ARE VERY,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
VERY FEW AND DON'T TEND TO
ACTUALLY BE A PINNACLE OF

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:12.000
MENTAL HEALTH.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
TERRI MOFFITT CONDUCTED
THE BIGGEST EVER STUDY OF

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
TEENAGE BOYS BEHAVIOR.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
SHE FOUND THAT IN THE
DEVELOPED WORLD ONE FIFTH

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
OF ALL BOYS OFTEN GET
INVOLVED IN CRIME BY THE

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
TIME THEY'RE EIGHTEEN.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
MOST OF MATTHEWS
FRIENDS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT OUT.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
SWAPPING CARS

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
TAKING THEM WITHOUT
ANYONE'S CONSENT

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
DOING HIJACKS

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000
GETTING CAUGHT FOR
ROBBING A CAR BUT I DIDN'T

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
GET DONE WITH IT.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
STEALING.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
TEENAGE BOYS ARE OUT FOR
EXCITEMENT AND TAKING AND

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
DRIVING AWAY IS A
COMMON WAY TO FIND IT.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
IN ROCHDALE IN THE NORTH
OF ENGLAND THEY RUN A PROJECT

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
WHERE BOYS ON THE EDGE OF CRIME
ARE TAUGHT HOW TO FIX CARS.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
IN THE UK YOU CAN'T
LEGALLY DRIVE UNTIL YOU'RE

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
SEVENTEEN.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
FIFTEEN YEAR-OLD MATTHEW
ALREADY HAS SIGNIFICANT

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
DRIVING EXPERIENCE.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
THE MATE FOUND A MOTOR BIKE
AND HE CAME TO MY HOUSE AND

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
ASKED ME TO GET SOME
PETROL FOR HIM.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
SO I WENT OFF AND GOT SOME
PETROL, POURED IT IN AND

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
HE COULDN'T GET IT STARTED.
SO I GOT IT STARTED FOR HIM.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
AND THEN WE HAD A GO ALL OVER.
IT WAS JUST A BUZZ...

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
THE POLICE CAME TO ME
AND ASKED ME QUESTIONS.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I GOT CAUGHT WITH ME
FINGERPRINTS STUFF AND

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
EVERYTHING. IT WAS A STOLEN
BIKE AND I GOT CAUGHT FOR IT.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
THAT'S LIFE.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
THIS ISN'T THE ONLY TIME
MATTHEW'S BEEN IN TROUBLE

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000
WITH THE POLICE, IF THEY
CATCH HIM ONCE MORE HE'LL

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
END UP IN COURT.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
BUT, DOES THIS MEAN HE'S
FACING A LIFE OF CRIME.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
IT WOULD BE THE WRONG
THING TO DO TO SEE THIS AS

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
A SIGN OF A BAD FUTURE
OR A SIGN OF A BAD KID.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS YOUNG
PEOPLE DOING THE BEST THEY

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
CAN TO COPE WITH AN
UNFORTUNATE SITUATION.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
THIS SITUATION IS NOT ALSO
DO TO THE FACT THAT KIDS

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
ARE BORED.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
THERE IS ALSO A
BIOLOGICAL CAUSE.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
BECAUSE BOYS ARE FED
BETTER AND MATURE MUCH

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
EARLIER ADOLESCENCE IS
LASTING LONGER THAN EVER

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000
BEFORE.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
IT'S A VERY UNPLEASANT
SITUATION TO BE STUCK IN

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
WE HAVE NO CLEAR ROLE IN
SOCIETY YOU ARE IN A SENSE

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
A SUPERFLUOUS MEMBER NO
LONGER A CHILD AND NOT A

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
PRODUCTIVE ADULT.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
TERRI MOFFITT THINKS THIS
FEELING BOYS HAVE THAT

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
THEY DON'T BELONG IS WHAT
SENT TEENAGE CRIME SOARING

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
OFF THE SCALE.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
THE MATURITY GAP
AFFECTS BOYS AND GIRLS.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
BUT, BOYS COMMIT
FAR MORE CRIME,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
AND THERE'S ONE CLEAR
DIFFERENCE THAT MIGHT

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
ACCOUNT FOR IT.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
ITS TESTOSTERONE AGAIN.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
AS WELL AS MAKING BOYS
MORE PHYSICAL INCREASED

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE IN
THE BLOOD MAKES THEM VERY

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
COMPETITIVE.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
I'VE COME FROM A QUIET
VARIETY OF SCHOOL

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
YOU GET REPUTATION
AT SCHOOL,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
YOU CAN GET REPUTATIONS FOR LIKE
IF YOU BOTHER AN ODD PERSON,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000
SOMEONE ODDER THAN MOST PEOPLE
THEN YOU BOTHER THEN YOU GET A

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
REPUTATION AS BEING REALLY ODD.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
FOR BOYS RESPECT
 IS CRUCIAL.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
IN ROCHDALE THE YOUTH
 PROJECT WORKS HARD TO GIVE

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
THEM A LEGAL WAY FOR GETTING
 IT AND IT'S REMARKABLY

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
EFFECTIVE.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
SINCE ITS BEEN RUNNING
 ARRESTS OF TEENAGERS IN

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
THE AREA ARE
 DOWN 60 PERCENT.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
MATTHEW'S BECOME DJ AT THE
 SPORTS CLUB AND HE STAYED

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
OUT OF TROUBLE FOR
 MORE THAN A YEAR.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
(MUSIC)

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
FOR MOST TEENAGE BOYS
 THERE IS HOPE A SMALL

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
PERCENTAGE CARRY ON
 OFFENDING BUT THE VAST

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
MAJORITY JUST
 GROW OUT OF IT.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
WE WILL BEGIN SERVICE
WITH THE SINGING OF MATAVU

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
WHICH YOU'LL FIND ON
THE BOTTOM OF PAGE ONE.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
AS I SAID IT WILL REPEAT
SEVERAL TIMES AND YOU WILL

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
FIND YOURSELF

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
BACK IN MANHATTAN
 ITS ANDY'S BIG DAY.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
HE'S THIRTEEN YEARS OLD
 AND IT'S HIS BAR MITZVAH.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
TRADITIONALLY IN THE JEWISH
 FAITH THIRTEEN IS WHEN A

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000
BOY BECOMES A MAN.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
AS MY FRIEND SAID
DON'T WORRY HENDRICKS

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
THERE'S NO PRESSURE ON YOU
HAVE DO IS GO UP THERE AND

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
LEAD THE SERVICE IN FRONT
OF A HUNDRED ODD PEOPLE.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
NOT ONLY DOES ANDY HAVE
 TO LEAD THE SERVICE HE HAS

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
TO DO IT IN A FOREIGN
 LANGUAGE, HEBREW.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000
(SINGING IN HEBREW)

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
ITS ONE OF THE FEW
FORMAL RITES OF PASSAGE

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
FROM CHILD TO ADULT THAT
REMAIN IN MODERN SOCIETY.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
(SINGING IN HEBREW)

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
THE BAR MITZVAH CEREMONY
IN ANCIENT DAYS USE TO

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
SYMBOLIZE A YOUNG PERSON
BECOMING AN ADULT,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
BECAUSE AT AGE THIRTEEN
IN FACT THEY DID BECOME

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
ADULTS.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
THEY WOULD MARRY THEY
WOULD HAVE A TRADE,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
IT TAKES ON A DIFFERENT
MEANING IN MODERN TIMES.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
IN MODERN TIMES THE
SIGNIFICANCE IS LEARNING

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
AND STUDYING AND ACHIEVING
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
I'M PROUD
OF HOW I DID,

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
BUT EVENTUALLY I'M VERY
HAPPY TO GET IT OFF MY

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
BACK.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
IT SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
FOLLOWING ME FOR A LONG

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
TIME, THIRTEEN
YEARS OR SO.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
OUTSIDE THE SYNAGOGUE
 ANDY MUST LIVE BY THE SAME

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
RESTRICTIONS AS
 OTHER TEENAGERS.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
FROM TODAY WITHIN HIS
 RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY HE'LL

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
BE TREATED AS AN ADULT.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:58.000
(MUSIC)

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:06.000
(MUSIC)

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
SO AT THE END OF TWO
 YEARS AT THE MERCY OF

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
THEIR BODY'S WHAT
 DIFFERENCE HAS PUBERTY

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
MADE TO EACH OF OUR BOYS.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:25.000
(MUSIC)

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
MARK AT NEARLY FOURTEEN
 IS STILL NOT GROWING,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
WHILE HE WAITS HE'S TAKEN
 UP KARATE TO BUILD UP HIS

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
MUSCLES.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
(CHOIR MUSIC)

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000
REMEMBER DOMINIC'S CHOIR
 BOY DAYS AT TWELVE HIS

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
LIFE REVOLVED AROUND THE
 CHOIR AND HIS BEAUTIFUL

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:42.000
TREBLE VOICE.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
I REALLY ENJOY IT AND
WE WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WHEN

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
OUR VOICE GETS LOWER BUT
WE'LL STILL BE ABLE TO SING

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
TENOR AND BASE, SEE.. AS LONG AS
WE CAN STILL SING I'LL THINK

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
I'VE GOTTEN RID OF
ALL OF THAT SINGING.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
WHEN I SPEAK YOU ALL SHUT UP!

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
WHEN DOMINIC'S VOICE HAD
 FINISHED BREAKING IT WAS A

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
WHOLE OCTAVE LOWER, HE'S
 A TENOR NOW BUT FRANKLY,

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
HE DOESN'T CARE.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO
SING, DON'T MAKE ME SING. NO..

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
PLEASE.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:35.000
(MUSIC)

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
NOW DOMINIC PLAYS RUGBY
 SIX DAYS A WEEK AND

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
HE'S RATHER GOOD, HE'S
 ALREADY BEEN SELECTED TO

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
PLAY FOR THE COUNTY.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
(MUSIC)

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:58.000
(MUSIC)

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
HELLO

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000
OKAY MOVE TOWARDS ME.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
WHEN WE FIRST MET ANDY
 HE WAS ELEVEN YEARS OLD.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
SO IT'S 56. SO, I AM NOW
FOUR FEET AND EIGHT INCHES.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
TWO YEARS LATER HE'S
 THIRTEEN AND HE'S STILL

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
CHECKING UP ON HIS GROWTH.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
I'M ABOUT TO MEASURE TO
SEE HOW MUCH I HAVE GROWN.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
FOUR FEET TEN, BUT
DIDN'T THE DOCTOR SAY YOU

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.000
WERE FOUR FEET ELEVEN

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
YES

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
WELL THEN THIS MEASUREMENT
IS A BIT SLOPPY.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
I BELIEVE I'VE BECOME
SLIGHTLY MORE DISGRUNTLED

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
AND UM ARGUMENTATIVE, BUT
I ALSO FEEL MORE MATURE

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
AND I'M COOLERHAN
ANYBODY ELSE.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
I FOUR FEET
AND ELEVEN INCHES

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
CAN I GO BACK TO
SLEEPING IN MY COAT NOW?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
MATTHEW HAS GOT A
 REGULAR SPOT DJ'ING IN

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
A PROPER CLUB.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
WHEN WE FIRST MET JESSIE
 HE WAS ALREADY A TEENAGER

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
AND HE LOVED IT.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
I CAN'T WAIT TO
GO TO HIGH SCHOOL,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
I MEAN LIKE ME AND THE
GUYS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
ALL THE FOOTBALL AND ITS
GOING TO BE HIGH SCHOOL

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:08.000
AND IT'S GOING TO BE...
WE'RE IN THE BIG TIMES NOW.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
RECENTLY, JESSIE
 TURNED SWEET SIXTEEN.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
I'VE BECOME A LITE
BIT MORE POLITICALLY AWARE,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
I TOTALLY FEEL THAT
SOMEBODY SHOULD BE WHO

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
THEY WANT TO BE.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR ATTENTION OR
ANYTHING LIKE THAT I DRESS

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
LIKE THIS BECAUSE
THIS IS WHO I AM.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
ALONG WITH HIS IMAGE
 HE'S CHANGED HIS FRIENDS.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
MY BAND IS CALLED AH ROLLING

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
YOUTH, MOSTLY WHAT WE
SING ABOUT IS BELIEF AH, IN

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
UNITY AND EQUALITY.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
SELLING OUAND GOING TO A

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
CORPORATE LABEL.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GO TO
A CORPORATE LABEL OR WHAT

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
NOT BECAUSE WHAT WE DO IS
NOT MEANT TO BE EXPENSIVE.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
ITS MEANT TO BE LIKE...YOU
KNOW, FOR THE KIDS.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
