00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.999
<br/>

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.000
Advertising.<br/>

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.999
Marketing.<br/>

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.999
Positioning.<br/>

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.999
Promotion.<br/>

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.999
Businesses use all of these<br/>
strategies to stand out in an

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.999
increasingly global crowd.<br/>

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.584
And today's high tech,<br/>
multimedia environment

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:35.999
provides companies endless<br/>
opportunities to hawk their

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.999
products to potential<br/>
customers.

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.999
With financial stakes higher<br/>
and competition stiffer,

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:44.999
businesses are devoting more<br/>
of their time, energy, and

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.999
resources to making a name for<br/>
themselves and their products.

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.999
But in the quest to sell their<br/>
wares, have companies also

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:55.667
sold their souls?<br/>

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.999
When does advertising's attempt<br/>
to be creative,

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:02.999
persuasive, and bold cross the<br/>
ethical line of being truthful

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:03.999
and informative?<br/>

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.999
In this program we'll examine<br/>
the role advertising plays in

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:11.999
today's society and look at how<br/>
businesses consider its

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:13.999
consequences.<br/>

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:17.999
This is Today's Life Choices:<br/>
Challenges for Our Times.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.999
<br/>

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:24.375
This is an historical moment.<br/>

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:25.999
Focuses the attention<br/>
of the President

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.999
of the United States.<br/>

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:30.999
Many Americans are distraught at<br/>
the rollback of some of the

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.999
protection zone.<br/>

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.999
They've gotten poorer and<br/>
poorer and poorer.

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.999
It is about helping people<br/>
who are dying.

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:39.999
Being a Palestinian is<br/>
a responsibility.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.000
Racism still endures.<br/>

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.999
The xenophobia still endures.<br/>

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:59.999
<br/>

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.999
Advertising has always been<br/>
essential to even the smallest

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:04.999
company's success.<br/>

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.999
After all, how can someone buy<br/>
a product or use a service if

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.209
they don't know they exist?<br/>

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.334
In its most basic and most<br/>
elaborate forms, advertising

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:18.709
should be informative and<br/>
provide customers with the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.999
essential benefits<br/>
about a product.

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.125
David Collins spent over 25<br/>
years as an executive with

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:28.042
Johnson & Johnson.<br/>

00:02:28.042 --> 00:02:30.751
One of the main roles of<br/>
advertising is information.

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:33.417
<br/>

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:36.250
That's why people spend a lot of<br/>
money on advertising, is to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.999
inform the consumer or the<br/>
eventual buyer of the

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.999
existence of the product, the<br/>
qualities of the product.

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.626
And to construct some kind of<br/>
scenario where the product

00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:48.999
becomes attractive to buy.<br/>

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:55.999
But advertising that just<br/>
informs would never be watched

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.999
beyond once, even if it<br/>
were watched then.

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.999
So advertising has to add<br/>
something more to it.

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:06.999
To be effective, advertising<br/>
must also move potential

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.999
customers to action by<br/>
persuading them to purchase a

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.999
particular product or service,<br/>
whether they need it or not.

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.999
The more difficult issue is the<br/>
one that says advertising

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:23.999
should not persuade someone to<br/>
buy something they don't need,

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.999
because frankly that's in<br/>
the eye of the beholder.

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:33.501
I may think that my consumers<br/>
need my Sunbeam Mixmaster.

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:35.375
You may think, they've<br/>
already got one, why

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:36.999
do they need another?<br/>

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.999
So there the tendency is, the<br/>
people who don't like

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:45.999
advertising at all will<br/>
criticize advertisers because

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:47.999
it's persuading people to buy<br/>
things they don't need.

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.999
Advertisers usually<br/>
have four goals.

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.999
The first is to create an<br/>
awareness of a particular

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.999
product, service, or idea.<br/>

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.999
The second is to establish an<br/>
identity or brand name.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.999
The third is to provide<br/>
information about the product,

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:08.999
service, or idea in a way that<br/>
consumers will remember.

00:04:08.999 --> 00:04:12.999
And lastly, the advertisement<br/>
must convince the consumer

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:17.959
that he or she will be better<br/>
off by using the product.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.626
Many observers think<br/>
advertising's mission is

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.999
inherently unethical.<br/>

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.667
Barbara Lippert serves<br/>
as the media critic

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:27.834
for New York Magazine.<br/>

00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:29.999
Advertisers like to think that<br/>
it's informative and

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:34.709
beneficial, just the way that<br/>
cigarette makers contend that

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:36.626
they're not getting people to<br/>
smoke, they're only getting

00:04:36.626 --> 00:04:38.999
people to switch brands.<br/>

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:41.999
And I assume that some<br/>
advertising is beneficial, in

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.999
that if you really do need a car<br/>
and you read all the print

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:47.999
about ads and you get<br/>
information and you decide

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.999
from there, then it<br/>
is beneficial.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.999
But mostly it's to make you<br/>
aware of things that you

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.584
wouldn't normally buy.<br/>

00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:58.999
Since its earliest days,<br/>
advertising has been attacked

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.999
from all sides using arguments<br/>
that still exist today.

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.999
Many believe that advertising<br/>
has always appealed to a

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:07.999
person's basic motives.<br/>

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.792
Ron Nahser, president and chief<br/>
executive officer of the

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:14.999
Nahser Agency in Chicago,<br/>
Illinois, admits there's an

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:16.999
element of truth in<br/>
that statement.

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.209
As one person described it,<br/>
you're looking for buttons to

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:21.999
push inside the consumer.<br/>

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.999
And you can push buttons that<br/>
are not so good for people or

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:30.999
ones that really inspire<br/>
people to be better.

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.999
The seven deadly sins<br/>
were not invented by

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.999
the advertising business.<br/>

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.999
We didn't discover them, and<br/>
you can't blame that on us.

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:38.999
But sometimes we're pretty good<br/>
at talking about them.

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.999
So what we say is that you<br/>
have the responsibility.

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:45.167
Do you want to appeal to the<br/>
higher nature of people or to

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:46.999
the lower nature of people?<br/>

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.751
That's a pretty simple<br/>
way of talking about

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:49.999
motivation of any kind.<br/>

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.999
Others recognize advertising<br/>
influence, but many claim most

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:57.999
advertising rarely uses<br/>
its power responsibly.

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.999
Although that charge has been<br/>
leveled at advertisers since

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:04.209
the early days of advertising,<br/>
it's particularly relevant in

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:06.959
today's society.<br/>

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.999
If a certain commercial can<br/>
persuade someone to buy a

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:13.709
particular brand of laundry<br/>
detergent, an ad can also

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:16.999
influence someone's behavior<br/>
or attitude.

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:21.999
The age old question of, does<br/>
society reflect advertising or

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:24.999
does advertising reflect<br/>
society,

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.999
may never be answered.<br/>

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:28.999
That's the filtering process<br/>
of ideas, the ideas of the

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:29.999
marketplace.<br/>

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:35.999
And whether it's true in<br/>
politics or it's true of the

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:40.999
arts, products, people are<br/>
constantly sifting and sorting

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:41.999
about what is important.<br/>

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.999
What is meaningful.<br/>

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.999
What do they want to take<br/>
into their lives.

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.959
We're just a piece of that.<br/>

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.999
The advertising industry has<br/>
grown more sophisticated

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.999
during the 20th century.<br/>

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:54.999
Many companies used to have<br/>
their own advertising, now

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:57.999
often called marketing,<br/>
departments that produced

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:00.000
in-house ads and strategies.<br/>

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.999
Now many businesses work with<br/>
outside agencies that

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:06.918
specialize in everything from<br/>
print, radio, and television

00:07:06.918 --> 00:07:08.999
ads to public relations.<br/>

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:11.999
And while many companies have<br/>
kept their own departments,

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:14.999
they still rely heavily on the<br/>
advice of an agency or

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:20.375
consultant when planning a<br/>
campaign or a strategic move.

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:23.999
The agency also helps the<br/>
company identify or target

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.999
consumers and offers advice<br/>
on how best to reach them.

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.999
We have a statement of<br/>
corporate purpose.

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:34.999
We say we want our advertising<br/>
to benefit the user, help our

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:37.999
clients' businesses grow, and<br/>
contribute to the well-being

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:38.999
of society.<br/>

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.999
And so we say, is this message<br/>
that we have, is it something

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:45.999
that ultimately adds to the<br/>
conversation, adds to the

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:47.999
cultural fabric of this country,<br/>
where people say

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:50.083
that's a responsible way<br/>
to talk about business?

00:07:50.083 --> 00:07:52.999
That was good commerce<br/>
and good business.

00:07:52.999 --> 00:07:55.999
Before an advertisement reaches<br/>
a newspaper, magazine,

00:07:55.999 --> 00:07:58.999
billboard, radio station, or<br/>
television network, it has

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:02.999
been unofficially scrutinized<br/>
at several levels.

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:06.999
First the in-house and/or<br/>
outside agency approves it.

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:10.999
Then the client agrees that<br/>
it fits the bill.

00:08:10.999 --> 00:08:13.999
Oftentimes newspapers,<br/>
magazines, radio and

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:16.999
television stations, and<br/>
broadcast and cable networks

00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:20.501
have advertising standards that<br/>
must be met before an ad

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.999
or commercial is printed<br/>
or aired.

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:26.999
Dan Jaffe serves as executive<br/>
vice president of the

00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:30.125
Association of National<br/>
Advertisers, an organization

00:08:30.125 --> 00:08:33.626
that helps its members work<br/>
more effectively.

00:08:33.626 --> 00:08:36.000
The advertising community has<br/>
probably the strongest

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.999
self-regulatory system<br/>
of any business

00:08:38.999 --> 00:08:39.999
entity in this country.<br/>

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:42.999
We have something called the<br/>
National Advertising division

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:44.999
of the Council of Better<br/>
Business Bureaus.

00:08:44.999 --> 00:08:48.999
And there are any consumer or<br/>
any business can bring cases

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:51.999
if they believe that somebody<br/>
is advertising in a false or

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.999
deceptive manner.<br/>

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:56.667
Government's power over<br/>
advertising rests with the

00:08:56.667 --> 00:08:59.999
Federal Trade Commission and<br/>
its Bureau of Consumer

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:02.999
Protection and the Food and<br/>
Drug Administration.

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:05.709
The Federal Communications<br/>
Commission, which regulates

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:08.584
the broadcasting and cable<br/>
industries, influences

00:09:08.584 --> 00:09:12.999
advertising content, yet has<br/>
no power over agencies or

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:13.999
print media.<br/>

00:09:13.999 --> 00:09:19.999
It is extremely important that<br/>
government be active in the

00:09:19.999 --> 00:09:21.999
advertising area.<br/>

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:24.999
Most people see this as<br/>
protecting consumers, but an

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.000
honest marketplace is<br/>
essential for honest

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.999
businessmen.<br/>

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:32.999
And therefore if advertisers<br/>
are not being truthful, are

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:37.292
being deceptive, they are taking<br/>
business from honest

00:09:37.292 --> 00:09:38.584
advertisers.<br/>

00:09:38.584 --> 00:09:41.999
And so the business community<br/>
has an equal interest in a

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:45.999
strong governmental presence<br/>
as do the consumer groups.

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:48.999
Because both want to be sure<br/>
that the advertising that's

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:50.999
done there is truthful<br/>
and non-deceptive.

00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:54.999
Yet despite a system of<br/>
self-regulation, criticism of

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:58.501
the advertising industry and<br/>
many of its clients abounds.

00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:01.209
Many critics focus on<br/>
advertisers' often thinly

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:04.792
disguised attempts at<br/>
targeting children.

00:10:04.792 --> 00:10:07.999
The Children's Television Act,<br/>
which was passed by Congress

00:10:07.999 --> 00:10:12.375
in 1990, limits advertising in<br/>
children's programs to 10 and

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:15.999
1/2 minutes per hour on weekends<br/>
and 12 and 1/2

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:18.834
minutes per hour on weekdays.<br/>

00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:21.999
In addition, advertisements for<br/>
toys or products related

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:25.083
to a show's characters or theme<br/>
cannot be aired during

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:26.999
the body of the program.<br/>

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:30.999
But as most experts will tell<br/>
you, children still view an

00:10:30.999 --> 00:10:35.459
awful lot of commercials and<br/>
what they see has an impact.

00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:37.999
Patrick Murphy is a professor of<br/>
marketing at the University

00:10:37.999 --> 00:10:39.626
of Notre Dame.<br/>

00:10:39.626 --> 00:10:44.000
There is even a difference<br/>
between children and the

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.999
teenage years, that there are<br/>
certain products obviously

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:48.999
aimed at children.<br/>

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:52.999
And their marketers are<br/>
very savvy and kind

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:55.999
of going after them.<br/>

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:58.999
Parents, though, generally have<br/>
their tentacles up and

00:10:58.999 --> 00:11:01.417
realize that the child is going<br/>
to try to influence them

00:11:01.417 --> 00:11:04.999
because the advertiser's trying<br/>
to influence the child.

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:06.999
But it's getting harder and<br/>
harder for parents to control

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.501
what their children see.<br/>

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:11.999
Although a new rating system<br/>
was supposed to provide

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:14.417
parents a handy tool for<br/>
knowing what shows were

00:11:14.417 --> 00:11:18.125
appropriate for children,<br/>
advertising content is neither

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.999
rated or reviewed.<br/>

00:11:20.999 --> 00:11:23.999
So it's quite possible for a<br/>
child to see an inappropriate

00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:27.999
commercial within a program<br/>
suitable for children.

00:11:27.999 --> 00:11:30.042
You can't really regulate it,<br/>
because what they don't

00:11:30.042 --> 00:11:32.999
realize is that people are<br/>
watching everything the way

00:11:32.999 --> 00:11:35.999
they normally would watch<br/>
the old three networks.

00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:37.999
So if you're going to<br/>
be buzzing around--

00:11:37.999 --> 00:11:40.999
I know any four year old knows<br/>
how to use a remote.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:43.999
You can't really regulate that<br/>
properly at what time,

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:47.999
because, especially in cable,<br/>
things run all day, things run

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.999
for 24 hours, and so children<br/>
are going to

00:11:50.999 --> 00:11:52.000
come upon these things.<br/>

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.999
Companies and the agencies that<br/>
design advertisements are

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:59.999
also creative, and some would<br/>
say sneaky, in designing ads

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:02.999
that subliminally target<br/>
children and young adults.

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:05.999
While the product may be geared<br/>
toward an adult, the

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:09.999
commercial often appeals to<br/>
children, which many say lays

00:12:09.999 --> 00:12:13.999
the groundwork for brand<br/>
choices later in life.

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:16.999
A recent USA Today Survey<br/>
found that most teens

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:20.999
recognized the Marlboro man,<br/>
Budweiser's talking

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:22.999
frogs, and Joe Camel.<br/>

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:26.999
Since the Surgeon General's<br/>
landmark report on smoking in

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:30.999
1964, the tobacco industry has<br/>
been fighting an uphill public

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:32.999
relations battle.<br/>

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:34.999
Tobacco, although a legal<br/>
product for adults to

00:12:34.999 --> 00:12:38.999
purchase, is the only product<br/>
banned from advertising on

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:40.999
television by Congress.<br/>

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:44.999
Since that 1971 ban, the tobacco<br/>
industry has poured

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:48.999
its deep advertising budget into<br/>
magazines, billboards,

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:51.999
and sponsorship of<br/>
sporting events.

00:12:51.999 --> 00:12:56.999
Cigarettes are the one product<br/>
when used as directed, are

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:58.999
harmful or can kill you.<br/>

00:12:58.999 --> 00:13:04.626
Where alcohol in moderation or<br/>
firearms properly used and

00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:09.999
other socially controversial<br/>
products have some redeeming

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:11.999
value, if you will, I<br/>
think cigarettes are

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:12.999
ones hard to defend.<br/>

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:15.999
So I've been a critic for<br/>
a number of years.

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:19.999
But I think that the industry<br/>
has been very successful in

00:13:19.999 --> 00:13:23.999
creating an image, whether it's<br/>
the cowboy image or the

00:13:23.999 --> 00:13:29.999
Kool image, if you will,<br/>
the K-O-O-L is C-O-O-L.

00:13:29.999 --> 00:13:32.959
Although the tobacco industry<br/>
denies targeting teens and

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.999
children, most think<br/>
those companies are

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:37.083
just blowing smoke.<br/>

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.999
After all, the majority of<br/>
smokers take up the habit

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:40.999
while in their teens.<br/>

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:44.375
And many adult smokers say they<br/>
would quit the habit if

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:45.999
they could.<br/>

00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:49.000
Tobacco advertising has been a<br/>
particularly favorite target

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.709
of President Bill Clinton, and<br/>
recent federal legislation

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:54.999
will try to curb the industry's<br/>
veiled attempts to

00:13:54.999 --> 00:13:56.999
target young people.<br/>

00:13:56.999 --> 00:14:00.999
But as Dan Jaffe says, the new<br/>
guidelines will be difficult.

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:04.751
if not impossible, to enforce,<br/>
and may even

00:14:04.751 --> 00:14:06.751
violate the First Amendment.<br/>

00:14:06.751 --> 00:14:08.542
Tobacco is a legal product.<br/>

00:14:08.542 --> 00:14:10.709
It's legal to sell to adults.<br/>

00:14:10.709 --> 00:14:13.999
If the ads are directed to being<br/>
sold to adults we think

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:17.209
that the government does<br/>
not have the power

00:14:17.209 --> 00:14:21.999
to stop their sale.<br/>

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:24.999
But if they are targeted to<br/>
young people they do, and the

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:28.999
Federal Trade Commission has<br/>
stated recently to us that

00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:33.792
they are looking at these<br/>
issues, and that they will be

00:14:33.792 --> 00:14:35.999
active in this area.<br/>

00:14:35.999 --> 00:14:39.999
And so we support strong<br/>
restrictions against targeting

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:45.999
to young people, but we do not<br/>
support blanket bans on

00:14:45.999 --> 00:14:46.999
tobacco advertising.<br/>

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:50.709
Still, most parents, educators,<br/>
and public health

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:53.834
officials support the<br/>
government's stance against

00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:55.999
tobacco advertising.<br/>

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:57.999
Although not officially banned<br/>
from advertising on

00:14:57.999 --> 00:15:01.334
television, the liquor or<br/>
distilled spirits industry had

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:04.999
followed a self-imposed policy<br/>
of not advertising in the

00:15:04.999 --> 00:15:07.999
electronic medium<br/>
for 48 years.

00:15:07.999 --> 00:15:11.167
But after watching its share of<br/>
the market drop steadily,

00:15:11.167 --> 00:15:14.999
while the market shares of<br/>
beer and wine, both heavy

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:17.792
users of television advertising,<br/>
climb, the

00:15:17.792 --> 00:15:21.626
distilled spirits industry<br/>
plans to change its tune.

00:15:21.626 --> 00:15:24.999
Fred Meister, the president and<br/>
chief executive officer of

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:27.999
the Distilled Spirits Council of<br/>
the United States, says his

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:30.999
organization completed<br/>
exhaustive research before

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:33.999
lifting its restrictions<br/>
on radio and television

00:15:33.999 --> 00:15:34.999
advertising.<br/>

00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:37.999
Most people thought we were<br/>
advertising on television

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:39.999
anyway, because they don't<br/>
understand the difference that

00:15:39.999 --> 00:15:43.999
beer or wine or say, malt<br/>
liquor, which is a form of

00:15:43.999 --> 00:15:45.999
beer, that it's really<br/>
different

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:47.999
than distilled spirits.<br/>

00:15:47.999 --> 00:15:49.999
And so they thought we<br/>
were advertising.

00:15:49.999 --> 00:15:53.292
When we told them we weren't<br/>
advertising on television,

00:15:53.292 --> 00:15:54.999
they thought there must<br/>
be some law or

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:56.542
regulation against it.<br/>

00:15:56.542 --> 00:15:59.542
And when we said, no, that's not<br/>
the case, we're doing it

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:03.667
for voluntary reasons, their<br/>
question was why?

00:16:03.667 --> 00:16:04.999
Why wouldn't you<br/>
use television?

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:07.999
Is there something wrong with<br/>
your product, because that's

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:11.292
the accepted way to advertise.<br/>

00:16:11.292 --> 00:16:14.999
What individuals were concerned<br/>
about was not,

00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:16.999
therefore, whether we advertise<br/>
on television, but

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.501
would we do it in a responsible<br/>
manner.

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:22.999
And would we avoid targeting<br/>
the under-aged.

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:26.000
Some think by not accepting ads<br/>
for distilled spirits, the

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.999
television and radio industry<br/>
is trying to head off an

00:16:28.999 --> 00:16:31.999
effort by some congressional<br/>
leaders to limit beer and wine

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:32.999
advertising.<br/>

00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:36.999
The beer industry currently<br/>
spends almost $1 billion a

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:38.999
year on television<br/>
advertising.

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:42.999
And most beer commercials air<br/>
during major sporting events

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:45.999
watched by both children<br/>
and adults.

00:16:45.999 --> 00:16:48.999
There are 100 million Americans<br/>
in the United States

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:51.042
who drink beverage alcohol,<br/>
beer wine and distilled

00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:53.999
spirits, on a responsible<br/>
basis.

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:57.999
And our advertising is directed<br/>
to those 100 million

00:16:57.999 --> 00:17:01.999
adult consumers, so that we<br/>
can bring them information

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:05.999
about our products in the same<br/>
way that beer and wine do now.

00:17:05.999 --> 00:17:09.999
We are not and never have and<br/>
never will direct our

00:17:09.999 --> 00:17:11.999
advertising at the under-aged.<br/>

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:14.417
Even if the ads aren't<br/>
designed to appeal to

00:17:14.417 --> 00:17:16.999
children, chances are the<br/>
commercials would air during

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:19.999
many televised sporting<br/>
events.

00:17:19.999 --> 00:17:23.250
Many broadcasters fear that a<br/>
backlash against beer and wine

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.999
advertising could cost them<br/>
millions of dollars.

00:17:26.999 --> 00:17:29.999
And also force such major<br/>
sporting events as the Super

00:17:29.999 --> 00:17:33.999
Bowl and World Series<br/>
to pay-per-view.

00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:37.999
Still, some lawmakers feel it's<br/>
unfair to crack down on

00:17:37.999 --> 00:17:40.999
tobacco advertising and<br/>
leave alcohol alone.

00:17:40.999 --> 00:17:43.999
After all, alcohol consumption<br/>
plays a major role in the

00:17:43.999 --> 00:17:46.918
three leading causes<br/>
of death--

00:17:46.918 --> 00:17:49.999
car crashes, homicides,<br/>
and suicides--

00:17:49.999 --> 00:17:52.999
for young people between<br/>
the ages of 16 and 24.

00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:56.209
We have always acknowledged the<br/>
fact that some people do

00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:59.999
abuse our product, and that<br/>
those people need to be

00:17:59.999 --> 00:18:03.918
educated and everybody needs to<br/>
be educated about alcohol.

00:18:03.918 --> 00:18:06.999
So we have spent millions of<br/>
dollars by the companies, as

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:09.709
well as the industry generally,<br/>
to help educate

00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:14.999
people, to help develop programs<br/>
that would treat

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:15.999
problems.<br/>

00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:18.876
The tobacco and alcohol<br/>
industries aren't the only

00:18:18.876 --> 00:18:20.626
advertisers that have<br/>
faced the wrath of

00:18:20.626 --> 00:18:22.999
parents and child advocates.<br/>

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:25.999
Over the last three decades the<br/>
fashion industry has also

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:28.999
come under fire for using<br/>
ultra-thin models in their

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:31.999
campaigns, thus sending a<br/>
message to young girls in

00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:35.999
particular and women in general<br/>
that thin is in.

00:18:35.999 --> 00:18:38.042
And since the number of women<br/>
suffering from eating

00:18:38.042 --> 00:18:41.999
disorders has skyrocketed over<br/>
the last 20 years, social

00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:46.709
analysts point to advertising<br/>
as a primary culprit.

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:48.999
You don't see overweight people<br/>
in advertising or in

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:51.999
the movies generally,<br/>
or on television.

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:56.999
And it becomes an unrealistic<br/>
kind of role model for them

00:18:56.999 --> 00:19:00.542
and they're not old enough--<br/>
or they're impressionable

00:19:00.542 --> 00:19:01.999
enough, maybe it has more<br/>
to do with their

00:19:01.999 --> 00:19:02.999
impressionability--<br/>

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:07.999
that these kind of messages hit<br/>
them harder than it would

00:19:07.999 --> 00:19:11.999
a 25 year old woman, if you<br/>
will, or somebody who's more

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:14.999
in an adult stage<br/>
in their life.

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:18.667
It's the nature of the fashion<br/>
industry to push the envelope,

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:20.999
to always be on the<br/>
cutting edge.

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:23.999
Fashion ads, like the products<br/>
they feature, are often

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:28.999
provocative, bold, sensual,<br/>
and striking.

00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:31.999
But some critics think fashion<br/>
designer Calvin Klein crossed

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:35.751
the line of good taste for the<br/>
recent campaign that featured

00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:39.999
young models in poses some<br/>
felt were pornographic.

00:19:39.999 --> 00:19:42.999
Anything beauty and fashion<br/>
related has to be on the edge

00:19:42.999 --> 00:19:44.999
and has to be provocative,<br/>
because that's

00:19:44.999 --> 00:19:45.999
what it's all about.<br/>

00:19:45.999 --> 00:19:51.999
It's about moving the envelope<br/>
constantly, and being part of

00:19:51.999 --> 00:19:54.999
the sophisticated, provocative<br/>
edge and not being in the

00:19:54.999 --> 00:19:55.999
mainstream.<br/>

00:19:55.999 --> 00:19:58.999
And then the problem becomes we<br/>
have no mainstream anymore,

00:19:58.999 --> 00:20:01.751
everything is edgy and<br/>
everything is provocative.

00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:03.999
Others said the models'<br/>
fashion resembled teen

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:06.250
prostitutes on heroin.<br/>

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.999
Even though Calvin Klein pulled<br/>
the ads after a public

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:15.999
outcry, sales of his jeans rose<br/>
to 462 million in 1995

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:18.999
from 113 million the<br/>
previous year.

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:21.999
Yet Calvin Klein and advertising<br/>
controversy are

00:20:21.999 --> 00:20:23.667
old friends.<br/>

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:26.834
He's attracted the public's<br/>
attention before with previous

00:20:26.834 --> 00:20:28.999
jeans and fragrance ads.<br/>

00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:32.999
A savvy businessman, Klein knows<br/>
all too well that an ad

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:36.709
that makes people talk garners<br/>
more publicity and exposure

00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:37.999
than you pay for.<br/>

00:20:37.999 --> 00:20:40.999
Yet Klein and his fashion<br/>
cohorts are not the only

00:20:40.999 --> 00:20:45.999
advertisers who practice the<br/>
old axiom sex sells.

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:48.999
Naked or nearly naked bodies<br/>
are showing up in ads for

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:53.999
everything from fashion to<br/>
furniture and perfume to milk.

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:56.959
As nudity has become more<br/>
prevalent in movies and

00:20:56.959 --> 00:20:59.999
television, Americans are rarely<br/>
shocked by what they

00:20:59.999 --> 00:21:01.584
see in ads.<br/>

00:21:01.584 --> 00:21:05.999
As David Collins points out, our<br/>
comfort level has changed.

00:21:05.999 --> 00:21:09.999
What we used to think as<br/>
absolutely outrageous is now

00:21:09.999 --> 00:21:11.375
accepted as normal.<br/>

00:21:11.375 --> 00:21:16.999
I can remember when I was a<br/>
child going into a drugstore

00:21:16.999 --> 00:21:21.999
and there would be paperbacks<br/>
on the stand and there would

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:26.999
be a picture of a woman<br/>
dressed in a negligee.

00:21:26.999 --> 00:21:28.999
And I used to think as a child,<br/>
this is absolutely

00:21:28.999 --> 00:21:30.709
unbelievable.<br/>

00:21:30.709 --> 00:21:33.792
This is just so exciting.<br/>

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.918
Today you go to the grocery<br/>
store and there are pictures

00:21:36.918 --> 00:21:38.999
of women with nothing on,<br/>
or men with nothing on.

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:43.999
So the whole norm of acceptable<br/>
behavior has eroded

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:44.999
in this country.<br/>

00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:47.999
Another routine advertising<br/>
technique that has often come

00:21:47.999 --> 00:21:50.999
under attack is the use of<br/>
celebrities to promote and

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:52.999
sell products.<br/>

00:21:52.999 --> 00:21:55.918
Sports stars, entertainers, and<br/>
even politicians who have

00:21:55.918 --> 00:21:57.999
left office have pitched<br/>
everything from

00:21:57.999 --> 00:22:00.083
underwear to cereal.<br/>

00:22:00.083 --> 00:22:03.999
While advertisers say using a<br/>
celebrity adds excitement and

00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:06.999
instant credibility to a<br/>
product, many think the

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:09.999
practice is unethical,<br/>
especially if the star doesn't

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:11.999
regularly use the product.<br/>

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:14.999
How big can a logo get on a<br/>
shirt before you finally say

00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:16.999
that logo is too big.<br/>

00:22:16.999 --> 00:22:20.501
And so I've taken great<br/>
satisfaction over the years

00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:22.999
that these things do tend<br/>
to ebb and flow.

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.209
<br/>

00:22:25.209 --> 00:22:27.999
An advertiser in one sense would<br/>
want to have their brand

00:22:27.999 --> 00:22:30.999
on the back of a<br/>
shirt that big.

00:22:30.999 --> 00:22:34.918
Kids finally say, I<br/>
don't like that.

00:22:34.918 --> 00:22:37.999
Kids, while I said before that<br/>
they are a very vulnerable

00:22:37.999 --> 00:22:39.999
group, they're very<br/>
street savvy.

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:43.999
And when they're clothes start<br/>
to get taken over by the big

00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:46.751
brands, they go, I don't<br/>
want that anymore.

00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:48.999
An ongoing campaign for the<br/>
milk industry has featured

00:22:48.999 --> 00:22:51.999
celebrities from all<br/>
walks of life.

00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:55.918
But some think the seemingly<br/>
innocuous campaign has at

00:22:55.918 --> 00:22:57.999
times overstepped<br/>
the boundaries.

00:22:57.999 --> 00:23:00.999
The milk campaign is one that<br/>
I think that's quite

00:23:00.999 --> 00:23:03.999
interesting, because they've<br/>
been very successful in

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:07.999
getting well known people.<br/>

00:23:07.999 --> 00:23:11.999
And it's a good segmentation one<br/>
as well because they have

00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:14.999
sports figures, Cal Ripken or<br/>
the Monday Night Football

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:19.501
crew, in sport magazines, aimed<br/>
at the sports fans.

00:23:19.501 --> 00:23:22.999
And they have the well known<br/>
Hollywood celebrities in

00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:24.999
general interest magazines.<br/>

00:23:24.999 --> 00:23:29.125
But the comment I would make is<br/>
that there seems to be more

00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:32.999
sex appeal than is necessary for<br/>
that product which is kind

00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:36.999
of associated with you know<br/>
family values, however

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:38.999
ill-defined they are.<br/>

00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:40.999
While companies and businesses<br/>
have been advertising their

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:44.999
products and services for<br/>
centuries, relatively new

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:47.999
players in the advertising mix<br/>
are those who use commercials

00:23:47.999 --> 00:23:51.999
and print ads to promote their<br/>
positions or ideas.

00:23:51.999 --> 00:23:54.999
Politicians were the first ones<br/>
to enter that fray and

00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:58.709
have created controversies of<br/>
their own with ads that many

00:23:58.709 --> 00:24:01.999
say are deceptive and<br/>
manipulative.

00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:04.999
Yet as any candidate for a major<br/>
office will tell you,

00:24:04.999 --> 00:24:06.999
very few will win<br/>
without a large

00:24:06.999 --> 00:24:08.999
television advertising budget.<br/>

00:24:08.999 --> 00:24:11.999
Through the years, public<br/>
service announcements and ads

00:24:11.999 --> 00:24:13.999
have been credited with<br/>
promoting the widespread use

00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:17.999
of seat belts, increasing<br/>
awareness about the dangers of

00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:20.999
drinking and driving,<br/>
understanding the effects of

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:23.834
cigarette smoking, and stopping<br/>
the spread of

00:24:23.834 --> 00:24:25.999
misinformation about AIDS.<br/>

00:24:25.999 --> 00:24:29.209
In the past, television networks<br/>
and stations have

00:24:29.209 --> 00:24:31.999
avoided issue advertising.<br/>

00:24:31.999 --> 00:24:34.626
And although they are more<br/>
likely to consider those ads

00:24:34.626 --> 00:24:38.667
now, Dan Jaffe points out that<br/>
those groups still must clear

00:24:38.667 --> 00:24:41.999
several hurdles before a<br/>
commercial actually airs.

00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:43.999
Getting ads on television<br/>
is very difficult.

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:46.999
About a third of the ads that<br/>
go on the networks have been

00:24:46.999 --> 00:24:49.999
modified in some way because the<br/>
networks themselves look

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:52.999
at every ad to decide whether<br/>
they think that they are

00:24:52.999 --> 00:24:54.042
accurate and appropriate.<br/>

00:24:54.042 --> 00:24:56.999
In the early days of television,<br/>
corporations used

00:24:56.999 --> 00:25:00.999
to sponsor and often produce<br/>
entire programs. Their names

00:25:00.999 --> 00:25:04.083
usually appeared in the title,<br/>
and only their commercials ran

00:25:04.083 --> 00:25:05.999
during the program.<br/>

00:25:05.999 --> 00:25:08.999
But in today's cluttered<br/>
environment, companies are

00:25:08.999 --> 00:25:11.999
sponsoring halftime reports and<br/>
sporting events and paying

00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:14.999
enormous amounts of money to<br/>
have their name and logos

00:25:14.999 --> 00:25:17.999
attached to bowl games,<br/>
stadiums,

00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:19.999
and basketball floors.<br/>

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:23.999
Visibility is a powerful<br/>
advertising tool, but

00:25:23.999 --> 00:25:26.999
over-commercialization<br/>
may turn people off.

00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:29.999
It goes in waves, where we<br/>
get over-saturated with

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:31.999
advertising and people<br/>
just tune out.

00:25:31.999 --> 00:25:34.125
And also, it really has to<br/>
do with the economy.

00:25:34.125 --> 00:25:37.999
It's really that the old<br/>
capitalism thing, when people

00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:39.999
can't buy, they get annoyed<br/>
by advertising.

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:42.999
If they have some money,<br/>
they like advertising.

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:45.999
So we get waves of saturation<br/>
where people tune out, and

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:48.999
then suddenly things turn around<br/>
again, or some kind of

00:25:48.999 --> 00:25:51.999
brilliant new graphic appears<br/>
and people get interested

00:25:51.999 --> 00:25:54.999
because people want to be<br/>
visually stimulated and they

00:25:54.999 --> 00:25:55.999
want to be entertained.<br/>

00:25:55.999 --> 00:25:57.999
That's what the culture<br/>
is all about.

00:25:57.999 --> 00:26:00.999
Consumers have several options<br/>
when they're offended by

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:02.999
advertising campaigns.<br/>

00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:05.999
While they can rant and rave<br/>
all they want to company

00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:08.999
officials and advertising<br/>
agencies, perhaps the most

00:26:08.999 --> 00:26:11.999
powerful way to express<br/>
opposition is to avoid or

00:26:11.999 --> 00:26:13.999
boycott the products.<br/>

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:17.125
And Lippert thinks parents and<br/>
schools should teach children

00:26:17.125 --> 00:26:18.959
about advertising.<br/>

00:26:18.959 --> 00:26:21.999
I think that if the parents<br/>
aren't at home seeing through

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:24.999
advertising in television and<br/>
knowing how to interpret it,

00:26:24.999 --> 00:26:27.999
that there really should be<br/>
media literacy courses in

00:26:27.999 --> 00:26:28.999
school, and increasingly<br/>
there are.

00:26:28.999 --> 00:26:30.999
Kids love to watch television.<br/>

00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:32.876
They love to watch<br/>
commercials.

00:26:32.876 --> 00:26:34.999
Why not have a course in school,<br/>
and not make fun of

00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:38.334
it, of how to watch advertising<br/>
so that you can

00:26:38.334 --> 00:26:40.999
see through it and you can<br/>
understand the manipulation

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:42.999
behind it and you can get<br/>
out of it what you want

00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:43.999
to get out of it.<br/>

00:26:43.999 --> 00:26:47.918
The remote control and the VCR<br/>
have helped push television

00:26:47.918 --> 00:26:49.999
advertising standards<br/>
to the edge.

00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:51.999
Viewers are no longer<br/>
captive by a

00:26:51.999 --> 00:26:53.999
particular station or network.<br/>

00:26:53.999 --> 00:26:57.083
They can channel surf during<br/>
commercials or record a

00:26:57.083 --> 00:27:01.000
favorite program and zap the<br/>
ads when they replay it.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.999
Television ads have become<br/>
shorter, slicker, and bolder.

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:07.999
They must grab viewer's<br/>
attention quickly

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:09.999
and maintain it.<br/>

00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:12.999
You don't want to be dull, but<br/>
you don't want to be so edgy.

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:15.999
So how do you hold that tension<br/>
properly, to be able

00:27:15.999 --> 00:27:18.999
to then really get the insights<br/>
that will lead you to

00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:21.999
a responsible conversation which<br/>
is nothing more than the

00:27:21.999 --> 00:27:22.999
give and take.<br/>

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:24.999
And that is the dance<br/>
of business, it's

00:27:24.999 --> 00:27:25.999
the dance of life.<br/>

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:29.999
The tension between advertising<br/>
and ethics will

00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:32.375
probably never disappear as<br/>
the business world becomes

00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:35.999
increasingly more global<br/>
and more competitive.

00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:39.999
The burden to keep advertising<br/>
appropriate and truthful falls

00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:41.999
on the shoulders of many.<br/>

00:27:41.999 --> 00:27:47.999
Businesses who advertise,<br/>
agencies that create the ads.

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:51.999
media who accept and run the<br/>
ads, and consumers who

00:27:51.999 --> 00:27:54.999
ultimately decide if the<br/>
ad is effective.

00:27:54.999 --> 00:29:03.999
<br/>
