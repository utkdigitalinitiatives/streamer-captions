00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:52.500


2
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Boatswain!

3
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.730
Here, master!

4
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.800
What cheer?

5
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.700
Good, speak to the mariners:

6
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.330
fall to't, yarely, or we run ourselves aground:

7
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.730
bestir, bestir!

8
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.500
Heigh, my hearts!

9
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.600
Cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!

10
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.500
Yare, yare!

11
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.570
Take in the topsail.

12
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.700
Tend to the master's whistle.

13
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.370
Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!

14
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.570
Good boatswain, have care.

15
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.830
Where's the master?

16
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.970
Play the men.

17
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.770
I pray now, keep below!

18
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.830
Where is the master, boatswain?

19
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.370
Do you not hear him?

20
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.630
You mar our labour: keep to your cabins:

21
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.800
you do assist the storm.

22
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.400
Nay, good, be patient.

23
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.570
When the sea is.

24
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.670
Hence!

25
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.800
What cares these roarers for the name of king?

26
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.230
To cabin: silence!

27
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.370
Trouble us not.

28
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.330
Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

29
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.170
None that I more love than myself.

30
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.370
You are a counsellor;

31
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.500
if you can command these elements to silence,

32
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.170
and work the peace of the present,

33
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.400
we will not hand a rope more; use your authority:

34
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.700
if you cannot, give thanks you have lived so long,

35
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.470
and make yourself ready in your cabin

36
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.430
for the mischance of the hour, if it so hap.

37
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.870
Cheerly, good hearts!

38
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.770
Out of our way, I say!

39
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.030
I have great comfort from this fellow:

40
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.670
methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him;

41
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.870
his complexion is perfect gallows.

42
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.430
Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:

43
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.730
make the rope of his destiny our cable,

44
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.200
for our own doth little advantage.

45
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.970
If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

46
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.500
Down with the topmast!

47
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.600
Yare!

48
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.070
Lower, lower!

49
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.670
Bring her to try with main-course.

50
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.970
A plague upon this howling!

51
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.500
They are louder than the weather or our office.

52
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.370
Yet again!

53
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.800
What do you here?

54
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.270
Shall we give o'er and drown?

55
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.370
Have you a mind to sink?

56
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.470
A pox o' your throat,

57
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.670
you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!

58
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.830
Work you then.

59
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.930
Hang, cur!

60
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.970
Hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!

61
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.100
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art!

62
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.570
I'll warrant him for drowning;

63
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.070
though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell

64
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.270
and as leaky as an unstanched wench.

65
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.730
Lay her a-hold, a-hold!

66
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.600
Set her two courses off to sea again;

67
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.830
lay her off!

68
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.330
To prayers, to prayers!

69
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.700
What, must our mouths be cold?

70
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.230
The king and prince at prayers!

71
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.700
Let's assist them, For our case is as theirs.

72
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.100
I'm out of patience.

73
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.970
We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:

74
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.430
This wide-chapp'd rascal-- would thou mightst lie drowning

75
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.070
The washing of ten tides!

76
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:44.600
He'll be hang'd yet,

77
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.930
Though every drop of water swear against it

78
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.670
And gape at widest to glut him.

79
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.470
Let's all sink with the king!

80
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.600
Let's take leave of him.

81
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.870
Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea

82
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.270
for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze,

83
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.430
any thing.

84
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.200
The wills above be done.

85
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.730
But I would fain die a dry death.

86
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.970
If by your art, my dearest father, you have

87
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.530
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.

88
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.730
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,

89
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.030
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,

90
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.130
Dashes the fire out.

91
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.600
O, I have suffered

92
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.400
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,

93
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.800
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,

94
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.030
Dash'd all to pieces.

95
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.400
O, the cry did knock

96
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.970
Against my very heart.

97
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.100
Poor souls, they perish'd.

98
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.800
Had I been any god of power, I would

99
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.670
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere

100
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.730
It should the good ship so have swallow'd and

101
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.500
The fraughting souls within her.

102
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.930
Be collected:

103
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.100
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart

104
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.200
There's no harm done.

105
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.500
O, woe the day.

106
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.770
No harm.

107
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.330
I have done nothing but in care of thee,

108
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.200
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who

109
00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.900
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing

110
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.970
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better

111
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.770
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,

112
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.700
And thy no greater father.

113
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.800
More to know

114
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.770
Did never meddle with my thoughts.

115
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.770
'Tis time I should inform thee farther.

116
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.730
Lend thy hand,

117
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.000
And pluck my magic garment from me.

118
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:19.000
So: Lie there, my art.

119
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.900
Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.

120
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.770
The direful spectacle of the wreck, that touch'd

121
00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.730
The very virtue of compassion in thee,

122
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.530
I have with such provision in mine art

123
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.270
So safely ordered that there is no soul--

124
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.030
No, not so much perdition as an hair

125
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.330
Betid to any creature in the vessel

126
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.830
That thou heard'st cry, that thou saw'st sink.

127
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.800
Sit down;

128
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.270
For thou must now know farther.

129
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.330
You have often

130
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.830
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd

131
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.970
And left me to a bootless inquisition,

132
00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.600
Concluding "Stay: not yet."

133
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.300
The hour's now come;

134
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.630
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;

135
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.370
Obey and be attentive.

136
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.630
Canst thou remember

137
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.630
A time before we came unto this cell?

138
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.870
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not

139
00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.970
Out three years old.

140
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:15.470
Certainly, sir, I can.

141
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.100
By what?

142
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.900
By any other house or person?

143
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.730
Of any thing the image tell me that

144
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.500
Hath kept with thy remembrance.

145
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.970
'Tis far off

146
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.270
And rather like a dream than an assurance

147
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.030
That my remembrance warrants.

148
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.600
Had I not

149
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.570
Four or five women once that tended me?

150
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.530
Thou hadst, and more, Miranda.

151
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.730
But how is it

152
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.270
That this lives in thy mind?

153
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.400
What seest thou else

154
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.670
In the dark backward and abysm of time?

155
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.100
If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,

156
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.000
How thou camest here thou mayst.

157
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.870
But that I do not.

158
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:58.030
Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,

159
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.400
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and

160
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.800
A prince of power.

161
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.070
Sir, are not you my father?

162
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.070
Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and

163
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.070
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father

164
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.770
Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir

165
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:17.430
And princess no worse issued.

166
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.700
O the heavens.

167
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.030
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?

168
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.130
Or blessed was't that we did?

169
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.630
Both, both, my girl:

170
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:30.400
By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,

171
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.900
But blessedly holp hither.

172
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.230
O, my heart bleeds

173
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.370
To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,

174
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.770
Which is from my remembrance.

175
00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.270
Please you, farther.

176
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:50.800
My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--

177
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.030
I pray thee, mark me-- that a brother should

178
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.730
Be so perfidious.

179
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.330
He whom next thyself

180
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.400
Of all the world I loved and to him put

181
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.300
The manage of my state; which at that time

182
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:04.300
Through all the signories it was the first

183
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.100
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed

184
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.730
In dignity, and for the liberal arts

185
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.730
Without a parallel; those being all my study,

186
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.270
The government I cast upon my brother

187
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:22.570
And to my state grew stranger, being transported

188
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:25.300
And rapt in secret studies.

189
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:27.500
Thy false uncle-- Dost thou attend me?

190
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.630
Sir, most heedfully.

191
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.930
Being once perfected how to grant suits,

192
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.130
How to deny them, who to advance, who

193
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.700
To trash for over-topping, new created

194
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.470
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,

195
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.130
Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key

196
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.000
Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state

197
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.830
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was

198
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.400
The ivy that had hid my princely trunk,

199
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.300
And suck'd my verdure out on't.

200
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.600
Thou attend'st not.

201
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.730
O, good sir, I do.

202
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.330
I pray thee, mark me.

203
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.700
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated

204
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.570
To closeness and the bettering of my mind

205
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.830
in my false brother

206
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.100
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,

207
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.170
Like a good parent, did beget of him

208
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:11.070
A falsehood in its contrary as great

209
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.030
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,

210
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:15.230
A confidence sans bound.

211
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.270
He being thus lorded,

212
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.100
Not only with what my revenue yielded,

213
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.770
But what my power might else exact,

214
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.000
he did believe

215
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.430
He was indeed the duke; hence his ambition growing--

216
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:25.570
Dost thou hear?

217
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:27.330
Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

218
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.400
To have no screen between this part he play'd

219
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.430
And him he play'd it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan.

220
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:36.900
Me, poor man, my library

221
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.230
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties

222
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.170
He thinks me now incapable; confederates--

223
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.070
So dry he was for sway-- wi' the King of Naples

224
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.200
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,

225
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.600
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend

226
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.600
The dukedom yet unbow'd-- alas, poor Milan--

227
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.430
To most ignoble stooping.

228
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.800
O the heavens.

229
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.830
Mark his condition and the event; and then tell me

230
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.900
If this might be a brother.

231
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.000
I should sin

232
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.270
To think but nobly of my grandmother:

233
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.630
Good wombs have borne bad sons.

234
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.570
Now the condition.

235
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.230
This King of Naples, being an enemy

236
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.270
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;

237
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.500
Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises

238
00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.630
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,

239
00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.830
Should presently extirpate me and mine

240
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.870
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan

241
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:35.870
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,

242
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.400
A treacherous army levied, one midnight

243
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.500
Fated for the purpose did Antonio open

244
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.800
The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,

245
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.470
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence

246
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:49.870
Me and thy crying self.

247
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.670
Alack, for pity.

248
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.200
I, not remembering how I cried out then,

249
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.300
Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint

250
00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.800
That wrings mine eyes to't.

251
00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.970
Hear a little further

252
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.330
And then I'll bring thee to this present business

253
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:04.570
That now's upon's; without the which this story

254
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.700
Were most impertinent.

255
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.900
Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us?

256
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.470
Well demanded, wench: My tale provokes that question.

257
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:11.600
Dear, they durst not,

258
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.900
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set

259
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.500
A mark so bloody on the business, but

260
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.030
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.

261
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.730
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,

262
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.900
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared

263
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.400
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,

264
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.630
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats

265
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.900
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,

266
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.100
To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh

267
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.970
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,

268
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.170
Did us but loving wrong.

269
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.030
Alas, what trouble

270
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.400
Was I then to you.

271
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.300
O, a cherubim

272
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.030
Thou wast that did preserve me.

273
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:03.370
Thou didst smile.

274
00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.900
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,

275
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.230
When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,

276
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.970
Under my burden groan'd; that raised in me

277
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.570
An undergoing stomach, to bear up

278
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.870
Against what should ensue.

279
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.530
How came we ashore?

280
00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:21.130
By Providence divine.

281
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.070
Some food we had and some fresh water that

282
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:29.030
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,

283
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:32.800
Out of his charity who, being then appointed

284
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.130
Master of this design, did give us, with

285
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:37.730
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,

286
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:42.600
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,

287
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.230
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me

288
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.830
From mine own library with volumes that I prize

289
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:51.870
above my dukedom.

290
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.070
Would I might

291
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:54.830
But ever see that man.

292
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.000
Now I arise:

293
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.270
Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.

294
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:12.200
Here in this island we arrived; and here

295
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.400
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit

296
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.530
Than other princesses can that have more time

297
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:22.400
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

298
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.370
Heavens thank you for't.

299
00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.130
And now, I pray you, sir,

300
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.430
For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason

301
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.170
For raising this sea-storm?

302
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.130
Know thus far forth.

303
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:38.830
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,

304
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.730
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies

305
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:47.800
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience

306
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.370
I find my zenith doth depend upon

307
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.570
A most auspicious star, whose influence

308
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.570
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes

309
00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.430
Will ever after droop.

310
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:59.030
Here cease more questions:

311
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:03.100
Thou art inclined to sleep.

312
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.070
'Tis a good dullness.

313
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:21.300
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.

314
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.730
Come away, servant, come.

315
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.930
I am ready now.

316
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:35.100
Approach, my Ariel, come.

317
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.170
All hail, great master!

318
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.330
Grave sir, hail!

319
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.470
I come

320
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.930
To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,

321
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.330
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride

322
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:48.970
On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task

323
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:51.800
Ariel and all his quality.

324
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.070
Hast thou, spirit,

325
00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.130
Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

326
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.670
To every article.

327
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.630
I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,

328
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.670
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,

329
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.530
I flamed amazement: sometime I'd divide,

330
00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.300
And burn in many places; the topmast,

331
00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.030
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,

332
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.330
Then meet and join.

333
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.530
Jove's lightning, the precursors

334
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.070
O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary

335
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.600
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks

336
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.270
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune

337
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.600
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,

338
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.670
Yea, his dread trident shake.

339
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.370
My brave spirit.

340
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.930
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil

341
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.300
Would not infect his reason?

342
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.400
Not a soul

343
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.130
But felt a fever of the mad and play'd

344
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:36.500
Some tricks of desperation.

345
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.800
All but mariners

346
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.270
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,

347
00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:47.370
Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,

348
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.500
With hair up-staring-- then like reeds, not hair--

349
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.530
Was the first man that leap'd; cried, "Hell is empty

350
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.870
And all the devils are here."

351
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.170
Why that's my spirit!

352
00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.970
But was not this nigh shore?

353
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:02.130
Close by, my master.

354
00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.830
But are they, Ariel, safe?

355
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.000
Not a hair perish'd;

356
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.270
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,

357
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:11.000
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,

358
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.400
In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.

359
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.800
The king's son have I landed by himself;

360
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.270
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs

361
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:22.070
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,

362
00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:27.530
His arms in this sad knot.

363
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.730
Of the king's ship

364
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.600
The mariners say how thou hast disposed

365
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.330
And all the rest o' the fleet.

366
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.530
Safely in harbour

367
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.730
Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once

368
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.770
Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew

369
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.170
From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:

370
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.100
The mariners all under hatches stow'd;

371
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.500
Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,

372
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.470
I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet

373
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.200
Which I dispersed, they have all met again

374
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.570
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,

375
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:56.930
Bound sadly home for Naples,

376
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.300
Supposing they saw the king's ship wreck'd

377
00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.400
And his great person perish.

378
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.630
Ariel, thy charge

379
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.900
Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.

380
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.270
What is the time o' the day?

381
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.870
Past the mid season.

382
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.200
At least two glasses.

383
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.830
The time 'twixt six and now

384
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.170
Must by us both be spent most preciously.

385
00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.000
Is there more toil?

386
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.400
Since thou dost give me pains,

387
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.530
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,

388
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.930
Which is not yet perform'd me.

389
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.030
How now? Moody?

390
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.400
What is't thou canst demand?

391
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.830
My liberty.

392
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.270
Before the time be out?

393
00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.400
No more!

394
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.500
I prithee,

395
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.470
Remember I have done thee worthy service;

396
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.800
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served

397
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.230
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise

398
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:37.070
To bate me a full year.

399
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.400
Dost thou forget

400
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.870
From what a torment I did free thee?

401
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.170
No.

402
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.800
Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze

403
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.000
Of the salt deep,

404
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.870
To run upon the sharp winds of the north,

405
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.800
To do me business in the veins o' the earth

406
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.100
When it is baked with frost.

407
00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.200
I do not, sir.

408
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.100
Thou liest, malignant thing.

409
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.600
Hast thou forgot

410
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.830
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy

411
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.000
Was grown into a hoop?

412
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.100
Hast thou forgot her?

413
00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:10.200
No.

414
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.030
Thou hast.

415
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.930
Where was she born?

416
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:22.100
Speak; tell me.

417
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.100
Sir, in Argier.

418
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.730
O, was she so?

419
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.830
I must

420
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.870
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,

421
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.170
Which thou forget'st.

422
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.770
This damn'd witch Sycorax,

423
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.030
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible

424
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:37.800
To enter human hearing, from Argier,

425
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.100
Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did

426
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.470
They would not take her life.

427
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.570
Is not this true?

428
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.870
Ay, sir.

429
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:46.630
This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child

430
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.600
And here was left by the sailors.

431
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.630
Thou, my slave,

432
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.870
As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;

433
00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.130
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate

434
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.030
To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,

435
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.370
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,

436
00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:09.670
By help of her more potent ministers

437
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:11.800
And in a most unmitigable rage,

438
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.170
Into a cloven pine; within which rift

439
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.270
Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain

440
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.570
A dozen years; within which space she died

441
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.330
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans

442
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.770
As fast as mill-wheels strike.

443
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.970
Then was this island--

444
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.300
Save for the son that she did litter here,

445
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.500
A freckled whelp hag-born-- not honour'd with

446
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.600
A human shape.

447
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.700
Yes, Caliban her son.

448
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.530
Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban

449
00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:43.000
Whom now I keep in service.

450
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:45.730
Thou best know'st

451
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:50.700
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans

452
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.030
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts

453
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.830
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment

454
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.570
To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax

455
00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:03.200
Could not again undo: it was mine art,

456
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.330
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape

457
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.400
The pine and let thee out.

458
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.600
I thank thee, master.

459
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:19.570
If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak

460
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.500
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till

461
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.270
Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

462
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:32.070
Pardon, master; I will be correspondent to command

463
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:35.600
And do my spiriting gently.

464
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:45.070
Do so, and after two days I will discharge thee.

465
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.430
That's my noble master!

466
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.830
What shall I do?

467
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.930
Say what; what shall I do?

468
00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:57.830
Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject

469
00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.670
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible

470
00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.400
To every eyeball else.

471
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.700
Go take this shape

472
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.130
And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence.

473
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:17.500
Awake, dear heart, awake.

474
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:23.530
Thou hast slept well; Awake.

475
00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.570
The strangeness of your story has put

476
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.030
Heaviness in me.

477
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.370
Shake it off.

478
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.570
Come on;

479
00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:33.900
We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never

480
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.170
Yields us kind answer.

481
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.200
'Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on.

482
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.300
But, as 'tis,

483
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.230
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,

484
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.130
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices

485
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.230
That profit us.

486
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.330
What, ho!

487
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.500
Slave. Caliban.

488
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.630
Thou earth, thou.

489
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:48.930
Speak!

490
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:51.330
There's wood enough within!

491
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:52.600
Come forth, I say!

492
00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.270
There's other business for thee.

493
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.230
Come, thou tortoise!

494
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.730
When?

495
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:59.830
Fine apparition.

496
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:01.000
My quaint Ariel,

497
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.330
Hark in thine ear.

498
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.770
My lord it shall be done.

499
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.130
Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself

500
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.270
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

501
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.600
As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd

502
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.630
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen

503
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:23.000
Drop on you both!

504
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.900
A south-west blow on ye

505
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.230
And blister you all o'er!

506
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:29.830
For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,

507
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.500
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins

508
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.730
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,

509
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.030
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd

510
00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.430
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging

511
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:43.000
Than bees that made 'em.

512
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.630
I must eat my dinner!

513
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.670
This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,

514
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.300
Which thou takest from me.

515
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.000
When thou camest first,

516
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.830
Thou strokedst me and made much of me, wouldst give me

517
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:00.630
Water with berries in't, and teach me how

518
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:02.670
To name the bigger light, and how the less,

519
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:07.270
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee

520
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:10.670
And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,

521
00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:15.170
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:

522
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.630
Cursed be I that did so!

523
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.900
All the charms

524
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.530
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!

525
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.930
For I am all the subjects that you have,

526
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.970
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me

527
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.670
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me

528
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.070
The rest o' the island.

529
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.230
Thou most lying slave,

530
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.600
Whom stripes may move, not kindness.

531
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.030
I have used thee,

532
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.730
Filth as thou art, with human care, lodged thee

533
00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.970
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate

534
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.330
The honour of my child.

535
00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.600
O ho, O ho!

536
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.470
Would't had been done!

537
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.830
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else

538
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.800
This isle with Calibans.

539
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.170
Abhorred slave,

540
00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.270
Which any print of goodness will not take,

541
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.630
Being capable of all ill.

542
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:09.900
I pitied thee,

543
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.770
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour

544
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.000
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,

545
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.230
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like

546
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.700
A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes

547
00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:21.900
With words which made them known.

548
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.530
But thy vile race,

549
00:25:24.530 --> 00:25:27.570
Though thou didst learn, had that in't which good natures

550
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.770
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou

551
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.530
Deservedly confined into this rock,

552
00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.370
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

553
00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.830
You taught me language; and my profit on't

554
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.170
Is, I know how to curse.

555
00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:41.830
The red plague rid you

556
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.470
For learning me your language!

557
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.070
Hag-seed, hence!

558
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.830
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,

559
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.170
To answer other business.

560
00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:53.070
Shrug'st thou, malice?

561
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:58.470
If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly

562
00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:04.470
What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,

563
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:09.130
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar

564
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.230
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

565
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.400
No, pray thee!

566
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:20.070
I must obey: his art is of such power,

567
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.400
It would control my dam's god, Setebos,

568
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.800
and make a vassal of him.

569
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.870
So, slave; hence!

570
00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.600
Come unto these yellow sands,

571
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.170
And then take hands:

572
00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:46.100
Courtsied when you have and kiss'd

573
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.030
The wild waves whist,

574
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:55.000
Foot it featly here and there;

575
00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.200
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear.

576
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.400
Hark, hark.

577
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:07.300
The watch-dogs bark.

578
00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.300
Hark, hark, hark.

579
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.900
I hear

580
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.600
The strain of strutting chanticleer

581
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.530
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow!

582
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.530
Where should this music be?

583
00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.370
I' the air or the earth?

584
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.270
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon

585
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.770
Some god o' the island.

586
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.570
Sitting on a bank,

587
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.770
Weeping again the king my father's wreck,

588
00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.970
This music crept by me upon the waters,

589
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.630
Allaying both their fury and my passion

590
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.930
With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,

591
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.100
Or it hath drawn me rather.

592
00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.470
But 'tis gone.

593
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.130
No, it begins again.

594
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:12.500
Full fathom five thy father lies;

595
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:18.930
Of his bones are coral made;

596
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:24.900
Those are pearls that were his eyes:

597
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:30.900
Nothing of him that doth fade

598
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.830
But doth suffer a sea-change

599
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:40.070
Into something rich and strange.

600
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.900
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.

601
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:50.330
Ding-dong, ding-dong.

602
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:51.730
Hark.

603
00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:55.130
Now I hear them.

604
00:28:55.130 --> 00:29:02.700
Ding-dong, bell.

605
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.370
The ditty does remember my drown'd father.

606
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:10.330
This is no mortal business, nor no sound

607
00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.000
That the earth owes.

608
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.130
I hear it now above me.

609
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.100
The fringed curtains of thine eye advance

610
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.130
And say what thou seest yond.

611
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.030
What is it?

612
00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.000
A spirit?

613
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.300
Lord, how it looks about!

614
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.030
Believe me, sir,

615
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:32.330
It carries a brave form.

616
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.330
But 'tis a spirit.

617
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:38.700
No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses

618
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:42.170
As we have, such.

619
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:43.530
This gallant that thou seest

620
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:46.430
Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd

621
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.930
With grief that's beauty's canker,

622
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.130
thou mightst call him

623
00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.630
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows

624
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.400
And strays about to find them.

625
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.600
I might call him

626
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.600
A thing divine, for nothing natural

627
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.730
I ever saw so noble.

628
00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:01.830
It goes on, I see,

629
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.030
As my soul prompts it.

630
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.170
Spirit, fine spirit.

631
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.270
I'll free thee

632
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.600
Within two days for this.

633
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.000
Most sure, the goddess

634
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.670
On whom these airs attend.

635
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:12.100
Vouchsafe my prayer

636
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.400
May know if you remain upon this island;

637
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.470
And that you will some good instruction give

638
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.730
How I may bear me here: my prime request,

639
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.130
Which I do last pronounce, is,

640
00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:23.500
O you wonder.

641
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.900
If you be maid or no?

642
00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.600
No wonder, sir;

643
00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.870
But certainly a maid.

644
00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.070
My language. Heavens.

645
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.500
I am the best of them that speak this speech,

646
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.330
Were I but where 'tis spoken.

647
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.230
How? The best?

648
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:39.270
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

649
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.400
A single thing, as I am now, that wonders

650
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.370
To hear thee speak of Naples.

651
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:44.900
He does hear me;

652
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.230
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,

653
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.530
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld

654
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.300
The king my father wreck'd.

655
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.630
Alack, for mercy.

656
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.830
Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan

657
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.670
And his brave son being twain.

658
00:30:57.670 --> 00:30:58.830
The Duke of Milan

659
00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.200
And his more braver daughter could control thee,

660
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.600
If now 'twere fit to do't.

661
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.570
At the first sight

662
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.530
They have changed eyes.

663
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:11.470
Delicate Ariel, I'll set thee free for this.

664
00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:14.970
A word, good sir;

665
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.770
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

666
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:19.830
Why speaks my father so ungently?

667
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.530
This is the third man that e'er I saw, the first

668
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.630
That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father

669
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.100
To be inclined my way.

670
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.630
O, if a virgin,

671
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.430
And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you

672
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.630
The queen of Naples.

673
00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:33.730
Soft, sir.

674
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:35.530
One word more.

675
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.330
They are both in either's powers;

676
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:39.300
but this swift business

677
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.600
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning

678
00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.370
Make the prize light.

679
00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.400
One word more; I charge thee

680
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.330
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp

681
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.530
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself

682
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.470
Upon this island as a spy, to win it

683
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.600
From me, the lord on't.

684
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.900
No, as I am a man.

685
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.400
There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:

686
00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.600
If the ill spirit have so fair a house,

687
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.600
Good things will strive to dwell with't.

688
00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.700
Follow me.

689
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.470
Speak not you for him; he's a traitor.

690
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:06.670
Come; I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:

691
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.800
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be

692
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.200
The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks

693
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.500
Wherein the acorn cradled.

694
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.600
Follow.

695
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.570
No; I will resist such entertainment till

696
00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:16.700
Mine enemy has more power.

697
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.030
O dear father,

698
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.700
Make not too rash a trial of him, for

699
00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.070
He's gentle and not fearful.

700
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.270
What?

701
00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.470
I say, My foot my tutor?

702
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.770
Put thy sword up, traitor;

703
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.330
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience

704
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:32.800
Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,

705
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:37.930
For I can here disarm thee with this stick

706
00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.770
And make thy weapon drop.

707
00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:44.200
Beseech you, father.

708
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.700
Hence! Hang not on my garments.

709
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.600
Sir, have pity; I'll be his surety.

710
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.730
Silence!

711
00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.000
One word more

712
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.030
Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee.

713
00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.030
What! An advocate for an imposter?

714
00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.530
Hush.

715
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.100
Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,

716
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:07.370
Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench.

717
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:11.330
To the most of men this is a Caliban

718
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.170
And they to him are angels.

719
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.500
My affections

720
00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.630
Are then most humble; I have no ambition

721
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:18.900
To see a goodlier man.

722
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.800
Come on; obey:

723
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.630
Thy nerves are in their infancy again

724
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.430
And have no vigour in them.

725
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.430
So they are;

726
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:34.300
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.

727
00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:43.700
My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,

728
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.370
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,

729
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:50.300
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,

730
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.500
Might I but through my prison once a day

731
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.870
Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth

732
00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:58.870
Let liberty make use of; space enough

733
00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.500
Have I in such a prison.

734
00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.170
It works.

735
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.870
Come on!

736
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.900
Thou hast done well, fine Ariel.

737
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.370
Hark what thou else shalt do me.

738
00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:10.600
Be of comfort;

739
00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:12.670
My father's of a better nature, sir,

740
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.230
Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted

741
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.370
Which now came from him.

742
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:17.630
Thou shalt be free

743
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.970
As mountain winds: but then exactly do

744
00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:22.370
All points of my command.

745
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.530
To the syllable.

746
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.900
Come, follow.

747
00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.770
Speak not for him.

748
00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.700
