WEBVTT

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
LIKE THE
SPRAWLING, COMPLEX,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
AND DYNAMIC CONTINENT
ITSELF, THE LITERATURE

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
OF LATIN AMERICA IS
FAR FROM HOMOGENEOUS.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
UNDER ITS BROAD
TENT THERE COEXIST

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
DIVERSE PERSPECTIVES,
ANTITHETICAL MOVEMENTS,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
AND DIVISIVE POLEMICS.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
AT ANY GIVEN TIME IN ITS
HISTORY, THE WRITING OF

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
LATIN AMERICA ENCOMPASSES
RADICALLY DIFFERENT WAYS

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
OF CONCEIVING LITERATURE
BOTH AS AN AESTHETIC ACT

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
AND AS A PART OF SOCIAL
AND POLITICAL LIFE.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
THE FIRST DECADES OF
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
WERE NO EXCEPTION.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
THESE YEARS WERE MARKED
BY THE INNOVATIONS OF

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
MODERNISMO - AN ARTISTIC
MOVEMENT IMBUED WITH THE

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
SPIRIT OF INNOVATION AND
LINGUISTIC REINVENTION.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
THIS PERIOD ALSO SAW THE
ARRIVAL OF THE AVANT GARDE

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
WHICH SUMMARILY
DISMISSED TRADITIONAL

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
MEANS OF DISCOURSE
AND REPLACED THEM WITH

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
A FRACTURED AND
ANXIOUS WORLD VIEW.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THERE
AROSE ZEALOUS RESPONSES

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
TO MODERNISMO.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
AT THE SAME TIME,
WRITERS CONCEIVED OF

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
THEIR OWN SPIN ON THE
REALISM AND NATURALISM

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
THEY HAD INHERITED
FROM EUROPE, AND THEY

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
TURNED THEIR ATTENTION
TO LOCAL INTERESTS

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
AS A MEANS OF CONCEIVING
OF NATIONAL IDENTITY.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:57.000
*

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
*

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
*

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
THE DAWN OF THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
SAW LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE AT A CROSSROADS.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
THESE WERE THE YEARS
OF REGIONALISM AND OF

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
"NOVELLAS DE LA TIERRA",
OR "NOVELS OF THE LAND"

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE MEXICAN

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
THESE YEARS SAW THE
APPEARANCE OF SOME OF

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
THE MOST RELEVANT NOVELS
OF THIS LITERATURE,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
TITLES SUCH AS
 DONA BARBARA,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
DON SEGUNDO SOMBRA,
AND THE VORTEX.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
IF YOU HAD TO
CHOOSE A SINGLE TERM

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
TO DEFINE THE LITERATURE
OF REGIONALISM,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
THAT WORD WOULD
BE "CONFLICT".

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
IN THE CHAOTIC PERIOD THAT
WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
LAST CENTURY, THE NOVELLAS
DE LA TIERRA HIGHLIGHTED

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
SOCIO-POLITICAL, ECONOMIC,
AND AESTHETIC TENSIONS

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
IN LATIN
AMERICAN CULTURE.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
THE EMERGENCE OF
REGIONALIST LITERATURE

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
COINCIDED WITH THE
CELEBRATION OF 100 YEARS

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
OF INDEPENDENCE FOR
MANY FORMER COLONIES.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
AS SUCH, THIS WAS A TIME
OF RELENTLESS QUESTIONING

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
AND REAPPRAISAL ABOUT
THE MEANING OF NATIONAL

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
IDENTITY AND THE
IMPACT OF IMMIGRATION

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
FROM EUROPE
AND ELSEWHERE.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
SOCIETY ALSO EXPERIENCED
A NEW MIDDLE CLASS

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
AND THE APPEARANCE OF
WORKERS WHO WERE BECOMING

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
INCREASINGLY VISIBLE
DUE TO UNION CLASHES

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
AND POLITICAL
GRIEVANCES.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE
IN THE 20TH CENTURY

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
HAS TO DO WITH A MOVEMENT
FROM CERTAIN STORYTELLERS

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
TO MOVE THE GAZE TO
SOMETHING NATIVE,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
TO NATURE SCENES BELONGING
TO THEIR COUNTRIES,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
TO EMBLEMATIC
CHARACTERS,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
TO THE REPRESENTATION
OF CONFLICTS,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
AND TENSIONS GENERATED
IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
IN A WAY, IT'S TAKING UP
WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
STARTED BY SOME ROMANTICS
AND BY SOME REALISTS.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
BUT THESE REGIONALISTS,
AS THEY'RE CALLED,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
WHOM WE FIND IN
THE 20'S AND 30'S,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:29.000
FAVOR THE INTEGRATION
OF THEIR OWN UNIVERSE,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
WITH ITS CONFLICTS AND
THE NATURAL LANDSCAPES OF

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000
THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES
AND EMBLEMATIC CHARACTERS.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN
1915 AND 1930,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
THE CONFLICT BEING
WAGED IN THE

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
NOVELLAS DE LA TIERRA WAS
BETWEEN A NEW GENERATION

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
OF WRITERS AND AN
AESTHETIC LEGACY

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
THEY SAW AS PROBLEMATIC AND
ILL-EQUIPPED TO CAPTURE

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
THE AUTHENTICITY OF
LIFE IN THE NEW WORLD.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
THAT LEGACY
WAS REALISM

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
AND THE
EUROPEAN NATURALIST

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
AND MODERNIST NOVEL.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
THE AUTHORS OF THE
NOVELLAS DE LA TIERRA

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
DENIGRATED
LITERARY REALISM

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
AS STYLISTICALLY BLAND
AND ARTISTICALLY LIMITING.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
THEY BELIEVED THAT
THESE WERE OUTDATED

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
FORMS OF EXPRESSION,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
THE VOICES OF A PAST
THAT NO LONGER MATTERED.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
AND WHILE REALISM OFTEN
TOYED WITH NOTIONS OF

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
VERISIMILITUDE, MIMESIS
AND REPRESENTATION,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
REGIONALIST LITERATURE
CO-OPTED THESE THEMES

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
AND INJECTED THEM WITH
THE LINGUISTIC INNOVATION

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
THAT WAS THE HALLMARK
OF MODERNISMO.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
AND THEY INVESTIGATED
THE DICHOTOMY

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
BETWEEN CITY
AND THE COUNTRY.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
THEIR WORKS ECHOED
THE ANTITHESIS

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
PROPOSED BY THE
ARGENTINEAN STATESMAN

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
AND AUTHOR DOMINGO
FAUSTINO SARMIENTO

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
MORE THAN A HALF
CENTURY BEFORE -

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
THE SCHISM BETWEEN
CIVILIZATION AND BARBARISM.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
REGIONALISM HAS TO
DO WITH SOMETHING

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
THAT WASN'T INVENTED
HERE IN LATIN AMERICA,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
BUT IS OLDER
IN LITERATURE.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
AND IT HAS TO DO WITH
DEFENDING ONE'S OWN,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
WITH EXPRESSING
IN LITERATURE

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
ONE'S OWN CHARACTER, AND
THE CHARACTER OF A REGION.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
PUBLISHED IN 1926, THE
NOVEL DON SEGUNDO SOMBRA

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
IS THE BEST-KNOWN WORK OF
THE ARGENTINEAN WRITER

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
RICARDO GUIRALDES.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
HE WAS A
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
AVANT GARDE REVIEW MARTIN
 FIERRO AND FOUNDER OF THE

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
JOURNAL PROA, ALONG
WITH JORGE LUIS BORGES,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
ROJAS PAZ, AND
BRANDAN CARAFFA.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
GUIRALDES STANDS AT THE
INTERSECTION BETWEEN

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
A REVITALIZED
INTEREST IN CREOLISM

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
AND THE EUROPEANIST
INTELLECTUAL TRADITION.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
RICARDO GUIRALDES SEARCHES
FOR THE ARGENTINE IDENTITY

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
IN HIS WORKS, AND
THROUGH HIS WORKS.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
AND HE BELIEVES THE GAUCHO
IS THE REPRESENTATIVE

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
OF THAT IDENTITY,
THAT ARGENTINE MEN

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
SHOULD SEE IN HIM A
MIRROR OF VIRTUES.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
AND THAT'S HOW HE'S
DIFFERENT FROM SARMIENTO,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
WHO CONSIDERS GAUCHOS
PROTOTYPICAL BARBARIANS.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
DON SEGUNDO SOMBRA IS
A BILDUNGSROMAN THAT

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
CHRONICLES THE MORAL AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL GROWTH

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
OF A YOUNG MAN
NAMED FABIO CACERES.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
THE NOVEL IS SET
IN LAS PAMPAS -

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THE GRASS-COVERED PLAINS
EAST OF THE ANDES.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
IT RECORDS THE PRACTICAL
KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCAL FOLK

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
SUCH AS THE BEST WAY
TO BREAKING WILD HORSES.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
AT TWO WEEKS THE
 MARES WERE TAME.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
DON SEGUNDO, A PRACTICAL
 AND PATIENT MAN,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
KNEW ALL THE TRICKS
 OF THE TRADE.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
GRADUALLY AND GENTLY,
 HE HAD FULFILLED THE

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
DIFFICULT OBLIGATIONS
 OF THE TRAINER

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
AND WE SAW HIM OPEN
 THE CATTLE GATES

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
AND DRIVE STEERS
 WITH HIS WILD MARES.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
WHEN MY TWO WEEKS OF GREAT
 TRANQUILITY WERE OVER,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I GOT SOME BAD NEWS:

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
IN TOWN THEY KNEW
 MY WHEREABOUTS,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
AND MIGHT POSSIBLY FORCE
 ME TO RETURN HOME.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
NO WAY WOULD I GO
 BACK TO LOAF AROUND

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
THE BORING STREETS.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I WAS, ONCE AND
 FOR ALL, A FREE MAN

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
WHO WAS EARNING
 HIS DAILY BREAD,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
AND I WOULD RATHER
 LIVE LIKE A PUMA

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
PERCHED IN THE HAYSTACKS,
 THAN LIKE A LITTLE DOG

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
NESTLED BETWEEN SKIRTS,
 STINKING OF CHURCH INCENSE

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
AND THE SCOLDINGS OF
 MUSTACHED BOSSY WOMEN.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
GUIRALDES CONSTRUCTED
A WORK THAT,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
UNLIKE OTHER NOVELS
OF THE GENRE,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
HE TRAFFICS NOT IN
CONFLICT BUT RATHER

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
INVESTIGATES THEMES OF
HARMONY AND RECONCILIATION.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
HE DESCRIBED A PEOPLE
AND A LANDSCAPE THAT

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
NO LONGER EXISTED,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
GENERATED BY THE
REINVENTION OF THE PAST

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
AND THE VISION OF
A RURAL UTOPIA.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
HE THUS SHAPED WHAT
THE ARGENTINEAN CRITIC

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
BEATRIZ SARLO CALLS A
"RUSTIC GOLDEN AGE",

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
A CREATION THAT
IS AT ITS CORE

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
A RESPONSE TO MODERNIZATION
AND URBANIZATION

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
WITH THEIR ATTENDANT
UNREST AND TENSION.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
HIS CHARACTERS ARE OF
A PIECE WITH NATURE,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
AND SHOW ANOTHER DYNAMIC,
ANOTHER WAY OF LIVING

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
THROUGH WORK, FREE TIME,
LEARNING, AND ROUTINE.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
THIS DYNAMIC IS WORLDS
AWAY FROM THE VERTIGINOUS

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
RHYTHM OF THE MODERN
CITY, WHICH GUIRALDES HAD

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
EXPERIENCED BOTH IN BUENOS
AIRES AND LATER IN PARIS,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
WHERE HE BEGAN
WRITING THE NOVEL.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
DON SEGUNDO SOMBRA
PRESENTS A NARRATIVE

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
LIBERATED FROM STRIFE
AND COMPLEXITY,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
THE POLAR OPPOSITE OF
MODERNITY'S QUAGMIRE.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
IN 1924, THE COLOMBIAN
WRITER JOSE EUSTASIO RIVERA

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
PUBLISHED THE VORTEX.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
THE NOVEL'S PROTAGONIST
IS ARTURO COVA,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
AND IT IS SET IN
THE VAST REGION

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
THAT STRETCHES FROM THE
PLAINS TO THE JUNGLE,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
BETWEEN BRAZIL,
VENEZUELA, AND PERU.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
AS THE ILL-FATED AFFAIR
BETWEEN ARTURO AND HIS

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
LOVER ALICIA UNFOLDS, THE
CHARACTERS MAKE THEIR WAY

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
DEEP INTO THE JUNGLE,
INTO THE SAVAGE UNKNOWN.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THE LOVERS BECOME
SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
AND IN THE NARRATIVE
DISPLACEMENTS ALSO ARISE,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
GIVING VOICE TO A
VARIETY OF CHARACTERS.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
AMONG THEM IS
CLEMENTE SILVA,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
A RUBBER PLANTATION
WORKER WHO

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
RECOUNTS A TRAGIC
TALE OF EXPLOITATION.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
THE NOVEL EXPOSES THE
APPALLING CONDITIONS

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
IN THE RUBBER
FACTORIES, AS WELL AS

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
THE TREMENDOUS HARDSHIP
FACED BY THOSE

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:16.000
WHO TRIED TO EKE OUT A
LIVING IN THE RAINFOREST.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
IT'S A NOVEL WHERE THE
ENVIRONMENT IS FUNDAMENTAL.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S BEEN
CALLED A NOVEL OF SPACE.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
AND SPACE WHICH IS, I
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
TOO MUCH TO SAY THIS
- PERSONIFIED -

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
BUT IT DOES HAVE AN ACTIVE
PRESENCE, THE JUNGLE.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:44.000
IT'S A NOVEL WHERE YOU SEE
THROUGH THE CHARACTERS

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
THE VIOLENCE
OF THE PLACE,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
ASSOCIATED WITH THE
VIOLENCE OF NATURE.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
WHEN IT SAYS THAT THE
JUNGLE DEVOURED THEM,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:12:00.000
IT'S THE JUNGLE APPEARING
AS AN ELEMENT OF THE REGION,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
BUT NOT A
DECORATIVE ELEMENT,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
AN ACTIVE ELEMENT,
WHICH IS CAPABLE

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
OF ACTION AND OF SHAPING
CHARACTERS' DESTINIES.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
THE VORTEX, ELEGANT IN
STYLE, REPLETE WITH

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
METAPHOR AND POETRY
YET COARSELY REALISTIC,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
DEFIES EASY DEFINITION.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
THIS NOVEL PROCESSES THE
INHERITANCE OF NATURALISM

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
AND REALISM AND THE LEGACY
OF MODERNISM THROUGH

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
A NEW WORLDVIEW AND A NEW
WAY OF USING LANGUAGE,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
AS IS EVIDENCED IN
ITS OPENING PASSAGE.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
BEFORE I FELL IN
 LOVE WITH ANY WOMAN,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I BET WITH MY
 HEART AT RANDOM,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
AND IT WON
 ME VIOLENCE.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
MORE THAN THE ONE IN
 LOVE, I WAS ALWAYS THE

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
DOMINEERING ONE WHOSE
 LIPS KNEW NO ENTREATIES.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
WITH EVERYTHING, I SOUGHT
 OUT THE DIVINE GIFT

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
OF IDEAL LOVE, THAT IT
 CONSUME ME SPIRITUALLY,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
SO THAT MY SOUL
 GLINTED IN MY BODY

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
LIKE A FLAME ON THE
 LOG THAT FEEDS IT.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
THE VORTEX EVOKED
VISIONS OF A BOUNDLESS,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
UNTAMED SPACE, AN
APPARITION WITH

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
FEW ANTECEDENTS IN LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
THIS KIND OF RUSTIC UTOPIA
HAD BEEN THE PROVINCE OF

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
EUROPEAN WRITERS SUCH
AS CHATEAUBRIAND...

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
RUDYARD KIPLING...

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
JOSEPH CONRAD...

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
AND THE PRUSSIAN NATURALIST
ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
WHO TRAVELED ACROSS
SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
BETWEEN
1795 AND 1804.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
TO CAPTURE THE ENORMITY
AND MENACE OF THE JUNGLE,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
THE NOVEL DEPICTS
SCALE AND VIOLENCE

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
IN A HIGHLY
ORIGINAL WAY.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
THE ENGINE OF THE PLOT
IS A CRIME COMMITTED BY

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
MANKIND AGAINST NATURE
- THE FLATTENING OF THE

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
RAINFOREST IN HEADLONG
PURSUIT OF RUBBER.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
THE OBJECT OF HUMAN
CRUELTY IS THE TREE,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
SEVERED AT THE ROOT
FROM THE EARTH

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
IN THE SERVICE
OF GREED.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
THE VIOLENCE OF THE
NARRATIVE IS RECIPROCATED.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
THE JUNGLE AVENGES ITSELF
ON THE MEN THAT ABUSE IT

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
BY MEANS OF VERMIN,
ILLNESS, AND PLAGUE.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
THE VORTEX TAKES THE
SENSIBILITIES OF THE

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
NATURALIST NOVEL TO
ITS AESTHETIC EXTREME,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
THEN CAREENS OFF INTO
SATIRE AND THE GROTESQUE.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
THE REVELATION OF
THE EARTH'S POWERS

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
IN ALL ITS TROPICAL
AND MONSTROUS SPLENDOR

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
STUNNED READERS
AND CRITICS ALIKE.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
IN THE VORTEX, THE
JUNGLE APPEARS.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
THESE PLACES AND THEIR
INHABITANTS AREN'T JUST

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
INCORPORATED IN A
REFERENTIAL WAY,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
IN A MERELY
FOLKLORIC WAY.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
INSTEAD, THEY'RE ALWAYS
CHARGED WITH VALUES

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
AND A GREAT
SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
SO IN THESE SPACES
YOU HAVE CONFLICTS

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
AND SITUATIONS
THAT AT SOME POINT

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
INVOLVE A POSITIONING
OF THESE STORYTELLERS.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000
INVOLVE A POSITIONING
OF THESE STORYTELLERS.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
THE VORTEX ALSO EXPOSES
THE EXPLOITATION

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
OF MAN BY MAN.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
THE STORY OF ABUSE
UNFOLDS IN A WORLD

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS
OF LAW AND ORDER.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
AS SUCH, IT IS THE
ANTITHESIS, IN MANY WAYS,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
OF WHAT WE MIGHT CALL
"NATIONALIST FICTION".

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
CONTRARY TO WORKS THAT
ESPOUSED HARMONY, SYNTHESIS,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
AND A MONOLITHIC
DEFINITION OF NATIONHOOD,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
THE VORTEX DWELT ON
THE SHADOWY EDGES

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
OF CIVILIZATION.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
THROUGH ITS PROVOCATIVE
MIX OF REGISTERS, VOICES,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
LANGUAGE, AND GENRES,
IT DEBUNKED THE MYTH

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
OF NATIONHOOD AS
A FAIT ACCOMPLI.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
THE LAST CABLE FROM OUR
 CONSUL, SENT TO THE

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
MINISTER AND IN RELATION
 TO THE FATE OF ARTURO COVA

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
AND HIS COMPANIONS, READS,
 VERBATIM: CLEMENTE SILVA

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR
 THEM FOR FIVE MONTHS.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
THERE IS NO
 TRACE OF THEM.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
THE JUNGLE
 DEVOURED THEM.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
IN 1929, THE VENEZUELAN
WRITER ROMULO GALLEGOS

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
PUBLISHED A NOVEL THAT
EARNED HIM RENOWN

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
THROUGHOUT THE
CONTINENT: DONA BARBARA.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
GALLEGOS BEGAN HIS
CAREER AS A MODERNISTA,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
AND LATER EXPERIMENTED
WITH REALISM.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
IN DONA BARBARA, GALLEGOS
INVESTIGATED THE DICHOTOMY

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
MADE FAMOUS
BY SARMIENTO,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
CONTRASTING CIVILIZATION
AND BARBARISM.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
DONA BARBARA TELLS THE STORY
OF A YOUNG CITY LAWYER,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
SANTOS LUZARDO, WHO
RETURNS TO HIS RURAL ROOTS

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
TO TAKE CHARGE
OF "ALTAMIRA",

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
HIS FAMILY'S ESTATE.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
THERE HE MEETS
 DONA BARBARA,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
A CLEVER AND
UNSCRUPULOUS WOMAN

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
WHO OWNS A HACIENDA
CALLED EL MIEDO.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
HER SOLE OBJECTIVE IS
TO DISPOSSESS LUZARDO

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
OF HIS LAND, AND SHE
WILL STOP AT NOTHING

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
TO ACHIEVE HER GOAL.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
THE NOVEL FEATURES
CLASSIC REALIST DEVICES.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
IT IS NARRATED IN
THE THIRD PERSON

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
OMNISCIENT POINT OF VIEW,
AND THE PLOT UNFOLDS

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
IN A STANDARD
THREE-PART STRUCTURE.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
IT INTRODUCES CHARACTERS
WHO ALLOW FOR VIVID

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
DESCRIPTIONS OF
LIFE ON THE PLAINS,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
THE BACKWARDNESS
AND SUPERSTITION

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
OF ITS INHABITANTS,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
AND THE MODERNIZING
INFLUENCE OF NEW ARRIVALS.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
AT ITS HEART, DONA BARBARA
IS A DIDACTIC NOVEL,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
DESIGNED TO EXPOSE
THE NATION'S TROUBLES

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
AND PROPOSE
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL
CONFLICT ARE ITS

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
CENTRAL THEMES, AS IS
THE IDEA THAT LITERATURE

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
IS THE BEST VEHICLE
FOR RELATING

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
THE ONGOING STRIFE THAT
DIVIDES THE COUNTRY.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000
THE PROBLEM, OR THE
PROBLEMS, SANTOS LUZARDO

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
FINDS IN BRINGING
ABOUT HIS PROJECT,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
IS THAT THE PLAINS, THE VERY
LANDSCAPE OF THE REGION

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
- YOU'LL SEE THAT I
USE DIFFERENT TERMS.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
FIRST IT'S THE JUNGLE,
THEN THE PLAINS,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000
THEN THE "PAMPAS".

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
THEY EVEN HAVE THEIR
OWN UNIQUE NAMES.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
AND HE FINDS AN
ENVIRONMENT THAT DOESN'T

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
SQUARE WITH HIS
IDEAL PROJECT.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
AND THIS WAS A PERSISTENT
CONFLICT IN THE

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
ORGANIZATION OF LATIN
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000
HAVING A CERTAIN MODEL
OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
AND THEN FINDING
AN ENVIRONMENT,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE
RESPONDING ALONG LINES

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
THAT WERE DIFFERENT FROM
THOSE THEY WANTED TO IMPOSE.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
AS IN THE CASE OF THE
 VORTEX, DONA BARBARA IS

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
AT ODDS WITH THE IDEA
OF NATIONAL LITERATURE.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
AND, IN EXPOSING THE DARK
SIDE OF MODERNIZATION,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
GALLEGOS EVISCERATED
THE TRADITIONAL ETHOS

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
OF RURAL FOLKS AND REPLACED
IT WITH A FRACTURED,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
NO-HOLDS-BARRED
APPROACH OF MODERNITY.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THE PRAIRIE IS AT ONCE
 BEAUTIFUL AND TERRIBLE;

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
IT HOLDS, WITH
 ROOM TO SPARE,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
SPLENDID LIFE AND
 ATROCIOUS DEATH.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
IT THREATENS ON ALL SIDES,
 BUT THERE NO ONE FEARS IT.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
DONA BARBARA STOPPED
 TO CONTEMPLATE

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
THE OBSTINATE ABERRATION
 OF THE LIVESTOCK,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
AND WITH THOUGHTS OF HERSELF
 THAT BECAME SENSATION,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
FELT IN THE FURRED
 DRYNESS OF HER TONGUE,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
BURNING WITH
 FEVER AND THIRST,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
THE HARSHNESS AND
 BITTERNESS OF THAT LAND

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
THAT THE STUBBORN BEASTS'
 TONGUES WERE LICKING.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
THUS WAS SHE IN
 HER DILIGENT ZEAL

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
TO SWEETEN THE LOVE
 THAT WAS CONSUMING HER.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
THEN, MAKING AN EFFORT
 TO FREE HERSELF FROM THE

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
FASCINATION THAT THOSE
 PLACES AND THE SPECTACLE

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
HELD OVER HER SPIRIT,
 SHE SPURRED HER HORSE

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
AND CONTINUED HER
 SOMBER ROAMING.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
HORACIO QUIROGA IS
GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
AS ONE OF THE
OUTSTANDING REGIONALISTS

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
ON THE CONTINENT, CREATING
TALES THAT CAPTURE

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:45.000
THE SPIRIT OF THE RIO
DE LA PLATA REGION.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
BORN IN THE
URUGUAYAN CITY OF SALTO,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
HE BECAME FASCINATED
WITH THE JUNGLE

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
WHILE ON A
PHOTOGRAPHIC EXPEDITION

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
WITH THE WRITER
LEOPOLDO LUGONES.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
HE WAS A REGULAR
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE JOURNAL

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
CARAS Y CARETAS ,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
WHICH PUBLISHED SOME OF
HIS BEST-KNOWN STORIES,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
SUCH AS SUNSTROKE AND
 THE FEATHER PILLOW.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
QUIROGA LIVED OFF OF HIS
WORK FOR NEWSPAPERS AND

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
MAGAZINES, AND THE COURSE
OF HIS CAREER ILLUSTRATES

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
THE TENSIONS BROUGHT ON
BY THE PROFESSIONALIZATION

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
OF WRITING IN THE
RIO DE LA PLATA.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
HE WAS A WRITER
WHO SYSTEMATICALLY

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
REFLECTED ON
HIS PROFESSION,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
AND PARTICULARLY ON
ITS MATERIAL ASPECTS.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
QUIROGA ADOPTED A
SELF-CONSCIOUSLY

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE
IN HIS RELATIONSHIP

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
WITH HIS EMPLOYERS
IN A DETERMINED

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
BUT NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL
ATTEMPT TO TURN LITERATURE

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
INTO A REASONABLY
PROFITABLE ACTIVITY.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
HE THOUGHT THAT LITERATURE
WAS A PROFESSION.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
BUT BEYOND THAT HE THOUGHT
OF WRITING AS MANUFACTURING.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:04.000
HE WAS VERY AWARE THAT ONE
SHOULD REFINE EACH TEXT.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
AND HE WAS
SOMEONE WHO,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
SINCE HE HAD A
PUBLISHING BACKGROUND,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
HE HAD SOME
THINGS VERY CLEAR.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000
HE PUT STOCK IN LANGUAGE,
IN STORIES, AND IN BREVITY

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
AND IN CONTROL
OVER THE STORY

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
FROM THE
VERY BEGINNING.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
CONTROL OVER
THE STORY,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
OVER THE CHARACTERS'
PHYSIOGNOMY,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
SO THAT THIS
DIDN'T GET SLACK.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
ONE OF THE FIRST
WRITERS' SOCIETIES,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
IN ARGENTINA AT LEAST,
IS PROMOTED BY

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
QUIROGA AND LUGONES;
THEY'RE THE FOUNDERS.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
SO THE IMAGE OF THE WRITER
BEGINS TO TAKE ON RELEVANCE.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
BECAUSE THEY PUT FORTH A
GREAT EFFORT TOWARD THAT

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
BUT ALSO BECAUSE
INSTITUTIONS BEGIN TO

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
APPEAR THAT ALLOW THEM TO
GAIN SOCIAL AWARENESS.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
WRITERS' SOCIETIES,
WRITERS' CIRCLES,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
AND ROUND-TABLE
DISCUSSIONS.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
QUIROGA SPECIALIZED IN
AND WAS A MASTER OF

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
THE SHORT STORY.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
HE OUTLINED HIS THEORIES
ON THE GENRE IN HIS FAMOUS

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
DECALOGUE OF THE
 PERFECT STORYTELLER.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
QUIROGA DESCRIBED THE
PERFECT SHORT STORY AS

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
"AN ARROW WHICH,
CAREFULLY SHARPENED,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
LEAVES THE BOW TO
HIT THE BULLSEYE".

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
HIS TALES WERE TYPICALLY
SET IN THE JUNGLE,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
AND THE JUNGLE IS IN FACT
THE TRUE PROTAGONIST

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
OF HIS STORIES.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
HE REVELED IN MYSTERY,
HORROR, AND THE FANTASTIC,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
PENNING STORIES SUCH AS
"THE DECAPITATED CHICKEN"

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
AND "THE FEATHER PILLOW"
THAT TRAFFICKED IN

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
CRUELTY, THE ABSURD,
AND - ALWAYS - DEATH.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS
OF POE, CHEKHOV,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
MAUPASSANT, AND KIPLING,
QUIROGA COMBINED REALISM,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
REGIONALISM, AND THE
FANTASTIC IN A CAREFULLY

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
CRAFTED SYNTAX OF BREVITY,
INTENSITY, AND IMPACT.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
HIS WAS A REALIST
LITERATURE THAT SYNTHESIZED

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
ELEMENTS OF REGIONALISM
AND COSTUMBRISMO,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
A SHORT PROSE
FORMAT THAT DEPICTED

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
LOCAL CUSTOMS
AND MANNERS.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
HIS LITERARY STYLE WAS
MARKED BY PRECISION

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
OF LANGUAGE, PLOT,
AND EXPOSITION.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
SOON ALICIA BEGAN TO
 HAVE HALLUCINATIONS,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
BEWILDERING, THAT
 FLOATED AT FIRST,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
AND LATER DESCENDED
 TO THE GROUND.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
THE YOUNG GIRL, WITH EYES
 WIDE OPEN, COULD NOT HELP

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
BUT STARE AT THE RUG ON
 EACH SIDE OF THE BED.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
ALICIA SLOWLY FADED AWAY
 IN HER ANEMIC DELIRIUM,

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
WHICH WOULD GROW
 WORSE IN THE EVENING

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
AND WITHDRAW IN
 THE EARLY HOURS.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
DURING THE DAYTIME HER
 ILLNESS DID NOT PROGRESS,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
BUT EACH MORNING SHE WOKE
 LIVID, ALMOST FAINT.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
IT SEEMED AS IF ONLY
 DURING THE NIGHT

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
THE LIFE IN HER VANISHED
 IN NEW SURGES OF BLOOD.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
AS SHE AWAKENED SHE
 ALWAYS FELT AS IF

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
SHE HAD JUST
 COLLAPSED ONTO THE BED

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
WITH A THOUSAND
 TONS ON TOP OF HER.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
IF THE FIRST PART OF
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
WAS LATIN AMERICA'S
"ERA OF INDEPENDENCE",

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
THE REMAINING DECADES
WERE TAKEN UP WITH

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
MAKING POLITICAL,
CULTURAL, SOCIAL,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000
AND ECONOMIC SENSE
OF THAT INDEPENDENCE.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
BECAUSE THE IMPERIUM OF
POWER HAD PASSED FROM

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
COLONIAL OVERLORDS TO THE
RESIDENT UPPER CLASSES,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
EXPLOITATION, DEPENDENCE,
AND BACKWARDNESS OFTEN

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
REMAINED AND SOMETIMES
BECAME EVEN HARSHER.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
AND THOSE WHO FOUND
THEMSELVES CUT OUT OF

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
THE POWER DYNAMIC WERE THE
VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO HAD

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
ENDURED THE MOST HARM
SINCE THE CONQUEST:

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
THE PRE-COLUMBIAN
INDIGENOUS POPULATION.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
THIS CYCLE OF OPPRESSION
WAS DIFFERENT

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
IN EACH COUNTRY, AND
HAD SPECIFIC AESTHETIC

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
AND ARTISTIC
MANIFESTATIONS AS WELL.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
IN MEXICO, WHERE
COLONIAL SOCIETY HAD BEEN

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
DEEPLY ENTRENCHED,
POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
WAS JUST THE BEGINNING
OF A COMPLETE MAKEOVER

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
OF THE COUNTRY'S CULTURAL
AND SOCIAL FABRIC.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION
WAS A VERITABLE

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
KALEIDOSCOPE OF
OPPOSING INTERESTS.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
IT INVOLVED PLAYERS FROM
ALL SOCIAL CLASSES,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
REPRESENTING A DIZZYING
ARRAY OF IDEOLOGIES.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
FRANCISCO MADERO, EMILIANO
ZAPATA, PANCHO VILLA,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
ALVARO OBREGON,
JUSTINIANO CARRANZA.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
THEY IGNITED MEXICO AND
THE ENTIRE CONTINENT

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
IN A SOCIAL CONFLAGRATION
THAT SPANNED THE DECADE

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
FROM 1910 TO 1920.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
THE REVOLUTION INVOLVED
MANY KEY INTELLECTUALS

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
OF THE TIME, WHO
ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
BOTH IN POLITICS
AND IN BATTLE.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
THIS HANDS-ON INVOLVEMENT
GAVE RISE TO A GENRE

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
THAT WAS TO HAVE A
PROFOUND ARTISTIC

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
AND CULTURAL IMPACT -
THE REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
TO THIS DAY, SCHOLARS
STILL FIERCELY DEBATE

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
THE EXACT ORIGINS
AND PARAMETERS

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
OF THE
REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
HOWEVER, CRITICS GENERALLY
AGREE THAT THE CYCLE BEGAN

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
WITH MARIANO AZUELA'S WORK
ENTITLED THE UNDERDOGS.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
PUBLISHED AS A SERIAL
IN THE MEXICAN NEWSPAPER

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
EL PASO DEL NORTE,
 " THE UNDERDOGS"

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
WAS A FIRST-HAND
DESCRIPTION OF COMBAT

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
DURING THE
MEXICAN REVOLUTION,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
BASED ON AZUELA'S
EXPERIENCES IN THE FIELD.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
IT HAS BEEN CALLED A "NOVEL
OF THE PEOPLE IN ARMS"

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
AND EVEN "AN EPIC
POEM IN PROSE".

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
IT FEARLESSLY DEPICTS
THE PASSION AND

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
DISILLUSIONMENT THAT
SEEM TO BE INTRINSIC

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
TO ALL GREAT
MOMENTS IN HISTORY.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:14.000
THE UNDERDOGS IS A NOVEL
WITH RURAL PROTAGONISTS.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:24.000
NOT PANCHO VILLA AS THE
HERO, BUT HE'S ALLUDED TO.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000
AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS A
GROUP OF RURAL PEOPLE

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
WHO RISE UP AGAINST
THE LANDOWNER.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
AND THE UNIQUE ASPECT
OF THE NOVEL IS THAT

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
THESE PEOPLE ARE
NOT IDEALIZED.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
THEY ARE SHOWN WITH
THEIR CONTRADICTIONS,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
THEIR CRUELTIES.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
SO WHEN THESE EXPLOITED
PEOPLE TRIUMPH,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
THEY CAN BE JUST
AS CRUEL AS

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
THEY THEMSELVES
HAD BEEN TREATED.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
AND SOME INTELLECTUALS
APPEAR WHO TRY TO

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:07.000
INTERPRET THE REVOLUTION
AS A HEROIC GESTURE.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
THE UNDERDOGS HAS TWO MAIN
PROTAGONISTS WHO ARE

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
IN MANY WAYS ANTITHETICAL
TO ONE ANOTHER:

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
DEMETRIO MACIAS
AND LUIS CERVANTES.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
DEMETRIO IS AN ORDINARY
GUY WHO THROWS HIMSELF

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
INTO THE REBELLION WHERE
HE BECOMES A LEADER,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
OR A "BANDIDO"
- OUTLAW.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
HE YEARNS FOR A BETTER
LIFE, AND WHILE HE MAY

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000
BE UNSOPHISTICATED TO
THE WAYS OF THE WORLD,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
HE IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND
SINCERE IN HIS INTENTIONS.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
LUIS CERVANTES, BY
CONTRAST, IS AN OBSEQUIOUS

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
INTELLECTUAL
WHO SERVES POWER

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
AND KNOWS HOW
TO PULL STRINGS.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
HIS GUILE AND TREACHERY TO
REVOLUTIONARY IDEALS ARE,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
IN THE IRONY OF
AZUELA'S NARRATIVE,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
ULTIMATELY REWARDED.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
BY THE END OF THE
STORY, DEMETRIO,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
DEFEATED AND HUNTED,
IS A MAN LAID LOW

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
BY POLITICS HE
CANNOT COMPREHEND.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
THE JUXTAPOSITION OF
THE NAIVE DEMETRIO

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
WITH THE CUNNING LUIS

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
HIGHLIGHTS THE
REVOLUTION'S CONTRADICTIONS

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
AND COMPLEXITIES; THAT
IT IS SIMULTANEOUSLY

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
IDEALISTIC AND
ROTTEN AT THE CORE,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.000
A TIME BOTH OF POSSIBILITY
AND OF CLOSURE.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
LUIS CERVANTES HAD NOT
 YET MANAGED TO DETECT

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
THE EXACT SHAPE OF
 THE OBJECTS ABOUT HIM.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
SEEKING THE MOST SUITABLE
 RESTING PLACE, HE LAID HIS

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
WEARY BONES DOWN ON A
 FRESH PILE OF MANURE

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
UNDER THE BLURRED MASS
 OF A HUIZACHE TREE.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
HE LAY DOWN, MORE
 EXHAUSTED THAN RESIGNED,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
AND CLOSED HIS EYES,
 RESOLUTELY DETERMINED

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
TO SLEEP UNTIL HIS FIERCE
 KEEPERS OR THE MORNING SUN,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
BURNING HIS EARS,
 AWAKENED HIM.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000
OTHER KEY NOVELS OF THIS
GENRE WERE WRITTEN BY

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
YOUNGER AUTHORS WHO GREW
UP DURING THE REVOLUTION.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
THEY INCLUDE THE
 EAGLE AND THE SERPENT

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
AND THE SHADOW
 OF THE LEADER

AND CARTRIDGE: TALES
 OF THE STRUGGLE

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
IN THE NORTH
 OF MEXICO

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
AN INTRIGUING
NOVEL TOLD FROM

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
THE POINT OF VIEW OF
A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
WRITTEN BY NELLIE
CAMPOBELLO.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
THROUGH SUCCESSIVE
READINGS AND

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
REINTERPRETATION, THE
MEXICAN REVOLUTION AND ITS

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
LITERATURE WERE REPRISED
IN SEMINAL TEXTS

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
FROM THE SECOND HALF OF
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
THESE WORKS INCLUDE PEDRO
 PARAMO BY JUAN RULFO,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
AND THE DEATH OF ARTEMIO
 CRUZ BY CARLOS FUENTES.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
FUENTES EXPERIMENTED WITH
POINT OF VIEW IN HIS NOVEL

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
- A THIRD OF THE BOOK IS
RELATED FROM THE SECOND

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
PERSON POINT OF VIEW,
WITH THE FIRST AND THIRD

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
PERSONS COMPRISING
THE REST OF THE BOOK.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
ALL THREE PERSPECTIVES
TELL THE SAME STORY

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
FROM DIFFERENT JUNCTURES
IN ITS TIMELINE.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
TAKEN TOGETHER, THE NOVEL
RESOUNDINGLY CRITIQUES

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
THE ROOTS OF THE REVOLUTION
THROUGH AN ACCOUNT OF

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
ARTEMIO CRUZ'S
LIFE AND DEATH.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.000
THUS ENDS ONE CYCLE
AND BEGINS ANOTHER:

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
THAT OF THE LATIN
AMERICAN BOOM.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
THE REVOLUTIONARY NOVEL
HAD SEVERAL POINTS

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
OF CONTACT WITH
ANOTHER LITERARY TREND

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
IN THE CONTINENT - THE
INDIGENIST NARRATIVE.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
THIS GENRE ARTICULATED
THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
SOUTH AMERICA'S NATIVE
PEOPLES, AND WAS STRONGLY

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
ANCHORED IN POLITICS,
REVOLUTION, AND MARXISM.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
IN THE FIRST DECADES OF
THE TWENTIETH CENTURY,

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
THE EMIGRATION OF
REALISM AND NATURALISM

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000
TO LATIN AMERICA
PROMPTED A NEW LOOK

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
AT THE ROLE OF
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
IN THE CONTINENT'S
CULTURAL FABRIC,

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
ESPECIALLY IN PERU,
ECUADOR, AND BOLIVIA.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
THE TRANSITIONAL WORK THAT
GOES FROM A REPRESENTATION

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
THAT'S A BIT
MORE INDIGENIST,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
A BIT MORE IDEALIZED,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
TO A REPRESENTATION
THAT'S MORE CRITICAL.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
BECAUSE HERE,
EXPLOITATION FOR INSTANCE,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
WHICH IS A PART OF ALL OF
THE INDIGENIST STORIES,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
FROM THE STRICTLY
INDIGENIST ANGLE,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
ISN'T SEEN AS
A MORAL PROBLEM.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
SO THERE AREN'T PEOPLE
WHO ARE MORALLY BAD,

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000
WHO HAVE CHARACTER FLAWS
THAT LEAD TO EXPLOITATION.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000
INSTEAD, EXPLOITATION IS
THE PRODUCT OF A SYSTEM.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000
THE STANDARD DEPICTION OF
THE INDIAN AS A "PROBLEM"

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
HAD DATED BACK TO
THE CONQUEST ITSELF,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
AND INCORPORATED
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.000
OF NATURAL LAW, RELIGION,
AND NATIONAL IDENTITIES.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
WHENEVER NATIVE VOICES
WERE HEARD, THEY WERE

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
TYPICALLY MEDIATED BY AN
EDITOR OR TRANSLATOR WHO

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
SMOOTHED OVER THE ROUGH
EDGES OF THEIR NARRATIVES

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
SO AS NOT TO OFFEND
NON-NATIVE EARS.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
THE INDIGENOUS PERSON
WAS AN OBJECT OF STUDY,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
INTERPRETATION, SCORN,
OR IDLE CURIOSITY,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
NOT OF ADMIRATION
OR RESPECT.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
THE REPRESENTATION OF
NATIVE TRIBES AND OF THEIR

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
EXPLOITATION AND SUFFERING
TOOK ON A MUCH DIFFERENT

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
CHARACTER IN THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
WITH INDEPENDENCE CAME
REASSESSMENT, AND WITH

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
ROMANTICISM CAME A RENEWED
INTEREST IN NATIONAL

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
IDENTITY, OFTEN ALLIED
WITH AN IDEALIZED

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
OR NOSTALGIC VERSION
OF NATIVE HISTORY.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
THE TROUBLING
PRESENCE OF THE INDIAN

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
IN MODERN LATIN AMERICA
BECAME ENMESHED

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
WITH THE AESTHETICS OF
REALISM AND NATURALISM.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
THE RESULT WAS
WORKS SUCH AS

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
CLORINDA MATTO
DE TURNER'S

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
BIRDS WITHOUT A NEST,
PUBLISHED IN 1889.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
IN THE PREFACE, THE
AUTHOR DECLARED THAT HER

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
INTENTION WAS FOR THIS
WORK TO BE "THE PHOTOGRAPH

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
THAT STEREOTYPES THE VICES
AND VIRTUES OF A PEOPLE".

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
AS SUCH, IT IS AN EXAMPLE
OF COSTUMBRISMO -

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
A LITERARY SKETCH OF
CUSTOMS AND MANNERS,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
A FORM THAT HAD
BECOME POPULAR

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
IN THE LATE
NINETEENTH CENTURY.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
MATTO WAS A WOMAN WHO
CAME FROM THE INTERIOR,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
NEAR CUZCO.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
AND THIS ALLOWED HER
TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
THE REALITY OF THE
MOUNTAINOUS REGION

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
AND HOW THE INDIGENOUS
PEOPLE LIVED AT THE TIME.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
SO IN THIS WORK,
 BIRDS WITHOUT A NEST,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
SHE REPRESENTS THE PROBLEM
OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
AND THEIR COMMUNITIES
MIRED IN IGNORANCE,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
IN EXTREME POVERTY,
AND IN EXPLOITATION

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
BY THE GOVERNOR, BY
THE ENCOMENDEROS,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
PERHAPS THEY WERE
CALLED DIFFERENTLY

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
BUT THEY WERE
ENCOMENDEROS NONETHELESS;

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
AND THE PRIEST,
WHO MANIPULATES THE

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
CONSCIENCE OF THE
SOUL AND THE SPIRIT

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
TO HELP MAINTAIN THAT
STATE OF AFFAIRS.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
BIRDS WITHOUT A NEST
FORESHADOWED CONCERNS

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
THAT WOULD BE REVISITED
IN THE LITERATURE

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
AND THE POLITICS OF
THE NEXT CENTURY.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
IN THE PERUVIAN
 PROVINCES,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
WHERE THEY BREED THE
 ALPACA AND WHERE

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
TRAFFIC IN WOOL IS THE
 CHIEF SOURCE OF RICHES,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
THERE EXISTS ALMOST
 WITHOUT EXCEPTION

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
THE CUSTOM KNOWN AS
 "DISTRIBUTION IN ADVANCE"

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
WHICH THE
 BUSINESS MAGNATES,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000
THE WELL-TO-DO PEOPLE
 OF THE PLACE, PRACTICE.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
FOR THE PAYMENT IN ADVANCE
 WHICH THE WOOL BUYERS

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
MAKE AND FORCE THE
 INDIANS TO ACCEPT,

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
THEY FIX THE PRICE OF A
 QUINTAL OF WOOL SO LOW

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
THAT THE GAIN WHICH
 THE CAPITAL INVESTED

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
IS MADE TO PRODUCE
 EXCEEDS 500%.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.000
THIS USURY, TOGETHER
 WITH THE EXTORTION

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
THAT GOES WITH IT,
 TURNS EXISTENCE

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
INTO A VIRTUAL HELL
 FOR THOSE BARBARIANS.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
THE INDIANS WHO ARE
 OWNERS OF ALPACAS

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
EMIGRATE FROM
 THEIR HUTS

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
DURING THE TIME
 OF DISTRIBUTION,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
IN ORDER NOT TO RECEIVE
 THE MONEY ADVANCED,

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
WHICH FOR THEM IS
 ALMOST AS CURSED AS THE

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER
 RECEIVED BY JUDAS.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
THE FIRST DECADES OF THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY BROUGHT

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
FORTH SOME OF THE MOST
ENDURING INDIGENIST NOVELS:

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
BRONZE RACE BY THE
BOLIVIAN WRITER

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
ALCIDES ARGUEDAS,
PUBLISHED IN 1919;

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
THE WHITE LLAMA BY
VENTURA GARCIA CALDERON

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
OF PERU, FROM 1924;

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
HUASIPUNGO BY JORGE
ICAZA OF ECUADOR,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
PUBLISHED IN 1934;

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
AND BROAD AND
 ALIEN IS THE WORLD

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
BY PERUVIAN CIRO
ALEGRIA, FROM 1941.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
EACH IN THEIR OWN WAY,
THESE WORKS OFFERED

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
A DIRECT AND RAW VIEW OF
THE ABORIGINAL REALITY,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
A FAR CRY FROM THE
STANDARD MYTHIC

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
IDEALIZATION OF THE
GLORIOUS PRE-HISPANIC PAST.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
ALTHOUGH AT TIMES
PATERNALISTIC

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
OR BLATANTLY BIASED,
THESE WORKS UNBLINKINGLY

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
PORTRAY THE INJUSTICES
THAT WERE METED OUT

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
AGAINST INDIGENOUS
PEOPLES.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
THEY DENOUNCE THE
PRACTICES OF CACIQUISMO

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
AND GAMONALISMO,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
SEMI-FEUDAL SYSTEMS RUN
BY CRUEL LOCAL BOSSES.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
THEY CONDEMNED THE
RELENTLESS EXPLOITATION

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
OF INDIAN POPULATIONS;
AND THEY MOURNED THE

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
APPARENTLY IRRESOLVABLE
CONFLICT BETWEEN

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
INDIAN AND WHITE MAN,
AND THE ENDLESS CYCLE

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
OF NATIVE REVOLT
THAT INVARIABLY ENDED

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
IN DEFEAT, HUMILIATION,
AND FAILURE.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
SOCIAL ISSUES
BECOME MORE RAW.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000
YOU START TO SENSE THE
PRESENCE OF THE INDIAN

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
BEFORE OTHER
SOCIAL ELEMENTS

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000
AND WE START
TO SENSE CONFLICT.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
THESE INDIANS ARE
GENERALLY SERVANTS,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
THE SERVANTS
OF THE WEALTHY.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
AND SO SEVERAL NOVELS
COME FROM THE EXPERIENCE

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
OF THESE PEOPLE WHO CAME
FROM ANOTHER CLASS,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
BECAUSE MAYBE THEIR PARENTS
HAD A LARGE RURAL ESTATE,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
AND THEY SAW WHAT WAS GOING
ON WITH THESE INDIANS.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:08.000
AND YOU MIGHT COMPARE IT
TO NOVELS ABOUT SLAVERY.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
THE WRITER WHO ELEVATED
INDIGENOUS LITERATURE

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
TO THE NEXT LEVEL WAS JOSE
MARIA ARGUEDAS OF PERU.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
HE PENNED SOME OF THE MOST
LUMINOUSLY BEAUTIFUL PROSE

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
EVER TO COME OUT
OF LATIN AMERICA.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
BORN AND RAISED
IN POVERTY

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
AMONGST THE
QUECHUA INDIANS,

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
HE LEARNED TO SPEAK BOTH
QUECHUA AND SPANISH.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
ARGUEDAS LATER ATTENDED
THE UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
MAYOR DE SAN MARCOS, WHERE
HE STUDIED ANTHROPOLOGY.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
IN HIS EARLY LITERARY
OUTPUT, ARGUEDAS NATURALLY

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
GRAVITATED TOWARDS THE
QUECHUA EXPERIENCE,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
WHICH ALLOWED
HIM TO INDULGE

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
HIS ANTHROPOLOGICAL
INTERESTS

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
WHILE INVESTIGATING HIS
OWN MULTICULTURAL ROOTS.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
INEVITABLY HE WAS DRAWN
TO EXAMINING THE CLASH

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
BETWEEN THE WHITE MAN'S
"CIVILIZED" LIFESTYLE

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
AND THE "TRADITIONAL"
INDIGENOUS WAY OF LIFE.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
THE INFLUENCE OF THE
QUECHUA LANGUAGE,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
WHICH ALLOWS FOR SUBTLE
SHADES OF MEANING,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
PERVADES HIS WORK,
INFUSING IT WITH

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
LYRICISM AND
EXPRESSIVENESS.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
HIS POETRY WAS
PUBLISHED IN QUECHUA,

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
AND IN HIS NOVELS
HE TYPICALLY USED

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
NATIVE SYNTAX WITH
SPANISH VOCABULARY.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
REGARDLESS OF THE GENRE,
HE MINED HIS OWN PAST

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
TO CONJURE A PAST THAT WAS
A KIND OF ARCHAIC UTOPIA.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
THE CASE OF JOSE MARIA
ARGUEDAS IS VERY IMPORTANT

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
TO THE HISTORY OF LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
BECAUSE HE TRIES TO
CONSTRUCT A PLACE THAT

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
WOULD DISTANCE HIM FROM
CONVENTIONAL REGIONALISM.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
IN WHAT SENSE?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
HE WAS A
BILINGUAL WRITER.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
SO HE WAS A COMING
TOGETHER OF TWO LANGUAGES:

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
SPANISH AND QUECHUA.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
QUECHUA WAS ALSO HIS
NATIVE LANGUAGE.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
AND THAT'S WHERE
THE PROBLEM BEGINS.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
IN THE OTHER CASES
YOU SEE A DISTANCING,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
EVEN THOUGH THERE
WAS GOOD FAITH.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS MEANT
TO BRING THE READER CLOSER

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
TO THOSE REALITIES, A
DISTANCING WAS PRODUCED.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
AND ONE CAN
EXPERIENCE IT

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
BY READING THOSE
NOVELS TODAY.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
AND JOSE MARIA ARGUEDAS
DECIDED TO BREAK DOWN

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000
THAT DISTANCE.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
HE BEGINS BY TRYING
TO BUILD A PLACE

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
OF PROCLAMATION, ONE THAT
ISN'T HIMSELF BROUGHT

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
CLOSER TO THE READER
AS OPPOSED TO THE REST.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
HIS FIRST NOVEL,
PUBLISHED IN 1941,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
WAS ENTITLED
 YAWAR FIESTA.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
IT BROUGHT TOGETHER MANY
ELEMENTS THAT WOULD BE

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
REPRISED IN HIS LATER
WORKS: THE LUCID AND

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
UNAFFECTED PERSPECTIVE
OF A CHILD NARRATOR;

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
THE ANDES DEPICTED
IN ALL THEIR

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
INTENSE
NATURAL BEAUTY;

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN
INDIANS AND WHITES;

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
NATIVE SUBMISSION
AND EXPLOITATION;

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
THE CULTURAL WEIGHT
OF THE CHURCH

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
AND FIERCE CRITICISM
OF ITS MANIPULATIONS;

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
AND THE CENTRAL
AND COMPLEX ROLE

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
OF THE MIXED-RACE PEOPLE
KNOWN AS MESTIZOS,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
WHO WERE
SOMETIMES SERVILE

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
AND AT OTHER
TIMES REBELLIOUS.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
THE TOWN LOOKS BIG AS
 IT FOLLOWS THE SLOPE

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
OF THE MOUNTAIN; FROM
 THE BANKS OF A STREAM,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
WHERE EUCALYPTUS
 TREES GROW,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
THE TILED ROOFS RISE UP
 TO THE TOP OF THE RIDGE;

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
AT THE TOP THEY COME TO AN
 END BECAUSE GIRON BOLIVAR,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
THE STREET WHERE
 LEADING CITIZENS LIVE,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
IS ON THE RIDGE,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
AND THERE THE ROOFS ARE
 WHITE, OF CORRUGATED TIN.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
ON THE MOUNTAIN FLANKS,
 ALMOST WITHOUT STREETS,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
AMID BARLEY FIELDS,
 WITH LARGE CORRALS

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000
WHERE CUSHION PLANTS AND
 LEAFY PEPPER TREES GROW,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
THE HOUSES OF THE
 COMUNEROS IN THE AYLLUS

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
OF PUQUIO RESEMBLE
 AN INDIAN TOWN.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000
INDIAN TOWN, ON THE
 MOUNTAINSIDE, BY A STREAM.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
ARGUEDAS' BOOK DEEP RIVERS
IS THE MOST WELL KNOWN

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
AND PERHAPS THE
BEST OF HIS NOVELS.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
IN IT HE CONJURES AN
UNFORGETTABLE CHARACTER,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
ERNESTO, A CHILD THROUGH
WHOSE EYES A BRUTAL

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE
WORLD IS REVEALED.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
ERNESTO IS A BOY OF
EUROPEAN ANCESTRY

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
WHO IS RAISED
AMONG INDIANS

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
AND THEN RETURNED
TO THE WHITE WORLD.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
HE EMBODIES THE PAINFUL
ANTAGONISM OF TWO WORLDS

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
THAT ARE AT WAR
- BOTH IN THE WORLD

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
AND IN HIS OWN PSYCHE.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
THE BOY NARRATES THIS
TRAGIC CONFLICT AS IT

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
UNFOLDS IN CUZCO,
AND THE BEAUTIFUL

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
AND ANCIENT MOUNTAIN
CITY OF ABANCAY:

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
ERNESTO'S TIME AT
A RELIGIOUS SCHOOL;

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
A REVOLT LED BY WOMEN
WHO SELL A MAIZE LIQUOR

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
CALLED CHICHA; AND A
DEVASTATING PLAGUE

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
THAT ENDS THE NOVEL.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
THE LANDSCAPE STANDS
AS SILENT WITNESS

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
TO THE NEVER-ENDING
CONFLICT, STARTING WITH

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
THE BROKEN YET STILL
IMPOSING STONES OF CUZCO,

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
WHICH ERNESTO LOOKS UPON
WITH RESPECT AND FEAR.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
DAD, I SAID, EACH STONE
 HAS SOMETHING TO SAY;

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
LET'S WAIT.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
WE'RE NOT GOING
 TO HEAR ANYTHING.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
IT'S NOT THAT THEY
 SPEAK, YOU'RE CONFUSED.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000
THEY TRAVEL
 INTO YOUR MIND

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
AND IT IS FROM THERE
 THAT THEY TROUBLE YOU.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
EACH STONE
 IS DIFFERENT;

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
THEY'RE NOT CUT OUT,
 THEY'RE MOVING.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
THEY SEEM TO BE MOVING
 BECAUSE THEY'RE UNEVEN,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
EVEN MORE THAN THE STONES
 OUT IN THE FIELDS.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
FOR THE INCAS TURNED
 STONES INTO MUD

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
AS I HAVE TOLD
 YOU MANY TIMES.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
DAD, IT LOOKS LIKE
 THEY'RE WALKING.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
THEY TOSS AND TURN AND
 THEN THEY'RE STILL.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
WHEREVER I GO, THE STONES
 THAT WERE SENT TO BE MADE

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
BY INCA ROCA SHALL
 KEEP ME COMPANY.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
WITH GREAT LYRIC BEAUTY,
ARGUEDAS CONSTRUCTED

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
A NOVEL OF MANY VOICES
IN WHICH NATURE,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:24.000
IMPETUOUS AND CAPRICIOUS,
IS THE MAIN PROTAGONIST.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
IN A TALE FILLED WITH THE
WORKINGS OF MEMORY AND THE

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
STRANGENESS INHERENT IN
ERNESTO'S BILINGUALISM,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
NATURE IS THE POINT
OF ENTRY FOR MAGIC

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
AND ANIMISM, AND
FOR NATIVE BELIEFS.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
ERNESTO'S WORLD
IS INHABITED

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.000
NOT ONLY BY
HUMAN BEINGS -

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
THE FRIARS AND BOARDING
SCHOOL STUDENTS,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
THE NATIVES AND
THE CHICHERAS -

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000
BUT ALSO AND ESPECIALLY
BY THE URUTURCO,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
A RIVER OF
VIOLENT GREEN

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
THAT CROSSES THE MOUNTAINS
AND PROVIDES ONE OF

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
THE POSSIBLE MEANINGS
OF THE NOVEL'S TITLE.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
SUFFUSED WITH THE
MUSICALITY OF

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
QUECHUA WORDS AND
SYNTAX, DEEP RIVERS IS

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
A COMPELLING NARRATIVE,
A CULTURAL TOUCHSTONE,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
AND A DEVASTATING SOCIAL
CRITIQUE WRAPPED INTO ONE.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
IT LAYS BARE THE
COMPLEXITIES OF A

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
PLURALIST CULTURE WHERE
VARIOUS NATIONS AND

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
MINORITIES COEXIST
UNEASILY, AND AS SUCH

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
LAYS OUT THE MOST ACUTE
POLITICAL CHALLENGES

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
FACING LATIN AMERICA.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
IN DEEP RIVERS
WE FIND SOMETHING

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000
RATHER INTERESTING.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
HE WANTS TO AVOID A
TYPICAL ELEMENT IN THESE

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
REGIONALIST NOVELS,
THAT IS, THE GLOSSARY.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
AT THE END OF THE
NOVEL OR IN FOOTNOTES

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
WE FIND DEFINITIONS
OF WORDS,

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
REFERRING TO THIS OR
THAT TYPE OF PLANT.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
TRYING TO EXPLAIN A TERM
RELATED TO AN ANIMAL

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
OR PLANT OR
EVEN LOCAL WAYS.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
WHAT HE WANTS IS TO
INCORPORATE THAT

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
INTO THE NARRATION.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
THEREFORE, THE READER
GOES ON IMAGINING THINGS,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
OR EVEN WORDS, THROUGH
THE WAY IN WHICH HE

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:18.000
PRESENTS THEM AND THROUGH
THE IMAGES HE PROVIDES.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
AS LATIN AMERICA SHED ITS
COLONIAL PAST AND SETTLED

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.000
INTO SECURE NATIONAL
IDENTITIES, IT WAS ALMOST

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
INEVITABLE THAT LITERATURE
WOULD FOCUS ITS ATTENTION

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
ON LOCAL ISSUES AND
NATIVE EXPERIENCE.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
YET, IN A WORLD OF IRONY
AND CONTRADICTIONS,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE OF THE EARLY

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
TWENTIETH CENTURY OFFERED
UP A WIDE SPECTRUM

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000
OF PERSPECTIVES THAT OFTEN
COMPETED WITH ONE ANOTHER.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
MODERNISMO EFFECTED A
PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
IN THE LANGUAGE
OF LITERATURE.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
THE AVANT GARDE STRETCHED
THE BOUNDARIES OF

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
AESTHETICS AND OF
POLITICAL ACTIVISM.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
MEANWHILE, THE
NOVELLA DE LA TIERRA,

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
REGIONALIST LITERATURE,
AND INDIGENIST NARRATIVES

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
LOOKED TO
THE REAL LIVES

BEING LIVED BY
EVERYDAY FOLKS,

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000

AND THE SUBMISSION

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
THAT SCAR THE HISTORY
