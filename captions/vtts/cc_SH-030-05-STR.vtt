00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.400


2
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.600
Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and enters

3
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.500
Into an honest house, our story says.

4
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.300
She sings like one immortal, and she dances

5
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.630
As goddess-like to her admired lays;

6
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.000
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes

7
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.800
Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, and berry,

8
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.070
That even her art sisters the natural roses;

9
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.270
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:

10
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.100
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,

11
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.600
Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain

12
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.870
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;

13
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700
And to her father turn our minds again,

14
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.030
Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;

15
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.570
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived

16
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.070
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast

17
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.270
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived

18
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.470
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence

19
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.230
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,

20
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.670
His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;

21
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.170
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.

22
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.330
Where is lord Helicanus?

23
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.570
he can resolve you.

24
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.570
O, here he is.

25
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.100
Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,

26
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.000
And in it is Lysimachus the governor,

27
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.800
Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?

28
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.200
That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.

29
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.070
Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.

30
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.800
Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;

31
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.200
I pray ye, greet them fairly.

32
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.670
Sir,

33
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.000
This is the man that can, in aught you would, resolve you.

34
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.830
Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!

35
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.170
And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,

36
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.970
And die as I would do.

37
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.430
You wish me well.

38
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.930
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,

39
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.570
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,

40
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.900
I made to it, to know of whence you are.

41
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.170
First, what is your place?

42
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.200
I am the governor of this place you lie before.

43
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.070
Sir,

44
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.570
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;

45
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.900
A man who for this three months hath not spoken

46
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.870
To any one, nor taken sustenance

47
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.100
But to prorogue his grief.

48
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.600
Upon what ground is his distemperature?

49
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.970
'Twould be too tedious to repeat;

50
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.200
But the main grief springs from the loss

51
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.130
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.

52
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.970
May we not see him?

53
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.130
You may;

54
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.100
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak to any.

55
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.100
Yet let me obtain my wish.

56
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.770
Behold him.

57
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.600
This was a goodly person,

58
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.900
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,

59
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.970
Drove him to this.

60
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.170
Sir king, all hail!

61
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.430
Hail, royal sir!

62
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.300
The god's preserve you.

63
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.530
It is in vain; he will not speak to you.

64
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.030
Sir,

65
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.300
We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,

66
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.870
Would win some words of him.

67
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.070
'Tis well bethought.

68
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.930
She questionless with her sweet harmony

69
00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.230
And other chosen attractions, would allure,

70
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.430
And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,

71
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.270
Which now are midway stopp'd:

72
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.630
She is all happy as the fairest of all,

73
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.600
And, with her fellow maids is now upon

74
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.530
The leafy shelter that abuts against

75
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.970
The island's side.

76
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.500
Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit

77
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.230
That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness

78
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.570
We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you

79
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.330
That for our gold we may provision have,

80
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.200
Wherein we are not destitute for want,

81
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.300
But weary for the staleness.

82
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.400
O, sir, a courtesy

83
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.770
Which if we should deny, the most just gods

84
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.730
For every graff would send a caterpillar,

85
00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.430
And so afflict our province. Yet once more

86
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.130
Let me entreat to know at large the cause

87
00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.430
Of your king's sorrow.

88
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.730
Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:

89
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.030
But, see, I am prevented.

90
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.070
O, here is

91
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.800
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!

92
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.870
Is't not a goodly presence?

93
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.230
She's a gallant lady.

94
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.900
She's such a one, that, were I well assured

95
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.970
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,

96
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.370
I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.

97
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:57.100
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty

98
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.900
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:

99
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.200
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat

100
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.500
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,

101
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.570
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay

102
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.070
As thy desires can wish.

103
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.370
Sir, I will use

104
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.830
My utmost skill in his recovery,

105
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.570
Provided that none but I and my companion maid

106
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.000
Be suffer'd to come near him.

107
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.330
Come, let us leave her;

108
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.630
And the gods make her prosperous!

109
00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:02.130
â™ª sings

110
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.600
Mark'd he your music?

111
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.730
No, nor look'd on us.

112
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.630
See, she will speak to him.

113
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:46.870
Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.

114
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.670
I am a maid,

115
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:52.400
My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,

116
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.070
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,

117
00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.270
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief

118
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:04.000
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.

119
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.270
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,

120
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.070
My derivation was from ancestors

121
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.830
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:

122
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.700
But time hath rooted out my parentage,

123
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.500
And to the world and awkward casualties

124
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.930
Bound me in servitude.

125
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.370
I will desist;

126
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.370
But there is something glows upon my cheek,

127
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.230
And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'

128
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:43.900
My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--

129
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:52.600
To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?

130
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.070
I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,

131
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.030
You would not do me violence.

132
00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:05.230
I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.

133
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:15.030
You are like something that--What country-woman?

134
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.800
Here of these shores?

135
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.670
No, nor of any shores:

136
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:21.430
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am

137
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.870
No other than I appear.

138
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:29.570
I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.

139
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.670
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one

140
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:42.900
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;

141
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.730
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;

142
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:51.230
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like

143
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:57.930
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;

144
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.300
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,

145
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:10.300
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?

146
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.670
Where I am but a stranger:

147
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:14.400
From the deck you may discern the place.

148
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.170
Where were you bred?

149
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.400
And how achieved you these endowments, which

150
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.500
You make more rich to owe?

151
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.100
If I should tell my history, it would seem

152
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.500
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.

153
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.900
Prithee, speak:

154
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.030
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st

155
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.200
Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace

156
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.100
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will believe thee,

157
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.970
And make my senses credit thy relation

158
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:50.500
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st

159
00:12:50.500 --> 00:13:02.200
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?

160
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.930
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--

161
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.930
Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest

162
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.470
From good descending?

163
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.100
So indeed I did.

164
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.500
Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st

165
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.570
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,

166
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.330
And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,

167
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:19.900
If both were open'd.

168
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.870
Some such thing

169
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.630
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts

170
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.070
Did warrant me was likely.

171
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:27.770
Tell thy story;

172
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.470
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part

173
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.830
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I

174
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:38.030
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look

175
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.230
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling

176
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:50.100
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?

177
00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:57.030
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?

178
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:00.730
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.

179
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.300
My name is Marina.

180
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:15.330
O, I am mock'd,

181
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.300
And thou by some incensed god sent hither

182
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.600
To make the world to laugh at me.

183
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.270
Patience, good sir,

184
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.330
Or here I'll cease.

185
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:33.700
Nay, I'll be patient.

186
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.870
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,

187
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:39.500
To call thyself Marina.

188
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.430
The name was given me by one that had some power,

189
00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:46.700
My father, and a king.

190
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.600
How! a king's daughter?

191
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.970
And call'd Marina?

192
00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.700
You said you would believe me;

193
00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.130
But, not to be a troubler of your peace, I will end here.

194
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.430
But are you flesh and blood?

195
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.700
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?

196
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:18.970
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?

197
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.100
And wherefore call'd Marina?

198
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.630
Call'd Marina For I was born at sea.

199
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:29.700
At sea! what mother?

200
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.070
My mother was the daughter of a king;

201
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.030
Who died the minute I was born,

202
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.900
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft

203
00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.130
Deliver'd weeping.

204
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:44.000
O, stop there a little!

205
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.030
This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep

206
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:54.500
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:

207
00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:09.370
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?

208
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.030
I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,

209
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.600
And never interrupt you.

210
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.770
You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.

211
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.230
I will believe you by the syllable

212
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:24.900
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:

213
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:31.270
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?

214
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.570
The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;

215
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.730
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,

216
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.000
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd

217
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.930
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,

218
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.870
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;

219
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.900
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,

220
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.700
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?

221
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.530
It may be, You think me an impostor:

222
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.500
no, good faith;

223
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.900
I am the daughter to King Pericles,

224
00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.430
If good King Pericles be.

225
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:08.670
Ho, Helicanus!

226
00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.970
Calls my lord?

227
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.500
Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,

228
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.030
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,

229
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.570
What this maid is, or what is like to be,

230
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:22.030
That thus hath made me weep?

231
00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.170
I know not; but

232
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.870
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene

233
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.070
Speaks nobly of her.

234
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.430
She would never tell

235
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.830
Her parentage; being demanded that,

236
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.770
She would sit still and weep.

237
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:41.930
O Helicanus, strike me, royal'd sir;

238
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.370
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;

239
00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:52.030
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me

240
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.770
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,

241
00:17:53.770 --> 00:18:05.330
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,

242
00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:13.630
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;

243
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:20.400
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,

244
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.500
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,

245
00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.730
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud

246
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:39.670
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.

247
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.630
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,

248
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.230
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,

249
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.400
Though doubts did ever sleep.

250
00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.630
First, sir, I pray,

251
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:48.670
What is your title?

252
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:52.030
I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now

253
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.530
My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said

254
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.000
Thou hast been godlike perfect,

255
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.030
The heir of kingdoms and another like

256
00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.700
To Pericles thy father.

257
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:04.000
Is it no more to be your daughter than

258
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.930
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?

259
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.500
Thaisa was my mother, who did end

260
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.270
The minute I began.

261
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:23.330
Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.

262
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:31.670
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;

263
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.100
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,

264
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:37.870
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;

265
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.770
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge

266
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.600
She is thy very princess. Who is this?

267
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.570
Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,

268
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.930
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,

269
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.100
Did come to see you.

270
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.500
I embrace you.

271
00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:55.730
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.

272
00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:02.470
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?

273
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.670
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him

274
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.670
O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,

275
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.330
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?

276
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.830
(â™ª music)

277
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.330
My lord, I hear none.

278
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.070
(â™ª music)

279
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:24.730
None!

280
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:35.770
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.

281
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.970
It is not good to cross him; give him way.

282
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:45.570
Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?

283
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.430
Music, my lord, I hear.

284
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.570
Most heavenly music!

285
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:59.530
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber

286
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:07.570
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.

287
00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.330
A pillow for his head:

288
00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.170
So, leave him.

289
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.870
Well, my companion friends,

290
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.200
If this but answer to my just belief,

291
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.430
I'll well remember you.

292
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:53.700
My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,

293
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:59.030
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.

294
00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.600
There, when my maiden priests are met together,

295
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.770
Before the people all,

296
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:10.930
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:

297
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.630
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call

298
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:18.030
And give them repetition to the life.

299
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:23.370
Perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;

300
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:29.570
Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!

301
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:35.570
Awake, and tell thy dream.

302
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:43.230
Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,

303
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.870
I will obey thee.

304
00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:04.470
Helicanus!

305
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.570
Sir?

306
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.000
My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike

307
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.770
The inhospitable Cleon; but I am

308
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.100
For other service first: toward Ephesus

309
00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.430
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.

310
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:23.370
Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,

311
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.000
And give you gold for such provision

312
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.100
As our intents will need?

313
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:29.130
Sir, With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,

314
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:32.500
I have another suit.

315
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.070
You shall prevail,

316
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.970
Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems

317
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.970
You have been noble towards her.

318
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:48.930
Sir, lend me your arm.

319
00:23:48.930 --> 00:23:54.570
Come, my Marina.

320
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:22.200
Now our sands are almost run;

321
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.730
More a little, and then dumb.

322
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:28.430
This, my last boon, give me,

323
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.800
For such kindness must relieve me,

324
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.270
That you aptly will suppose

325
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:38.330
What pageantry, what feats, what shows,

326
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.530
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,

327
00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.130
The regent made in Mytilene

328
00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:45.030
To greet the king. So he thrived,

329
00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.100
That he is promised to be wived

330
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.730
To fair Marina; but in no wise

331
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.770
Till he had done his sacrifice,

332
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.970
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,

333
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.400
The interim, pray you, all confound.

334
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:03.070
In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,

335
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.630
And wishes fall out as they're will'd.

336
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.970
At Ephesus, the temple see,

337
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.200
Our king and all his company.

338
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.070
That he can hither come so soon,

339
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.900
Is by your fancy's thankful doom.

340
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:33.700
Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,

341
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.900
I here confess myself the king of Tyre;

342
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.500
Who, frighted from my country, did wed

343
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.600
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.

344
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:47.830
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth

345
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.870
A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,

346
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:56.730
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus

347
00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.430
Was nursed with Cleon; who at sixteen years

348
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.470
He sought to murder: but her better stars

349
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.830
Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore

350
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.230
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,

351
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:13.370
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she

352
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:17.170
Made known herself my daughter.

353
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:29.500
Voice and favour!

354
00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:39.800
You are, you are--O royal Pericles!

355
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.100
She dies! help, gentlemen!

356
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.730
To the lady.

357
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:48.200
Noble sir,

358
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.700
If you have told Diana's altar true,

359
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.700
This is your wife.

360
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.830
Reverend appearer, no;

361
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:59.070
I threw her overboard with these very arms.

362
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.630
Upon this coast, I warrant you.

363
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:06.570
'Tis most certain.

364
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:12.570
O, she's but o'erjoy'd.

365
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.470
Early one blustering morn this lady was

366
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:22.200
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,

367
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.200
Found her rich jewels; recover'd her,

368
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.000
and placed her here in Diana's temple.

369
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.400
May we see them?

370
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.330
Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,

371
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:38.530
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.

372
00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:42.500
O, let me look!

373
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.130
If he be none of mine, my sanctity

374
00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.900
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,

375
00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:54.370
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,

376
00:27:54.370 --> 00:28:02.470
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,

377
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:08.500
Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,

378
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.370
A birth, and death?

379
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.900
The voice of dead Thaisa!

380
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:20.270
That Thaisa am I, supposed dead

381
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.530
And drown'd.

382
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:24.830
Immortal Dian!

383
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.330
Now I know you better.

384
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.030
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,

385
00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:30.570
The king my father gave you such a ring.

386
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:41.470
This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness

387
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:47.830
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,

388
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:52.530
That on the touching of her lips I may

389
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:58.930
Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried

390
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.870
A second time within these arms.

391
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:09.000
My heart Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.

392
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.630
Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;

393
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.830
Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina

394
00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.600
For she was yielded there.

395
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:29.630
Blest, and mine own!

396
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:35.170
Blest, and mine own!

397
00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:40.530
Hail, madam, and my queen!

398
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:43.300
I know you not.

399
00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.000
You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,

400
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.530
I left behind an ancient substitute:

401
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.900
Can you remember what I call'd the man?

402
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.700
I have named him oft.

403
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.400
'Twas Helicanus then.

404
00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.830
Still confirmation:

405
00:29:54.830 --> 00:30:00.230
Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.

406
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.200
Now do I long to hear how you were found;

407
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.430
How possibly preserved; and who to thank,

408
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.200
Besides the gods, for this great miracle.

409
00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.830
Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,

410
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.430
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can

411
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:20.130
From first to last resolve you.

412
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.630
Reverend sir,

413
00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.370
The gods can have no mortal officer

414
00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.700
More like a god than you. Will you deliver

415
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:29.900
How this dead queen re-lives?

416
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.830
I will, my lord.

417
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.130
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,

418
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.670
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;

419
00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:37.400
How she came placed here in the temple;

420
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.000
No needful thing omitted.

421
00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:53.930
Pure Dian, I bless thee for thy vision!

422
00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:57.800
And will offer night-oblations to thee.

423
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:04.300
Thaisa, This prince,

424
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.100
the fair-betrothed of your daughter,

425
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.970
Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,

426
00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:15.200
This ornament

427
00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.630
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;

428
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.730
And what these many years no razor touch'd,

429
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.600
To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.

430
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.900
Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,

431
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:34.930
My father's dead.

432
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:41.700
Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,

433
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.170
We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves

434
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:47.830
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:

435
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:52.630
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.

436
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.830
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay

437
00:31:54.830 --> 00:32:01.230
To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.

438
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.770
In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard

439
00:32:21.770 --> 00:32:26.200
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:

440
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.070
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,

441
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.130
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,

442
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.130
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,

443
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:42.570
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:

444
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.330
In Helicanus may you well descry

445
00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:48.930
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:

446
00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.000
In reverend Cerimon there well appears

447
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
The worth that learned charity aye wears:

448
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.530
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame

449
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.200
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name

450
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:06.600
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,

451
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:13.570
That he and his they in his palace burn;

452
00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.600
The gods for murder seemed so content

453
00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:22.330
To punish; although not done, but meant.

454
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:29.670
So, on your patience evermore attending,

455
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:37.330
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.

456
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.870
