 The Secret Life of the Brain...

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.430
WOMAN:
One weekend,
our daughter was here,

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.330
and he walked into the kitchen
and he said,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.360
"Who are you?"

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.500
NARRATOR:
In its final decades,
the brain is faced

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.230
with a new set of challenges.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.530
MAN:
63 years old
and can't tie your own shoes?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.130
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.600
NARRATOR:
But it marshals
surprising powers of renewal.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.760
MAN 2:
What makes the engine go?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.360
Desire... desire... desire.

MAN:
I have walked through many lives

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.230
Some of them my own

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.130
And I am not who I was

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.400
Though some principle
of being abides

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.500
From which I struggle
not to stray.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.530
NARRATOR:
The brain in old age.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.500
In its furrows and folds dwell
the imprints of a lifetime,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.030
the unique history
that makes us who we are--

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.730
all we know and can remember

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.230
etched in
a hundred billion neurons--

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.860
cells that can last
our entire lives.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.560
MAN:
Neurons can live to a hundred
and twenty-some years.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.530
What else will work
for that long

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.230
without going to the repairman
all the time?

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.130
I think what's unusual
about the aging brain

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.930
is the fact that it's built

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.600
to withstand, you know,
that many years.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.900
Somehow these neurons
just keep going.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.260
And neurons are up against a
potentially hostile environment.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.960
They take hits.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.700
NARRATOR:
In its final decades,
the brain must contend

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.460
with the slowing down
of its neural circuits

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.260
and with crippling diseases
and injuries

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.360
few younger brains ever face.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.260
But scientists have begun

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.330
to unlock the secrets
of the aging brain.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.360
Long thought to be defenseless
to the onslaughts of time,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.230
the brain can marshal
surprising powers of renewal.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.560
NARRATOR:
Three years ago,
a stroke left Kent Miller

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.060
with the left side
of his body paralyzed.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.430
Even after months
of rehabilitation,

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.660
he still can't use
his left arm and hand.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.960
His career as an accountant
has come to an end.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.260
MILLER:
You know, you feel worthless.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.760
You can't do the things
that you used to do,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.200
physically and mentally.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.100
And it's been a bear
for my wife, my family.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.960
It hasn't been
too easy for me, either.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.400
I want to become whole,
to put it simply.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.700
I want to get my arm back.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.100
I want to take something
in my left hand.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.700
I want to be able
to tie my shoes.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.330
Is that, you know...
isn't that ridiculous--

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.560
63 years old
and can't tie your own shoes?

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.330
I'm sick of Velcro.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.500
I want shoelaces, and I want
to be able to tie them.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.960
What about using a toothbrush
to brush your teeth?

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.130
Did you use
the affected hand
to do that?

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.330
No, I didn't do that.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.930
You just used
your right hand.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.930
Yeah.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.960
When you are
getting dressed,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.130
putting your arm
through a sleeve
of clothing,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.430
do you actively
push your left hand
and arm through,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.060
or do you pull it on
with your right?

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.030
I pull it on
with my right.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.600
So that means
your left hand

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.560
just kind of,
sort of,   
laid there?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.360
Yeah.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.230
NARRATOR:
At the University of Alabama
in Birmingham,

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.860
Kent has enrolled in a study

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.400
that may help him regain
the use of his arm.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.800
For Mr. Miller, he's still there
very much cognitively,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.860
but physically he would like
to have his independence back.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.300
So we're trying to work with him

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.830
so that he can regain
some of his independence.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.960
You know,
actually...

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.230
that's
fairly flexible.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.530
Yeah, I know,
but<i> I</i> can't do it.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.500
NARRATOR:
The stroke that left Kent
with a paralyzed left arm

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.460
struck at the part of his brain
responsible for moving the arm.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.400
A blockage in an artery suddenly
stopped the flow of blood,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.000
cutting off oxygen, shutting
down the flow of signals.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.900
Millions of neurons were killed.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.200
Millions more were injured.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.300
The damaged part of his brain
shrank to half its former size.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.030
Because the right side
of the brain controls

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.730
the left side of the body,

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.600
Kent's left arm and leg
were paralyzed.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.530
MAN:
Most patients have been told,
after a stroke,

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.400
that the amount of movement

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.860
that they have at six months
or one year

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.530
is the maximum
that they're going to have

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.330
for the rest of their life.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.660
Whatever they have
at one year, that's it

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.000
and they're not going
to get any better.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.800
NARRATOR:
But neuroscientist Edward Taub
and his colleagues

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.800
are teaching stroke survivors
from all over the country

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.460
how to revive the stricken part
of their brains

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.430
many years after a stroke.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.030
Let it go.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.330
Let it go.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.130
Extend that finger on out.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.760
Good job.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.660
There are little
spacings in here

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.960
for each individual
finger,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.060
so you're going
to have

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.160
to push your hand
all the way in.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.100
NARRATOR:
Taub's innovative therapy
requires Kent

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.900
to immobilize his good hand.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.460
Oh, let's do
this again.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.160
What it boils down to is that
you can't use the good one,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.600
so you've got
to use the bad hand.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.160
ALLEN:
Okay, are
you ready

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.300
to place your hand
up on the table?

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.130
NARRATOR:
Kent had written off
his left hand as useless.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.730
Now he will discover just
how much he can do with it--

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.330
because of the resilience
of his brain.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.400
During the past three years,

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.700
many of the injured neurons
have recovered.

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.230
But most have been recruited
by neighboring brain circuits

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.860
responsible for moving parts
of Kent's body

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.460
unaffected by the stroke.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:20.260
If Kent works hard enough, he
can force his recovered neurons

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.260
to resume their old job

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.830
and send signals
to his left arm once again.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.700
But first he has to overcome
a dependence on his right arm

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.760
that's become deeply encoded
in his brain.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:37.030
TAUB:
The person could use the arm,
if he really tried,

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.200
but he just never tries.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.260
He doesn't try
because he's learned not to try.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.230
It's a conditioned response,

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:48.660
but it goes on week after week,
month after month

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.930
and as time goes on, it becomes
more and more powerful,

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:56.660
and eventually, it becomes
overwhelmingly powerful.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.730
And so you've got
to counter-condition

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.860
this extremely strong tendency
not to use the arm.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.530
I want you
to see how many
of these dominoes

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.300
you can flip over
in 30 seconds.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.430
The key is to not
just pick them up
and drop them,

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.360
but to actually
use your fingers

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.830
and maneuver
the domino.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.230
I know you have the ability.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.100
And that's what I'm here to do,

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.400
to push you
to do the right thing.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.560
Okay, let's go.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560
You starting
the timer?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560
Yes.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.900
Ooh, try it again.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.930
That one was two.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.630
That's okay.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.060
This last one you just did here,
we don't want that.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.030
Better,
that's great.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.030
Ooh, look!

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.200
Those fingers
are working.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.530
NARRATOR:
What makes Taub's therapy so
effective-- and so exhausting--

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.560
is that these
small, clumsy movements

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.300
have to be endlessly repeated.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.460
Nice.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.630
Easy for you
to say.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.160
NARRATOR:
Over the next two weeks,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.200
Kent will flip hundreds
of dominoes.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.160
TAUB:
Simply overcoming this nonuse
of the limb isn't enough.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:12.330
You have to repeat movements
over and over and over again.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.330
That's the secret.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:14.230
(<i> sighs</i> )

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.230
Come on, fingers.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.230
(<i> groans</i> )

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.230
That's all right.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.260
Keep going.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.430
You put grease
on this one.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.930
(<i> laughs</i> )

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.430
NARRATOR:
Hundreds of Taub's patients have
seen remarkable improvement.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.100
James Faust was a sales manager

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.030
when a stroke paralyzed
his right arm.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.060
FAUST:
I had no use of it whatsoever.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.400
It was just dangling.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.860
I even had thoughts

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.260
of maybe talking to somebody
about amputation

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.460
because it was just
in my way, really.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.860
NARRATOR:
But after two years
of paralysis,

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:59.200
he went to see Edward Taub,
and his life turned around.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.430
FAUST:
Two weeks or three weeks
after that program,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.660
we were out to eat dinner
one night.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.660
And I looked over at my wife,
and her eyes were wide

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.760
and her mouth was agasp...

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.900
(<i> imitates gasping</i> )

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.460
And I said,
"What's the matter?"

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.230
And she said,
"Look at your right hand."

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:17.530
And I did, and in that
right hand was a steak knife.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.330
And I was cutting up my steak

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.100
as if nothing had ever happened
to that hand.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.630
NARRATOR:
Encouraged by his progress,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.560
Faust continued
his exercises for years.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:35.230
FAUST:
I have no problem doing anything
I want to do with my right arm.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:37.700
I can drive my car.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.330
I can tie my shoes.

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:43.660
I can brush my teeth.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.160
I can shave.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.800
I can do anything I want to do.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.830
TAUB:
The human brain is an
enormously plastic instrument.

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:57.900
The amount of area of the brain

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.730
that is involved
in producing movements

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:07.760
or receiving sensation
keeps changing continuously,

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:14.200
based on the amount of use
that part of the body gets.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.830
And it turns out that no matter
how old the person becomes--

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.360
no matter
how aged the brain is--

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.960
that plasticity
remains undiminished.

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:30.160
NARRATOR:
Taub has found that
after just two weeks of therapy,

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.860
the part of the brain
that controls the crippled limb

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:36.300
has expanded back
to its original size.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:42.000
Just why is still a mystery.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.330
TAUB:
In introductory
psychology courses

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.060
when I first went to school,

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.530
they used to say, some people
think of the brain as a muscle.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:54.200
And that was invariably followed
by the professor laughing

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.800
and saying,
"The brain isn't a muscle."

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.360
Well, the fact
of the matter is...

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.030
(<i> chuckling</i> ):
that in the last 15 years,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.930
what we've begun to find
is that, in a sense,

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.660
the brain<i> is</i> like a muscle

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:11.400
and the more that you
exercise it, the better it gets.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.930
ALLEN:
Are those
good French fries?

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.230
MILLER:
Yeah, they're
pretty good.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.700
NARRATOR:
After two weeks of therapy,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.430
Kent Miller is eating
with his left hand

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:23.360
for the first time in years.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.000
Break my neck
getting to it, though.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.560
ALLEN:
Good, good.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.730
That's good; good bite.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:34.000
MILLER:
I know I'm a lot farther along
than I was,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.830
because I really wouldn't use
my left hand.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.400
When your hand gets tired,
stop, let it rest.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.660
MILLER:
It was so much easier to use
the right, which worked normal,

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.330
and now it's...
it's almost natural

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.560
for me to use it at times--
the left side.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.560
How's that?

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.960
That's a little
bit better.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.230
The one thing I got
to watch

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.900
is that I don't bite
my fingers.

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.330
Yeah, because you kind
of want to keep those.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.830
That's another thing.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.400
It's easier
to go down after something

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.830
than, sometimes,
lift the arm and...

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.360
up to where it is.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:12.060
One of the things they want me
to do is to comb my hair,

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.860
and I just can't hardly
get up there,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.060
where I can get
to my mouth okay.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.730
And, uh... that's neat.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:30.400
In this task,
I'm going to say
some words

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.660
that are the names
of objects
and animals.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.060
When...
Listen carefully

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.200
and when I finish,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.200
I want you to say them
back to me

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.430
in the order of
their physical size--

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:41.130
so from smallest
to largest.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:44.930
"Wastebasket, oven,
river,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.000
slipper, lemon."

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.760
Slipper,
wastebasket, oven...

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.660
I don't know what the third...

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.360
what the last one
you said there.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.000
I've forgotten it already.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.700
NARRATOR:
While only some of us suffer
from strokes,

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.500
all of us worry our minds may
start to fail as we get older.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.460
I'd like you to point to the
same blocks in the same order.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.460
Here's the
first one.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.460
NARRATOR:
This lab at the
University of Michigan

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.130
studies how age
affects mental performance.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.530
Its director,
psychologist Denise Park,

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:27.400
is gathering evidence
that presents a new view

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.700
of brain aging.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.600
Aging begins in your 20s,
as soon as you reach maturity.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.600
Our data show clearly--
absolutely clearly--

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.700
that, um, as you age
from 20 to 30,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.160
you're a little bit slower.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:47.330
You process information
not quite as fast, um,

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.560
you can hold a little bit less
information in consciousness

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.230
and you recall a little,
tiny bit less from 20 to 30

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.300
and from 30 to 40, the same
thing and so on and so forth.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.930
Then suddenly you're 70 and you
start really noticing, perhaps

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:08.500
that these continuous declines
have aggregated

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.460
and you may realize

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:14.760
that you're not cognitively
what you used to be.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.800
Now, this is especially true
of memory,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.830
and the more unfamiliar
the information,

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:26.760
the more trouble
you're going to have.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.730
You're going to remember
familiar stuff,

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.200
but if I bring you in my lab

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.230
and ask you to remember
a list of words,

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.560
you're going to see
that age-related decline.

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.760
Okay, this task is
the free-recall task.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.200
In this task, I'll
read you a list
of 12 words.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.360
When I get to...

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.400
You should listen
carefully to the words,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.800
and when I get
to the end,

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.600
you should recall them
back to me

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.100
in any order
that you like.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.330
Okay?

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.800
All right.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.660
"Line, honey, train,

00:17:55.660 --> 00:18:03.900
"sky, puzzle, jury,
garage, doll,

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:10.930
wife, toast, bed, watch."

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.260
Recall.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.460
(<i> sighs</i> )

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:23.530
Line, honey, train,
sky, doll, honey, um...

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:28.300
Watch, honey...

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.300
train...
I said that, didn't I?

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:39.360
Watch, toast, doll,
wife, honey, line...

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.730
NARRATOR:
Learning someone's name,

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.860
remembering where you
parked your car...

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.460
"Jury" comes to mind.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.500
NARRATOR:
Why do these things get harder
as we get older?

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:58.260
One answer may lie in
the way new memories are formed.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.360
For a memory to take shape,

00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.560
neurons must forge
electrical and chemical links

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.260
that connect them
into a stable circuit.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.830
For decades, scientists thought
that as the brain aged,

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.830
millions of neurons died,

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.160
making it harder
for new circuits to form.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.160
But in the 1990s,
this long-standing theory

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.300
was found to be wrong.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:30.100
One of the most remarkable
things now that we understand it

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.660
is how little nerve cell loss
there is--

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.260
how much the brain stays full
of cells that we need

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.430
in order to function normally,

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:42.360
and that's something that
we didn't use to know at all.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.360
Now, this is interesting,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.860
because it forces us, then,
to look elsewhere

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.200
for the changes in the brain
that are impacting function.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.330
Hi, guys.

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.160
How's the cutting
going?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.300
Great.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.230
Are these the,
uh, brains
from Boston?

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.600
NARRATOR:
At Mount Sinai School
of Medicine in New York,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.730
neurobiologist John Morrison
is looking for clues

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.600
in a region of the brain
where new memories are formed--

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.600
the hippocampus.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:13.500
When we learn something new,

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.230
neurons in the hippocampus
forge strong connections

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.760
by sending electrochemical
messages

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.660
across the tiny gaps
between them, called "synapses."

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.300
Essential to the strength
of the connection

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.030
is the movement of electrically
charged particles of calcium

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.900
drifting through the synapses.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.130
When the particles stream
into a neuron,

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.230
they trigger chemical changes

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.030
that make the connection
more reliable.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:45.730
The calcium flows
through a molecule

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.800
that's the gateway to
the neuron-- the NMDA receptor.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.160
MORRISON:
We know that the NMDA receptor
is critically linked to memory.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.330
So, one of the changes that
leads to memory decline in aging

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.160
might be lower levels
of NMDA receptors.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.330
So we have looked
for those kinds of changes.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:08.500
NARRATOR:
When Morrison examined
the hippocampus of monkeys,

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.730
he found that in young animals,

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.900
a single synapse had dozens
of NMDA receptors,

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.630
but in older monkeys,

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.960
the numbers of receptors
dropped sharply.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.100
MORRISON:
Well, it was really amazing,

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.930
because this decrease occurred
in the circuit

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.130
that leads to the ability to
learn and remember new things--

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:33.760
the classic form of memory
that's affected in aging.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.300
This is, to me,
an optimistic scenario,

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:41.230
because now we have
a molecular target

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.100
that could potentially
be manipulated

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.630
to restore the health
of that memory circuit.

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.330
You guys can start staining
for the light microscopy.

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:53.400
NARRATOR:
Morrison is trying
to develop drugs

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:56.800
to replenish the lost receptors
and rejuvenate failing memories.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.100
So that will give us
a receptor

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.560
and a presynaptic
marker.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.860
NARRATOR:
But the brain,
scientists are learning,

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.460
has ways to rejuvenate itself.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.030
93-year-old Milton Adamson

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.930
has exercised regularly
since he was 42.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:19.100
On memory tests, he does as well
as people half his age.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:24.130
I feel that the mind, uh,
does not lose its ability

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.160
as quickly if you exercise.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.360
ALBERT:
We never used to think
that physical activity

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.630
was good for the brain
until really very recently

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.560
and there was a large study
that was done

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.830
where they took over
1,000 people in the community

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.460
and looked at the things

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.530
that predicted what helped them
maintain mental ability,

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.760
and it turned out that physical
activity was one of them.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.130
ADAMSON (<i> on phone</i> ):
Yeah, well,

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.330
we'll get
involved with that

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:51.860
in the next week or so,

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.830
because I just got a call today
from Burns Nugent, uh, asking me

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.500
to be present
at the next meeting,

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.000
which is a week from Thursday.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.900
NARRATOR:
Milton has been tested

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.460
at the University of California
at Irvine,

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.400
where scientists are searching
for the biochemical keys

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.560
to successful aging.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.460
MAN:
The biggest revolution is,
we've gone

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.230
from describing
what's going wrong

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.360
to getting deep down
into the mechanisms

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:16.100
to tell what can you do about it

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:20.630
and how can you put more quality
into the life of a neuron.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.460
NARRATOR:
Carl Cotman theorized
that exercise might help

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.760
to keep neurons healthy

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.430
by boosting production
of vital brain proteins.

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.160
To test his theory,
he compared two groups of rats.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.060
While one group sat idly
in their cages,

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.160
the other group
spent hours a day running.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.260
COTMAN:
They jump into
these running wheels

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.900
and they go like gangbusters
around

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.430
and they even do little tricks
in the running wheels.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.100
And then you say, "Well,
what happens to the brain now?"

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.830
NARRATOR:
After eight days, Cotman found
that in the running rats,

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.130
levels of a protein that helps
neurons grow, called "BDNF,"

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.800
had doubled in a part of the
brain that's critical to memory.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.630
COTMAN:
The surprising bottom line

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.000
is that exercise will induce
all kinds of wonderful molecules

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.930
that keep neurons healthier,
they keep them stronger.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.760
They're basically
molecular fertilizer,

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.960
and running actually increases
these molecules in the brain.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.630
NARRATOR:
As knowledge of
the aging brain deepens,

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.300
a new portrait is emerging

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.800
of an organ that's resilient
and resourceful,

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:33.130
whose lifetime of experience
may provide it

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.060
with a unique advantage.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.330
PARK:
Younger people seek out
more information,

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:39.960
and that's what they're good at.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.560
They're good at processing
and seeking information.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.430
Older people are good at mulling
over situations, reflecting

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.300
and using and drawing
upon their experiences,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.760
and I think that's
what wisdom is.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.060
(<i> crowd applauding, whistling</i> )

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.730
NARRATOR:
Stanley Kunitz
is America's poet laureate.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:09.300
Still writing
and reading his poems,

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:14.200
a mentor to younger poets,
he is 95 years old.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.760
KUNITZ:
"How shall the heart
be reconciled

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:22.960
"to its feast of losses?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:29.630
"In a rising wind,
the manic dust of my friends,

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:37.430
"Those who fell along the way,
bitterly stings my face.

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:43.630
"Yet I turn, I turn,
exulting somewhat

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:50.000
"With my will intact to go,
wherever I need to go,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.360
and every stone on the road
precious to me."

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.430
WOMAN:
Mr. Kunitz, that was
absolutely wonderful.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.730
There we are
and here's your lovely pen.

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.730
Thank you.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.230
Thank you.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.960
MAN:
We were really in the woods
20 years ago.

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.560
We didn't understand
the fundamental nature

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.060
of brain aging.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.060
We thought that to get senile--

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.360
to sort of lose your marbles
as you got older--

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.930
was just a normal part of life.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.400
That's really not
how brain aging works.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.200
There was such a great pulse
of affection coming back

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.200
from that audience,
it was hard to resist.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.930
And I loved hearing
about your mother.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:34.760
Stanley, if all
of my patients

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.660
were like you,
I'd be starving.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.460
I've been thinking
about you.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.630
KUNITZ:
Sometimes a name slips you.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.360
That seems to be the most...

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.530
or you don't remember
where you put something down.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:50.930
Little, occasional bits
of memory, um, vanish

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.660
from the screen.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:59.230
On the other hand, some memories
go deeper than ever before.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:05.160
They are profoundly embedded

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:09.930
in your whole psychic structure.

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:12.830
They form a constellation

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:17.600
that is at the center
of your imagination.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:25.060
"Summer is late, my heart.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:32.400
"Words plucked out of the air
some forty years ago

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.530
"When I was wild with love
and torn almost in two

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:49.200
"scatter like leaves this night
of whistling wind and rain.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:58.200
It is my heart that's late,
it is my song that's flown."

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.500
TAUB:
Some people's brains
will age slowly,

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.830
some will age more rapidly.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:13.360
A big factor is the genetic
factor-- what's built in.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.230
The other factor
is the maintenance of activity,

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.900
and if the aging person
remains active,

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.500
there's ample evidence
to indicate

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:27.030
that his intellectual
functioning

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.400
will decrease
at a much slower rate

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.500
and maybe not decrease at all.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:42.660
KUNITZ:
Poetry is an exercise of the
spirit... the spirit within one,

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:50.630
and every time you exercise it,
you increase your vitality.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.300
INTERVIEWER:
Most people
aren't poets.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.560
They may
enjoy poetry...

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.060
So what do they do
if they're not poets

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.400
to stay vital
and connected

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.500
and as alive
as you are?

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:18.160
To care about the life, to care
about others, to remain active.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:26.360
For example, you plant a seed,
you cultivate the soil,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.460
you watch it flower.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:37.400
You're participating in an
ancient ritual of life itself.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.260
"I kneeled to the crickets
trilling underfoot

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.560
"as if about to burst
from their crusty shells;

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:56.900
"and like a child again
marveled to hear so clear

00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:04.400
"and brave a music pour
from such a small machine.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:08.900
"What makes the engine go?

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:14.730
Desire, desire, desire."

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.100
NARRATOR:
As scientists learn more
about how the aging brain works,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.000
they are overturning some
of the central dogmas

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.460
of neuroscience itself.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.160
For decades, neuroscientists
believed that neurons

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.300
in a fully developed brain
never reproduce themselves

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.400
and can never be replaced.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.360
MAN:
The idea was that the brain
is a very complex structure.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.660
It's involved in learning
and memory

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.930
and storing large... large
amounts of information.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.730
And if you were adding
new neurons

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.100
into the circuit over time,

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.360
it would somehow disrupt
the function of the brain.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:10.730
NARRATOR:
But in 1998 at the Salk
Institute in California,

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.730
neuroscientist Fred Gage
and his colleagues

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.700
discovered that even
into old age,

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:20.000
the human brain continues
producing new neurons.

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.830
Like the neurons
that form a baby's brain,

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:29.500
they are created
by the division of stem cells--

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.030
the seeds from which the tissues
of the body grow.

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:35.730
Everybody was astonished

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.300
that our brain makes
new nerve cells late in life.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.800
The assumption was

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.160
that you had all the nerve
cells you were going to have

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.360
when you were younger,
and then you would lose them

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.260
and you would never be able
to replace them.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:54.130
NARRATOR:
Stem cells in an embryonic brain
are wildly prolific,

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:57.330
producing hundreds
of different kinds of neurons,

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:04.830
enabling us to see, smell,
walk, think, remember.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.860
But in an adult brain,
very few neurons are produced.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:13.200
Most stem cells
mysteriously stay inactive.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.600
As neuroscientists look
to the future,

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.330
they have begun asking if
these stem cells can be directed

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:23.260
to make neurons to replace those
killed by injury or disease.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.300
SELKOE:
And that's very exciting,

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.660
because it opens up the idea

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.030
that the brain is not
this fixed machine

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.330
for which there are
no replacement parts.

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:34.430
Look at my fingers

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.260
where they're almost
touching.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:39.400
NARRATOR:
At Harvard Medical School
in Boston,

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.130
Dr. Jeffrey Macklis works
with patients

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.160
with neurological disorders.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.060
48-year-old Sally Carlson
has Parkinson's disease...

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:50.860
Okay, look over
at the frame again.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.460
NARRATOR:
...which typically begins
in middle age

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.060
and grows steadily worse
as a person gets older.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.760
Now, can you open
your eyes again

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.900
and walk over there?

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.630
Can you do it
on the tightrope?

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.660
NARRATOR:
Deep inside her brain

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:05.230
in a region
that coordinates movements,

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.760
thousands of neurons
are slowly dying.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.230
(<i> pills rattling</i> )

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.560
Sally's body
is starting to feel stiff.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.900
Her hands sometimes tremble.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.460
CARLSON:
Folding clothes
is probably the worst thing

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.500
in that it's a constant reminder

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.630
because obviously
with three kids,

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.500
I'm folding a lot of clothes.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.100
But I can't shake things
anymore.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.000
I can't shake a pillow
into a pillowcase.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.260
I can't...

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:38.400
Just pulling up
is a very difficult thing to do.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.060
I think you're in shock

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.260
when you first find
something like this out.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.900
I was scared to death.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:50.100
And I know I'm not dying,
but part of me is dying.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:53.400
There's no doubt about that.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.960
I love you.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.560
NARRATOR:
Macklis can relieve
some of Sally's symptoms

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.860
with medications,
but not forever.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.360
MACKLIS:
Ultimately, ten or 20 years
down the road,

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.900
there are going to be
enough neurons that have died

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:12.330
that no combination of medicines
is going to be fully effective.

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:14.800
Now, how about doing
the patting on this side?

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.160
MACKLIS:
She's understood from
the very beginning that our goal

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.830
is to get her through
the childhood of her children

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.600
to their graduations
and weddings,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.760
uh, before we start losing
the efficacy of the drugs

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.130
that we currently have.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.760
Now, can you put
your fingers...

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.500
your hands out,
palms straight up

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.060
and spread your
fingers apart?

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.660
NARRATOR:
By the time Sally
reaches her 60s,

00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:43.700
she may have trouble
even walking.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.630
And then back
to where they are.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:50.300
NARRATOR:
But Macklis hopes that someday
science can develop a treatment

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.230
to restore her lost abilities

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.800
by tapping the potential
of stem cells.

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.630
Different.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:00.260
NARRATOR:
Macklis is not only a doctor,
he's a research scientist.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:02.960
Yeah, these are normal
adult sections.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.860
MACKLIS:
If there's a possibility
to replace

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.130
and interconnect new neurons

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:10.930
within circuitry
that's imperfect,

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.100
that gives a whole
different view

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.530
toward repair
of the nervous system.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.400
For an individual animal,
they ran two different...

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.200
NARRATOR:
To identify the forces

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:22.600
that trigger stem cells
to become neurons,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.100
in 1999 Macklis
and his colleagues

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.530
launched an ambitious
experiment.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.900
They targeted the most recently
evolved part of the brain--

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.560
the cerebral cortex.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.160
In tests with mice,
they injected a chemical,

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.700
killing thousands of neurons.

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.300
But within weeks,
the decimated neural circuits

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.100
received some unexpected
reinforcements--

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.330
a stream of stem cells.

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:57.530
MACKLIS:
They moved to exactly
the right location,

00:35:57.530 --> 00:36:01.030
they turned into the right kind
of neurons

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:06.060
and most strikingly, some of
them could send long connections

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.030
to the correct targets.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.630
In other words, they rebuilt
circuitry in the brain.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.100
NARRATOR:
For the first time,
scientists had shown

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:20.200
that a living brain might
be able to repair itself

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.530
with new neurons.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:30.030
But it may take decades
before scientists know

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:33.860
if neuron replacement will ever
be effective in people.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.430
MACKLIS:
Lots more work to get there,

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:39.860
lots of work in the laboratory,
in animal models.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.800
But what these experiments
clearly tell us

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.600
is that there exists
some sequence

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.130
and some combination
of molecular signals

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.830
that can induce the birth
of new nerve cells,

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:57.760
and by finding out what
these molecules are in mice,

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.000
we might be able to find out

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.560
what the proper molecules
are for humans.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.730
NARRATOR:
The same mysterious forces

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:10.660
that propel stem cells
to build the baby's brain

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.230
may one day be harnessed
to mend the aging brain.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.030
CARLSON:
I am extremely hopeful

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.360
and would want to be
the first human

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.760
following the last rat
or mice, whatever it is.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.100
We have such incredible
abilities as human beings

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.930
that I believe in miracles

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:36.330
and I have no intention
of quitting

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.230
before the miracle happens.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.960
WOMAN:
I'll wait till
you finish it.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.000
Then I'll
ask you, okay?

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.500
NARRATOR:
While Parkinson's disease
cripples the body,

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.230
the most widespread disease
of the aging brain

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.660
is one that cripples the mind.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:01.660
These men and women
in a California day center

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.230
can still express themselves
with pictures.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:08.860
But the parts of their brains
that put thoughts into words

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:10.600
are slowly dying.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.060
They have Alzheimer's disease.

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.730
Alvin Johnson was running
an insurance company

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:23.730
when he began having problems
with his memory eight years ago.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:29.030
WOMAN:
He can no longer sign his name.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:33.200
He doesn't know the date,
the day, the time.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.430
One weekend our daughter
was here

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:39.500
and he walked into the kitchen
and he said, "Who are you?"

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:47.860
MAN:
Alzheimer's disease is almost
a uniquely human disorder,

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.400
because the areas of the brain

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.660
most recently developed
through evolution

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:55.430
that are important for thinking

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:59.660
and memory and reasoning
are the most vulnerable.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.230
It's a tragic illness.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:05.330
It robs an individual,
ultimately,

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:10.630
of his own qualities
that make him human.

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:13.460
That was loose.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:15.730
You can set it down
if you want, Kate.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.030
Don't have to hold it.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:22.000
NARRATOR:
Chuck Hiatt,
a retired aircraft engineer,

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.600
was always good
at fixing things.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.660
But two years ago,
when he was 67,

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.230
his wife and daughter
began noticing a change.

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:33.430
You're sitting around
not doing anything.

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.460
NARRATOR:
He was having trouble
coordinating details

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.360
or remembering what he'd done.

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:44.300
The Hiatts want to know if
Chuck's continuing difficulties

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.930
are just a normal part of aging

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:49.030
or the early signs
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.160
Oh, my... yeah!

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.730
NARRATOR:
Unfortunately, the only
conclusive proof of Alzheimer's

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.230
comes after death,
from analysis of brain tissue.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:04.960
You know, it would be great if
we had a test that would tell us

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.900
whether somebody
has Alzheimer's disease--

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.500
take an image of the brain
or take a blood test

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.700
or even if we had a reliable
test of the spinal fluid,

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:18.000
something to tell us
absolutely certain you have it

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.660
or you don't.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.330
We don't have that test.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:25.000
So the way we make the diagnosis

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.060
is based upon information from
the examination of the patient

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.630
and information from the family

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.260
about how the person
has changed.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.560
We're here to talk
about your husband.

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.460
Tell me what you've noticed
about his memory.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.260
Well, I guess
to start with, um,

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.160
he just can't remember
short-term things.

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.130
A lot of repetition is required

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.960
in telling him
something.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.730
Does he depend more
on you for help?

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.400
He depends on me for help.

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.260
And that's a change
from before?

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.730
Yes, big change.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:02.160
Big change.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.460
I mean, he was an engineer,
he was a problem solver

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:09.830
and, um, that just
is not what it was.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.730
Wait a minute
now, hon.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:14.730
Hon...

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:15.730
Hmm?

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.700
You want to use this?

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.100
It cuts real well.

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:22.000
You hold it up
and I'm going to rip.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.330
How's that?

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.330
Nope, now we got
it stuck again.

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.900
Yeah, it has to be...
okay.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.200
MORRIS:
It might be difficult
to convince a casual observer

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.460
that he has lost memory
and thinking ability

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:44.230
without the background
from his wife.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.700
Certainly his family
is concerned about his decline.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.430
Tell me about
your memory.

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:52.130
Any problems
with memory?

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.460
Uh, definitely.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.200
I end up, uh,
forgetting things.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.630
I'll, uh, not...

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.400
Dottie will
say something to me

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.500
and half-hour later
or something,

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.560
I can't remember
what she said.

00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.860
Are these important
things or...

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.760
No, sometimes they may be

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:12.000
but most times it's not--
just conversation.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.860
She was telling
me something.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:15.400
I guess I'd
like to hear

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.660
a little bit more
about it from you

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.800
about the Rams.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.000
You're a football fan,
I understand.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.260
You enjoy the games?

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.400
Oh, yes.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.330
What's the last game
that you attended?

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.300
Uh, Rams versus 49ers.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.330
49ers.

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:33.400
They won 41 to... No, 21 to...

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.460
No, it was 41 to 20,
something like that.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.330
But I'm not sure of that.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:40.900
I think that's what it was,
or maybe 20 something.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.230
Now, who's the coach
of the Rams?

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.260
Now, that I don't know.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.000
Mmm, I'll think of it,
maybe, but right now...

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.600
MORRIS:
Well, if it
comes to you,

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:51.160
let me know
a little bit later.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.030
Sir, I want
to ask you 
some questions

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.460
just to test
different things

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.800
about memory
and so forth.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.630
Some of these
questions may
be easy,

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.500
some may
be a little
more difficult.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.500
Tell me what year
it is now.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:04.500
Hmm.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.260
I'd say 19... 96?

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.260
I don't know.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:13.260
96...

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:14.400
What month is it?

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.400
Uh.

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.060
And you can guess,
you can guess.

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.060
April.

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.060
April.

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.700
Subtract 3 from 20,

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:24.500
and then keep
subtracting 3

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.100
from each new number,
all the way down.

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:33.560
HIATT:
20, 17, 14, 11.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.230
Eight.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:47.660
6... no, 7... no, 5, 2.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.330
You did very well.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:50.860
I didn't think too well.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.330
You took
a little while
to get there,

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.030
but you got there.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:58.130
MORRIS:
Most people, when you say
"Alzheimer's disease,"

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:00.860
get a mental image
of an incapacitated patient,

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:04.660
almost, perhaps, ready
for the nursing home.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.300
But people don't,
overnight, change

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.200
from healthy,
functioning, older adult

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.230
to a nursing home patient.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.360
There's a gradual change.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.600
You know,
I don't know

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.830
how confident
you are

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.630
about
remembering
things

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:21.000
like the players
and the coach.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.230
I bet, a few
years ago,

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.630
you would have
known that

00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:25.730
without
any problem
whatsoever

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.460
and now
you can't come
up with it

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:28.630
when
you need it.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:30.330
So I think
that kind

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:32.130
of memory
disturbance

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.600
is not part
of normal aging.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.930
It is not part
of aging.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:41.260
I think it is
a memory decline
caused by disease.

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.330
And the disease
that most often
affects us

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.300
as we get older
in this day
and age,

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.300
I would say that
almost always,

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:51.500
that's
Alzheimer's
disease.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:52.860
And it should
be treated,

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.360
because now
there are drugs

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.860
that help
stabilize things

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.330
where they are.

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:00.130
Now, there aren't
any drugs

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.360
that will cure it.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.560
We don't have those,
certainly, now,

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.630
but compared
to where we were

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:07.930
even five
years ago,

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:11.630
there has been
a tremendous amount
of advance,

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:14.960
and we hope
that that pace
will continue.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.030
DOTTIE:
We sure do.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.460
I do, too.

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.830
For my sake, anyway,

00:45:18.830 --> 00:45:21.730
and other people
that's going to follow me.

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.730
Right.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.330
Because it's hell when
you can't remember things.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.900
WOMAN:
Here, I'll replicate it.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:42.000
COTMAN:
Yeah, see, and then this is
a really diffuse deposit, here.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.500
WOMAN:
Here's a good
diffuse one.

00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.330
COTMAN:
This is actually representative

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.230
of almost all three stages,
isn't it?

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.600
NARRATOR:
In labs all across the world,
neuroscientists are closing in

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.360
on the mystery
that has baffled them

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.000
for nearly a century:

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.100
What causes Alzheimer's disease?

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:01.400
Alzheimer's disease
ravages the brain,

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.130
killing billions of neurons,
leaving in its wake

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.730
dark, twisted filaments
called tangles

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:13.100
and large, sticky masses
called plaques.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.330
For decades, scientists had
no idea where they came from.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.030
SELKOE:
It took so long to figure out

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.800
the beginnings
of Alzheimer's disease

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.060
because the brain scientists--

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.730
who understood
what Alzheimer's looked like

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:27.200
under the microscope--

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.830
didn't think
that these plaques and tangles

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:33.100
were going to turn out to be
the key to the disease.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.330
They thought they were
tombstones of the process.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:41.030
NARRATOR:
But in the 1980s,
scientists took advantage

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:43.460
of new technologies
to look more closely.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:46.460
They began to suspect
that tangles and plaques

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:51.230
were more than just tombstones--
they were killers.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.900
Neurons depend
for their survival

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.760
on long chains of molecules
arrayed like railroad tracks

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.800
that transport nourishment
across the cell.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.900
What keeps the tracks stable

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.030
are short strips of protein
called tau

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:11.530
that work like railroad ties.

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.530
In Alzheimer's disease,

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:17.530
the tau mysteriously starts
to curl and tangle,

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:21.860
causing the strands of molecules
to separate and collapse.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.400
These things become twisted,

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.230
and they just don't transport
very well.

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:28.500
You know, it's like somebody
took the train track

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.960
and went... eeyah!

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.030
You know, try and get a train
to run along<i> that.</i>

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.100
It can't-- it falls off.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.060
If the material can't get

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:36.730
where it needs to be,

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.630
the cell is really going
to collapse

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.830
and eventually die.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.060
Looking at the cell

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.260
late in the course
of Alzheimer's disease,

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:52.760
you see a cell that's literally
choked with tangles of tau.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.630
Now, tangle formation
is a long, slow process.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.930
That may be a very good thing,

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:04.560
because if we could interfere
with tangle formation

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.760
early in the disease,
what we may be able to do

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.530
is prevent the progression
of the disease.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.230
NARRATOR:
Neuroscientist
Peter Davies thinks

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:18.200
he may have found
one of the triggers

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.600
that causes tangles to form--

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.930
a protein inside the neuron
called PIN 1.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:27.660
DAVIES:
It binds to tau and bends tau,

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.960
actually changes
the shape of tau.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.960
What we would like to do
is to test the idea

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.560
that if we block the effect...
action of PIN 1 on tau,

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.600
we'll actually stop
the tau becoming abnormal

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.930
and becoming tangled tau.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:55.560
NARRATOR:
Davies has begun work
developing a drug to stop PIN 1.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.760
But while he and others
take aim at tangles,

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.530
another group of scientists
is targeting plaques.

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.430
In the spaces between neurons

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.800
drift thousands
of molecules of protein.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.300
In an Alzheimer's brain,
some of them

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.130
are suspicious protein fragments
called beta amyloid.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:22.830
Sticky and resilient, bits
of beta amyloid clump together

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.300
to form an expanding mass
called a plaque,

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.530
which attaches itself
like a barnacle

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.360
to the outside of the neuron.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.230
Sensing a hostile invader,

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.830
the brain's defensive cells
fight back,

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:38.300
releasing powerful chemicals.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.760
But the counterattack backfires.

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.760
The chemicals set off
a series of reactions

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.000
that slowly destroy the neuron.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:52.500
When the brain tries to defend
itself from beta amyloid,

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.030
it seems to not get it
quite right.

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:57.160
It seems to cause
even more of a mess.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:02.300
NARRATOR:
As the damage spreads,
more and more neurons die,

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:07.030
leaving whole regions of
the brain infested with plaques.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:08.530
It doesn't
perfectly co-migrate

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.760
with any
of the other bands.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.260
So it's a little bit
tough to say.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.930
So these
are her stable
transfectants?

00:50:12.930 --> 00:50:16.100
NARRATOR:
Scientists
like Dennis Selkoe theorize

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.530
that lowering the amount
of beta amyloid in the brain

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.530
may prevent Alzheimer's disease,

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:24.300
just as lowering levels
of cholesterol

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.700
prevents heart disease.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:29.300
SELKOE:
The trouble is
that it's not so easy,

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.730
because, number one,
the theory might be wrong--

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:34.430
it's a hypothesis, not a fact--

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:37.230
and number two,
even if it's right,

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:39.060
it may be trouble
to lower amyloid.

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:41.760
It may cause side effects.

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.030
But experimental work
that's been done

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:45.960
in many laboratories worldwide

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.460
supports
this hypothesis strongly.

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.200
And the proof will come

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.830
from lowering beta amyloid
in people

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:55.060
and watching their Alzheimer's
get better.

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:02.960
NARRATOR:
In a pharmaceutical lab
near San Francisco,

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.900
neuroscientist Dale Schenk has
taken a step toward that goal

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.130
with a strategy
that surprised many scientists.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:16.630
SCHENK:
The novelty was to use
the immune system

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:19.930
to treat Alzheimer's disease--

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.160
to try to tell
the immune system, in fact,

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.830
that this plaque material
in the brain is foreign

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:28.230
and our immune system
needs to get rid of it.

00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:34.630
NARRATOR:
Schenk developed a vaccine
made from beta amyloid itself

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:37.630
and tested it
on genetically engineered mice

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:41.700
bred to develop plaques like
those in Alzheimer's disease.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.430
Well, as it turned out,
to our huge surprise,

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:49.400
when we immunized them
from a young age onward,

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.800
and then looked at an old age--

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.130
when they should have a lot
of plaque lesions--

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:54.400
they had almost none.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.700
Their brain
was almost entirely perfect.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:00.960
NARRATOR:
Encouraged by his findings,
Schenk wondered

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.930
if the vaccine
might eliminate plaques

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:05.260
that had already formed
in older mice.

00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:09.060
He vaccinated one group
of older mice

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:12.030
but left a control group
untreated.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:15.260
He found that the brains
of the mice in the control group

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.930
were ravaged by plaque,

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.230
but the brains
of the vaccinated mice

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.130
had almost no plaques at all.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.430
In the beginning,
I was skeptical.

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:28.100
And then I saw the data.

00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:31.400
And the data are very good,
and they're very persuasive.

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.500
And that's
why everybody's very excited.

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.430
NARRATOR:
But establishing the safety
and effectiveness of the vaccine

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:42.660
and other new treatments
for Alzheimer's

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:45.130
will require years of testing.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:50.060
HIATT:
I'm hoping at least I can
hang on long enough

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.860
that somebody can make
a breakthrough to figure out

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.700
how to take care of this stuff.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:58.930
Right now, I really
don't have much fear.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:01.800
I think that what concern,
though, is the future--

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.530
what's five years from now,
or ten years from now.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:08.930
HIATT:
Okay, I'm not going
to cut any more today.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.500
Enough.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:13.160
ALBERT:
I really thought that in my
lifetime, I wouldn't see

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.200
effective treatments
for Alzheimer's disease.

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:19.930
And I believe now
that in my lifetime I will.

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:23.460
DOTTIE:
Let me start here
on this end, please?

00:53:23.460 --> 00:53:24.500
HIATT:
Okay.

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:34.260
KUNITZ:
In my darkest night

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:40.530
When the moon was covered
And I roamed through wreckage

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:45.700
A nimbus-clouded voice
Directed me:

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:54.260
"Live in the layers
Not on the litter."

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.000
Though I lack the art
to decipher it,

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:05.360
no doubt the next chapter
in my book of transformations

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:07.560
Is already written.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.200
I am not done with my changes.
