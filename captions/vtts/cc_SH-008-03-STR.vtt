00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.600


2
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.600
How many thousand of my poorest subjects

3
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.370
are at this hour asleep.

4
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.230
Oh, sleep; oh, gentle sleep,

5
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.830
nature's soft nurse,

6
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.270
how have I frighted thee

7
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.100
that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down

8
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.100
and steep my senses in forgetfulness?

9
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.700
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,

10
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.370
upon uneasy pallets stretching thee

11
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.600
and hushed with buzzing night flies to thy slumber,

12
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.670
than in the perfumed chambers of the great,

13
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.070
under the canopies of costly state,

14
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.230
and lulled with sound of sweetest melody?

15
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.300
Oh, thou dull god,

16
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.200
why liest thou with the vile in loathsome beds

17
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.230
and leav'st the kingly couch

18
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.830
a watchcase or a common larum bell?

19
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.170
Wilt thou, upon the high and giddy mast,

20
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.070
seal up the shipboy's eyes

21
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.900
and rock his brains

22
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.100
in cradle of the rude, imperious surge

23
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.930
and in the visitation of the winds,

24
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.830
who take the ruffian billows by the top,

25
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.700
curling their monstrous heads

26
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.670
and hanging them with deafing clamor in the slippery clouds,

27
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.200
that, with the hurly, death itself awakes?

28
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.570
Canst thou, oh, partial sleep,

29
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.700
give thy repose to the wet seaboy in an hour so rude,

30
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.400
and in the calmest and most stillest night,

31
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.100
with all appliances and means to boot,

32
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.800
deny it to a king?

33
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.470
Then happy low, lie down.

34
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.230
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.

35
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.270
Many good morrows to Your Majesty.

36
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.100
Is it good morrow, lords?

37
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.900
'Tis 1:00, and past.

38
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.830
Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.

39
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.230
Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?

40
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.770
We have, my liege.

41
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.830
Then you perceive the body of our kingdom,

42
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.170
how foul it is;

43
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.070
what rank diseases grow,

44
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.200
and with what danger, near the heart of it.

45
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.930
It is but as a body yet distempered,

46
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.970
who to his former strength may be restored

47
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.070
with good advice and little medicine.

48
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.600
My lord Northumberland will soon be cooled.

49
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.200
Oh, God.

50
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.430
That one might read the book of fate

51
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.330
and see the revolution of the times make mountains level

52
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.830
and the continent, weary of solid firmness,

53
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.230
melt itself into the sea.

54
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.500
And, other times, to see

55
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.130
the beachy girdle of the ocean too wide for Neptune's hips.

56
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.000
How chances mock

57
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.600
and changes fill the cup of alteration with divers liquors.

58
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.270
Oh, if this were seen,

59
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.470
the happiest youth, viewing his progress through,

60
00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.730
what perils past, what crosses to ensue,

61
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.200
would shut the book, and sit him down and die.

62
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.230
'Tis not ten years gone since Richard and Northumberland,

63
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.830
great friends, did feast together,

64
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.070
and in two years after were they at wars.

65
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.430
It is but eight years

66
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.930
since this Percy was the man nearest my soul,

67
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.930
who, like a brother, toiled in my affairs

68
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.070
and laid his love and life under my foot.

69
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.300
Yea, for my sake,

70
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.600
even to the eyes of Richard gave him defiance.

71
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.130
But which of you was byó

72
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.870
you, cousin Nevil, as I may rememberó

73
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.670
when Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,

74
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.330
then checked and rated by Northumberland,

75
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.970
did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?

76
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.800
"Northumberland, thou ladder by the which

77
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.530
my cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throneó"

78
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.400
though then, God knows, I had no such intent,

79
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.000
but that necessity so bowed the state

80
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.700
that I and greatness were compelled to kiss.

81
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.330
"The time shall come," thus did he follow it,

82
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:32.800
"The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,

83
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.470
shall break into corruption," so went on,

84
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.930
foretelling this same time's condition

85
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.800
and the division of our amity.

86
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.570
There is a history in all men's lives,

87
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.200
figuring the natures of the times deceased.

88
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.170
The which observed, a man may prophesy with a near aim

89
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.130
of the main chance of things as yet not come to light,

90
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.500
which in their seeds and weak beginnings lie entreasured.

91
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.930
Such things become the hatch and brood of time.

92
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.270
And by the necessary form of this,

93
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.330
King Richard might create a perfect guess

94
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
that great Northumberland, then false to him,

95
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.730
would of that seed grow to a greater falseness,

96
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.800
which should not find a ground to root upon, unless on you.

97
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.300
Are these things, then, necessities?

98
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.330
Then let us meet them like necessities.

99
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.830
And that same word even now cries out on us.

100
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.230
They say the bishop and Northumberland

101
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.370
are 50,000 strong.

102
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.300
It cannot be, my lord.

103
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.330
Rumor doth double, like the voice and echo,

104
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.870
the numbers of the feared.

105
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.670
Please it, Your Grace, to go to bed.

106
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:43.730
Upon my soul, my lord,

107
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.230
the powers you already have sent forth

108
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.500
will bring this prize in very easily.

109
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.930
To comfort you the more,

110
00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.330
I have received a certain instance that Glendower is dead.

111
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.500
Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill,

112
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.370
and these unseasoned hours must add perforce

113
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.000
unto your sickness.

114
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.900
I will take your counsel.

115
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.000
And were these inward wars once out of hand,

116
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.800
we would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.

117
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.630
Come on; come on; come on, sir.

118
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.530
Give me your hand, sir.

119
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.230
Give me your hand, sir.

120
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.230
An early stirrer, by the rood.

121
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.470
And how doth my good cousin Silence?

122
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.300
Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.

123
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.470
And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow,

124
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:51.770
and your fairest daughter and mine, my goddaughter Ellen?

125
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.870
Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow.

126
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.030
By yea and nay.

127
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.000
I daresay my cousin William is become a good scholar.

128
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.870
He is at Oxford still, is he not?

129
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.800
Indeed, sir, to my cost.

130
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.470
A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly.

131
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:11.430
I was once of Clement's Inn,

132
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.870
where I think they will talk of mad Shallow yet.

133
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:18.100
You were called "lusty Shallow" then, Cousin.

134
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.770
By the mass, I was called anything.

135
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.670
And I would have done anything indeed, too, and roundly too.

136
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.300
There was I and little John Doit of Staffordshire

137
00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.030
and black George Barnes and Francis Pickbone

138
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.600
and Will Squele, a Cotswold man.

139
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.930
You had not four such swinge bucklers

140
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.930
in all the inns o' court again.

141
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.530
And I may say to you,

142
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.970
we knew where the bona-robas were

143
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:51.000
and had the best of them all at commandment.

144
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.170
Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John,

145
00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.100
a boy and page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.

146
00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.730
This Sir John, Cousin,

147
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.270
that comes hither anon about soldiers?

148
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.270
The same Sir John; the very same.

149
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:09.300
I see him break Skogan's head at the court gate

150
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.100
when a' was a crack not thus high.

151
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.400
And the very same day

152
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.400
did I fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,

153
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.900
behind Gray's Inn.

154
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.170
Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I have spent.

155
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:28.170
And to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead.

156
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.730
We shall all follow, Cousin.

157
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.400
Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure.

158
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.630
Death, as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all.

159
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.400
All shall die.

160
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.300
How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?

161
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.870
By my troth, I was not there.

162
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.370
Death is certain.

163
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:50.900
Is old Double of your town living yet?

164
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.930
Dead, sir.

165
00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.630
Jesu, Jesu, dead.

166
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.200
A' drew a good bow, and dead.

167
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200
Dead.

168
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.900
A' shot a fine shoot.

169
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.500
John a Gaunt loved him well and betted much money on his head.

170
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.700
Dead.

171
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.100
A' would clap you in the clout at 12 score

172
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.870
and carried you a forehand shaft a 14, a 14 1/2,

173
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.170
that it would have done a man's heart good to see.

174
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.370
How a score of ewes now?

175
00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.500
Thereafter as they be.

176
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.570
A score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds.

177
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.630
And is old Double dead?

178
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.630
Here comes one of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.

179
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.830
Good morrow, honest gentlemen.

180
00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.170
I beseech you, which is Master Justice Shallow?

181
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:49.530
I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this county,

182
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.600
and one of the king's justices of the peace.

183
00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.500
What is your good pleasure with me?

184
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.500
My captain, sir, commends him to you.

185
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.570
My captain, Sir John Falstaff,

186
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:07.030
a tall gentleman, by heaven, and a most gallant soldier.

187
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.100
He greets me well.

188
00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.070
I knew him a good backsword man.

189
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:11.570
How doth the good knight?

190
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.370
And may I ask how my lady his wife doth?

191
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:20.270
Sir, pardon.

192
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.970
A soldier is better accommodated than with a wife.

193
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:29.730
That is very good, i' faith; and it is very good indeed too.

194
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:32.000
Better accommodated.

195
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.670
It is good; yea, indeed, is it.

196
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:40.470
Good phrases surely are, and ever were, very commendable.

197
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.870
Accommodated.

198
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.300
It comes from "accommodo."

199
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.200
Very good; a good phrase.

200
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.070
Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word.

201
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:50.870
Phrase call you it?

202
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:53.230
By this good day, I know not the phrase,

203
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.570
but I will maintain the word

204
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.970
with my sword to be a soldierlike word,

205
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.200
by heaven, and a word of exceeding good command.

206
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.770
By heaven.

207
00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.800
Here comes good Sir John.

208
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.070
Give me your hand, sir.

209
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.130
Give me Your Worship's good hand.

210
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:18.030
By my troth, you like well, and you bear your years very well.

211
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.930
Welcome, good Sir John.

212
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.370
I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert Shallow.

213
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:26.800
Master Surecard, as I think?

214
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.870
No.

215
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.000
No, Sir John, it is my cousin Silence

216
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.670
in commission with me.

217
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.670
Good Master Silence,

218
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.330
it well befits you should be of the peace.

219
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.600
Your good Worship is welcome.

220
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.200
Why, fie, gentlemen.

221
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.030
This is hot weather.

222
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.230
Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?

223
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.470
Marry, have we, sir.

224
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.470
Will you sit?

225
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.730
Well, I beseech you, let me see them.

226
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:52.930
Where's the roll?

227
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.930
Where's the roll?

228
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:54.930
Where's the roll?

229
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.770
Let me see; let me see; let me see.

230
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.330
So, so, so, so.

231
00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.600
Yea, marry, sir.

232
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.600
Ralph Mouldy.

233
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.730
Let them appear as I call.

234
00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:06.700
Let them do so; let them do so.

235
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.600
Ralph Mouldy.

236
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.270
Where is Mouldy?

237
00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.470
Here, an't please you.

238
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.130
What think you, Sir John?

239
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:15.270
A good-limbed fellow:

240
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.900
young, strong, and of good friends.

241
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.070
Is thy name Mouldy?

242
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:23.000
Yea, an't please you.

243
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.130
'Tis the more time thou wert used.

244
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.330
Most excellent, i' faith.

245
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.630
Things that are moldy lack use.

246
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.500
Very singular good, Sir John.

247
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.800
Well said, i' faith, Sir John.

248
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.270
Very well said.

249
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.370
Prick him.

250
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.700
I was pricked well enough before,

251
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:43.230
an you could have let me alone.

252
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.830
My old dame will be undone now

253
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.970
for one to do her husbandry and her drudgery.

254
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.630
You need not to have pricked me.

255
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.470
There are other men fitter to go out than I.

256
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.470
Go to; go to.

257
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:52.530
Peace, Mouldy; you shall go.

258
00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:53.970
Mouldy, it is time you were spent.

259
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.130
Spent.

260
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.200
Peace, fellow, peace.

261
00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.200
Stand aside.

262
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.700
Know you where you are?

263
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.730
Yes, well, for the other, let me seeó

264
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.330
Simon Shadow.

265
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.930
Let me have him to sit under.

266
00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.830
He's like to be a cold soldier.

267
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:12.230
Where's Shadow?

268
00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.970
Here, sir.

269
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.670
Whose son art thou, Shadow?

270
00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.630
Myómy mother's son, sir.

271
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.800
Thy mother's son.

272
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:30.200
Like enough, and thy father's shadow.

273
00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.930
Do you like him, Sir John?

274
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.130
Shadow will serve for summer.

275
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.330
Prick him.

276
00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.100
Thomas Wart.

277
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.100
Wart?

278
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.300
Where's he?

279
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.470
Here, sir.

280
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.900
Is thy name Wart?

281
00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.430
Yea, sir.

282
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.370
Thou art a very ragged wart.

283
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.570
Shall I prick him, Sir John?

284
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.200
It were superfluous,

285
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.100
for his apparel is built upon his back,

286
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.130
and the whole frame stands upon pins.

287
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.170
Prick him no more.

288
00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:00.770
You can do it, Sir John; you can do it.

289
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.670
I commend you well.

290
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:05.270
Francis Feeble.

291
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.570
Here, sir.

292
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.400
What trade art thou, Feeble?

293
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.770
A woman's tailor, sir.

294
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:10.770
Oh.

295
00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.970
Shall I prick him, Sir John?

296
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.730
Well, you may, but if he'd been a man's tailor,

297
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.800
he'd ha' pricked you.

298
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.530
Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle

299
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.700
as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?

300
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.930
I will do my good will, sir.

301
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.430
You can have no more.

302
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.600
Well said, good woman's tailor.

303
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.800
Well said, courageous Feeble.

304
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.070
Thou wilt be as valiant

305
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:40.200
as the wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse.

306
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.770
Prick the woman's tailor.

307
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.130
Well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.

308
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.970
Who's next?

309
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.700
Peter Bullcalf of the green.

310
00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.000
Yea, marry, let me see Bullcalf.

311
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.200
Here, sir.

312
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.570
'Fore God, there's a likely fellow.

313
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.400
Here, prick me Bullcalf till he roar again.

314
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.430
Oh, Lord.

315
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.570
Good my lord captainó

316
00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.400
Dost thou roar before thou art pricked?

317
00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.730
Oh, Lord, sir.

318
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.470
I am a diseased man.

319
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:03.900
Oh, now what disease hast thou?

320
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.500
A whoreson cold, sir.

321
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.130
Oh.

322
00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.930
Oh.

323
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.000
A cough, sir, which I got with ringing in the king's affairs

324
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.230
upon his coronation day.

325
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:15.370
Come, come.

326
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:17.900
Thou shalt go to the wars in a gown.

327
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:19.930
We'll have away thy cold.

328
00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:21.500
And I will take such order

329
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.370
that thy friends shall ring for thee.

330
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.170
Is here all?

331
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.570
Here is two more called than your number, Sir John.

332
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.470
You must have but four here, sir.

333
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.730
And so, I pray you, go in with me to dinner.

334
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.800
Come, I'll go drink with you, but I cannot tarry dinner.

335
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.300
By my troth, I'm glad to see you, good Master Robert Shallow.

336
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:51.970
Oh, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night

337
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:54.700
in the windmill in Saint George's field?

338
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.500
No more of that, Master Shallow.

339
00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.570
No more of that.

340
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.230
'Twas a merry night.

341
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:07.070
And is Jane Nightwork alive?

342
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.630
She lives, Master Shallow.

343
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:11.170
She never could away with me.

344
00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:12.600
Never, no, no.

345
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.700
She would always say she could not abide Master Shallow.

346
00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.670
By the mass, I would anger her to the heart.

347
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.900
She was then a bona-roba.

348
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.630
Doth she hold her own well?

349
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:29.030
Old, old, Master Shallow.

350
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.330
Nay, she must be old.

351
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.870
She cannot choose but be old.

352
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:34.030
Certain she's old

353
00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.770
and had Robin Nightwork by Old Nightwork

354
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:38.500
before I came to Clement's Inn.

355
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.700
That's 55 years ago.

356
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.630
Cousin Silence, that you had seen that

357
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.930
that this knight and I have seen.

358
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.330
Said I well, Sir John?

359
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.530
We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.

360
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.670
That we have.

361
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.000
That we have; that we have.

362
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.330
I' faith, Sir John, we have.

363
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:05.900
Our watchword was "Hem boys."

364
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.270
Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner.

365
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.130
Oh, Jesus, the days that we have spent.

366
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.200
Hem boys.

367
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:39.500
Good Master Corporal Bardolph, stand my friend.

368
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.400
Here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns for you.

369
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.970
In very truth, sir, I had as lief be hanged, sir, as go.

370
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.730
And yet, for mine own part, sir, I do not care.

371
00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.270
But rather, because I am unwilling,

372
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:53.200
and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with my friends.

373
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.330
Else I do not care, for mine own part, so much, sir.

374
00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:59.100
Go to; stand aside.

375
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.200
And, good Master Corporal Captain,

376
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.030
for my old dame's sake, stand my friend.

377
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:08.370
She has nobody to do anything about her when I am gone;

378
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.070
and she is old and cannot help herself.

379
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.430
You shall have 40, sir.

380
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:18.300
Go to.

381
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.570
Stand aside.

382
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.900
By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once.

383
00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.700
We owe God a death.

384
00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.070
I'll ne'er bear a base mind.

385
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.330
An't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so.

386
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.900
No man's too good to serve's prince.

387
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.900
And let it come when it will.

388
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.430
If a man die this year, he is quit of it the next.

389
00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.900
Well said.

390
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:45.300
Thou art a good fellow.

391
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.500
Faith, I'll bear no base mind.

392
00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.400
Which men shall I have?

393
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.970
Four of which you please.

394
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.200
Sir, a word with you.

395
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.770
I have three pounds to free Mouldy and Bullcalf.

396
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:00.830
Go to.

397
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.000
Well.

398
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Come, Sir John, which four will you have?

399
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Do you choose for me.

400
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.900
Marry, then, Bullcalfó

401
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:13.070
Bullcalf, Mouldy, Shadow, and Feeble.

402
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.070
Mouldy and Bullcalf.

403
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.470
For you, Mouldy, stay at home till you are past service.

404
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.030
And for your part, Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it.

405
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.300
I'll none of you.

406
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.870
Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong.

407
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.400
They are your likeliest men.

408
00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.070
I would have you served with the best.

409
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:33.030
Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a man?

410
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:36.400
Care I for the limb, the thews, the stature, bulk,

411
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.600
and big assemblance of a man?

412
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.670
Give me the spirit, Master Shallow.

413
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.270
Here, take Wart.

414
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.100
You see what a ragged appearance it has.

415
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.630
A' shall charge you,

416
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.000
discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's hammer.

417
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.100
And this same half-faced fellow, Shadow.

418
00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.970
Give me this man, for he presents no mark to the enemy.

419
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.570
The foeman may with as great aim level at the edge of a penknife.

420
00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.270
And for a retreat,

421
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:06.200
how swiftly will this Feeble, the woman's tailor, run off.

422
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.230
Oh, give me the spare men, and spare me the great ones.

423
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.030
Bardolph, put me a caliver into Wart's hand.

424
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:20.570
Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.

425
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.230
Come, manage me your caliver.

426
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.530
So.

427
00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.530
Very well.

428
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.370
Go to.

429
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:28.400
Very good.

430
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.370
Exceeding good.

431
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.670
Oh, give me always a little, lean, old, chapped, bald shot.

432
00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.700
Well said, Wart.

433
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.430
Thou art a good scab.

434
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:44.270
Hold, there's a tester for thee.

435
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.830
He is not his craft's master.

436
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.470
He doth not do it right.

437
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.630
I remember in Mile End Green, when I lay at Clement's Innó

438
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.030
I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's showó

439
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.500
we had a little quiver fellow

440
00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.130
who would manage you his piece thus.

441
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:04.270
And about and about, and come you in and come you in.

442
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.830
And "rah-tah-tah," would a' say, and "bounce" would a' say,

443
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:11.070
and away again would a' go, and again would a' come.

444
00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:21.100
These fellows will do well, Master Shallow.

445
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.500
One, twoócome onó three, four.

446
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.700
God keep you, Master Silence.

447
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.130
I will not use many words with you.

448
00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.130
Gentlemen both, farewell.

449
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.130
I thank you.

450
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.570
I must a dozen miles tonight.

451
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.370
Bardolph, lead the men away.

452
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.070
Hey, hup.

453
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:40.570
Hey, hup.

454
00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:46.700
Hup, aye, hup, aye, hup, aye, hup, aye, hup, aye, hup, aye.

455
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.830
The Lord bless you, Sir John.

456
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.030
God prosper your affairs.

457
00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.500
God send us peace.

458
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.930
Oh, God send us peace.

459
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.830
Now return visit our house.

460
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:59.000
Let our old acquaintance be renewed.

461
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.530
Peradventure I will with you to the court.

462
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.430
'Fore God, I would you would.

463
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:05.570
Go to.

464
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:06.930
I have spoke at a word.

465
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.670
As it isó

466
00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.030
God keep you, Sir John.

467
00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.070
God keep you.

468
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:12.070
May God keep you.

469
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:13.070
Farewell.

470
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.300
Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.

471
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.670
As I return,

472
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:32.300
I will fetch off these justices.

473
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:39.300
I do see the bottom of Justice Shallow.

474
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:46.430
Lord, Lord, how subject we old men are to this vice of lying.

475
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:52.170
This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me

476
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.730
of the wildness of his youth

477
00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.500
and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Streetó

478
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:02.530
and every third word a lie.

479
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.700
I do remember him at Clement's Inn

480
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.630
like a man made after supper of a cheeseparing.

481
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.730
When a' was naked, he was, for all the world,

482
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.470
like a forked radish

483
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:19.370
with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife.

484
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.330
A' was the very genius of famine,

485
00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.930
yet lecherous as a monkey.

486
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:27.870
And the whores called him mandrake.

487
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:33.270
And now is this vice's dagger become a squire

488
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.400
and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt

489
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.000
as if he'd been sworn brother to him,

490
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.070
and I'll be sworn he never saw him but once in the tiltyard,

491
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:42.200
and then he broke his head

492
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.000
for crowding among the marshal's men.

493
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.500
And now has he land and beefs.

494
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:55.300
Well, I'll be acquainted with him, if I return.

495
00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:00.570
If the young dace be a bait for the old pike,

496
00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:06.230
I see no reason in the laws of nature but I may snap at him.

497
00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:12.100
Let time shape, and there an end.

498
00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.770
My friends and brethren in these great affairs...

499
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:31.070
I must acquaint you that I have received

500
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.870
new dated letters from Northumberland,

501
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.870
their cold intent, tenor, and substance thus:

502
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.770
here doth he wish his person,

503
00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.500
with such powers as might hold sortance with his quality,

504
00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.100
the which he could not levy,

505
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.970
whereupon he is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,

506
00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.400
to Scotland,

507
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.870
and concludes in hearty prayers

508
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:53.400
that your attempts may overlive

509
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.870
the hazard and fearful meeting of their opposite.

510
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.570
Thus do the hopes we have in him

511
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.770
touch ground and dash themselves to pieces.

512
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.200
Now, what news?

513
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.670
West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,

514
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.970
in goodly form come on the enemy.

515
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:07.670
And by the ground they hide,

516
00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:11.300
I judge their number in or near the rate of 30,000.

517
00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.600
The just proportion that we gave them out.

518
00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.630
Let us sway on and face them in the field.

519
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.400
Health and fair greeting from our general,

520
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.630
the prince, Lord John, and duke of Lancaster.

521
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.900
Say on, my lord of Westmoreland, in peace.

522
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.370
What doth concern your coming?

523
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.900
Then, my lord,

524
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:41.930
unto Your Grace do I in chief address

525
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:44.630
the substance of my speech.

526
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.900
You, lord archbishop,

527
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.700
wherefore do you so ill translate yourself

528
00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.430
out of the speech of peace which bears such grace

529
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:59.130
into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war,

530
00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:03.700
turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,

531
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.200
your pens to lances, and your tongue divine

532
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.830
to a loud trumpet and a point of war?

533
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.530
Wherefore do I this?

534
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.000
So the question stands.

535
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:19.200
Briefly, to this end.

536
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:23.830
We are all diseased,

537
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:25.830
and with our surfeiting and wanton hours

538
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.570
have brought ourselves into a burning fever,

539
00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:31.800
and we must bleed for itó

540
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:39.630
of which disease our late king, Richard, being infected, died.

541
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.270
I have in equal balance justly weighed

542
00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:52.600
what wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,

543
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:56.200
and find our griefs heavier than our offences.

544
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.670
We see which way the stream of time doth run

545
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.470
and are enforced from our most quiet there

546
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.000
by the rough torrent of occasion

547
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.600
and have the summary of all our griefs,

548
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.470
when time shall serve, to show in articles,

549
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:11.400
which long ere this we offered to the king

550
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.630
and might by no suit gain our audience.

551
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.730
When we are wronged and would unfold our griefs,

552
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.700
we are denied access unto his person

553
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.630
even by those men that most have done us wrong.

554
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.670
When ever yet was your appeal denied?

555
00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:30.500
Wherein have you been galled by the king?

556
00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.600
What peer hath been suborned to grate on you

557
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.870
that you should seal this lawless bloody book

558
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.270
of forged rebellion with a seal divine

559
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.900
and consecrate commotion's bitter edge?

560
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.770
My brother general, the commonwealth

561
00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.030
I make my quarrel in particular.

562
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.870
There is no need of any such redressó

563
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.270
or if there were, it not belongs to you.

564
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.970
Why not to him in part,

565
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:56.600
and to us all that feel the bruises of the days before,

566
00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.600
and suffer the conditions of these times

567
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.800
to lay a heavy and unequal hand upon our honors?

568
00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.770
Oh, my good Lord Mowbray,

569
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.100
construe the times to their necessities

570
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.070
and you shall see indeed,

571
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.870
it is the time and not the king that doth your injuries.

572
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.770
But this is mere digression from my purpose.

573
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:26.370
Here come I from our princely general to know your griefs,

574
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:31.030
to tell you from His Grace that he will give you audience,

575
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:36.930
and wherein it shall appear that your demands are just,

576
00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.230
you shall enjoy them...

577
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.430
everything set off that might so much as think you enemies.

578
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.630
Then take, my lord of Westmoreland,

579
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.070
this schedule,

580
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.770
for this contains our general grievances.

581
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.230
This will I show the general.

582
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:08.430
Let it please you, lords,

583
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:11.370
in sight of both our battles we may meet,

584
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.100
and either end in peace, which God so frame,

585
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.600
or to the place of difference,

586
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.730
call the swords, which must decide it.

587
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.070
My lord, we will do so.

588
00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:28.000
There is a thing within my bosom tells me

589
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.530
that no conditions of our peace can stand.

590
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.400
Fear you not that.

591
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.330
If we can make our peace upon such large terms and so absolute

592
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.730
as our conditions shall consist upon,

593
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.970
our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.

594
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.400
Yea, but our valuation shall be such

595
00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.700
that every slight and false derived cause,

596
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.270
yea, every idle, nice, and wanton reason

597
00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.870
shall to the king taste of this action;

598
00:31:56.870 --> 00:32:00.930
that, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,

599
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:03.400
we shall be winnowed with so rough a wind

600
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.470
that even our corn will seem as light as chaff

601
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:08.600
and good from bad find no partition.

602
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.770
No, no, my lord.

603
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.170
Note this.

604
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.870
The king is weary of dainty and such picking grievances,

605
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.230
for he hath found to end one doubt by death

606
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.230
revives two greater in the heirs of life.

607
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.130
Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods

608
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:23.630
on late offenders,

609
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.700
that he now doth lack the very instruments of chastisement,

610
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.630
so that his power, like to a fangless lion,

611
00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:32.130
may offer, but not hold.

612
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.630
'Tis very true.

613
00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:35.630
And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,

614
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.230
if we do now make our atonement well,

615
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.000
our peace will, like a broken limb united,

616
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.170
grow stronger for the breaking.

617
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.400
Be it so.

618
00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.470
Here returns my lord of Westmoreland.

619
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.500
The prince is here at hand.

620
00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.670
Pleaseth your lordship to meet His Grace

621
00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.170
just distance twixt our armies.

622
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:26.170
You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray.

623
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:29.370
Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop,

624
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:32.500
And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.

625
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.400
My lord of York, it better showed with you

626
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.100
when that your flock, assembled by the bell,

627
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.730
encircled you to hear with the reverence

628
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.500
your exposition on the holy text

629
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.670
than now to see you here an iron man,

630
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.800
cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,

631
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.870
turning the word to sword and life to death.

632
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.070
Oh, who shall believe

633
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:59.570
but you misuse the reverence of your place,

634
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.570
employ the countenance and grace of heaven

635
00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:04.870
as a false favorite doth his prince's name,

636
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.270
in deeds dishonorable?

637
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:10.030
You have ta'en up, under the counterfeited zeal of God,

638
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.870
the subjects of his substitute, my father,

639
00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.130
and both against the peace of heaven and him

640
00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.900
have here upswarmed them.

641
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.470
Good my lord of Lancaster,

642
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:20.730
I am not here against your father's peace,

643
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.070
but, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,

644
00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:26.830
the time misordered doth, in common sense,

645
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:29.230
crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,

646
00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.970
to hold our safety up.

647
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:34.930
I sent Your Grace the parcels and particulars of our grief,

648
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:37.830
the which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,

649
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.530
whereon this Hydra son of war is born,

650
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:47.030
whose dangerous eyes may well be charmed asleep

651
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:51.970
with grant of our most just and right desires.

652
00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.200
Pleaseth Your Grace to answer them directly

653
00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.530
how far forth you do like their articles.

654
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:06.800
I like them all and do allow them well

655
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.800
and swear here, by the honor of my blood,

656
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.130
my father's purposes have been mistook,

657
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:13.970
and some about him have too lavishly

658
00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.570
wrested his meaning and authority.

659
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:19.470
My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redressed.

660
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.900
Upon my soul, they shall.

661
00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:23.230
If this may please you,

662
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.830
discharge your powers unto their several countiesó

663
00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:26.830
My lordó

664
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:27.830
As we will ours.

665
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.570
And here between the armies

666
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.930
let's drink together friendly and embrace,

667
00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.930
that all their eyes may bear those tokens home

668
00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:38.830
of our restored love and amity.

669
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:45.830
I take your princely word for these redresses.

670
00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.370
I give it you and will maintain my word.

671
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.770
And thereupon I drink unto Your Grace.

672
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.070
Go, Captain, and deliver to the army this news of peace.

673
00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.430
Let them have pay, and part.

674
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.800
I know it will well please them.

675
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.070
Hie thee, Captain.

676
00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.430
To you, my noble lord of Westmoreland.

677
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.400
I pledge Your Grace.

678
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.970
And, if you knew what pains I had bestowed

679
00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:18.530
to breed this present peace,

680
00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.330
you would drink freely.

681
00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.630
But my love to you shall show itself more openly hereafter.

682
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.770
I do not doubt you.

683
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:26.400
I am glad of it.

684
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.100
Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.

685
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.400
You wish me health in very happy season,

686
00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.300
for I am, on the sudden, something ill.

687
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.000
Against ill chances men are ever merry,

688
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.170
but heaviness foreruns the good event.

689
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.330
Therefore be merry, coz,

690
00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:43.400
since sudden sorrow serves to say thus,

691
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.030
"Some good thing comes tomorrow."

692
00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.300
Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.

693
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.000
The more, the worse, if your own rule be true.

694
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.270
The word of peace is rendered.

695
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.330
Hark, how they shout.

696
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:59.100
This had been cheerful after victory.

697
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.630
A peace is in the nature of a conquest,

698
00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:04.400
for then both parties nobly are subdued,

699
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.370
and neither party loser.

700
00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:10.000
Go, my lord, and let our army be discharged too.

701
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.100
And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains march by us,

702
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.670
that we may peruse the men we should have coped withal.

703
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.930
Go, good Lord Hastings,

704
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.230
and, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.

705
00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:30.130
I trust, lords, we shall lie tonight together.

706
00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:34.830
Now, Cousin, wherefore stands our army still?

707
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:39.430
The leaders, having charge from you to stand,

708
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:42.200
will not go off until they hear you speak.

709
00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.970
They know their duties.

710
00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:49.270
My lord, our army is dispersed already.

711
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:50.770
Like youthful steers unyoked,

712
00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:53.100
they take their courses east, west, north, south;

713
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.730
or, like a school broke up,

714
00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:57.170
each hurries towards his home and sporting place.

715
00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.300
Good tidings, my Lord Hastings,

716
00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.270
for the which I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason.

717
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:06.430
And you, Lord Archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,

718
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.230
of capitol treason I attach you both.

719
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:09.800
Is this proceeding just and honorable?

720
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.600
Is your assembly so?

721
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.670
Will you thus break your faith?

722
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.600
I pawned thee none.

723
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.830
I promised you redress

724
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.470
of these same grievances whereof you did complain,

725
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:21.700
which, by mine honor,

726
00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:26.130
I will perform with a most Christian care.

727
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:28.800
But for you, rebels, look to taste

728
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.770
the due meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.

729
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.830
Most shallowly did you these arms commence,

730
00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.830
fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.

731
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.830
Strike up our drums.

732
00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:40.330
Pursue the scattered stray.

733
00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:45.830
God, and not we, hath safely fought today.

734
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.100
What is your name, sir?

735
00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.430
Of what condition are you and of what place?

736
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.130
I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.

737
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:31.670
Well, then, Colevile is your name

738
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:34.830
and knight is your degree and your place the dale.

739
00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.570
Colevile shall still be your name,

740
00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:38.170
a traitor your degree,

741
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.300
and the dungeon your place, a place deep enough.

742
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.370
So should you be still Colevile of the dale.

743
00:39:44.370 --> 00:39:47.430
Are not you Sir John Falstaff?

744
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.000
As good a man as he, sir, whoever I am.

745
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.630
Do ye yield, sir, or shall I sweat for you?

746
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.230
I think you are Sir John Falstaff,

747
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.300
and in that thought yield me.

748
00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:00.400
Here comes our general.

749
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.530
Come, hie thee, sir.

750
00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.570
The heat is past; follow no further now.

751
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.270
Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.

752
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.430
Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?

753
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.670
When everything is ended, then you come.

754
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.630
These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,

755
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:18.770
one time or other break some gallows' back.

756
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:22.200
I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus.

757
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.670
I never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward of valor.

758
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:29.970
Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a bullet?

759
00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:31.530
Have I, in my old and poor motion,

760
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.570
the expedition of thought?

761
00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.030
I have speeded hither

762
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.600
with the very extremest inch of possibility.

763
00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.630
And here, travel tainted as I am,

764
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.230
have in my pure and immaculate valor,

765
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.970
taken Sir John Colevile of the dale,

766
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.370
a most furious knight and valorous enemy.

767
00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:51.730
But what of that?

768
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.500
He saw me and yielded,

769
00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.500
that I may justly say,

770
00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.870
with the hooknosed fellow of Rome,

771
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:00.770
"I came, saw, and overcame."

772
00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:03.430
It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.

773
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:05.200
I know not.

774
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.170
Here he is, and here I yield him.

775
00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:09.770
And I beseech Your Grace,

776
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.000
let it be booked with the rest of this day's deeds,

777
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.970
or, by the Lord, I'll have it in a particular ballad else,

778
00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:17.870
with mine own picture on the top on't,

779
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:19.700
Colevile kissing my foot.

780
00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:22.500
Therefore let me have right, and let desert mount.

781
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.770
Thine's too heavy to mount.

782
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.970
Well, let it shine, then.

783
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.430
Thine's too thick to shine.

784
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.570
Well, let it do something, my good lord,

785
00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:33.100
that will do me good, and call it what you will.

786
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.500
Is thy name Colevile?

787
00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.200
It is, my lord.

788
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.200
A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.

789
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.670
And a famous true subject took him.

790
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.930
I am, my lord, but as my betters are that led me hither.

791
00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.870
Had they been ruled by me,

792
00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:50.900
you should have won them dearer than you have.

793
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.670
How they sold themselves, I know not,

794
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.730
but thou, like a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis.

795
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.670
And I thank thee for thee.

796
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.970
Send Colevile with his confederates to York,

797
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.500
to present execution.

798
00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.630
And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords.

799
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.630
I hear the king my father is sore sick.

800
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:14.700
Our news shall go before us to His Majesty,

801
00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.770
which, Cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,

802
00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.470
and we with sober speed will follow you.

803
00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.130
My lord, I beseech you,

804
00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.530
give me leave to go through Gloucestershire.

805
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.230
And when you come to court,

806
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.200
stand, my good lord, in your good report.

807
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.500
Fare you well, Falstaff.

808
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.930
I, in my condition, shall better speak of you than you deserve.

809
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.370
I would you had but the wit.

810
00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.130
'Twere better than your dukedom.

811
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.230
Good faith,

812
00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:54.470
this same young, sober-blooded boy doth not love me,

813
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:57.000
nor a man cannot make him laugh.

814
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.230
That's no marvel.

815
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:00.700
He drinks no wine.

816
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:07.730
There's never none of these demure boys comes to any proof,

817
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:14.100
for thin drink doth so overcool their blood

818
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.270
and making many fish meals

819
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:22.730
that they fall into a kind of male greensickness.

820
00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.500
And then when they marry, they get wenches.

821
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.200
They are generally fools and cowards,

822
00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.200
which some of us would be, too, but for inflammation.

823
00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:41.970
A good sherris sack hath a twofold operation.

824
00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:47.070
It ascends me into the brain;

825
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.730
dries me there all the foolish

826
00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:52.000
and dull and curdy vapors which environ it;

827
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.970
makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive,

828
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:58.670
full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes;

829
00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.600
which, delivered o'er to the voice,

830
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.900
the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit.

831
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.430
The second property of your excellent sherris

832
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:17.070
is the warming of the blood, which, before cold and settled,

833
00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:20.700
left the liver white and pale,

834
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.830
which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice.

835
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.200
But the sherris warms it,

836
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:31.100
makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme.

837
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:35.600
It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning

838
00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.230
to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm.

839
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:45.770
And then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits

840
00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:48.470
muster me all to their captain, the heart,

841
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.130
who, great and puffed up with this retinue,

842
00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:53.370
doth any deed of courage.

843
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.470
And this valor comes of sherris.

844
00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:02.800
So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack,

845
00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.700
for that sets it awork,

846
00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:11.170
and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil,

847
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:15.400
till sack commences it and sets it in act and use.

848
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:24.100
Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant,

849
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.530
for the thin blood

850
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:29.870
which he did naturally inherit from his father,

851
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:36.130
he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land,

852
00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:42.330
manured and husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavor

853
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:46.430
of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris,

854
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.770
that he is become very hot and valiant.

855
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.300
If I had a thousand sons,

856
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:55.770
the first humane principle I would teach them should be

857
00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:01.770
to forswear thin potations and addict themselves to sack.

858
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.630
Captain!

859
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.730
Captain!

860
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:07.870
Captain!

861
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.870
The army is discharged all and gone.

862
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.800
Let them go.

863
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.430
I'll through Gloucestershire,

864
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:31.270
and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire.

865
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:36.300
I have him already tempering between my finger and my thumb,

866
00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.770
and shortly will I seal with him.

867
00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:40.830
Come, away.

868
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.900
