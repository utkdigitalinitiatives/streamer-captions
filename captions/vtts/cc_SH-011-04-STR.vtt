00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.500


3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.700
You must translate: 'tis fit weunderstand them.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.770
Where is your son?

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.900
Bestow this place on us a littlewhile.

6
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.600
O, my own lord, what have I seento-night!

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.800
What, Gertrude?

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.630
How does Hamlet?

9
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.770
Mad as the sea and wind,

10
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.900
when both contend Which is themightier:

11
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.870
in his lawless fit,

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.000
Behind the arras hearingsomething stir,

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.700
Whips out his rapier, cries, "Arat, a rat!"

14
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.670
And, in this brainishapprehension,

15
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.200
kills The unseen good old man.

16
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.030
O heavy deed!

17
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.500
It had been so with us, had webeen there:

18
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.170
His liberty is full of threatsto all;

19
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.230
To you yourself, to us, to everyone.

20
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.130
Alas, how shall this bloody deedbe answer'd?

21
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.530
It will be laid to us,

22
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.400
whose providence Should havekept short,

23
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.830
restrain'd and out of haunt,

24
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.270
This mad young man: but so muchwas our love,

25
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.430
We would not understand what wasmost fit;

26
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.100
But, like the owner of a fouldisease

27
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.600
To keep it from divulging,

28
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.400
let it feed Even on the pith ofLife.

29
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.300
Where is he gone?

30
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.470
To draw apart the body he hathkill'd:

31
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.530
O'er whom his very madness,

32
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.430
like some ore Among a mineral ofmetals base,

33
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.800
Shows itself pure; he weeps forwhat is done.

34
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.500
O Gertrude, come away!

35
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.630
The sun no sooner shall themountains touch,

36
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.830
But we will ship him hence: andthis vile deed We must,

37
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.830
with all our majesty and skill,Both countenance and excuse.

38
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.800
Ho, Guildenstern!

39
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.030
Friends both, go join you withsome further aid:

40
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.630
Hamlet in madness hath Poloniusslain,

41
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.800
And from his mother's closethath he dragg'd him:

42
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.070
Go seek him out; speak fair,

43
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.970
and bring the body Into thechapel.

44
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.130
Gertrude, come away.

45
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.200
My soul is full of discord anddismay.

46
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.970
Safely stowed.

47
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.630
Hamlet!

48
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.730
Lord Hamlet!

49
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.830
What noise?

50
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.870
Who calls on Hamlet?

51
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.700
O, here they come.

52
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.230
What have you done, my lord,with the dead body?

53
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.570
Compounded it with dust, whereto'tis kin.

54
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.900
Tell us where 'tis,

55
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.000
that we may take it thence Andbear it to the chapel.

56
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.470
Do not believe it.

57
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.470
Believe what?

58
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.070
That I can keep your counsel andnot mine own.

59
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.830
Besides, to be demanded of asponge!

60
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.500
What replication should be madeby the son of a king?

61
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.570
Take you me for a sponge, mylord?

62
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.670
Ay, sir, that soaks up theking's countenance,

63
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.230
his rewards, his authorities.

64
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.730
But such officers do the kingbest service in the end:

65
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.470
he keeps them, like an ape anapple,

66
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.700
in the corner of his jaw;

67
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.170
first mouthed, to be lastswallowed.

68
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.870
When he needs what you havegleaned,

69
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.900
it is but squeezing you, and,sponge,

70
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.630
you shall be dry again.

71
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.230
I understand you not, my lord.

72
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.370
I am glad of it.

73
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.530
A knavish speech sleeps in afoolish ear.

74
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.130
My lord, you must tell us wherethe body is

75
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.970
and go with us to the king.

76
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.600
The body is with the king,

77
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.630
but the king is not with thebody.

78
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.370
The king is a thing--

79
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.970
A thing, my lord!

80
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.800
Of nothing.

81
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.070
Bring me to him.

82
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.000
Hide fox, and all after.

83
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.400
I have sent to seek him and tofind the body.

84
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.270
How dangerous is it that thisman goes loose!

85
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.030
Yet must we not put the stronglaw on him.

86
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.100
He's loved of the distractedmultitude,

87
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.400
Who like not in their judgment,but their eyes;

88
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.100
And where 'tis so, theoffender's scourge is weigh'd,

89
00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.470
But never the offence.

90
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.400
To bear all smooth and even,

91
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.930
This sudden sending him awaymust seem Deliberate pause:

92
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.330
diseases desperate grown Bydesperate appliance

93
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.600
are relieved, Or not at all.

94
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.700
How now!

95
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.830
What hath befall'n?

96
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.930
Where the dead body is bestow'd,my lord,

97
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.030
We cannot get from him.

98
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.200
But where is he?

99
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.870
Without, my lord; guarded, toknow your pleasure.

100
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.070
Bring him before us.

101
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.330
Ho, Guildenstern!

102
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.870
Bring in the lord.

103
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.730
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

104
00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:34.900
At supper.

105
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.330
At supper! Where?

106
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.470
Not where he eats, but where heis eaten.

107
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.830
A certain convocation of politicworms are e'en at him.

108
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.570
Your worm is your only emperorfor diet.

109
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.130
We fat all creatures else to fatus,

110
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.630
and we fat ourselves formaggots.

111
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.200
Your fat king and your leanbeggar

112
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.970
is but variable service,

113
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.100
two dishes, but to one table:that's the end.

114
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.400
Alas, alas!

115
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.800
Man may fish with the worm thathath eat of a king

116
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.570
and eat of the fish that hathfed of that worm.

117
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.630
What dost thou mean by this?

118
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.870
Nothing but to show you how aking may go a progress

119
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.970
through the guts of a beggar.

120
00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.000
Where's Polonius?

121
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.130
In heaven; send thither to see:

122
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.970
if your messenger find him notthere,

123
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.300
seek him in the other placeyourself.

124
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.570
But indeed, if you find him notwithin this month,

125
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.230
You shall nose him as you go upthe stairs into the lobby.

126
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.970
Go seek him there.

127
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.970
He will stay till you come.

128
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.100
Hamlet, this deed, for thineespecial safety--

129
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.370
Which we do tender,

130
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.370
as we dearly grieve For thatwhich thou hast done--

131
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.100
must send thee hence With fieryquickness:

132
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.730
therefore prepare thyself; Thebark is ready,

133
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.600
the wind at help, The associatestend,

134
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.030
and every thing is bent ForEngland.

135
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.130
For England!

136
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.230
Ay, Hamlet.

137
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.470
Good.

138
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.230
So is it, if thou knew'st ourpurposes.

139
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.470
I see a cherub that sees them.

140
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.370
But, come; for England!

141
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.900
Farewell, dear mother.

142
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.130
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

143
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.800
My mother:

144
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.100
father and mother is man andwife;

145
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.370
man and wife is one flesh; andso, my mother.

146
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.030
Come, for England!

147
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.630
Follow him at foot; tempt himwith speed aboard;

148
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.130
Delay it not; I'll have himhence to-night.

149
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.470
And, England, if my love thouhold'st at aught,

150
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.800
thou mayst not coldly set Oursovereign process;

151
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.430
which imports at full,

152
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.230
By letters congruing to thateffect,

153
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.500
The present death of Hamlet.

154
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.000
Do it, England; For like thehectic in my blood he rages,

155
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.370
And thou must cure me: till Iknow 'tis done,

156
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.170
Howe'er my haps, my joys werene'er begun.

157
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.400
Go, captain, from me greet theDanish king;

158
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.930
Tell him that, by his license,

159
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:23.670
Fortinbras Craves the conveyance

160
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.830
of a promised march Over hiskingdom.

161
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.430
You know the rendezvous.

162
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:31.430
If that his majesty would aughtwith us,

163
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.600
We shall express our duty in hiseye; And let him know so.

164
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.800
I will do't, my lord.

165
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.800
Go softly on.

166
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.330
Good sir, whose powers arethese?

167
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.730
They are of Norway, sir.

168
00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.170
How purposed, sir, I pray you?

169
00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.730
Against some part of Poland.

170
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.000
Who commands them, sir?

171
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.770
The nephew of old Norway,Fortinbras.

172
00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.970
Goes it against the main ofPoland, sir,

173
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:07.230
Or for some frontier?

174
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.030
Truly to speak, and with noaddition,

175
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.700
We go to gain a little patch ofground

176
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.470
That hath in it no profit butthe name.

177
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.830
To pay five ducats, five, Iwould not farm it.

178
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.900
Why, then the Polack never willdefend it.

179
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.570
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

180
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:24.530
I humbly thank you, sir.

181
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.370
Wilt please you go, my lord?

182
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.270
I'll be with you straight go alittle before.

183
00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.130
How all occasions do informagainst me

184
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:51.870
And spur my dull revenge!

185
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.600
What is a man,

186
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.270
If his chief good and market ofhis time

187
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.370
Be but to sleep and feed?

188
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.170
A beast, no more.

189
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.170
Sure, he that made us with suchlarge discourse,

190
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.770
Looking before and after,

191
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.870
gave us not That capability andgod-like reason

192
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:13.870
To fust in us unused.

193
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.330
Now, whether it be Bestialoblivion

194
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.370
or some craven scruple

195
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.770
Of thinking too precisely on theevent,

196
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:28.730
I do not know Why yet I live tosay,

197
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.570
"This thing's to do."

198
00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:40.030
I have cause and will andstrength and means To do't.

199
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:43.100
Examples gross as earth exhortme:

200
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.570
Witness this army of such massand charge

201
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.230
Led by a delicate and tenderprince,

202
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.630
Whose spirit with divineambition puff'd

203
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.270
Makes mouths at the invisibleevent,

204
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.200
Exposing what is mortal andunsure To all that fortune,

205
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:08.700
death and danger dare, Even foran egg-shell.

206
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:15.570
Rightly to be great Is not tostir without great argument,

207
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.330
But greatly to find quarrel in astraw

208
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.000
When honour's at the stake.

209
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.230
How stand I then, That have afather kill'd,

210
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.430
a mother stain'd, Excitements ofmy reason and my blood,

211
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.570
And let all sleep?

212
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.900
While, to my shame, I see Theimminent death

213
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.700
of twenty thousand men, That,

214
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.530
for a fantasy and trick of fame,Go to their graves like beds,

215
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:49.200
fight for a plot Whereon thenumbers cannot try the cause,

216
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.530
Which is not tomb enough andcontinent To hide the slain?

217
00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:03.070
O, from this time forth, Mythoughts be bloody,

218
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.070
or be nothing worth!

219
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.130
I will not speak with her.

220
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:34.230
She is importunate, indeeddistract.

221
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.200
Her mood will needs be pitied.

222
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.270
What would she have?

223
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:41.800
She speaks much of her father;

224
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.770
says she hears There's tricks i'the world;

225
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.730
and hems, and beats her heart;

226
00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.100
Spurns enviously at straws;speaks things in doubt,

227
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.230
That carry but half sense: herspeech is nothing,

228
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.930
Yet the unshaped use of it

229
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.270
doth move her hearers tocollection.

230
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.300
They yawn at it,

231
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.500
And botch the words up fit totheir own thoughts;

232
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.830
Which, as her winks and nods andgestures yield them,

233
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.200
Indeed would make one thinkthere might be thought,

234
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.700
Though nothing sure, yet muchunhappily.

235
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.370
It were good she were spokenwith;

236
00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:14.000
for she may strew Dangerousconjectures

237
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.170
in ill-breeding minds.

238
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.030
Let her come in.

239
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:28.500
To my sick soul, as sin's truenature is,

240
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.870
Each toy seems prologue to somegreat amiss:

241
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.970
So full of artless jealousy isguilt;

242
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:41.100
It spills itself in fearing tobe spilt.

243
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:54.330
Where is the beauteous majestyof Denmark?

244
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:56.870
How now, Ophelia!

245
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:08.330
How should I your true love knowFrom another one?

246
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:14.000
By his cockle hat and staff, Andhis sandal shoon.

247
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.100
Alas, sweet lady, what importsthis song?

248
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.200
Say you?

249
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.630
Nay, pray you, mark.

250
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:23.070
He is dead and gone, lady, He isdead and gone;

251
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.870
At his head a grass-green turf,

252
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.530
At his heels a stone.

253
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.630
Nay, but, Ophelia.

254
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.370
Pray you, mark.

255
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.530
White his shroud as the mountainsnow.

256
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:36.400
Larded with sweet flowers Whichbewept to the grave--

257
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.600
Alas, look here.

258
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.730
Did not go With true-loveshowers.

259
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.300
How do you, pretty lady?

260
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.830
Well.

261
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.230
God dild you!

262
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.330
They say the owl was a baker'sdaughter.

263
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:55.970
Lord, we know what we are, butknow not what we may be.

264
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.500
God be at your table!

265
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.700
Conceit upon her father.

266
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.430
Pray let's have no words ofthis;

267
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:06.470
but when they ask you what itmeans, say you this:

268
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:09.470
To-morrow is Saint Valentine'sday,

269
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.570
All in the morning betime, And Ia maid at your window,

270
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.200
To be your Valentine.

271
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.830
Then up he rose and donn'd hisclothes

272
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.030
And dupp'd the chamber-door;

273
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:25.300
Let in a maid, let out a maid,

274
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.570
Never departed more.

275
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.900
Pretty Ophelia!

276
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.130
Indeed, la, without an oath,I'll make an end on't:

277
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:31.830
By Gis and by Saint Charity,

278
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.030
Alack, and fie for shame!

279
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.500
Young men will do't, if theycome to't;

280
00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.630
By cock, they are to blame.

281
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.930
Quoth she, before you tumbledme,

282
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.170
You promised me to wed.

283
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.500
He answers:

284
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.100
So would I ha' done, by yondersun,

285
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.330
An thou hadst not come to mybed.

286
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.030
How long hath she been thus?

287
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.700
I hope all will be well.

288
00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.370
We must be patient: but I cannotchoose but weep,

289
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:05.370
to think they would lay him inthe cold ground.

290
00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.700
My brother shall know of it!

291
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.000
And so I thank you for your goodcounsel.

292
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.170
Come, my coach!

293
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:23.070
Good night, ladies; good night,sweet ladies;

294
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:27.400
good night, good night.

295
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.230
Follow her close; give her goodwatch, I pray you.

296
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.300
O, this is the poison of deepgrief;

297
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.570
it springs All from her father'sdeath.

298
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.300
And now behold.

299
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:50.270
O Gertrude, Gertrude, Whensorrows come,

300
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:55.600
they come not single spies Butin battalions.

301
00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.400
First, her father slain: Next,your son gone;

302
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.630
and he most violent author Ofhis own just remove:

303
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.470
the people muddied,

304
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.030
Thick and unwholesome in theirthoughts and whispers,

305
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:09.600
For good Polonius' death;

306
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.000
and we have done but greenly, Inhugger-mugger to inter him.

307
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.730
Poor Ophelia Divided fromherself and her fair judgment,

308
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.970
Without the which we arepictures,

309
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.500
or mere beasts:

310
00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.330
Last, and as much containing asall these,

311
00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.230
Her brother is in secret comefrom France

312
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.470
and wants not buzzers to infecthis ear

313
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.500
With pestilent speeches of hisfather's death.

314
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.270
O my dear Gertrude, this, Liketo a murdering-piece,

315
00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.870
in many places Gives mesuperfluous death.

316
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.270
Alack, what noise is this?

317
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:51.730
Attend! Where are my Swissers?

318
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.830
Let them guard the door.

319
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:53.930
What's the matter?

320
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.030
Save yourself, my lord:

321
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.670
The ocean, overpeering of hislist,

322
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.670
Eats not the flats with moreimpetuous haste

323
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.470
Than young Laertes, in a riotoushead,

324
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.870
O'erbears your officers.

325
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.400
The rabble call him lord;

326
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.570
And, as the world were now butto begin,

327
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:07.600
Antiquity forgot, custom notknown,

328
00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.400
They cry, "Choose we; Laertesshall be king."

329
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.400
Caps, hands, and tongues,applaud it to the clouds:

330
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.370
"Laertes shall be king, Laertesking!"

331
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:19.270
How cheerfully on the falsetrail they cry!

332
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.670
O, this is counter, you falseDanish dogs!

333
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.330
The doors are broke.

334
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:26.330
Where is this king?

335
00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:31.530
O thou vile king, Give me myfather!

336
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:34.300
Calmly, good Laertes.

337
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.530
That drop of blood that's calmproclaims me bastard,

338
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.900
Cries cuckold to my father,brands the harlot Even here,

339
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.070
between the chaste unsmirchedbrow Of my true mother.

340
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.670
What is the cause, Laertes,

341
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.670
That thy rebellion looks sogiant-like?

342
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.430
Let him go, Gertrude; do notfear our person:

343
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.370
There's such divinity doth hedgea king

344
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.670
That treason can but peep towhat it would,

345
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.270
Acts little of his will.

346
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.470
Tell me, Laertes, Why thou artthus incensed.

347
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.900
Let him go, Gertrude.

348
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.130
Speak, man.

349
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:09.230
Where is my father?

350
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:10.330
Dead.

351
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:11.570
But not by him.

352
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.870
Let him demand his fill.

353
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:14.130
How came he dead?

354
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:18.470
I'll not be juggled with: Tohell, allegiance!

355
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.770
Vows, to the blackest devil!

356
00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.470
Conscience and grace, to theprofoundest pit!

357
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.400
I dare damnation.

358
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:28.600
To this point I stand,

359
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.400
That both the worlds I give tonegligence,

360
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.230
Let come what comes;

361
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:36.930
only I'll be revenged Mostthroughly for my father.

362
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.070
Who shall stay you?

363
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.870
My will, not all the worlds.

364
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.230
Good Laertes, If you desire toknow the certainty

365
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:45.430
Of your dear father, is't writin your revenge,

366
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.800
That, swoopstake,

367
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.100
you will draw both friend andfoe, Winner and loser?

368
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.630
None but his enemies.

369
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.470
Will you know them then?

370
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.700
To his good friends thus wideI'll ope my arms;

371
00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.400
And like the kind life-renderingpelican,

372
00:19:58.400 --> 00:19:59.930
Repast them with my blood.

373
00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.430
Why, now you speak Like a goodchild

374
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.770
and a true gentleman.

375
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:07.730
That I am guiltless of yourfather's death

376
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.900
And am most sensibly in grieffor it,

377
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.670
It shall as level to yourjudgment pierce

378
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:12.900
As day does to your eye.

379
00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.000
How now!

380
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.370
What noise is that?

381
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.700
O heat, dry up my brains!

382
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.200
Tears seven times salt,

383
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.500
Burn out the sense and virtue ofmine eye!

384
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.200
By heavens, thy madness shall bepaid with weight

385
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.070
Till our scale turn the beam.

386
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.530
O rose of May!

387
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.370
Dear maid, kind sister, sweetOphelia!

388
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.870
O heavens!

389
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.370
Is't possible a young maid'swits

390
00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.000
Should be as mortal as an oldman's life?

391
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.030
Nature is fine in love, andwhere 'tis fine,

392
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:14.970
It sends some precious instanceof itself after the thing itloves.

393
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.770
They bore him barefaced on thebier;

394
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:22.330
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;

395
00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:26.000
And in his grave rain'd many atear.

396
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.370
Fare you well, my dove!

397
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.430
Hadst thou thy wits and didstpersuade revenge,

398
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.300
It could not move thus.

399
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:43.270
You must sing a-down a-down, An'you call him a-down-a.

400
00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:45.230
O, how the wheel becomes it!

401
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.670
It is the false steward thatstole his master's daughter.

402
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.670
This nothing's more than matter.

403
00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.600
There's rosemary, that's forremembrance;

404
00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.400
pray you, love, remember.

405
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.700
There's pansies.

406
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:05.230
That's for thoughts.

407
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:11.830
A document in madness, thoughtsand remembrance fitted.

408
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:17.470
There's fennel for you, andcolumbines.

409
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:20.100
There's rue for you; and there'ssome for me.

410
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.830
We may call it herb-grace o'Sundays:

411
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.030
O you must wear your rue with adifference.

412
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.170
There's a daisy.

413
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:33.900
I would give you some violets,

414
00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:38.600
but they withered all when myfather died.

415
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.970
They say he made a good end.

416
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.270
For bonny sweet Robin is all myjoy.

417
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:51.630
Thought and affliction, passion,hell itself,

418
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:56.030
She turns to favour and toprettiness.

419
00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:59.570
Will he not come again?

420
00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.730
And will he not come again?

421
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:12.730
No, no, he is dead: Go to thydeath-bed:

422
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.130
He never will come again.

423
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:21.270
His beard was as white as snow,

424
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.700
All flaxen was his poll:

425
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:31.470
He is gone, he is gone, And wecast away moan:

426
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:33.630
God ha' mercy on his soul!

427
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.670
And of all Christian souls, Ipray God.

428
00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.100
God buy you.

429
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.900
Do you see this, O God?

430
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.530
Laertes.

431
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:59.130
I must commune with your grief,

432
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:01.000
Or you deny me right.

433
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.470
Go but apart,

434
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.670
Make choice of whom your wisestfriends you will.

435
00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.130
And they shall hear and judge'twixt you and me:

436
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:10.630
If by direct or by collateralhand

437
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.870
They find us touch'd, we willour kingdom give,

438
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.800
Our crown, our life, and allthat we call ours

439
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:18.170
To you in satisfaction; but ifnot,

440
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.500
Be you content to lend yourpatience to us,

441
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.700
And we shall jointly labour withyour soul

442
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.630
To give it due content.

443
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:31.900
Let this be so;

444
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.400
His means of death, his obscurefuneral--

445
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.400
No trophy, sword, nor hatchmento'er his bones,

446
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.030
No noble rite nor formalostentation--

447
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:46.330
Cry to be heard, as 'twere fromheaven to earth,

448
00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.800
That I must call't in question.

449
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.670
And so you shall;

450
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:57.170
And where the offence is let thegreat axe fall.

451
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.700
God bless you, sir.

452
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.100
Let him bless thee too.

453
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.630
That shall, sir, and please him.

454
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.930
There's a letter for you, sir.

455
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.100
It came from the ambassador thatwas bound for England;

456
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:32.300
if your name be Horatio, as I amlet to know it is.

457
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.370
"Horatio, when thou shalt haveoverlooked this,

458
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.030
"give these fellows some meansto the king:

459
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.770
"they have letters for him.

460
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:58.730
"Ere we were two days old atsea,

461
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.930
"a pirate of very warlikeappointment gave us chase.

462
00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:03.700
"Finding ourselves too slow ofsail,

463
00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.330
"we put on a compelled valour,

464
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.730
"and in the grapple I boardedthem:

465
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:09.630
"on the instant they got clearof our ship;

466
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.400
"so I alone became theirprisoner.

467
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.500
"They have dealt with me likethieves of mercy:

468
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.170
"but they knew what they did;

469
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.570
"I am to do a good turn forthem.

470
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.230
"Let the king have the letters Ihave sent;

471
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.370
"and repair thou to me with asmuch speed

472
00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.700
"as thou wouldst fly death.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.030
"I have words to speak in thineear will make thee dumb;

474
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:35.770
"yet are they much too light forthe bore of the matter.

475
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.130
"These good fellows will bringthee where I am.

476
00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.430
"Rosencrantz and Guildensternhold their course for England:

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.700
"of them I have much to tellthee.

478
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.900
"Farewell.

479
00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.630
He that thou knowest thine,--Hamlet."

480
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.870
Come, I will give you way forthese your letters;

481
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.570
And do it the speedier that youmay direct me To him

482
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.400
from whom you brought them.

483
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.900
Now must your conscience myacquaintance seal,

484
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.900
And you must put me in yourheart for friend,

485
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:19.530
Sith you have heard, and with aknowing ear,

486
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.070
That he which hath your noblefather slain

487
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:24.170
Pursued my life.

488
00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.470
It well appears.

489
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.230
But tell me Why you proceedednot against these feats,

490
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.030
So crimeful and so capital innature,

491
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.870
As by your safety, wisdom, allthings else,

492
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.200
You mainly were stirr'd up.

493
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.530
O, for two special reasons;

494
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.670
Which may to you, perhaps, seemmuch unsinew'd,

495
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.100
But yet to me they are strong.

496
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.070
The queen his mother Livesalmost by his looks;

497
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:45.930
and for myself--

498
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.900
My virtue or my plague, be iteither which--

499
00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.030
She's so conjunctive to my lifeand soul,

500
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.500
That, as the star moves not butin his sphere,

501
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.700
I could not but by her.

502
00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.870
The other motive, Why to apublic count I might not go,

503
00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.570
Is the great love the generalgender bear him;

504
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.700
Who, dipping all his faults intheir affection,

505
00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:09.100
Would, like the spring thatturneth wood to stone,

506
00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:10.830
Convert his gyves to graces.

507
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.970
And so have I a noble fatherlost;

508
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.270
A sister driven into desperateterms,

509
00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.900
Whose worth, if praises may goback again,

510
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.670
Stood challenger on mount of allthe age

511
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:25.100
For her perfections: but myrevenge will come.

512
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.500
Break not your sleeps for that:

513
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.230
you must not think That we aremade of stuff so flat and dull

514
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.200
That we can let our beard beshook with danger

515
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.670
And think it pastime.

516
00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:37.230
You shortly shall hear more:

517
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:45.000
I loved your father, and we loveourself;

518
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And that, I hope, will teach youto imagine--

519
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.570
How now! What news?

520
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.300
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:

521
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.430
These to your majesty; this tothe queen.

522
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.500
From Hamlet!

523
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:57.800
Who brought them?

524
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.470
Sailors, my lord, they say; Isaw them not:

525
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.200
They were given me by Claudio;

526
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.070
he received them Of him thatbrought them.

527
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.800
Laertes, you shall hear them.

528
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.900
Leave us.

529
00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:14.530
"High and mighty,

530
00:29:14.530 --> 00:29:18.170
"You shall know I am set nakedon your kingdom.

531
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.370
"To-morrow shall I beg leave tosee your kingly eyes:

532
00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.970
"when I shall, first asking yourpardon thereunto,

533
00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.700
"recount the occasion of mysudden and more strange return.

534
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.800
--Hamlet."

535
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.170
What should this mean?

536
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.330
Are all the rest come back?

537
00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:34.130
Or is this some abuse, and nosuch thing?

538
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.700
Know you the hand?

539
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.830
'Tis Hamlet's character.

540
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.170
"Naked!"

541
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.200
And in a postscript here, hesays "alone."

542
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.730
Can you advise me?

543
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:47.530
I'm lost in it, my lord.

544
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.270
But let him come;

545
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.100
It warms the very sickness in myheart

546
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.200
That I shall live and tell himto his teeth,

547
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.730
"Thus didest thou."

548
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.700
If it be so, Laertes-- thus howshould it be so?

549
00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.100
How otherwise?

550
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.430
Will you be ruled by me?

551
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.670
Ay, my lord; So you will noto'errule me to a peace.

552
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:10.000
To thine own peace.

553
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.130
If he be now return'd, Aschecking at his voyage,

554
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:13.970
and that he means No more toundertake it,

555
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:16.200
I will work him To an exploit,now ripe in my device,

556
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.730
Under the which he shall notchoose but fall:

557
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.870
And for his death no wind ofblame shall breathe,

558
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:23.000
But even his mother shalluncharge the practice

559
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.830
And call it accident.

560
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:27.800
My lord, I will be ruled; Therather,

561
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.400
if you could devise it so That Imight be the organ.

562
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:38.330
It falls right.

563
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.430
You have been talk'd of sinceyour travel much,

564
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.800
And that in Hamlet's hearing,

565
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.600
for a quality Wherein, they say,you shine.

566
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.100
Two months since, Here was agentleman of Normandy.

567
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.570
He made confession of you

568
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.630
And gave you such a masterlyreport For art and exercise

569
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.730
in your defence And for yourrapier most especial

570
00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.170
That he cried out,

571
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.300
'twould be a sight indeed If onecould match you.

572
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.570
This report of his Did Hamlet soenvenom

573
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.270
with his envy That he couldnothing do

574
00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.100
but wish and beg Your suddencoming o'er

575
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.570
to play with you.

576
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.370
Now, out of this.

577
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.900
What out of this, my lord?

578
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.330
Laertes, was your father dear toyou?

579
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.100
Or are you like the painting ofa sorrow,

580
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.370
A face without a heart?

581
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:28.900
Why ask you this?

582
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.070
Not that I think you did notlove your father;

583
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.700
But that I know love is begun bytime;

584
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.500
And that I see, in passages ofproof,

585
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.900
Time qualifies the fire andspark of it.

586
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.970
There lives within the veryflame of love

587
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.300
A kind of wick or snuff thatwill abate it;

588
00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.670
And nothing is at a likegoodness still;

589
00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:50.970
But goodness, growing to apleurisy,

590
00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:55.470
Dies in his own too much.

591
00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.700
But, to the quick o' the ulcer.

592
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.600
Hamlet comes back: what wouldyou undertake

593
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.700
To show yourself in deed

594
00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.170
your father's son More than inwords?

595
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.870
To cut his throat i' the church.

596
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:11.000
No place, indeed, should murdersanctuarize;

597
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.700
Revenge should know no bounds.

598
00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:16.730
But, good Laertes, Will you dothis,

599
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.400
keep close within your chamber.

600
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.470
Hamlet return'd shall know youare come back.

601
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.000
We'll put on those shall praiseyour excellence

602
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.730
And set a double varnish on thefame The Frenchman gave you,

603
00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.970
bring you in fine together Andwager on your heads:

604
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.670
he, being remiss, Most generousand free from all contrivings,

605
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.870
Will not peruse the foils; sothat, with ease,

606
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.370
Or with a little shuffling, youmay choose A sword unbated,

607
00:32:39.370 --> 00:32:43.330
and in a pass of practiceRequite him for your father.

608
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.630
I will do't:

609
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.500
And, for that purpose, I'llanoint my sword.

610
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.070
I bought an unction of amountebank

611
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:56.130
So mortal that but dip a knifein it,

612
00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.100
Where it draws blood nocataplasm so rare,

613
00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.970
Collected from all simples thathave virtue Under the moon

614
00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:06.970
can save the thing from deathThat is but scratch'd withal:

615
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.100
I'll touch my point With thiscontagion,

616
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.000
that, if I gall him slightly, Itmay be death.

617
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.700
Let's further think of this;

618
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.830
Weigh what convenience both oftime and means

619
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:20.100
May fit us to our shape.

620
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:21.370
If this should fail,

621
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.400
And that our drift look throughour bad performance,

622
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.870
'Twere better not assay'd:

623
00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.300
therefore this project Shouldhave a back or second,

624
00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.400
that might hold, If this didblast in proof.

625
00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.500
Soft!

626
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.230
Let me see.

627
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:38.830
We'll make a solemn wager onyour cunnings.

628
00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.500
O, I ha't.

629
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.430
When in your motions you are hotand dry--

630
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:46.630
As make your bout more violentto that end--

631
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.830
And that he calls for drink,

632
00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:51.130
I'll have preffer'd him Achalice for the nonce,

633
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:52.370
whereon but sipping,

634
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.370
If he by chance escape yourvenom'd stuck,

635
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.530
Our purpose may hold there.

636
00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.170
Stay. What noise?

637
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:11.730
One woe doth tread uponanother's heels.

638
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.770
So fast they follow.

639
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:23.900
Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

640
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.000
Drown'd!

641
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.570
O, where?

642
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:41.100
There is a willow grows aslantthe brook

643
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.300
That shows his hoar leaves inthe glassy stream;

644
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.170
There with fantastic garlands

645
00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:50.900
she would make of daisies,crow-flowers, nettles,

646
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:57.370
and long purples which liberalshepherds give a grosser name,

647
00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:04.170
But our cold maids do dead men'sfingers call them:

648
00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:08.270
There, on the pendent boughs

649
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:11.830
her coronet weeds Clambering tohang,

650
00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:15.470
an envious sliver broke;

651
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.670
When down her weedy trophies andherself

652
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.970
Fell in the weeping brook.

653
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.630
Her clothes spread wide;

654
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:27.970
And, mermaid-like, awhile theybore her up:

655
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:31.870
Which time she chanted snatchesof old lauds;

656
00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:34.400
As one incapable of her owndistress

657
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.800
Or like a creature native andindued Unto that element:

658
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.500
but long it could not be Tillthat her garments,

659
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.830
heavy with their drink,

660
00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.430
Pull'd the poor wretch from hermelodious lay

661
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:52.700
To muddy death.

662
00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:00.970
Alas, then, she is drown'd?

663
00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:05.770
Drown'd, drown'd.

664
00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:15.900
Too much of water hast thou,poor Ophelia.

665
00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.870
And therefore I forbid my tears.

666
00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:36.000
But yet It is our trick; natureher custom holds,

667
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.230
Let shame say what it will.

668
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.400
When these are gone, the womanwill be out!

669
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.670
Adieu, my lord:

670
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:57.070
I have a speech of fire thatfain would blaze,

671
00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:01.930
But that this folly douts it.

672
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.100
Let's follow, Gertrude:

673
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:15.000
How much I had to do to calm hisrage.

674
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.330
Now fear I this will give itstart again.

675
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:19.830
Therefore let's follow.

676
00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:25.170
