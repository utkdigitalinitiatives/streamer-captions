00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.870


2
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.400
This is the palace of thefearful king,

3
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.170
And this the regal seat:possess it, York;

4
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.800
For this is thine and notKing Henry's heirs'

5
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.330
Assist me, then, sweetWarwick, and I will;

6
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.230
We'll all assist you; hethat flies shall die.

7
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.230
Thanks, gentle Norfolk:

8
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.570
And when the king comes,offer him no violence,

9
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.830
Unless he seek to thrustyou out perforce.

10
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.300
Then leave me not, mylords; be resolute;

11
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.970
I mean to take possessionof my right.

12
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.630
Neither the king, nor hethat loves him best,

13
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.470
The proudest he that holdsup Lancaster,

14
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.170
Dares stir a wing, ifWarwick shake his bells.

15
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.030
I'll plant Plantagenet,root him up who dares:

16
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.200
Resolve thee, Richard;claim the English crown.

17
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.630
(celebrating cheers)

18
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.630
(horns sound)

19
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.000
My lords, look where thesturdy rebel sits,

20
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.930
Even in the chair ofstate: belike he means,

21
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.700
Back'd by the power ofWarwick, that false peer,

22
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.400
To aspire unto the crownand reign as king.

23
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.530
Earl of Northumberland, heslew thy father.

24
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.230
And thine, Lord Clifford; andyou both have vow'd revenge

25
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.470
On him, his sons, hisfavourites and his friends.

26
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.930
If I be not, heavens berevenged on me!

27
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.500
The hope thereof makesClifford mourn in steel.

28
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.470
What, shall we suffer this?let's pluck him down:

29
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.170
My heart for anger burns;I cannot brook it.

30
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.570
Be patient, gentle Earl ofWestmoreland.

31
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.670
Patience is for poltroons,such as he:

32
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.630
He durst not sit there,had your father lived.

33
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.830
My gracious lord, here inthe parliament

34
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.630
Let us assail the familyof York.

35
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.030
Well hast thou spoken,cousin: be it so.

36
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.030
Ah, know you not the cityfavours them,

37
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.130
And they have troops ofsoldiers at their beck?

38
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.830
But when the duke is slain,they'll quickly fly.

39
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.000
Far be the thought of thisfrom Henry's heart,

40
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.100
To make a shambles of theparliament-house!

41
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.830
Cousin of Exeter, frowns,words and threats

42
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.500
Shall be the war thatHenry means to use.

43
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.770
Thou factious Duke ofYork, descend my throne,

44
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.800
and kneel for grace andmercy at my feet;

45
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.200
I am thy sovereign.

46
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.900
I am thine.

47
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.070
For shame, come down: hemade thee Duke of York.

48
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.800
'Twas my inheritance, asthe earldom was.

49
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.270
Thy father was a traitorto the crown.

50
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.500
Exeter, thou art a traitorto the crown

51
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.400
In following this usurpingHenry.

52
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.800
Whom should he follow buthis natural king?

53
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.630
True, Clifford; and that'sRichard Duke of York.

54
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.130
And shall I stand, andthou sit in my throne?

55
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.130
It must and shall be so:content thyself.

56
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.730
Be Duke of Lancaster; lethim be king.

57
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.300
He is both king and Dukeof Lancaster;

58
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.530
And that the Lord ofWestmoreland shall maintain.

59
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.330
And Warwick shall disprove it.

60
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.930
You forget that we are thosewhich chased you from the field

61
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.030
And slew your fathers, andwith colours spread

62
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.270
March'd through the cityto the palace gates.

63
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.470
Yes, Warwick, I do rememberit to my grief;

64
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.230
And, by his soul, thou andthy house shall rue it.

65
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.630
Plantagenet, of thee andthese thy sons,

66
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.130
Thy kinsman and thy friends,I'll have more lives

67
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.930
Than drops of blood werein my father's veins.

68
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.030
Urge it no more; lestthat, instead of words,

69
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.200
I send thee, Warwick, sucha messenger

70
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.470
As shall revenge his deathbefore I stir.

71
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:23.270
Poor Clifford! how I scornhis worthless threats!

72
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.330
Will you we show our titleto the crown?

73
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.630
If not, our swords shallplead it in the field.

74
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.770
What title hast thou,traitor, to the crown?

75
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.400
Thy father was, as thouart, Duke of York;

76
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.230
Thy grandfather, RogerMortimer, Earl of March:

77
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.730
I am the son of Henry theFifth,

78
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.600
Who made the Dauphin andthe French to stoop

79
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.600
And seized upon theirtowns and provinces.

80
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.630
Talk not of France, siththou hast lost it all.

81
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.230
The lord protector lostit, and not I:

82
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.100
When I was crown'd I wasbut nine months old.

83
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.570
You are old enough now, andyet, methinks, you lose.

84
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.770
Father, tear the crownfrom the usurper's head.

85
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.200
Sweet father, do so; setit on your head.

86
00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.970
Good father, as thoulovest and honourest arms,

87
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.130
Let's fight it out and notstand cavilling thus.

88
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.100
Sound drums and trumpets,and the king will fly.

89
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.170
Sons, peace!

90
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.770
Peace, thou! and give KingHenry leave to speak.

91
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:14.130
Plantagenet shall speakfirst: hear him, lords;

92
00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.330
And be you silent andattentive too,

93
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.470
For he that interrupts himshall not live.

94
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.730
Plantagenet, why seeks thou todipose thee?

95
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.770
Are we not bothplantagenets by birth

96
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.400
and from two brotherslinearly decent?

97
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.270
Suppose by right and equity,thou be king.

98
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.430
Think'st thou that I willleave my kingly throne,

99
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.400
Wherein my grandsire andmy father sat?

100
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.300
No: first shall warunpeople this my realm;

101
00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.100
Ay, and their colours,often borne in France,

102
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.130
And now in England to ourheart's great sorrow,

103
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:55.030
Shall be my winding-sheet.Why faint you, lords?

104
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.170
My title's good, andbetter far than his.

105
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.170
Prove it, Henry, and thoushalt be king.

106
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.370
Henry the Fourth byconquest got the crown.

107
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.570
'Twas by rebellion againsthis king.

108
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.330
I know not what to say; mytitle's weak.--

109
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:16.070
Tell me, may not a kingadopt an heir?

110
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.300
What then?

111
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.600
An if he may, then am Ilawful king;

112
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.870
For Richard, in the viewof many lords,

113
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.870
Resign'd the crown toHenry the Fourth,

114
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.700
Whose heir my father was,and I am his.

115
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.330
He rose against him, beinghis sovereign,

116
00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.430
And made him to resign hiscrown perforce.

117
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:37.930
Suppose, my lords, he didit unconstrain'd,

118
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.800
Think you 'twereprejudicial to his crown?

119
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:49.070
No; for he could not soresign his crown

120
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.100
But that the next heirshould succeed and reign.

121
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.730
Art thou against us, Dukeof Exeter?

122
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.930
His is the right, andtherefore pardon me.

123
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.570
Why whisper you, my lords,and answer not?

124
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.600
My conscience tells me heis lawful king.

125
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.830
All will revolt from me,and turn to him.

126
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.430
King Henry, be thy titleright or wrong,

127
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:12.700
Lord Clifford vows tofight in thy defence:

128
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.300
May that ground gape andswallow me alive,

129
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.770
Where I shall kneel to himthat slew my father!

130
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.800
O Clifford, how thy wordsrevive my heart!

131
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.270
Henry of Lancaster, resignthy crown.

132
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.530
Do right unto thisprincely Duke of York,

133
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:30.300
Or I will fill the housewith armed men,

134
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:33.300
And over the chair ofstate, where now he sits,

135
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.900
Write up his title withusurping blood.

136
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:42.200
(drums sound)

137
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:48.830
My Lord of Warwick, hearme but one word:

138
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.230
Let me for this mylife-time reign as king.

139
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.930
Confirm the crown to meand to mine heirs,

140
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.270
And thou shalt reign inquiet while thou livest.

141
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.630
Convey the soldiers hence,and then I will.

142
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.470
Captain: Conduct them into thefields.

143
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:19.330
Away!

144
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.470
I am content: RichardPlantagenet,

145
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.630
Enjoy the kingdom after mydecease.

146
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.270
What wrong is this untothe prince your son!

147
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.330
What good is this toEngland and himself!

148
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.370
Base, fearful anddespairing Henry!

149
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:46.430
How hast thou injured boththyself and us!

150
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.570
I cannot stay to hearthese articles.

151
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.670
Nor I.

152
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.430
Come, cousin, let us tellthe queen these news.

153
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.130
Farewell, faint-heartedand degenerate king,

154
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.070
In whose cold blood nospark of honour bides.

155
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.330
Be thou a prey unto thehouse of York,

156
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.670
And die in bands for thisunmanly deed!

157
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.670
In dreadful war mayst thoube overcome,

158
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.500
Or live in peace abandon'dand despised!

159
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:15.430
Turn this way, Henry, andregard them not.

160
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.030
They seek revenge andtherefore will not yield.

161
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.470
Ah, Exeter!

162
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.430
Why should you sigh, mylord?

163
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.100
Not for myself, LordWarwick, but my son,

164
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.000
Whom I unnaturally shalldisinherit.

165
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.430
But be it as it may:

166
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.130
I here entail The crown to theeand to thine heirs for ever;

167
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:46.670
Conditionally, that herethou take thine oath

168
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.100
To cease this civil war,and, whilst I live,

169
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.930
To honour me as thy kingand sovereign,

170
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.300
And neither by treason norhostility

171
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.530
To seek to put me down andreign thyself.

172
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:10.530
This oath I willingly takeand will perform.

173
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.330
Long live the King!

174
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.300
(crowd chants) Long live theKing!

175
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.930
And long live thou andthese thy forward sons!

176
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.500
Now York and Lancaster arereconciled.

177
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.070
Accursed be he that seeksto make them foes!

178
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.800
(horn sounds)

179
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.870
Farewell, my graciouslord; I'll take my leave.

180
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.470
But I'll to Wakefield to mycastle.

181
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.530
And I'll keep London withmy soldiers.

182
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.470
And I to Norfolk with myfollowers.

183
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.970
And I, with grief andsorrow, to the court.

184
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.330
Here comes the queen, whoselooks bewray her anger:

185
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.170
I'll steal away.

186
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.670
Exeter, so will I.

187
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.030
Nay, go not from me; Iwill follow thee.

188
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:13.230
Be patient, gentle queen,and I will stay.

189
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.500
Who can be patient in suchextremes?

190
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.800
Ah, wretched man! would Ihad died a maid

191
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.000
And never seen thee, neverborne thee son,

192
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.200
Seeing thou hast proved sounnatural a father

193
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.300
Hath he deserved to losehis birthright thus?

194
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.200
Father, you cannotdisinherit me:

195
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.830
If you be king, why shouldnot I succeed?

196
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.100
Pardon me, Margaret;pardon me, sweet son:

197
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.270
The Earl of Warwick andthe duke enforced me.

198
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:45.400
Enforced thee! art thouking, and wilt be forced?

199
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.070
I shame to hear thee speak.Ah, timorous wretch!

200
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.900
Thou hast undone thyself,thy son and me;

201
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.830
And given unto the houseof York such head

202
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.130
As thou shalt reign but bytheir sufferance.

203
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.530
To entail him and hisheirs unto the crown,

204
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.130
What is it, but to makethy sepulchre

205
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.600
And creep into it farbefore thy time?

206
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.170
Warwick is chancellor. Salisburylord of Calais;

207
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:13.970
And the duke is made protectorof the realm;

208
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.830
And yet shalt thou besafe? such safety finds

209
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.230
The trembling lambenvironed with wolves.

210
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.670
Had I been there, which ama silly woman,

211
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.470
The soldiers should havetoss'd me on their pikes

212
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.100
Before I would havegranted to that act.

213
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.630
But thou preferr'st thylife before thine honour:

214
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.130
And seeing thou dost, Ihere divorce myself

215
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.870
Both from thy table,Henry, and thy bed,

216
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.170
Until that act ofparliament be repeal'd

217
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:46.370
Whereby my son isdisinherited.

218
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:50.370
The northern lords thathave forsworn thy colours

219
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.900
Will follow mine, if oncethey see them spread;

220
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.900
And spread they shall be,to thy foul disgrace

221
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.930
And utter ruin of thehouse of York.

222
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:04.970
Thus do I leave thee.Come, son, let's away;

223
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.330
Our army is ready; come,we'll after them.

224
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.870
Stay, gentle Margaret, andhear me speak.

225
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.670
Thou hast spoke too muchalready: get thee gone.

226
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.570
Gentle son Edward, thouwilt stay with me?

227
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.700
Ay, to be murder'd by hisenemies.

228
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.370
When I return with victoryfrom the field

229
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.200
I'll see your grace: tillthen I'll follow her.

230
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:28.700
Come, son, away; we maynot linger thus.

231
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.100
Poor queen! how love to meand to her son

232
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.800
Hath made her break outinto terms of rage!

233
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.930
Revenged may she be onthat hateful duke,

234
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.930
Whose haughty spirit,winged with desire,

235
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.700
Will cost my crown, andlike an empty eagle

236
00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:50.430
Tire on the flesh of meand of my son!

237
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:54.930
The loss of those threelords torments my heart:

238
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.300
I'll write unto them andentreat them fair.

239
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.330
Come, cousin you shall bethe messenger.

240
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:09.100
And I, I hope, shallreconcile them all.

241
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.900
Brother, though I beyoungest, give me leave.

242
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.370
No, I can better play theorator.

243
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.300
But I have reasons strongand forcible.

244
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.500
Why, how now, sons! At astrife?

245
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.470
What is your quarrel? howbegan it first?

246
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.400
No quarrel, but a slightcontention.

247
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.700
About what?

248
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.570
About that which concernsyour grace and us;

249
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.330
The crown of England,father, which is yours.

250
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.470
Mine boy? not till KingHenry be dead.

251
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.570
Your right depends not onhis life or death.

252
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.930
Now you are heir,therefore enjoy it now:

253
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.070
By giving the house ofLancaster leave to breathe,

254
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.600
It will outrun you,father, in the end.

255
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.470
I took an oath that heshould quietly reign.

256
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.430
But for a kingdom any oathmay be broken:

257
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:02.570
I would break a thousandoaths to reign one year.

258
00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.370
No; God forbid your graceshould be forsworn.

259
00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.570
I shall be, if I claim byopen war.

260
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.330
I'll prove the contrary,if you'll hear me speak.

261
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.670
Thou canst not, son; it isimpossible.

262
00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.400
An oath is of no moment,being not took

263
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.630
Before a true and lawfulmagistrate,

264
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.230
That hath authority overhim that swears:

265
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:30.130
Henry had none, but didusurp the place;

266
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.630
Then, seeing 'twas he thatmade you to depose,

267
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.270
Your oath, my lord, isvain and frivolous.

268
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:39.000
Therefore, to arms! And,father, do but think

269
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.830
How sweet a thing it is towear a crown;

270
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:43.930
Within whose circuit isElysium

271
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.830
And all that poets feignof bliss and joy.

272
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.970
Why do we linger thus? Icannot rest

273
00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.130
Until the white rose thatI wear be dyed

274
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.300
Even in the lukewarm bloodof Henry's heart.

275
00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:04.470
Richard, enough; I will beking, or die.

276
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.230
Cousin, thou shalt toLondon presently,

277
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.330
And whet on Warwick tothis enterprise.

278
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.470
Richard and George, you shalt toNorfolk straight,

279
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.830
And tell him privily ofour intent.

280
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.100
You Edward, shall to EdmundBrooke, Lord Cobham,

281
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.800
With whom the Kentishmenwill willingly rise:

282
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.800
In them I trust; for theyare soldiers,

283
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.800
Witty, courteous, liberal,full of spirit.

284
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.300
While you are thus employ'd,what resteth more,

285
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:33.770
But that I seek occasionhow to rise,

286
00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.930
And yet the king not privyto my drift,

287
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.930
Nor any of the house ofLancaster?

288
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.370
(horn sounds)

289
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:43.400
But, stay: what news? Whycomest thou in such post?

290
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.970
The queen with all thenorthern earls and lords

291
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.970
Intend here to besiege youin your castle:

292
00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:51.800
She is hard by with twentythousand men;

293
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.800
And therefore fortify yourhold, my lord.

294
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.230
Ay, with my sword.

295
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.230
What! think'st thouthat we fear them?

296
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.900
Edward and Richard, youshall stay with me;(bell rings)

297
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.200
Haste you to London cousinMontague:

298
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.300
Let noble Warwick, Cobham,and the rest,

299
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.070
Whom we have leftprotectors of the king,

300
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.930
With powerful policystrengthen themselves,

301
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.200
And trust not simple Henrynor his oaths.

302
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.900
Cousin, I go; I'll winthem, fear it not:

303
00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.370
Sir John and Sir HughMortimer, mine uncles,

304
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.800
You are come to Sandal ina happy hour;

305
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.000
The army of the queen meanto besiege us.

306
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.430
She shall not need; we'llmeet her in the field.

307
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.830
What, with five thousandmen?

308
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.930
Ay, with five hundred,father, for a need:

309
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.670
A woman's general; whatshould we fear?

310
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.230
I hear their drums: let'sset our men in order,

311
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.570
And issue forth and bidthem battle straight.

312
00:19:54.570 --> 00:20:02.900
Five men to twenty! thoughthe odds be great,

313
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.070
I doubt not, uncle, of ourvictory.

314
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.670
Many a battle have I wonin France,

315
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:13.200
When as the enemy hathbeen ten to one:

316
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.900
Why should I not now havethe like success?

317
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:23.400
(bells ring, drums beat)

318
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.100
Ah, whither shall I fly to'scape their hands?

319
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.930
Ah, tutor, look wherebloody Clifford comes!

320
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.700
Chaplain, away! thypriesthood saves thy life.

321
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.030
As for the brat of thisaccursed duke,

322
00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.600
Whose father slew myfather, he shall die.

323
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.370
And I, my lord, will bearhim company.

324
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.370
Soldiers, away with him!

325
00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.670
Ah, Clifford, murder notthis innocent child,

326
00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.270
Lest thou be hated both ofGod and man!

327
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.600
How now! is he dead already?

328
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.770
Or is it fear that makes himclose his eyes? I'll open them.

329
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.200
So looks the pent-up liono'er the wretch

330
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.630
That trembles under hisdevouring paws;

331
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.800
Sweet Clifford, hear mespeak before I die.

332
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.470
I am too mean a subjectfor thy wrath:

333
00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:00.470
Be thou revenged on men,and let me live.

334
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:02.000
In vain thouspeak'st, poor boy;

335
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.030
my father's blood hathstopp'd the passage

336
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.570
where thy words should enter.

337
00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.930
Then let my father's bloodopen it again:

338
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.670
He is a man, and,Clifford, cope with him.

339
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:16.470
Had thy brethren here,their lives and thine

340
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.000
Were not revengesufficient for me;

341
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.930
No, if I digg'd up thyforefathers' graves

342
00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.800
And hung their rottencoffins up in chains,

343
00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.230
It could not slake mineire, nor ease my heart.

344
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.800
The sight of any of thehouse of York

345
00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.270
Is as a fury to torment mysoul;

346
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:39.130
And till I root out theiraccursed line

347
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:43.700
And leave not one alive, Ilive in hell.

348
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.570
Therefore--

349
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.730
O, let me pray before Itake my death!

350
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.870
To thee I pray; sweetClifford, pity me!

351
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.500
Such pity as my rapier'spoint affords.

352
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.000
I never did thee harm: whywilt thou slay me?

353
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.400
Thy father hath.

354
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.330
But 'twas ere I was born.

355
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.230
Thou hast one son; for hissake pity me,

356
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:06.470
Thy father slew my father;therefore, die.

357
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:10.700
Di faciant laudis summasit ista tuae!

358
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:16.500
Plantagenet! I come,Plantagenet!

359
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.470
And this thy son's bloodcleaving to my blade

360
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.800
Shall rust upon my weapon,till thy blood,

361
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.970
Congeal'd with this, domake me wipe off both.

362
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.500
The army of the queen hathgot the field:

363
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.600
My uncles both are slainin rescuing me;

364
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.430
And all my followers tothe eager foe

365
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.870
Turn back and fly, likeships before the wind

366
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:47.100
Or lambs pursued byhunger-starved wolves.

367
00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:53.370
My sons, God knows whathath bechanced them:

368
00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.000
But this I know, they havedemean'd themselves

369
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.230
Like men born to renown bylife or death.

370
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.530
Three times did Richardmake a lane to me.

371
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.270
And thrice cried 'Courage,father! fight it out!'

372
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:08.400
And full as oft cameEdward to my side,

373
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.800
With purple falchion,painted to the hilt

374
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.230
In blood of those that hadencounter'd him:

375
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.070
And when the hardiestwarriors did retire,

376
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.170
and George cried 'Charge! andgive no foot of ground!'

377
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:28.370
Edward.  'A crown, orelse a glorious tomb!

378
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:32.800
A sceptre, or an earthlysepulchre!'

379
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.870
With this, we chargedagain: but, out, alas!

380
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:41.200
We bodged again; as I haveseen a swan

381
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.000
With bootless labour swimagainst the tide

382
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.600
And spend her strengthwith over-matching waves.

383
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.500
(trumpets sound)

384
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:59.030
Ah, hark! the fatalfollowers do pursue;

385
00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:05.030
And I am faint and cannotfly their fury:

386
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:14.470
And were I strong, I wouldnot shun their fury:

387
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:19.000
The sands are number'dthat make up my life;

388
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.900
Here must I stay, and heremy life must end.

389
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.330
Come, bloody Clifford,rough Northumberland,

390
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:52.100
I dare your quenchlessfury to more rage:

391
00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:57.430
I am your butt, and Iabide your shot.

392
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.300
Yield to our mercy, proudPlantagenet.

393
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.130
Ay, to such mercy as hisruthless arm,

394
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.730
With downright payment,show'd unto my father.

395
00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.930
My ashes, like the phoenix,may bring forth

396
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:16.730
A bird that will revengeupon you all:

397
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.600
And in that hope I throwmine eyes to heaven,

398
00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:25.970
Scorning whate'er you canafflict me with.

399
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:31.200
Why come you not? what!multitudes, and fear?

400
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.470
So cowards fight when theycan fly no further;

401
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:40.430
So doves do peck thefalcon's piercing talons;

402
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.800
So desperate thieves, allhopeless of their lives,

403
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.570
Breathe out invectives'gainst the officers.

404
00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:54.770
O Clifford, but bethinkthee once again,

405
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:58.230
And in thy thoughto'er-run my former time;

406
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:02.830
And, if though canst forblushing, view this face,

407
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.270
And bite thy tongue, thatslanders him with cowardice

408
00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.700
Whose frown hath made theefaint and fly ere this!

409
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.970
I will not bandy with theeword for word,

410
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.930
But buckle with theeblows, twice two for one.

411
00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.230
Hold, valiant Clifford!for a thousand causes

412
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.570
I would prolong awhile thetraitor's life.

413
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:22.370
Wrath makes him deaf: speakthou, Northumberland.

414
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:25.430
Hold, Clifford! do nothonour him so much

415
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.730
To prick thy finger,though to wound his heart:

416
00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.870
What valour were it, whena cur doth grin,

417
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:32.070
For one to thrust his handbetween his teeth,

418
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.030
When he might spurn himwith his foot away?

419
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.130
It is war's prize to takeall vantages;

420
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:42.770
And ten to one is noimpeach of valour.

421
00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:06.230
Ay, ay, so strives thewoodcock with the gin.

422
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.970
So doth the cony strugglein the net.

423
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.400
So triumph thieves upontheir conquer'd booty;

424
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.870
So true men yield, withrobbers so o'ermatch'd.

425
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.770
What would your grace havedone unto him now?

426
00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:25.230
Brave warriors, Cliffordand Northumberland,

427
00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:30.130
Come, make him stand uponthis molehill here,

428
00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.700
That raught at mountainswith outstretched arms,

429
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.870
Yet parted but the shadowwith his hand.

430
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.030
(laughing)

431
00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:03.070
What! was it you thatwould be England's king?

432
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.270
Was't you that revell'd inour parliament,

433
00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:10.700
And made a preachment ofyour high descent?

434
00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:15.170
Where are your mess ofsons to back you now?

435
00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.370
The wanton Edward, and thelusty George?

436
00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:24.330
And where's that valiantcrook-back prodigy,

437
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.700
Dicky your boy, that withhis grumbling voice

438
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.830
Was wont to cheer his dadin mutinies?

439
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:37.500
Or, with the rest, whereis your darling Rutland?

440
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:46.830
Look, York: I stain'd thisnapkin with the blood

441
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:50.430
That valiant Clifford,with his rapier's point,

442
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:54.870
Made issue from thebosom of the boy;

443
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:59.630
And if thine eyes canwater for his death,

444
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:05.730
I give thee this to drythy cheeks withal.

445
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:15.530
Alas poor York! but that Ihate thee deadly,

446
00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:20.170
I should lament thymiserable state.

447
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:25.000
I prithee, grieve, to makeme merry, York.

448
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.730
What, hath thy fiery heartso parch'd thine entrails

449
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:34.330
That not a tear can fallfor Rutland's death?

450
00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:39.130
Why art thou patient, man?thou shouldst be mad;

451
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:44.670
And I, to make thee mad,do mock thee thus.

452
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:54.800
Stamp, rave, and fret,that I may sing and dance.

453
00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:01.000
Thou wouldst be fee'd, Isee, to make me sport:

454
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.900
York cannot speak, unlesshe wears a crown.

455
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:17.000
A crown for York! and,lords, bow low to him:

456
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.870
Hold you his hands, whilstI do set it on.

457
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:36.030
Ay, marry, sir, now lookshe like a king!

458
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:42.430
Ay, this is he that tookKing Henry's chair,

459
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:48.000
And this is he was hisadopted heir.

460
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.200
But how is it that greatPlantagenet

461
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.800
Is crown'd so soon, andbroke his solemn oath?

462
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.170
As I bethink me, youshould not be king

463
00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.200
Till our King Henry hadshook hands with death.

464
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.370
And will you pale yourhead in Henry's glory,

465
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:08.470
And rob his temples of thediadem,

466
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:14.130
Now in his life, againstyour holy oath?

467
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:19.400
O, 'tis a fault too toounpardonable!

468
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:26.770
Off with the crown, andwith the crown his head;

469
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:35.970
And, whilst we breathe,take time to do him dead.

470
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.530
That is my office, for myfather's sake.

471
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:45.200
Nay, stay; lets hear theorisons he makes.

472
00:33:53.900 --> 00:34:00.070
She-wolf of France, butworse than wolves of France,

473
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.470
Whose tongue more poisonsthan the adder's tooth!

474
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.970
How ill-beseeming is it inthy sex

475
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.600
To triumph, like anAmazonian trull,

476
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:15.770
Upon their woes whomfortune captivates!

477
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:21.170
But that thy face is,vizard-like, unchanging,

478
00:34:21.170 --> 00:34:23.500
Made impudent with use ofevil deeds,

479
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:29.030
I would assay, proudqueen, to make thee blush.

480
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.070
To tell thee whence thoucamest, of whom derived,

481
00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:37.070
Were shame enough to shamethee, wert thou not shameless.

482
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.430
Thy father bears the typeof King of Naples,

483
00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:45.530
Of both the Sicils andJerusalem,

484
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.070
Yet not so wealthy as anEnglish yeoman.

485
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.570
Hath that poor monarchtaught thee to insult?

486
00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:57.730
'Tis beauty that doth oftmake women proud;

487
00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:02.370
But, God he knows, thyshare thereof is small:

488
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.930
'Tis virtue that doth makethem most admired;

489
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:10.330
The contrary doth makethee wonder'd at:

490
00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.730
'Tis government that makesthem seem divine;

491
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:19.200
The want thereof makesthee abominable:

492
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:25.200
O tiger's heart wrapt in awoman's hide!

493
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.400
How couldst thou drain thelife-blood of the child,

494
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.400
To bid the father wipe hiseyes withal,

495
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.500
And yet be seen to bear awoman's face?

496
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:43.430
Women are soft, mild,pitiful and flexible;

497
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:49.700
Thou stern, obdurate,flinty, rough, remorseless.

498
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:56.600
Bids't thou me rage? why,now thou hast thy wish:

499
00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.300
Wouldst have me weep? why,now thou hast thy will:

500
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.100
For raging wind blows upincessant showers,

501
00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:08.970
And when the rage allays,the rain begins.

502
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:17.200
These tears are my sweetRutland's obsequies:

503
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.400
And every drop criesvengeance for his death,

504
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:28.270
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford,and thee, false Frenchwoman.

505
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:31.770
Beshrew me, but hispassion moves me so

506
00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.430
That hardly can I chequemy eyes from tears.

507
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.900
That face of his thehungry cannibals

508
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.830
Would not have touch'd, wouldnot have stain'd with blood:

509
00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:48.430
But you are more inhuman,more inexorable,

510
00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:54.200
O, ten times more, thantigers of Hyrcania.

511
00:36:54.200 --> 00:37:02.170
See, ruthless queen, ahapless father's tears:

512
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:12.170
This cloth thou dip'dst inblood of my sweet boy,

513
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:19.530
And I with tears do washthe blood away.

514
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:28.830
Keep thou the napkin, andgo boast of this:

515
00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:30.870
And if thou tell'st theheavy story right,

516
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.770
Upon my soul, the hearerswill shed tears;

517
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:40.630
Yea even my foes will shedfast-falling tears,

518
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:47.570
And say 'Alas, it was apiteous deed!'

519
00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:08.100
There, take the crown, and,with the crown, my curse;

520
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.430
And in thy need suchcomfort come to thee

521
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:14.030
As now I reap at thy toocruel hand!

522
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:25.270
Hard-hearted Clifford,take me from the world:

523
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:31.130
My soul to heaven, myblood upon your heads!

524
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:35.500
Had he been slaughter-manto all my kin,

525
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.970
I should not for my lifebut weep with him.

526
00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:43.430
To see how inly sorrowgripes his soul.

527
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:50.070
What, weeping-ripe, myLord Northumberland?

528
00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.830
Think but upon the wronghe did us all,

529
00:38:53.830 --> 00:39:00.500
And that will quickly drythy melting tears.

530
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.900
Here's for my oath, here'sfor my father's death.

531
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.070
And here's to right ourgentle-hearted king.

532
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.430
Open Thy gate of mercy,gracious God!

533
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:34.900
My soul flies through thesewounds to seek out Thee.

534
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.630
Off with his head, and setit on York gates;

535
00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:56.900
That York may overlook thetown of York.

536
00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.900
