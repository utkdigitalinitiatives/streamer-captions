00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.667
(pulsing music)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.125
- [Voiceover] Modern
cuisines are the products

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.999
of endless
reinventions, fusions,

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.000
and explorations
of possibilities,

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:42.667
of traditional dishes
from varying cultures

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:45.667
and periods in history.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:48.417
These traditional dishes are
primarily made from grains.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.333
One ancient grain
that remains relevant

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.208
up to this day is bulgur.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.000
Bulgur is called by many names

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.917
depending on the
country of your origin.

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:07.333
In Turkey it's
known as "bulgar",

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.583
"burgal, or "burghoul".

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.999
In Saudi Arabia it's
"burghul" or "borgal".

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:16.917
In Greece it's "pourgouri".

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.999
And in the Bible
it's called "arisah".

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.458
But like how a rose by any
other name would smell as sweet,

00:01:23.625 --> 00:01:27.417
bulgur by any other
name would be as great.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:31.208
Bulgur is made from
different groats or berries

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.208
of several species of wheat.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:36.875
But it's typically made from
the specie called durum,

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.291
scientific name Triticum durum.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:43.000
Durum is believed to be a
result of artificial breeding

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:47.542
of another ancient
domesticated specie of wheat

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.709
called emmer, grown
in Central Europe

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:53.875
and in the Near East in 7000 BC.

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.041
There were
archaeological findings

00:01:57.834 --> 00:01:59.917
indicating that the
immediate regions

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:01.999
surrounding the Tigris
and Euphrates Rivers

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:05.125
were the first places to
process durum wheat into bulgur.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.458
In Latin, "durum" means "hard",

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.709
which is appropriate
because it is the hardest,

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.250
and one of the widely
produced species

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:18.250
of wheat in the world.

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:20.375
What differentiates bulgur
from other wheat species?

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:25.250
Bulgur is already cooked.

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:28.834
Wheat kernels are
soaked, boiled, dried,

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.667
and then cracked to make bulgur.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.166
Some actually say
that it is the world's

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:38.000
first processed food,

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.999
because this method
of preparing bulgur

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:42.959
is believed to have originated

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.583
in the Mediterranean region
during the early times.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.041
There are also claims
that early Arab,

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:51.875
Israeli,

00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:53.417
Egyptian,

00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.675
and Roman civilizations
were already eating

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:58.999
dried cooked bulgur
around 1000 BC.

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.500
The Bible also has indications
of ancient Babylonians,

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:09.834
Hittites, and Hebrews
preparing bulgur

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:12.917
4000 years ago.

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:14.750
Three basic steps to
follow in making bulgur.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.625
Number one, clean and then soak
the wheat kernels in water,

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:23.208
followed by exposing them to
heat to dissolve the starch.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:27.125
Number two, dry
the grains and then

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:30.291
slightly moisten them
to remove the bran.

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:33.417
Dry again before cleaning
them by winnowing.

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.999
And number three, grind
and sieve the grains

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:40.041
into three or four grades.

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:42.417
Coarse, fine, and very fine.

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:45.542
Coarse bulgur is
usually used as stuffing

00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:48.999
for casseroles, pilafs,
soups, and salads.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.834
Fine bulgur is the
all-purpose grade,

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.500
used in salads, stews, soups,

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:59.750
mulit-grain baked goods,

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:01.917
and used as a protein substitute

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.999
for foods like meatless burgers.

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.750
It's widely used in popular
Middle Eastern dishes

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:09.999
such as tabbouleh and kibbeh.

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.999
Very fine bulgur is made
into breakfast cereals,

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:17.375
breads, and used as
a rice substitute.

00:04:17.542 --> 00:04:20.417
Because the grain's
starch is gelatinized

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.999
and the kernels are
semi-cooked during the process,

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:25.999
bulgur gets a longer shelf
life compared to other wheat,

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:30.500
specially in hot and
humid environments.

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:33.166
Bulgur remains to
be a staple grain

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.291
in many parts of the Middle East

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:38.250
like Turkey, Syria, Jordan,

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:40.999
Lebanon, and Egypt.

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.375
Grains from early
times, like bulgur,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.625
will continue to prove
that its ancient properties

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:50.583
can easily pick up on
modern culinary techniques

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.125
and provide modern man with
new and exciting dishes.

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:58.542
Cereal grains are
characterized by

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:31.667
significant amounts of protein,

00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:33.834
carbohydrates, and fiber.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.041
These nutrients remain essential

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:38.250
for man to attain and
maintain optimum health.

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:42.125
Bulgur is practically a
product of processed wheat.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:58.999
That's why they share a
similar nutrient profile.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.667
100g of cooked bulgur

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.417
contains the following
nutrients, vitamins,
and minerals.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:14.458
Carbohydrates, 18.6g.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.375
Protein, 3.1g.

00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:21.959
Dietary fiber, 4.5g.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:25.999
Vitamin B6, 0.08mg.

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:29.917
Folate, 18 micrograms.

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:33.000
Pantothenic acid, 0.34mg.

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:36.625
Calcium, 10mg.

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:39.625
Iron, 0.96mg.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:43.667
Magnesium, 32mg.

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:46.667
Phosphorus, 40mg.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:49.999
Sodium, 5mg.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:53.917
Manganese, 0.61mg.

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:57.041
And zinc, 0.57mg.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.709
Bulgur's fiber is comparable
to that of whole wheat's.

00:07:02.709 --> 00:07:06.250
It aids in flushing toxins
out of the digestive system,

00:07:08.041 --> 00:07:11.834
thus preventing the development
of cancerous particles.

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.542
It can also effectively
aid in weight loss.

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:20.125
100g of cooked bulgur
only has 83 calories

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:24.458
and it can easily make
someone feel full,

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.792
thus curbing cravings
and preventing
excessive food intake.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.999
Bulgur consumption
also boosts metabolism,

00:07:32.792 --> 00:07:35.999
immunity, and overall
physical vitality.

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:39.458
Because of its iron content,

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:41.999
the body is able to produce
adequate levels of hemoglobin

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:45.999
to efficiently transport
oxygen throughout the body

00:07:46.041 --> 00:07:49.709
for faster conversion
of foods into the energy

00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:52.750
the body needs to perform
physical activities.

00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:56.208
The interaction between
the calcium, manganese,

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:00.999
and phosphorus in bulgur

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:03.000
leads to healthier
tissues and bones.

00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:06.375
Calcium also aids in
regulating blood pressure,

00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:10.999
specially in men.

00:08:11.041 --> 00:08:12.375
And in women, high calcium
intake helps relieve

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:15.667
symptoms of
pre-menstrual syndrome

00:08:15.834 --> 00:08:18.000
such as mood, behavior,
pain, and water retention.

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:22.375
Bulgur's vitamin
B composition, B6,

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:27.041
pantothenic acid or B5,

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.667
and folate or B9,
does not only benefit

00:08:29.834 --> 00:08:33.083
a regular person's
metabolic process,

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.999
it can also supplement
a pregnant woman's

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:38.417
folic acid levels.

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.125
In some countries where
rice is a staple food,

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:46.250
many are starting to
shift from white rice

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:49.375
to either red or brown
rice for health reasons.

00:08:49.542 --> 00:08:52.834
Bulgur is a great
alternative to brown rice.

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:56.709
Actually, its nutrient profile
reads better than brown rice.

00:08:56.875 --> 00:09:00.999
Here's how one cup of bulgur

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:03.834
fares against one
cup of brown rice.

00:09:03.999 --> 00:09:06.750
Brown rice has 216 calories,

00:09:07.375 --> 00:09:10.583
while bulgur only has 151.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.792
Brown rice has 1.8g of fat,

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:17.834
while bulgur only has 0.44.

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.999
Brown rice has 3.5g of fiber,

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:24.917
while bulgur has 8.21.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.542
Brown rice has 7.8
micrograms of folate,

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:31.999
while bulgur has 32.8.

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:34.959
Wheat and rice are undeniably
more popular than bulgur.

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:46.000
But as an even better
alternative to brown rice,

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:49.125
there's a huge
possibility that bulgur

00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:52.625
can attract a niche in
a rice-dominated market.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:56.125
One thing that
grains such as wheat,

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:33.583
quinoa,

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:35.250
maize,

00:10:36.417 --> 00:10:37.250
bulgur,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:39.542
and others have in common

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:41.999
is the equal opportunity
to stand witness

00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:44.917
as man makes history,
good and bad.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:48.542
As far as 300 years ago,

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:54.999
bulgur was already a
part of man's economy.

00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:58.999
Manuscripts from an
Assyrian monastery

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:04.375
Mor Mattai in Iraq

00:11:04.542 --> 00:11:06.709
cited a few references on bulgur

00:11:06.875 --> 00:11:09.291
being used as a form
of money by the monks.

00:11:09.458 --> 00:11:12.999
The monks grew their own wheat

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:15.542
in the lands owned
by the monastery,

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:18.041
and they processed
their own bulgur.

00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:20.667
That's why they would have
stocks in large quantities.

00:11:20.834 --> 00:11:24.208
Plus, monasteries that
time were also used

00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:28.875
as inns and refuge,

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:30.999
so the monks also served
their guests with meals

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.333
made from bulgur.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.208
Before the 19th century,

00:11:40.583 --> 00:11:42.792
bulgur was primarily homemade

00:11:42.959 --> 00:11:45.709
in quantities enough
to feed a family.

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:48.834
But World War I
necessitated the industrial

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:52.166
and commercial
production of bulgur.

00:11:52.333 --> 00:11:54.875
A province in Antolia
called Karaman

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.999
produced bulgur that
was used as food rations

00:11:59.041 --> 00:12:02.291
for the Ottoman army.

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:04.083
Many believe that bulgur
was brought to France

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:09.125
by the survivors of
the Armenian genocide.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:12.875
French cuisine was
foreign to them,

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:19.291
so even in exile they continued
to prepare and eat bulgur,

00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:23.834
alleviating their
homesickness as well.

00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:26.999
Later on the French were
introduced to bulgur,

00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:36.999
and it was eventually
incorporated into their diet.

00:12:36.999 --> 00:12:40.542
Today in the postwar era,

00:12:43.375 --> 00:12:45.583
adding to bulgur's role
in the Armenian cuisine

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.999
is its symbolic participation

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:51.083
in an Armenian ceremony
called "madagh",

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.834
a requiem service
conducted to commemorate

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:58.750
and remember the victims
of the Armenian genocide.

00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:01.917
During the annual ceremony,

00:13:02.709 --> 00:13:04.750
families and descendants
of the victims

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.959
would come together and
make food offerings,

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:10.208
which always include lamb stew
with pilaf made from bulgur.

00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:14.417
Madagh is still popular
among Armenian communities

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:18.875
in New York, Wisconsin,
and Illinois.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.999
Turkey produces approximately
one million tons

00:13:25.709 --> 00:13:28.792
of bulgur every year, which
is why the Turkish people

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:32.999
were never forced to
stop making one of their

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.250
oldest fermented
drinks called "boza",

00:13:35.417 --> 00:13:38.417
made from bulgur, water, sugar,

00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:41.625
roasted chickpeas, and cinnamon.

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:44.208
It's commonly drunk
during winter.

00:13:44.375 --> 00:13:46.667
In the 17th century
alcohol, including boza,

00:13:47.208 --> 00:13:50.999
was banned by Sultan Mehmed IV

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:53.999
and it was only in
the 19th century

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.125
when a non-alcoholic
version from Albania

00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:59.375
revived boza's popularity.

00:13:59.542 --> 00:14:02.125
This non-alcoholic version
continues to be sold

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.667
in Turkey as well as
in Bosnia, Bulgaria,

00:14:06.834 --> 00:14:10.709
Kazakhstan,
Kyrgystan, Lithuania,

00:14:10.875 --> 00:14:14.999
Macedonia, Poland, and Ukraine.

00:14:14.999 --> 00:14:18.583
It is said that in order
for man to move forward

00:14:28.458 --> 00:14:31.750
he must look at his
past and learn from it.

00:14:31.917 --> 00:14:34.959
The benefits and uses of bulgur

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.000
are something man
should take with him

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:01.083
as he journeys
towards the future.

00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:04.333
In World War I bulgur
was mass-produced

00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:26.000
to feed the soldiers
of the Ottoman army.

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:28.999
Then in World War II, aside
from being a food ration,

00:15:29.083 --> 00:15:33.709
bulgur was also used
as a blasting agent

00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:36.999
to clean airplane parts due
to its exfoliating properties.

00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:41.291
Today and in other countries,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.291
bulgur is more than
just a food ration.

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:48.500
It's made and used
in pilafs, soups,

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:51.917
baked goods, or as stuffing.

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:54.208
"Dahlia", or what bulgur
is called in India,

00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:57.291
is eaten as a cereal
with milk and sugar

00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:00.208
and is typically given
to recuperating people.

00:16:00.375 --> 00:16:03.375
Since bulgur and
pasta both come from

00:16:03.999 --> 00:16:06.917
the processed
wheat specie durum,

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:09.458
bulgur is a popular
pasta substitute

00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:12.333
in the United States.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.250
Today Turkey is the
largest producer

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.999
and exporter of
bulgur in the world,

00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:21.166
with 91,940 tons in 2008.

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:25.625
Bulgur has come a long way,

00:16:28.417 --> 00:16:30.999
from being processed in
small households in the past,

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:34.417
into state of the art
facilities today in Turkey.

00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:38.250
When people from the Middle East

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:42.999
migrated to the United
States, so did bulgur.

00:16:42.999 --> 00:16:46.875
And so research was
done to determine

00:16:47.667 --> 00:16:49.999
the nutritional
value of the grain.

00:16:50.083 --> 00:16:52.458
Eventually it was
recognized as a whole grain

00:16:52.625 --> 00:16:55.667
by the United States
Department of Agriculture,

00:16:55.834 --> 00:16:58.625
or USDA, and the
Whole Grains Council.

00:16:58.792 --> 00:17:02.208
Bulgur found its place and role

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:05.458
in the modern world in 1965,

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:08.792
when it became an official
emergency food contingency

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:12.291
in fallout shelters by the USDA.

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:15.250
Also because of bulgur's
excellent nutrient profile,

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:20.750
it became a part of the
Food for Peace program

00:17:20.917 --> 00:17:23.834
of the United States Agency
for International Development,

00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:27.500
or USAID.

00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:28.792
Based on USAID's
programming guidelines,

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.250
bulgur can be served in
areas where wheat is staple,

00:17:32.417 --> 00:17:36.417
such as the Middle
East and Asia,

00:17:36.583 --> 00:17:38.583
during both emergency
and development settings.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:42.000
The USAID fortified bulgur

00:17:42.834 --> 00:17:45.041
living micronutrient premix

00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:47.208
containing iron, zinc,

00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:49.083
and vitamins A, B1, B2,

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.834
B3, B6, B9,

00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:56.625
B12, and D3,

00:17:56.792 --> 00:17:59.291
resulting in a more ideal
food ration package,

00:17:59.458 --> 00:18:02.875
specially during calamity
relief operations.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:06.125
Here's a comparison
of nutrients,

00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:09.500
minerals, and vitamins

00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:11.750
between 100g of regular bulgur

00:18:11.917 --> 00:18:14.125
and 100g of USAID's
fortified bulgur.

00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:18.291
Regular bulgur has
18.6g carbohydrates,

00:18:19.917 --> 00:18:24.166
3.1g protein,

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:26.917
4.5g dietary fiber,

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:29.999
32mg magnesium,

00:18:30.125 --> 00:18:32.709
40mg phosphorus,

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:35.041
5mg sodium,

00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:37.375
0.57mg zinc,

00:18:37.542 --> 00:18:40.125
0.08mg vitamin B6,

00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:43.417
and 18 micrograms folate.

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:46.250
Now the fortified bulgur
premix of the USAID.

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:50.750
It has 75.87g carbohydrates,

00:18:51.208 --> 00:18:54.999
12.29g protein,

00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:57.999
18.3g dietary fiber,

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.792
164mg magnesium,

00:19:01.959 --> 00:19:05.041
300mg phosphorus,

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:08.083
17mg sodium,

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.917
4.33mg zinc,

00:19:10.999 --> 00:19:14.041
0.74 vitamin B6,

00:19:14.208 --> 00:19:17.875
and 181 micrograms of folate.

00:19:17.999 --> 00:19:21.166
The fact that bulgur is
chosen as a perfect food

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:40.542
to nourish people during times

00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:42.458
when their nutrition
is highly compromised

00:19:42.625 --> 00:19:44.999
only attests to this
grain's already inherent

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:48.125
exceptional
properties and value.

00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:50.999
Through fortification efforts,
it will not be surprising

00:19:51.583 --> 00:19:55.458
if bulgur surpasses
the superfood level

00:19:55.625 --> 00:19:59.250
and starts a totally new

00:19:59.417 --> 00:20:01.083
and more superior food category.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.875
Most bulgur today,
specially the kind

00:20:17.834 --> 00:20:20.208
that is exported
around the world,

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:22.625
is processed using
modern facilities.

00:20:22.792 --> 00:20:26.166
But the ancient method lives on

00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:28.417
in some small villages
in Eastern Mediterranean.

00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:31.834
Since bulgur is already
partially cooked,

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:35.999
it enjoys a longer shelf life

00:20:36.125 --> 00:20:38.458
and preparation is much simpler
compared to other grains.

00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:42.667
It's like instant cereal,

00:20:43.166 --> 00:20:44.999
because you can just
pour boiling water,

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:47.709
soak it for 30 to 40 minutes,

00:20:47.875 --> 00:20:49.959
drain it, and then voilà.

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.250
You now have a bulgur pilaf.

00:20:52.417 --> 00:20:55.041
Bulgur absorbs water, expands,

00:20:55.208 --> 00:20:58.000
and doubles, even
triples in volume

00:20:58.166 --> 00:21:00.999
so make sure you use big pots.

00:21:01.041 --> 00:21:03.999
Here are some recipe
ideas for you to try.

00:21:04.792 --> 00:21:07.917
Vegan bulgur pilaf
with mushrooms.

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.583
For this recipe you will need

00:21:11.208 --> 00:21:13.083
one and one half cups
of uncooked bulgur,

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.291
three cups of water,

00:21:16.458 --> 00:21:18.166
three tablespoons of
butter or vegan margarine,

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:21.500
two cups sliced mushrooms,

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:23.834
one bunch of chopped
green onions,

00:21:24.542 --> 00:21:27.333
one medium chopped
red bell pepper,

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.250
two tablespoons of lime juice,

00:21:30.417 --> 00:21:32.959
three tablespoons
of dry white wine,

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:35.667
one quarter cup of
chopped fresh parsley,

00:21:35.834 --> 00:21:38.458
one tablespoon of dried basil,

00:21:38.999 --> 00:21:41.625
and one teaspoon each
of salt and pepper.

00:21:41.792 --> 00:21:44.750
Start by cooking the
bulgur in a pot of water

00:21:45.166 --> 00:21:48.375
for five minutes.

00:21:48.542 --> 00:21:50.000
Remove the pot from the heat,

00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:51.999
but let it stand for
five more minutes

00:21:52.041 --> 00:21:54.583
so the bulgur can start
absorbing water, then drain.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.500
In a large skillet
over medium heat

00:21:58.999 --> 00:22:01.458
melt the butter and
sauté the mushrooms,

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:04.000
onions, and peppers.

00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:06.041
Once the onions are translucent,

00:22:06.709 --> 00:22:08.542
remove the skillet
from the heat.

00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:10.959
Then add the lemon
juice, wine, parsley,

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:14.083
basil, salt, and pepper.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.834
Mix with bulgur and serve.

00:22:16.999 --> 00:22:19.542
Another must-try recipe

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.750
is sprouts and
bulgur sandwiches.

00:22:22.917 --> 00:22:25.417
Prepare the following.

00:22:25.583 --> 00:22:26.999
One half cup of fine bulgur,

00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:29.375
one cup of water,

00:22:29.999 --> 00:22:31.417
226.8g low fat yogurt,

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:35.667
one quarter of a cup of
fat-free salad dressing,

00:22:36.291 --> 00:22:39.834
one and one half
teaspoons of curry powder,

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:42.917
one cup of shredded carrots,

00:22:42.999 --> 00:22:45.166
one half cup of chopped apple,

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:47.917
one third cup of
coarsely chopped peanuts,

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:51.125
two cups of fresh bean sprouts,

00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:53.999
and eight very thin slices
of toasted wheat bread.

00:22:53.999 --> 00:22:57.917
First, thoroughly rinse
bulgur under cold water,

00:22:58.999 --> 00:23:02.999
then stir in the bulgur in a pot

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:04.999
of one cup of boiling water.

00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:07.625
Remove from heat.

00:23:07.792 --> 00:23:09.000
Let it stand uncovered
for 20 minutes,

00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:11.917
before draining and
squeezing excess water.

00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:14.999
Second, in a bowl combine
yogurt, salad dressing,

00:23:15.667 --> 00:23:19.125
or mayonnaise and curry powder.

00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:21.959
Stir until everything
is evenly incorporated.

00:23:22.542 --> 00:23:25.709
Third, put the bulgur, carrots,

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.999
apple and peanuts in
the yogurt mixture.

00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:32.458
Mix, cover, and then
refrigerate until serving time.

00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:37.375
To serve, divide and
arrange the sprouts

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:41.208
on four wheat toasts.

00:23:41.375 --> 00:23:43.500
Scoop and spread bulgur mixture,

00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:45.999
and then top with the
rest of the wheat toasts.

00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:48.750
You can still enjoy bulgur using

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.999
traditional tabbouleh recipes.

00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:54.709
But in today's evolving cuisines

00:23:54.875 --> 00:23:57.000
and growing anticipation
for new food ideas,

00:23:57.166 --> 00:24:00.583
utilizing bulgur in your
gastronomic adventures

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.125
is truly a must.
