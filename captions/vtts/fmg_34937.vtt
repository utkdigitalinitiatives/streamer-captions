WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
* ...THAT YOU CAN'T SEE. *

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
IT MAKES US UNIQUELY HUMAN.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I WAS JUST DOING HIS
UNIVERSAL HEARING SCREEN.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
 A CHILD HAS PROBLEMS?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
UH-OH!  GRACE!
* LA, LA, LA, LA *

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
CAN YOU SAY  HEAVY ?
HEAVY.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
TODAY WE'LL HELP
 WITH LANGUAGE DELAYS...

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
WE'RE REALLY PART
OF AN ORGANIZATION
THAT'S MEANT FOR KIDS.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
AND NEW FINDINGS ABOUT
 HOW KIDS REALLY LEARN.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
WE HAVE TO USE
TRICKY METHODS.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
HER MIND GETS WAY AHEAD
OF HER CAPACITY TO
PUT SPEECH TOGETHER.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Narrator:
 BRAZELTON ON PARENTING.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
SPEECH AND LANGUAGE--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
THEY'RE PART OF OUR
SPECIAL CAPACITIES,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
MARKING US AS UNIQUELY HUMAN.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
THEIR DEVELOPMENT
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
A COMPELLING TOPIC

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
FOR PARENT
AND SCIENTIST ALIKE.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
BUT TODAY, NEW STRIDES
ARE BEING MADE

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
IN UNDERSTANDING
LANGUAGE AND SPEECH,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
REVEALING EXCITING INSIGHTS
INTO HOW AND HOW EARLY

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
A CHILD LEARNS
TO COMMUNICATE.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
JOIN ME NOW IN A FASCINATING
JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
THE PLACE--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S
 MEDICAL CENTER.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
CHERYL ARCHER IS
 THE TEAM LEADER FOR
 SPEECH AND LANGUAGE CARE.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
THE SPECIAL THING ABOUT THIS
CENTER IS THAT WE'RE REALLY

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
PART OF AN ORGANIZATION
THAT'S MEANT FOR KIDS.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
WE'RE A COMPREHENSIVE
 HOSPITAL,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
AND WE ARE COMPLETELY
 KID-ORIENTED.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I WAS JUST DOING
HIS UNIVERSAL
HEARING SCREEN HERE.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
WE TEST EVERY BABY.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Brazelton:
 SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THAT
 EARLY DETECTION IS CRITICAL.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
FIRST I HAVE TO STICK THESE
LITTLE EARMUFFS ON HIM.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
THIS IS WHAT HELPS READ
THROUGH THE COMPUTER.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Archer:
 CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT
 SCREENED AT BIRTH

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
MIGHT NOT HAVE THEIR
HEARING LOSS DETECTED

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
UNTIL TWO YEARS OF AGE.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
HE'LL HEAR SOFT-
AND HIGH-PITCHED NOISES

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
RIGHT INTO HIS EARS,
 AND THEN THOSE SENSORS

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
ON HIS FACE AND ON HIS NECK
CAN TELL IF HE IS
RESPONDING TO THEM.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Archer:
 SO WE WANT TO DETECT
 A HEARING LOSS

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
 AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
ANY DELAYS
 IN DEVELOPMENT.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Brazelton:
 HEARING AND SPEECH PROBLEMS
 ARE OFTEN INTERRELATED.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
UH-OH!  GRACE!
* LA, LA, LA, LA *
PEEK-A-BOO!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
THAT'S WHY HEARING TESTS

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
ARE PRIMARY
 DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I'M STILL OVER HERE!
 GOOD JOB!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
EVEN SIMPLE THINGS
 LIKE EAR INFECTIONS
 CAN CAUSE SPEECH DELAYS.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
OH, NO!
PEEK-A-BOO!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Rita Daves:
 MANY OF THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE
 DIFFICULTIES WITH ORAL MOTOR

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
HAVE DIFFICULTIES MAKING
A VARIETY OF SOUNDS,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
WHICH THEN CAUSE THEM
TO HAVE DIFFICULTY

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
IMITATING OR MAKING WORDS.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
PARENTS DON'T UNDERSTAND.
FOR EXAMPLE, A CHILD
MIGHT SAY  UH,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
AND IT MIGHT BE  CUP.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
AND MANY TIMES, THE REASON
THEY CAN'T SAY THAT

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
IS BECAUSE THEIR MOUTH
ISN'T WORKING THE WAY
THEY WANT IT TO WORK.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Brazelton:
 OR IT CAN BE SOMETHING
 MORE ORGANIC

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
- TO SPEECH PRODUCTION.
-HELLO!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Daves:
 THE EARLIER WE WORK WITH THEM,
 THE EASIER IT IS

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
TO FIX OR
 TO HELP THE FAMILIES.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
MOMMY COMES
WITH YOU, HUH?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
MOMMY COMES WITH YOU
EVERY DAY.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Archer:
 PARENTS ARE AFRAID THAT
 THEIR CHILDREN WON'T BE ABLE

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
TO PLAY WITH OTHER KIDS
 OR SUCCEED IN SCHOOL,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
- DO YOU HEAR IT? GOOD!
- YEAH.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE
 THAT THEY'RE DOING
 EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Brazelton:
 IT'S REALLY CRITICAL
 TO DO SO.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
HE WON'T EAT IT
UNLESS YOU TELL HIM
WHAT IT IS.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
-IT'S A BOAT.
- THE THERAPISTS HERE
  USE TECHNIQUES

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
DESIGNED ESPECIALLY
 FOR KIDS.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
- SAY,  EAT BOAT. 
- EAT BOAT.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
AAH!  HE ATE
YOUR HEAD!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
AND NOT JUST IN
 A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Daves:
 IN THEIR HOME, YOU CAN SEE
 THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
IN HIS LIFE OR HER LIFE,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
AND YOU CAN WORK THAT WAY,
AND INTO THEIR LIFE.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
IT BECOMES MORE
NATURAL FOR THEM,
AND THEY LEARN IT QUICKER.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
THE OTHER IMPORTANT FACTOR
IS THAT

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
YOU CAN TEACH
THE FAMILY MEMBERS
RIGHT ON THE SPOT.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Brazelton:
 THE BOLANDS ARE
 A PERFECT EXAMPLE.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
WE WERE MARRIED
11 YEARS AGO,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
AND WE HAD JUSTIN FIVE YEARS
INTO OUR MARRIAGE,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
AND CHANDLER CAME ALONG ABOUT
 THREE AND A HALF YEARS AFTER.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
IT'S HEAVY.
CAN YOU SAY  HEAVY ?
HEAVY!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Brazelton:
 JODI AND MICHAEL
 NOTICED PROBLEMS EARLY.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
- Jodi Boland: HE WOULD
  SAY ABOUT FOUR THINGS.
-HIS COMPREHENSION WAS THERE.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
HE UNDERSTOOD YOU
WHEN YOU WOULD SAY TO HIM,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
CHANDLER, GO OVER HERE 
OR  MOVE THIS 
OR  DO SOMETHING.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
HE WOULD DO IT,
BUT HE COULDN'T
COMMUNICATE BACK.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
HE WOULD ALWAYS BE, LIKE,
 BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
THAT REALLY PUT A LIGHT ON
IN MY HEAD.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
MY DOCTOR HAD GIVEN US
AN 800 NUMBER THAT YOU CALL.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
SO I CALLED THE 800 NUMBER...

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
- LOOK WHO'S HERE!
- ...AND RITA CAME ALONG
  TO OUR HOUSE.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
- CHANDLER WAS
  REFERRED AT 22 MONTHS.
-HI, CHANDLER. GOOD WAVING.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
- SAY,  HI, RITA. 
- HI!

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Rita:
 AND HE HAD SOME
 ORAL MOTOR ISSUES.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I COULD TELL BY LOOKING AT HIM.
 AND I EXPLAINED THAT
 TO MOM RIGHT AWAY

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
WHEN WE DETERMINED
 THAT HE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE
 FOR SERVICES.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
- ( babbling )
- WE CAN GO INSIDE. DO YOU
  WANT TO PLAY WITH THE TOYS?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
- WHO IS THAT?
- ( exclaims )

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
- THAT'S DIPSY.
-  DIPPY.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
VERY NICE,
USING YOUR SOUNDS.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Brazelton:
 RITA'S NOT ONLY
 A GREAT THERAPIST,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
SHE'S A MARVEL
 AT MOTIVATION.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
RITA COMES TO OUR HOUSE
WITH A WHOLE ARRAY
OF NEW TOYS.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
AND THEN HE WANTS TO SIT DOWN
RIGHT AWAY AND,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
LET'S SEE WHAT'S
IN YOUR BOX,  AND--

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
AND FOR HIM IT'S JUST--
 I THINK IN HIS MIND--

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I COULD BE WRONG,
 BUT I THINK FOR HIM,
 IT'S JUST AN HOUR OF PLAY.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
CHANDLER DOES
A MUCH BETTER JOB

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
USING HIS LANGUAGE
TO COMMENT ON THE TOYS

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
RATHER THEN ACTUALLY
 USING THE WORDS
 TO ASK FOR THINGS.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Rita:
 A TWO-YEAR-OLD'S
 MOST NATURAL ACTIVITY IS PLAY,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
AND IT'S EASIER
 FOR A CHILD TO LEARN

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
AND TO TALK TO THE TOYS
 AND TELL THEM WHAT TO DO

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
THAN IT IS
TO ACTUALLY TELL

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
THEIR MOTHER OR FATHER
OR THEIR BROTHER OR SISTER.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
LOOK AT WHO I FOUND.
WHO'S THAT?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
- MEOW.
- MEOW-- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
WE'LL WORK WITH
 ANIMAL SOUNDS AND CARS

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
AND JUST THE TYPICAL
 TWO-YEAR-OLD TYPES OF TOYS
 THAT THEY ENJOY.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
AND THEN I WORK ON SOME
ORAL-MOTOR COMPONENTS.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
AND THIS IS DESIGNED
TO HELP INCREASE
THE TONE IN HIS MOUTH

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
SO THAT HE CAN MOVE
HIS TONGUE MORE FLUIDLY
WHEN HE MAKES SPEECH SOUNDS.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Brazelton:
 THE CHILD-ORIENTED TECHNIQUES
 ARE INGENIOUS.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
MOST OFTEN,
WE'RE WORKING ON TONGUE

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
AND WE'RE WORKING ON
LIP MOVEMENT.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
AND GENERALLY BY DOING THAT,
WE WORK THROUGH FEEDING
AND BLOWING ACTIVITIES.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
WOW! LOOK AT
THAT LITTLE BUBBLE!

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
POP! POP!

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
THIS IS CALLED
A FIVE-POINT BITE.
BITE! GOOD BOY.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Brazelton:
 EVERY EXERCISE
 HAS A PURPOSE.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
IF YOU HAVE HIM
BITE SOMETHING--

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
LIKE THIS--
BITE--

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
HIS TONGUE WILL FOLLOW
YOU AUTOMATICALLY.
IT'S REFLEXIVE.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
- THAT GETS THAT TONGUE MOVING
  AGAIN FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
- OKAY.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
ONCE HE CAN DO THAT
MORE EFFICIENTLY

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
IS WHEN WE ARE GONNA GET
BETTER TONGUE ELEVATION,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
AND THAT'S WHEN
WE GET THOSE SOUNDS--
THOSE  T's

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
AND THOSE "D's"
AND THOSE "N's.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Brazelto
 ONCE AGAIN,
 EARLY INTERVENTION

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
IS THE KEY.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
WITHOUT THE THERAPY,
CHANDLER WOULD PROBABLY
HAVE BECOME VERY FRUSTRATED.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
- HEY, CHANDLER.
- YEAH?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
- DID RITA COME TODAY?
- YEP.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Rita:
 BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T BE
 UNDERSTOOD BY HIS FAMILY,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
AND THEN THERE WOULD'VE BEEN
 A SITUATION THAT COULD HAVE
 DEVELOPED BEHAVIORALLY.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
AND I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY
IF YOU EVEN HAVE A QUESTION

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
IF YOU THINK YOUR CHILD HAS
A COMMUNICATION PROBLEM

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
IS TO DEFINITELY CALL
AND GET HELP.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
CAN I SEE?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
- OH, VERY NICE. EXCELLENT.
- VERY GOOD!

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Jodi:
 IT'S ALMOST LIKE
 A BLOSSOM HAS OPENED

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
FROM WHEN
 HE WAS A SMALL, LITTLE BUD.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
- NOT REALLY SURE IF HE
   WAS DEVELOPING PROPERLY,
 - HERE YOU GO.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
BUT NOW HE'S JUST BLOSSOMED
 INTO THIS BEAUTIFUL FLOWER.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
FAST BREAK.
YAY!

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
WITH US TODAY
IS CRYSTAL HOLMES,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM I.B.M.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
CRYSTAL, ARE THERE
THINGS ON THE INTERNET
THAT WOULD HELP PARENTS

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
WHO ARE WORRIED
ABOUT THEIR CHILD'S
SPEECH DEVELOPMENT?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD
SITES, BERRY, THAT PROVIDE
INFORMATION FOR PARENTS.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
WHY DON'T WE GO
 TO ONE OF THE SITES
 AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
HERE WE'RE AT THE PAMPERS
 PARENTING INSTITUTE,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
AND IF WE DO A SEARCH
 ON DEVELOPMENT,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
LET'S SEE IF
 WE CAN FIND ANYTHING
 SPECIFIC TO LANGUAGE.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
THERE'S AN ARTICLE
 ON YOUR BABY'S
 SIGHT AND HEARING.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
IF WE CLICK ON THAT ARTICLE,
 WE CAN SEE THAT IT SHOWS US

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
THAT A BABY'S SPEECH

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
AND THEIR HEARING
 ARE LINKED.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
NOW, WE MAY HAVE
 VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
ABOUT LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
MAYBE WE NEED A HEALTH-CARE
 PROFESSIONAL, AND WE DON'T
 KNOW WHERE TO FIND ONE.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
WE CAN DO A SEARCH
 ON LANGUAGE.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
LET'S SEE WHAT
 WE COME UP WITH.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
THE FIRST HIT IS
 THE AMERICAN SPEECH LANGUAGE
 HEARING ASSOCIATION.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
WE CAN GO TO THIS SITE
 AND SEE WHAT RESOURCES
 THEY HAVE AVAILABLE.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY TALK
 ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE
 INFORMATION REGARDING
 HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
THIS SITE IS GREAT
 IF YOU NEED TO FIND

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
A SPEECH-LANGUAGE
 PATHOLOGIST OR AUDIOLOGIST.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
THE INTERNET IS
A WONDERFUL RESOURCE
FOR PARENTS

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
TO DO SELF-EDUCATION
OR TO ACTUALLY FIND
RESOURCES TO HELP THEM,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
REGARDLESS OF WHAT
THE NEED MAY BE.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I'M SO GLAD THERE'S THIS KIND
OF HELP FOR PARENTS,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
'CAUSE THEY WORRY A LOT
ABOUT IT, AND THEY SHOULD.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
A CHILD WHO CAN'T
COMMUNICATE

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
IS ALREADY
A HANDICAPPED CHILD.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
OUR INTERNET QUESTION TODAY

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
COMES FROM ALEX
IN BEAUMONT, TEXAS.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
HIS QUESTION IS:

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
WELL, IT'S EARLY
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO BE SURE THAT HER HEARING
IS OKAY AND SO FORTH

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR PHYSICIAN
OR YOUR NURSE PRACTITIONER.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
BUT YOU KNOW, THERE ARE WAYS
TO TELL FOR YOU AS A PARENT,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
AND THAT IS, DOES SHE HAVE
RECEPTIVE SPEECH?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
DOES SHE UNDERSTAND WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING WHEN YOU
ASK HER TO DO SOMETHING?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
CAN SHE COMMUNICATE
BEHAVIORALLY?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
DOES SHE LET YOU KNOW
BEHAVIORALLY THAT
SHE UNDERSTANDS YOU

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
AND THAT YOU CAN
UNDERSTAND HER GESTURES?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
THOSE ARE WAYS
TO MARK SPEECH.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
BY TWO, I WOULD BE WORRIED
IF HER SPEECH HASN'T DEVELOPED,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
AND THAT'S THE TIME TO LOOK
FOR A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
WHO UNDERSTANDS
SMALL CHILDREN.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
SO I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
LANGUAGE AND SPEECH
DEVELOP IN STAGES

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
OVER THE FIRST FEW YEARS.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I'M JOINED TODAY BY
DR. ROBERTA GOLINKOFF,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
THE DIRECTOR
OF THE LANGUAGE LAB

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF DELAWARE.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
ROBERTA, ONE OF
THE MOST AMAZING THINGS
YOU'VE FOUND OUT

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
IS HOW EARLY SPEECH BEGINS

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
AND HOW CRITICAL IT IS

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
FOR A CHILD TO BE ABLE
TO COMMUNICATE

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
HIS WISHES, HIS DREAMS,
HIS THOUGHTS.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
IT IS AMAZING HOW EARLY
THE PROCESS BEGINS.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
IT BEGINS IN THE WOMB,
ONCE THE BABY CAN HEAR.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
BABIES COME OUT
BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE
THEIR MOTHER'S VOICE

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
OVER A STRANGER'S VOICE

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
AND BEING ABLE TO RECOGNIZE
THEIR OWN LANGUAGE

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
OVER A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
- ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?
- IT'S AMAZING!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
- HOW EARLY?
- FOUR DAYS OF AGE.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
WE HAVE TO USE
TRICKY METHODS

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
TO GET BABIES TO SHOW US
WHAT THEY KNOW,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
AND ONE OF THE METHODS
THAT WE USE IS SUCKING.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
SO WE GIVE BABIES
A NIPPLE,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
AND WE ALLOW THEM
TO SUCK ON IT WHILE WE PLAY

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
EITHER THEIR MOTHER'S VOICE
OR A STRANGER'S VOICE
READING A STORY,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
AND THEN WE SWITCH VOICES,
BUT WE DON'T TELL THE BABY.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
AND IF THE BABY STARTS
SUCKING FAST AGAIN,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
WE KNOW THAT
THE BABY HAS RECOGNIZED
THE DIFFERENCES IN THE VOICES.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
AND BABIES APPEAR
TO PREFER TO LISTEN TO

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
THEIR OWN MOM'S VOICE
OVER A STRANGE WOMAN'S VOICE.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
AND THE ONLY REASON THAT
WE KNOW THESE THINGS IS BECAUSE

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
WE HAVE COME UP WITH
THESE TRICKY METHODS
IN THE LAST 15 YEARS.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
BEFORE THAT,
WE REALLY DIDN'T KNOW

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
HOW MUCH BABIES WERE
WORKING ON LANGUAGE
AND HOW EARLY.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
ROBERTA, WHEN
SHOULD PARENTS WORRY?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
YOU TELL ME THAT
THEY SHOULD BE SAYING

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
- A WORD OR TWO AT TWO,
- OH, YES.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
AND THAT THEY SHOULD
BE UNDERSTANDING

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
- RECEPTIVE SPEECH BY TWO.
- LOTS OF WORDS BY TWO.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
- WHEN SHOULD THEY DO SOMETHING?
- THE VERY FIRST THING
  ONE CHECKS OUT IS HEARING.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
- HEARING?
- THE VERY FIRST THING.
  CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
TO GET EAR INFECTIONS
WHEN THEY'RE MIXING
WITH OTHER CHILDREN.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
AND EAR INFECTIONS
ARE THE FIRST
LINE OF DEFENSE

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
AGAINST SPEECH DELAYS.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
AND MANY PARENTS
WILL TAKE THEIR CHILDREN
TO THE PEDIATRICIAN

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
IF THE CHILD HAS A FEVER
AND CLEARLY HAS
AN EAR INFECTION,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
BUT THEY WON'T
OFTEN FOLLOW UP TWO
OR THREE WEEKS LATER

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE FLUID IN THE MIDDLE EAR
HAS DRIED UP.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR--
 THAT HAVING REPEATED
 EAR INFECTIONS

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
MAKES IT HARDER
TO LEARN LANGUAGE.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
BEING IN THE BATHTUB.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
YOU'RE UNDERWATER
WHEN SOMEBODY'S TRYING
TO TALK TO YOU,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
YOU AND YOU'RE HEARING IT
THROUGH THIS MASS OF FLUID.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
SO IT'S HARD TO MAKE OUT
THE INDIVIDUAL SOUNDS
AND THE SEQUENCES OF SOUNDS--

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
- SO THEY CAN IMITATE IT
  AND BEGIN TO PICK UP ON IT.
- YES. YES.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
AND I'VE HEARD
TAPES OF CHILDREN

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
WHO HAVE A LOSS

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
OF THE MIDDLE RANGE,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
AND IT'S GARBLED,
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING
THAT'S COMING THROUGH IT.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
- YEAH.
- THIS MUST BE A PROBLEM, TOO,
  WITH MIDDLE EAR, ISN'T IT?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
YES, AND I THINK
THE THING THAT PARENTS
HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
IS BEING VIGILANT
AND MAKING SURE

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
THAT THE CHILD DOES NOT
 HAVE FLUID IN THERE.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I WOULD THINK IF--
BETWEEN 24 AND 28 MONTHS,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
IF PARENTS HAVE
A SENSE THAT

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
CHILDREN AREN'T MAKING EYE
CONTACT, THAT THEY DON'T
WANT TO SIT AND HEAR A STORY,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
THAT THEY CAN'T FOLLOW
SIMPLE COMMANDS,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING--
IN ADDITION TO THE FACT

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
THAT THEY'RE NOT
USING WORDS.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE
TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
THAT THERE'S SUCH WIDE
VARIABILITY OF THE BEGINNING
OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
THAT I WANT PARENTS TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME WITH THEIR KIDS

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
AND INTERACT CONVERSATIONALLY
WITH THEIR CHILDREN

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
AND RECOGNIZE THAT
A 24-MONTH-OLD

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
CAN BE PUTTING TWO WORDS
TOGETHER OR SAYING
ONLY ONE WORD AT A TIME,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
AND MOST OF THE TIME
 THOSE CHILDREN ARE
 BOTH GONNA BE FINE,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
INCLUDING THE 24-MONTH-OLD
 THAT'S SPEAKING
 IN PARAGRAPHS.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
THERE'S SUCH VARIABILITY
AT THE BEGINNING,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
SO I DON'T WANT PARENTS
TO WORRY THAT MUCH.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE--

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Emcee:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
HI, DOCTOR.
I HAVE A DAUGHTER
THAT'S TWO AND A HALF,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
AND I'VE NOTICED
OVER THE LAST MONTH
THAT SHE STARTED TO STUTTER.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
AND IT'S VERY NOTICEABLE,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
AND I WAS WONDERING
WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I'VE HEARD FROM
SOME PEOPLE THAT IT COULD BE
A DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIOR.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU
THAT IT IS NORMAL

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
AND IT COMES JUST AT A TIME--
I CAN EVEN--

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
THINK I CAN TELL YOU
THE MECHANISM.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
AS THEY LEARN SPEECH--
AND THIS IS WHAT'S INTERESTING--

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
SHE'S JUST PROBABLY BEGUN
TO SPEAK WELL, HASN'T SHE?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
- YES.
- AND PUT WORDS TOGETHER.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
HER MIND GETS WAY AHEAD
OF HER CAPACITY TO
PUT SPEECH TOGETHER,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
SO SHE BEGINS TO EITHER
STAMMER OR STUTTER,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
AND IT'S A VERY NORMAL

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESS.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
AND AS THEY GET
BETTER AND BETTER AT IT,
IT DROPS OUT

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
UNLESS SOMEBODY PAYS
TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO IT.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
AND YOU MAY HAVE TO ASK
OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO, TOO,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS
TO HELP HER.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
THEY WANT TO GIVE HER THE WORD.
WELL, THAT ISN'T GONNA HELP HER.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
IT JUST EMPHASIZES
WHAT SHE MAY ALREADY BE

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
A LITTLE BIT
UPTIGHT ABOUT--

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
THAT I CAN'T QUITE
GET IT OUT YET.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
AND IT WILL COME.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
IS THERE A POINT, THOUGH,
THAT YOU SAY,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
THIS ISN'T CHANGING ?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
- IS THERE AN AGE WHERE THAT--
- MAYBE FOUR OR FIVE.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
- FOUR OR FIVE?
-MM-HMM, I WOULD THINK
   IT'D BE A LOT LATER.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
BUT IT DOESN'T, TO ME,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
RING A BELL OF HAVING
ANYTHING WRONG UP HERE.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
I WOULD LET IT GO RIGHT NOW
 AND WATCH THE COURSE OF IT.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN STUTTERERS
WHO GET SO UPTIGHT

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
THAT THEY JUST STUTTER MORE
'CAUSE THEY CAN'T GET IT OUT.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
THEN UNLESS THAT BEGAN
TO HAPPEN, I WOULDN'T BE
VERY WORRIED ABOUT IT.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
- GOOD FOR YOU.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
MY NAME IS MELISSA,
AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS
TO ENCOURAGE LANGUAGE
DEVELOPMENT IN A TODDLER?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
- IN A TODDLER?  UH-HUH.
-IN A TODDLER.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
- TELL ME ABOUT YOUR TODDLER.
-HE'S 26 MONTHS OLD,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
AND HE SAYS
 MAMA  AND  DADA, 
BUT THAT'S IT.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
- I CAN'T GET HIM TO SAY
  ANYTHING ELSE.
- REALLY?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
- YEAH.
-DO YOU THINK HE HEARS?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
WE'VE HAD HIS HEARING TESTED,
AND HE CAN HEAR.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
- ARE YOU SURE THAT
  HE DOES UNDERSTAND YOU?
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
UH-HUH.
BECAUSE RECEPTIVE SPEECH--

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF A BIG
DIAGNOSTIC DECISION

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
AND WHETHER TO GO
GET HIM TESTED OR NOT.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
IF HE REALLY HAD
 RECEPTIVE SPEECH,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
WHICH MEANS HE DID
UNDERSTAND YOU,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
AND IF YOU PUT
A SECOND THING--

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
GO GET SO-AND-SO,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
DO SOMETHING TO IT
AND BRING IT TO MOMMY,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
HE COULD DO
ALL THAT WITHOUT--

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
NEGATIVISM IS NORMAL
AT THAT AGE--

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
BUT IF HE COULD DO
 ALL THAT, YOU'D KNOW
 HE HAD RECEPTIVE SPEECH.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
THE NEXT THING I'D LOOK FOR
IS BEHAVIORAL SPEECH.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
DOES HE HAVE BEHAVIOR
HE COMMUNICATES WITH YOU?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
IF HE DOES,
THAT'S TELLING YOU
SOMETHING TOO.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
AND THE THIRD THING IS
WHY HIS SPEECH

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
IS SO SPARSE AT TWO,
BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY SPARSE.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
IT'S VERY SCARY,
'CAUSE HE GOES TO DAYCARE,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
- AND ALL HIS OTHER FRIENDS
  TALK AND--
- YEAH.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
YOU ASKED ME HOW
YOU HELP HIM TALK.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
YOU LOOK IN THEIR FACES,
YOU SAY THINGS TO 'EM,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
YOU PICK UP ON WHAT THEY SAY
AND ENLARGE ON IT

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
JUST A LITTLE BIT--
NOT TOO MUCH--

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
BECAUSE THEN YOU'VE
OVERWHELMED THEM--
AND THEN THEY IMITATE YOU,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
WHY, THAT'S TELLING YOU
SOMETHING-- THAT THEY'RE TRYING.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
YEAH, IT SEEMS LIKE HE TRIES
TO, LIKE, SAY SOMETHING,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
BUT IT JUST--
HE JUST CAN'T DO IT.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
WELL, THERE ARE
TWO-YEAR-OLD EVALUATIONS NOW
THAT ARE SO SIMPLE

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
AND TELL YOU SO MUCH
THAT I WOULDN'T HESITATE
TO HAVE ONE.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
- THANK YOU.
- GREAT.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
( people applauding )

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
I HAVE A QUESTION
ABOUT LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
MY HUSBAND'S FIRST LANGUAGE
IS ITALIAN,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
AND WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS BORN
HE SPOKE STRICTLY ITALIAN

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
- FOR THE FIRST
  COUPLE OF YEARS.
- GREAT.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
BUT WE FOUND THAT SHE REALLY
 RESENTED IT, AND IT--

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
- SHE RESENTED IT?
- YEAH, IT CREATED A BARRIER
  IN THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
SHE DIDN'T WANT 
 TO TALK TO HIM.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS
SAYING, BUT SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
AND SHE STARTED TO SPEAK LESS
AND LESS IN ENGLISH TO HIM.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
SO AT TWO YEARS OLD,
HE STOPPED.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
- HE MUST FEEL SO SHUT OUT.
- WHICH IS WHY HE GAVE IT UP.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
AND I FEEL, AS AN ADULT

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
WHO TRIED TO LEARN
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
THAT I REALLY WANTED THAT GIFT
GIVEN TO MY CHILDREN.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
- I DO KNOW THAT
  IT'S CONFUSING TO 'EM.
- MM-HMM.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
- DO YOU SPEAK
  ITALIAN WITH HIM?
- NO.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I TRY, BUT IT'S NOT
AS NATURAL, SO--

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
WELL, I WOULD THINK
IF YOU DID,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
IT WOULD MAKE IT
EASIER FOR HER TO,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
- SO YOU MIGHT TRY
  EVEN HARDER.
- MM-HMM.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
I ALWAYS DO RECOMMEND JUST
 EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID--

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
THAT TWO LANGUAGES IN INFANCY
AND EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
IS SUCH AN ASSET LATER ON.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
NOW, THEY DON'T
SPEAK EARLY.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
SHE'S THREE NOW.
IS IT TO LATE TO
TRY TO REINTRODUCE IT?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I'D HATE TO GIVE UP
ON THE CHANCE FOR HER TO LEARN,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
AND SO SURE,
I'D INTRODUCE IT
AT SENSITIVE TIMES.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
AND I WOULD WATCH SOMETHING

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
THAT MAY BE HAPPENING
THAT YOU'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
AND YOU MAY WITHOUT KNOWING IT,
WHEN HE TALKS TALKING ITALIAN,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
FROWN OR GIVE HER A SIGNAL

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
THAT THIS ISN'T
WHAT WE'RE UP TO,
AND I'D WATCH THAT.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
- OKAY.
- CROSS THAT LINE YOURSELF

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
AND LAUGH ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS
FOR YOU TO LEARN IT

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
AND SORT OF
LEAD HER INTO IT.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
AND IF SHE HAD
PERMISSION FROM YOU

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
TO SOP UP THE LANGUAGE
AS WELL AS EVERYTHING ELSE,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
WHY, IT WOULD
CERTAINLY MAKE SENSE.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
- OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- GREAT.  OKAY.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
FOR TAPES
 AND TRANSCRIPTS, CALL:

ARENTING,
 PRESENTED BY

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I HOPE YOU'VE GOTTEN
SOME INSIGHTS

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
INTO THE FASCINATING WORLD
OF LANGUAGE LEARNING,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
AND I ALSO HOPE YOU'VE
COME TO AN APPRECIATION
OF HOW CRITICAL IT IS

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
TO GET YOUR KIDS HELP
IF THEY NEED IT.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
OH, ONE MORE THING--

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
KIDS LOVE TO COMMUNICATE.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
IT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL
BORN TO DO.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
SO TALK TO THEM,
READ TO THEM,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
AND MORE IMPORTANT,
LISTEN TO THEM.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I PROMISE YOU'LL BE
GLAD YOU DID.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
