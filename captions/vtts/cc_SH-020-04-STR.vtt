00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.470


2
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.300
See, ho! who is thatthere?

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.870
It is the Lord AEneas.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.470
Is the prince there inperson?

5
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.000
Had I so good occasion tolie long

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.170
As you, prince Paris, nothingbut heavenly business

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.730
Should rob my bed-mate ofmy company.

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.170
That's my mind too. Goodmorrow, Lord AEneas.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.230
A valiant Greek,AEneas,--take his hand,--

10
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.400
Witness the process ofyour speech, wherein

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.070
You told how Diomed, awhole week by days,

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.500
Did haunt you in thefield.

13
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.470
Health to you, valiantsir,

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.400
During all question of thegentle truce;

15
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.900
But when I meet you arm'd,as black defiance

16
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.530
As heart can think orcourage execute.

17
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.300
The one and other Diomedembraces.

18
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.770
Our bloods are now in calm;and, so long, health!

19
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.830
But when contention andoccasion meet,

20
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.200
By Jove, I'll play thehunter for thy life

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.730
With all my force, pursuitand policy.

22
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.430
And thou shalt hunt alion, that will fly

23
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.630
With his face backward. Inhumane gentleness,

24
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.870
Welcome to Troy! now, byAnchises' life,

25
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.030
Welcome, indeed! By Venus'hand I swear,

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.370
No man alive can love insuch a sort

27
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.230
The thing he means to killmore excellently.

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.300
We sympathize: Jove, letAEneas live,

29
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.830
If to my sword his fate benot the glory,

30
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.930
A thousand completecourses of the sun!

31
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.930
But, in mine emuloushonour, let him die,

32
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.770
With every joint a wound,and that to-morrow!

33
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.070
We know each other well.

34
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.670
We do; and long to knoweach other worse.

35
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.770
This is the most despitefulgentle greeting,

36
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.400
The noblest hateful love,that e'er I heard of.

37
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.930
What business, lord, soearly?

38
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.130
I was sent for to theking; but why, I know not.

39
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.470
His purpose meets you:'twas to bring this Greek

40
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.170
To Calchas' house, andthere to render him,

41
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.000
For the enfreed Antenor,the fair Cressid:

42
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.330
Let's have your company,or, if you please,

43
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.130
Haste there before us: Iconstantly believe--

44
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.770
Or rather, call my thoughta certain knowledge--

45
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.700
My brother Troilus lodgesthere to-night:

46
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.600
Rouse him and give himnote of our approach.

47
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.300
With the whole qualitywherefore: I fear

48
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.400
We shall be muchunwelcome.

49
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.730
That I assure you:

50
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.870
Troilus had rather Troywere borne to Greece

51
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.400
Than Cressid borne fromTroy.

52
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.800
There is no help;

53
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.100
The bitter disposition ofthe time

54
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.370
Will have it so. On, lord;we'll follow you.

55
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:51.000
Good morrow, friend.

56
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.830
And tell me, noble Diomed,faith, tell me true,

57
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.930
Even in the soul of soundgood-fellowship,

58
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.270
Who, in your thoughts,merits fair Helen best,

59
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.330
Myself or Menelaus?

60
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.070
Both alike:

61
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.800
He merits well to haveher, that doth seek her,

62
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.200
Not making any scruple ofher soilure,

63
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.400
With such a hell of painand world of charge,

64
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.900
And you as well to keepher, that defend her,

65
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.000
Not palating the taste ofher dishonour,

66
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.670
With such a costly loss ofwealth and friends:

67
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.200
He, like a puling cuckold,would drink up

68
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.370
The lees and dregs of aflat tamed piece;

69
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.500
You, like a lecher, out ofwhorish loins

70
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.970
Are pleased to breed outyour inheritors:

71
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.500
Both merits poised, eachweighs nor less nor more;

72
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.430
But he as he, the heavierfor a whore.

73
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.800
You are too bitter to yourcountrywoman.

74
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.800
She's bitter to hercountry: hear me, Paris:

75
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.130
For every false drop inher bawdy veins

76
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.770
A Grecian's life hathsunk; for every scruple

77
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.430
Of her contaminatedcarrion weight,

78
00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.300
A Trojan hath been slain:since she could speak,

79
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.870
She hath not given so manygood words breath

80
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.300
As for her Greeks andTrojans suffer'd death.

81
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.270
Fair Diomed, you do aschapmen do,

82
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.230
Dispraise the thing thatyou desire to buy:

83
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.670
But we in silence holdthis virtue well,

84
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.400
We'll but commend what weintend to sell.

85
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.300
Here lies our way.

86
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:51.400
Dear, trouble not yourself:the morn is cold.

87
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.800
Then, sweet my lord, I'llcall mine uncle down;

88
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.870
He shall unbolt the gates.

89
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.130
Trouble him not;

90
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.070
To bed, to bed: sleep killthose pretty eyes,

91
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.700
And give as softattachment to thy senses

92
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.870
As infants' empty of allthought!

93
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.900
Good morrow, then.

94
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.400
I prithee now, to bed.

95
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.500
Are you a-weary of me?

96
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.800
O Cressida! but that thebusy day,

97
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.900
Waked by the lark, hathroused the ribald crows,

98
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.630
And dreaming night willhide our joys no longer,

99
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.470
I would not from thee.

100
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.270
Night hath been too brief.

101
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.870
Beshrew the witch! withvenomous wights she stays

102
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.230
As tediously as hell, butflies the grasps of love

103
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.230
With wings moremomentary-swift than thought.

104
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.400
You will catch cold, andcurse me.

105
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.770
Prithee, tarry:

106
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.730
You men will never tarry.

107
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.700
O foolish Cressid! I mighthave still held off,

108
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.070
And then you would havetarried. Hark!

109
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.700
there's one up.

110
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.970
What, 's all the doorsopen here?

111
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.330
It is your uncle.

112
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.330
A pestilence on him! nowwill he be mocking:

113
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.800
I shall have such a life!

114
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:18.400
How now, how now!how go maidenheads?

115
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.630
Here, you maid! where'smy cousin Cressid?

116
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.800
Go hang yourself, younaughty mocking uncle!

117
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.870
You bring me to do, andthen you flout me too.

118
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.530
To do what? to do what?let her say

119
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.030
what: what have I broughtyou to do?

120
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.130
Come, come, beshrew yourheart! you'll ne'er be good,

121
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.830
Nor suffer others.

122
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.800
Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch!ah, poor capocchia!

123
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.130
hast not slept to-night?would he not, a naughty man,

124
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.470
let it sleep? abugbear take him!

125
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.570
Did not I tell you? Would hewere knock'd i' the head!

126
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.200
(Knocking)

127
00:06:50.200 --> 00:07:01.970
Hark. Who's that at door? gooduncle, go and see.

128
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.000
My lord, come you againinto my chamber:

129
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.200
You smile and mock me, asif I meant naughtily.

130
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.270
Ha, ha!

131
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.530
Come, you are deceived, Ithink of no such thing.

132
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.230
(Knocking within)

133
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.070
How earnestly they knock!Pray you, come in:

134
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.230
I would not for half Troyhave you seen here.

135
00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.630
My LordAEneas! By my troth,

136
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.070
I knew you not: what newswith you so early?

137
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.130
Is not Prince Troilushere?

138
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.330
Here! what should he dohere?

139
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.800
Come, he is here, my lord;do not deny him:

140
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.530
It doth import him much tospeak with me.

141
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.230
Is he here, say you?'tis more than I know,

142
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.300
I'll be sworn: for my ownpart, I came in late.

143
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.330
What should he do here?

144
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.570
Who!--nay, then: come,come, you'll do him wrong

145
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.900
ere you're ware: you'llbe so true to him,

146
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.600
to be false to him: donot you know of him,

147
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.030
but yet go fetchhim hither; go.

148
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.930
How now! what's thematter?

149
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.870
My lord, I scarce haveleisure to salute you,

150
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.470
My matter is so rash:there is at hand

151
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.330
Paris your brother, andDeiphobus,

152
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.630
The Grecian Diomed, andour Antenor

153
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.300
Deliver'd to us; and forhim forthwith,

154
00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.070
Ere the first sacrifice,within this hour,

155
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.630
We must give up toDiomedes' hand

156
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.200
The Lady Cressida.

157
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.800
Is it so concluded?

158
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.000
By Priam and the generalstate of Troy:

159
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.700
They are at hand and readyto effect it.

160
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:45.000
How my achievements mockme!

161
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.830
I will go meet them: and,my Lord AEneas,

162
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.730
We met by chance; you didnot find me here.

163
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:53.770
Good, good, my lord; thesecrets of nature

164
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.970
Have not more gift intaciturnity.

165
00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:01.970
Is't possible? nosooner got but lost?

166
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:07.070
The devil take Antenor! theyoung prince will go mad:

167
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.200
a plague upon Antenor! I wouldthey had broke 's neck!

168
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.930
How now! what's thematter? who was here?

169
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:14.070
Ah, ah!

170
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.970
Why sigh you so profoundly?where's my lord? gone!

171
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.700
Tell me, sweet uncle,what's the matter?

172
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.530
Would I were as deep underthe earth as I am above!

173
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.070
O the gods! what's thematter?

174
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.830
Prithee, get thee in: wouldthou hadst ne'er been born!

175
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.630
I knew thou wouldstbe his death.

176
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:33.030
O, poor gentleman! Aplague upon Antenor!

177
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.170
Good uncle, I beseech you,

178
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.870
what's the matter?

179
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.770
Thou must be gone, wench,thou must be gone;

180
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:43.130
thou art changed for Antenor:thou must to thy father,

181
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.870
and be gone from Troilus:'twill be his death;

182
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:48.830
'twill be his bane; hecannot bear it.

183
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:54.070
O you immortal gods! Iwill not go.

184
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.470
Thou must.

185
00:09:55.470 --> 00:10:00.600
I will not, uncle: I haveforgot my father;

186
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.400
I know no touch ofconsanguinity;

187
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.730
No kin no love, no blood,no soul so near me

188
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:15.900
As the sweet Troilus. Oyou gods divine!

189
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.430
Make Cressid's name thevery crown of falsehood,

190
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:23.870
If ever she leave Troilus!Time, force, and death,

191
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.270
Do to this body whatextremes you can;

192
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.730
But the strong base andbuilding of my love

193
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.470
Is as the very centre ofthe earth,

194
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.170
Drawing all things to it.

195
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:44.730
(Cressida starts crying)

196
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.900
I'll go in and weep,--

197
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.870
Do, do.

198
00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:03.900
Tear my bright hair andscratch my praised cheeks,

199
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:11.100
Crack my clear voice withsobs and break my heart

200
00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:22.230
With sounding Troilus. Iwill not go from Troy.

201
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.130
Be moderate, be moderate.

202
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.170
Why tell you me ofmoderation?

203
00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:33.530
The grief is fine, full,perfect, that I taste,

204
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.030
And violenteth in a senseas strong

205
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:42.530
As that which causeth it:how can I moderate it?

206
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:46.930
If I could temporize withmy affection,

207
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.900
Or brew it to a weak andcolder palate,

208
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.870
The like allayment could Igive my grief.

209
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:58.970
My love admits noqualifying dross;

210
00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:04.430
No more my grief, in sucha precious loss.

211
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:11.400
Here, here, here he comes.

212
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.730
Ah, sweet ducks!

213
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:20.530
O Troilus! Troilus!

214
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.470
What a pair of spectaclesis here!

215
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:29.400
Let me embrace too.How now, lambs?

216
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:48.530
Cressid, I love thee in sostrain'd a purity,

217
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:55.170
Cressid, I love thee in sostrain'd a purity,

218
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.170
That the bless'd gods, asangry with my fancy,

219
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.470
More bright in zeal thanthe devotion which

220
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:09.370
Cold lips blow to theirdeities, take thee from me.

221
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.000
Have the gods envy?

222
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.770
Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis tooplain a case.

223
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.970
And is it true that I mustgo from Troy?

224
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:31.370
A hateful truth.

225
00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.370
What, and from Troilustoo?

226
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:39.170
From Troy and Troilus.

227
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.770
Is it possible?

228
00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:47.670
And suddenly; where injuryof chance

229
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:54.000
Puts back leave-taking,justles roughly by

230
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.570
All time of pause, rudelybeguiles our lips

231
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.530
Of all rejoindure,forcibly prevents

232
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.770
Our lock'd embrasures,strangles our dear vows

233
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:17.170
Even in the birth of ourown labouring breath:

234
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.730
We two, that with so manythousand sighs

235
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.370
Did buy each other, mustpoorly sell ourselves

236
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:36.700
With the rude brevity anddischarge of one.

237
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:43.700
Injurious time now with arobber's haste

238
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:49.800
Crams his rich thieveryup, he knows not how:

239
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.900
As many farewells as bestars in heaven,

240
00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:01.770
With distinct breath andconsign'd kisses to them,

241
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.770
He fumbles up into a loseadieu,

242
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:11.230
And scants us with asingle famish'd kiss,

243
00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:17.800
Distasted with the salt ofbroken tears.

244
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:21.600
[Within] My lord, is thelady ready?

245
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:25.830
Hark! you are call'd: somesay the Genius so

246
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.470
Cries 'come' to him thatinstantly must die.

247
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.070
Bid them have patience;she shall come anon.

248
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:40.230
Where are my tears?rain, to lay this wind,

249
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.270
or my heart will beblown up by the root.

250
00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.470
I must then to theGrecians?

251
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.870
No remedy.

252
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.000
A woful Cressid 'mongstthe merry Greeks!

253
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.930
When shall we see again?

254
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.330
Hear me, my love: be thoutrue and I will see thee--

255
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.500
I true! how now! whatwicked deem is this?

256
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.630
Nay, we must useexpostulation kindly,

257
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.500
For it is parting from us:

258
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.000
I speak not 'be thoutrue,' as fearing thee,

259
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.200
For I will throw my gloveto Death himself,

260
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.870
That there's no maculationin thy heart:

261
00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.830
But 'be thou true,' say I,to fashion in

262
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.500
My sequent protestation;be thou true,

263
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.170
And I will see thee.

264
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.300
O, you shall be exposed,my lord, to dangers

265
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.800
As infinite as imminent!but I'll be true.

266
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:49.970
And I'll grow friend withdanger. Wear this sleeve.

267
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:57.630
And you this glove. Whenshall I see you?

268
00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.370
I will corrupt the Greciansentinels,

269
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.500
To give thee nightlyvisitation.

270
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.430
But yet be true.

271
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:07.330
O heavens! 'be true'again!

272
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.130
Hear while I speak it,love:

273
00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.770
The Grecian youths arefull of quality;

274
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.100
They're loving, well composedwith gifts of nature,

275
00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.470
Flowing and swelling o'erwith arts and exercise:

276
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.500
How novelty may move, andparts with person,

277
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.000
Alas, a kind of godlyjealousy--

278
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.700
Which, I beseech you, calla virtuous sin--

279
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.430
Makes me afeard.

280
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.970
O heavens! you love menot.

281
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:33.730
Die I a villain, then!

282
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.570
In this I do not call yourfaith in question

283
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:39.600
So mainly as my merit: Icannot sing,

284
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:46.130
Nor heel the high lavolt,nor sweeten talk,

285
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:48.030
Nor play at subtle games;fair virtues all,

286
00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.800
To which the Grecians aremost prompt and pregnant:

287
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.830
But I can tell that ineach grace of these

288
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.070
There lurks a still anddumb-discoursive devil

289
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.900
That tempts most cunningly:but be not tempted.

290
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.970
Do you think I will?

291
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.400
No.

292
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:10.470
But something may be donethat we will not:

293
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.500
And sometimes we aredevils to ourselves,

294
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.300
When we will tempt thefrailty of our powers,

295
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.030
Presuming on theirchangeful potency.

296
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.300
Nay, good my lord,--

297
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.130
Come, kiss; and let uspart.

298
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.070
(from outside) Brother Troilus!

299
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.370
Good brother, come youhither;

300
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:33.070
And bring AEneas and theGrecian with you.

301
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.970
My lord, will you be true?

302
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:47.730
Who, I? alas, it is myvice, my fault:

303
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.570
Whiles others fish withcraft for great opinion,

304
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.900
I with great truth catchmere simplicity;

305
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.930
Whilst some with cunninggild their copper crowns,

306
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.670
With truth and plainness Ido wear mine bare.

307
00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.600
Fear not my truth: themoral of my wit

308
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:16.070
Is 'plain and true;' there'sall the reach of it.

309
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.970
Welcome, Sir Diomed! hereis the lady

310
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.930
Which for Antenor wedeliver you:

311
00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.830
At the port, lord, I'llgive her to thy hand,

312
00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:03.670
And by the way possessthee what she is.

313
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:08.230
Entreat her fair; and, bymy soul, fair Greek,

314
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.630
If e'er thou stand atmercy of my sword,

315
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.330
Name Cressida and thy lifeshall be as safe

316
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:18.100
As Priam is in Ilion.

317
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.500
Fair Lady Cressid,

318
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.200
So please you, save thethanks this prince expects:

319
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.700
The lustre in your eye,heaven in your cheek,

320
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:32.100
Pleads your fair usage;and to Diomed

321
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.470
You shall be mistress, andcommand him wholly.

322
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.700
Grecian, thou dost not useme courteously,

323
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.000
To shame the zeal of mypetition to thee

324
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.930
In praising her: I tellthee, lord of Greece,

325
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.530
She is as far high-soaringo'er thy praises

326
00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.130
As thou unworthy to becall'd her servant.

327
00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:57.070
I charge thee use herwell, even for my charge;

328
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:58.900
For, by the dreadfulPluto, if thou dost not,

329
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.770
Though the great bulkAchilles be thy guard,

330
00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.300
I'll cut thy throat.

331
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.330
O, be not moved, PrinceTroilus:

332
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:07.130
Let me be privileged by myplace and message,

333
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.030
To be a speaker free; whenI am hence

334
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.400
I'll answer to my lust:and know you, lord,

335
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.670
I'll nothing do on charge:to her own worth

336
00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.270
She shall be prized; butthat you say 'be't so,'

337
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.800
I'll speak it in my spiritand honour, 'no.'

338
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.700
Come, to the port. I'lltell thee, Diomed,

339
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:33.370
This brave shall oft makethee to hide thy head.

340
00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:39.070
Lady, give me your hand,and, as we walk,

341
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.630
To our own selves bend weour needful talk.

342
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:48.230
(Cressida stops crying)

343
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.930
(♪trumpet plays)

344
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:04.700
Hark! Hector's trumpet.

345
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:12.030
How have we spent thismorning!

346
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:15.230
The prince must think metardy and remiss,

347
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.670
That sore to ride beforehim to the field.

348
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.670
'Tis Troilus' fault: come,come, to field with him.

349
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.670
Yea, with a bridegroom'sfresh alacrity,

350
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.630
Let us address to tend onHector's heels:

351
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.300
The glory of our Troy doththis day lie

352
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:36.400
On his fair worth andsingle chivalry.

353
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:39.700
(screams)

354
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:47.430
Here art thou inappointment fresh and fair,

355
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.230
Anticipating time withstarting courage.

356
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.400
Give with thy trumpet aloud note to Troy,

357
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.600
Thou dreadful Ajax; thatthe appalled air

358
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.870
May pierce the head of thegreat combatant

359
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:00.270
And hale him hither.

360
00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.500
Thou, trumpet, there's mypurse.

361
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:07.630
Now crack thy lungs, andsplit thy brazen pipe:

362
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.400
Blow, villain, till thysphered bias cheek

363
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.730
Outswell the colic ofpuff'd Aquilon:

364
00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:18.070
Come, stretch thy chest andlet thy eyes spout blood;

365
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.570
Thou blow'st for Hector.

366
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:28.970
(♪Trumpet sounds)

367
00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.930
No trumpet answers.

368
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.470
'Tis but early days.

369
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:43.070
Is not yond Diomed, withCalchas' daughter?

370
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.870
'Tis he, I ken the mannerof his gait;

371
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.400
He rises on the toe: thatspirit of his

372
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.930
In aspiration lifts himfrom the earth.

373
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.070
Is this the Lady Cressid?

374
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.530
Even she.

375
00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:09.470
Most dearly welcome to theGreeks, sweet lady.

376
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.100
Our general doth saluteyou with a kiss.

377
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.700
Yet is the kindness butparticular;

378
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.570
'Twere better she werekiss'd in general.

379
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.930
And very courtly counsel:I'll begin.

380
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:22.600
So much for Nestor.

381
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.670
I'll take what winter fromyour lips, fair lady:

382
00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.130
Achilles bids you welcome.

383
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:31.270
I had good argument forkissing once.

384
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.430
But that's no argument forkissing now;

385
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.000
For this popp'd Paris inhis hardiment,

386
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.870
And parted thus you andyour argument.

387
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.900
O deadly gall, and themeof all our scorns!

388
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.800
For which we lose ourheads to gild his horns.

389
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.200
The first was Menelaus'kiss; this, mine:

390
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.270
Patroclus kisses you.

391
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.630
O, this is trim!

392
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.100
Paris and I kiss evermorefor him.

393
00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.930
I'll have my kiss, sir.Lady, by your leave.

394
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.370
In kissing, do you renderor receive?

395
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.830
Both take and give.

396
00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.170
I'll make my match tolive,

397
00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.470
The kiss you take isbetter than you give;

398
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.630
Therefore no kiss.

399
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.870
I'll give you boot, I'llgive you three for one.

400
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.030
You're an odd man; giveeven or give none.

401
00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.030
An odd man, lady! everyman is odd.

402
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.100
No, Paris is not; for youknow 'tis true,

403
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.430
That you are odd, and heis even with you.

404
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:19.600
You fillip me o' the head.

405
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.730
No, I'll be sworn.

406
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.900
It were no match, yournail against his horn.

407
00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.300
May I, sweet lady, beg akiss of you?

408
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:26.930
You may.

409
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:27.930
I do desire it.

410
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.370
Why, beg, then.

411
00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:33.470
Why then for Venus' sake,give me a kiss,

412
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.530
When Helen is a maidagain, and his.

413
00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.130
I am your debtor, claim itwhen 'tis due.

414
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.000
Never's my day, and then akiss of you.

415
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.600
Lady, a word: I'll bringyou to your father.

416
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.870
A woman of quick sense.

417
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.470
Fie, fie upon her!

418
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.770
There's language in hereye, her cheek, her lip, her eye

419
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.070
Nay, her foot speaks;her wanton spirits look out

420
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.100
At every joint and motiveof her body.

421
00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.300
O, these encounterers, soglib of tongue,

422
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.200
That give accostingwelcome ere it comes,

423
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.170
And wide unclasp thetables of their thoughts

424
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.500
To every ticklish reader!set them down

425
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.730
For sluttish spoils ofopportunity

426
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.270
And daughters of the game.

427
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.400
(♪ Trojans' trumpet sounds)

428
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.870
Yonder comes the troop.

429
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:22.600
Hail, all you state ofGreece! what shall be done

430
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.130
To him that victorycommands? or do you purpose

431
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.500
A victor shall be known?will you the knights

432
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.570
Shall to the edge of allextremity

433
00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.500
Pursue each other, orshall be divided

434
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.430
By any voice or order ofthe field?

435
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:35.300
Hector bade ask.

436
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.570
Which way would Hectorhave it?

437
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.200
He cares not; he'll obeyconditions.

438
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.170
'Tis done like Hector; butsecurely done,

439
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.770
A little proudly, andgreat deal misprizing

440
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.800
The knight opposed.

441
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.770
If not Achilles, sir,

442
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:49.800
What is your name?

443
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.670
If not Achilles, nothing.

444
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:57.700
Therefore Achilles: but,whate'er, know this:

445
00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.930
In the extremity of greatand little,

446
00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:03.200
Valour and pride excelthemselves in Hector;

447
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.600
The one almost as infiniteas all,

448
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.030
The other blank asnothing. Weigh him well,

449
00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:14.270
And that which looks likepride is courtesy.

450
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.770
This Ajax is half made ofHector's blood:

451
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.670
In love whereof, halfHector stays at home;

452
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.930
Half heart, half hand,half Hector comes to seek

453
00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.830
This blended knight, halfTrojan and half Greek.

454
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.770
A maiden battle, then? O,I perceive you.

455
00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.130
Here is Sir Diomed. Go,gentle knight,

456
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:37.500
Stand by our Ajax: as youand Lord AEneas

457
00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.030
Consent upon the order oftheir fight,

458
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.600
So be it; either to theuttermost,

459
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.870
Or else a breath: thecombatants being kin

460
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:47.730
Half stints their strifebefore their strokes begin.

461
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.570
They are opposed already.

462
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.300
What Trojan is that samethat looks so heavy?

463
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.900
The youngest son ofPriam, a true knight,

464
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.900
they call him Troilus.

465
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:59.530
Not yet mature, yetmatchless, firm of word,

466
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:02.000
Speaking in deeds anddeedless in his tongue;

467
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.070
Not soon provoked nor beingprovoked soon calm'd:

468
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.870
His heart and hand bothopen and both free;

469
00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.500
For what he has he gives,what thinks he shows;

470
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.300
Yet gives he not tilljudgment guide his bounty,

471
00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:16.870
Manly as Hector, but moredangerous;

472
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.400
For Hector in his blaze ofwrath subscribes

473
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.770
To tender objects, but hein heat of action

474
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.800
Is more vindicative thanjealous love:

475
00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.930
They call him Troilus, andon him erect

476
00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.000
A second hope, as fairlybuilt as Hector.

477
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.470
Thus says AEneas; one thatknows the youth

478
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:31.970
Even to his inches, andwith private soul

479
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:32.970
They are in action.

480
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.230
Did in great Ilion thustranslate him to me.

481
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.230
They are in action.

482
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.330
You must no more.

483
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.770
Princes, enough, so pleaseyou.

484
00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:55.830
I am not warm yet; let usfight again.

485
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.430
As Hector pleases.

486
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.930
Why, then will I no more:

487
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.330
Thou art, great lord, myfather's sister's son,

488
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:05.130
A cousin-german to greatPriam's seed;

489
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:06.400
The obligation of ourblood forbids

490
00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.730
A gory emulation 'twixt ustwain:

491
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:10.900
Were thy commixtion Greekand Trojan so

492
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.000
That thou couldst say'This hand is Grecian all,

493
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.600
And this is Trojan; thesinews of this leg

494
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.900
All Greek, and this allTroy; my mother's blood

495
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.670
Runs on the dexter cheek,and this sinister

496
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.630
Bounds in my father's;' byJove multipotent,

497
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.400
Thou shouldst not bearfrom me a Greekish member

498
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.730
Wherein my sword had notimpressure made

499
00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:28.930
Of our rank feud: but thejust gods gainsay

500
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.200
That any drop thouborrow'dst from thy mother,

501
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.630
My sacred aunt, should bymy mortal sword

502
00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.630
Be drain'd! Let me embracethee, Ajax:

503
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.000
By him that thunders, thouhast lusty arms;

504
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.470
Hector would have themfall upon him thus:

505
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.900
Cousin, all honour tothee!

506
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.300
I thank thee, Hector

507
00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.330
Thou art too gentle andtoo free a man:

508
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.170
I came to kill thee,cousin, and bear hence

509
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.030
A great addition earned inthy death.

510
00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.600
Not Neoptolemus somirable,

511
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.630
On whose bright crest Famewith her loud'st Oyes

512
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:09.470
Cries 'This is he,' couldpromise to himself

513
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.170
A thought of added honourtorn from Hector.

514
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.770
There is expectance herefrom both the sides,

515
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:17.900
What further you will do.

516
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.830
We'll answer it;

517
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.770
The issue is embracement:Ajax, farewell.

518
00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.600
If I might in entreatiesfind success--

519
00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.900
As seld I have thechance--I would desire

520
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.430
My famous cousin to ourGrecian tents.

521
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.370
'Tis Agamemnon's wish, andgreat Achilles

522
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.430
Doth long to see unarm'dthe valiant Hector.

523
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.970
AEneas, call my brotherTroilus to me,

524
00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.500
And signify this lovinginterview

525
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.030
To the expecters of ourTrojan part;

526
00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.370
Desire them home. Give methy hand, my cousin;

527
00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:50.800
I will go eat with theeand see your knights.

528
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.370
Great Agamemnon comes tomeet us here.

529
00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.200
The worthiest of them tellme name by name;

530
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.370
But for Achilles, mine ownsearching eyes

531
00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.670
Shall find him by hislarge and portly size.

532
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.230
Worthy of arms! as welcomeas to one

533
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.970
That would be rid of suchan enemy;

534
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.670
But that's no welcome:understand more clear,

535
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.970
What's past and what's tocome is strew'd with husks

536
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:13.200
And formless ruin ofoblivion;

537
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.970
But in this extant moment,faith and troth,

538
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.770
Strain'd purely from allhollow bias-drawing,

539
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.970
Bids thee, with mostdivine integrity,

540
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.330
From heart of very heart,great Hector, welcome.

541
00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.500
I thank thee, mostimperious Agamemnon.

542
00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.600
My well-famed lord ofTroy, no less to you.

543
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.100
Let me confirm my princelybrother's greeting:

544
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.900
You brace of warlikebrothers, welcome hither.

545
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.700
Who must we answer?

546
00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.230
The noble Menelaus.

547
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.570
O, you, my lord? by Marshis gauntlet, thanks!

548
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:45.570
Mock not, that I affectthe untraded oath;

549
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:50.400
Your quondam wife swearsstill by Venus' glove:

550
00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.100
She's well, but bade menot commend her to you.

551
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:56.230
Name her not now, sir;she's a deadly theme.

552
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.100
O, pardon; I offend.

553
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.000
I have, thou gallantTrojan, seen thee oft

554
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Labouring for destiny makecruel way

555
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.600
Through ranks of Greekishyouth, and I have seen thee,

556
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.470
As hot as Perseus, spurthy Phrygian steed,

557
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:11.070
Despising many forfeitsand subduements,

558
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.270
When thou hast hung thyadvanced sword i' the air,

559
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.100
Not letting it decline onthe declined,

560
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.470
That I have said to somemy standers by

561
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.830
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder,dealing life!'

562
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.930
And I have seen thee pauseand take thy breath,

563
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.370
When that a ring of Greekshave hemm'd thee in,

564
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.370
Like an Olympian wrestling:this have I seen;

565
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.670
But this thy countenance,still lock'd in steel,

566
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:38.670
I never saw till now. Iknew thy grandsire,

567
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.400
And once fought with him:he was a soldier good;

568
00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.670
But, by great Mars, thecaptain of us all,

569
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.330
Never saw like thee. Letan old man embrace thee;

570
00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:53.600
And, worthy warrior,welcome to our tents.

571
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.870
'Tis the old Nestor.

572
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:59.170
Let me embrace thee, goodold chronicle,

573
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:02.230
That hast so long walk'dhand in hand with time:

574
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.230
Most reverend Nestor, I amglad to clasp thee.

575
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.130
I would my arms couldmatch thee in contention,

576
00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.130
As they contend with theein courtesy.

577
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:11.400
I would they could.

578
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.570
Ha!

579
00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:13.600
By this white beard, I'ldfight with thee to-morrow.

580
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.430
Well, welcome, welcome! Ihave seen the time.

581
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.630
I wonder now how yondercity stands

582
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.430
When we have here her baseand pillar by us.

583
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.430
I know your favour, LordUlysses, well.

584
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.830
Ah, sir, there's many aGreek and Trojan dead,

585
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.470
Since first I saw yourselfand Diomed

586
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.200
In Ilion, on your Greekishembassy.

587
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.170
Sir, I foretold you thenwhat would ensue:

588
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.670
My prophecy is but halfhis journey yet;

589
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.500
For yonder walls, thatpertly front your town,

590
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.830
Yond towers, whose wantontops do buss the clouds,

591
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:44.670
Must kiss their own feet.

592
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:47.170
I must not believe you:

593
00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.300
There they stand yet, andmodestly I think,

594
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.230
The fall of every Phrygianstone will cost

595
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:57.370
A drop of Grecian blood:the end crowns all,

596
00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.230
And that oldcommon arbitrator,

597
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.030
Time, Will one day end it.

598
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:03.030
So to him we leave it.

599
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.600
Most gentle and mostvaliant Hector, welcome:

600
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.200
After the general, Ibeseech you next

601
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.370
To feast with me and seeme at my tent.

602
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:20.030
I shall forestall thee,Lord Ulysses, thou!

603
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:24.270
Now, Hector, I have fedmine eyes on thee;

604
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.430
I have with exact viewperused thee, Hector,

605
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.170
And quoted joint by joint.

606
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:32.300
Is this Achilles?

607
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.900
I am Achilles.

608
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.970
Stand fair, I pray thee:let me look on thee.

609
00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:40.030
Behold thy fill.

610
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.500
Nay, I have done already.

611
00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.230
Thou art too brief: I willthe second time,

612
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:48.230
As I would buy thee, viewthee limb by limb.

613
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:52.070
O, like a book of sportthou'lt read me o'er;

614
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:57.000
But there's more in methan thou understand'st.

615
00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.930
Why dost thou so oppressme with thine eye?

616
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:01.970
Tell me, you heavens, inwhich part of his body

617
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:05.300
Shall I destroy him? whetherthere, or there, or there?

618
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.970
That I may give the localwound a name

619
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.270
And make distinct the verybreach whereout

620
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:14.130
Hector's great spiritflew: answer me, heavens!

621
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.300
It would discredit theblest gods, proud man,

622
00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:22.530
To answer such a question:stand again:

623
00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.970
Think'st thou to catch mylife so pleasantly

624
00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.000
As to prenominate in niceconjecture

625
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.430
Where thou wilt hit medead?

626
00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.230
I tell thee, yea.

627
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.600
Wert thou an oracle totell me so,

628
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.400
I'd not believe thee.Henceforth guard thee well;

629
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.230
For I'll not kill theethere, nor there, nor there;

630
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.700
But, by the forge thatstithied Mars his helm,

631
00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:46.770
I'll kill thee everywhere, yea, o'er and o'er.

632
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.970
You wisest Grecians,pardon me this brag;

633
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:55.530
His insolence draws follyfrom my lips;

634
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.730
But I'll endeavour deedsto match these words,

635
00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.270
Or may I never--

636
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:03.830
Do not chafe thee, cousin:

637
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:05.800
And you, Achilles, letthese threats alone,

638
00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.930
Till accident or purposebring you to't:

639
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.700
You may have every dayenough of Hector

640
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.270
If you have stomach; thegeneral state, I fear,

641
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:18.130
Can scarce entreat you tobe odd with him.

642
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.670
I pray you, let us see youin the field:

643
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.970
We have had pelting wars,since you refused

644
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:26.870
The Grecians' cause.

645
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.470
Dost thou entreat me,Hector?

646
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:34.000
To-morrow do I meet thee,fell as death;

647
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.770
To-night all friends.

648
00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.300
Thy hand upon that match.

649
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.600
First, all you peers ofGreece, go to my tent;

650
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.800
There in the full convivewe: afterwards,

651
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.500
As Hector's leisure andyour bounties shall

652
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:52.230
Concur together, severallyentreat him.

653
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:55.600
Beat loud the tabourines,let the trumpets blow,

654
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.630
That this great soldiermay his welcome know.

655
00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:16.800
My Lord Ulysses, tell me,I beseech you,

656
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.370
In what place of the fielddoth Calchas keep?

657
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.270
At Menelaus' tent, mostprincely Troilus:

658
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.070
There Diomed doth feastwith him to-night;

659
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.170
Who neither looks upon theheaven nor earth,

660
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:29.500
But gives all gaze andbent of amorous view

661
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.430
On the fair Cressid.

662
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.570
Shall sweet lord, be boundto you so much,

663
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:37.100
After we part fromAgamemnon's tent,

664
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.100
To bring me thither?

665
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.370
You shall command me, sir.

666
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.700
As gentle tell me,of what honour was

667
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:46.630
This Cressida in Troy?Had she no lover there

668
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.200
That wails her absence?

669
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.900
O, sir, to such asboasting show their scars

670
00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:59.630
A mock is due. Will youwalk on, my lord?

671
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:04.200
She was beloved, sheloved; she is, and doth:

672
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:09.430
But still sweet love isfood for fortune's tooth.

673
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:17.630
