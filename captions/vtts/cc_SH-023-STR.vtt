00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000


3
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.530
This is the palace of thefearful king,

4
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.300
And this the regal seat:possess it, York;

5
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.930
For this is thine and notKing Henry's heirs'

6
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.470
Assist me, then, sweetWarwick, and I will;

7
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.370
We'll all assist you; hethat flies shall die.

8
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.370
Thanks, gentle Norfolk:

9
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.700
And when the king comes,offer him no violence,

10
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.970
Unless he seek to thrustyou out perforce.

11
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.430
Then leave me not, mylords; be resolute;

12
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.100
I mean to take possessionof my right.

13
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.770
Neither the king, nor hethat loves him best,

14
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.600
The proudest he that holdsup Lancaster,

15
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.300
Dares stir a wing, ifWarwick shake his bells.

16
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.170
I'll plant Plantagenet,root him up who dares:

17
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.330
Resolve thee, Richard;claim the English crown.

18
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.770
(celebrating cheers)

19
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.770
(horns sound)

20
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.130
My lords, look where thesturdy rebel sits,

21
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.070
Even in the chair ofstate: belike he means,

22
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.830
Back'd by the power ofWarwick, that false peer,

23
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.530
To aspire unto the crownand reign as king.

24
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.670
Earl of Northumberland, heslew thy father.

25
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.370
And thine, Lord Clifford; andyou both have vow'd revenge

26
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.600
On him, his sons, hisfavourites and his friends.

27
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.070
If I be not, heavens berevenged on me!

28
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.630
The hope thereof makesClifford mourn in steel.

29
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.600
What, shall we suffer this?let's pluck him down:

30
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.300
My heart for anger burns;I cannot brook it.

31
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.700
Be patient, gentle Earl ofWestmoreland.

32
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.800
Patience is for poltroons,such as he:

33
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.770
He durst not sit there,had your father lived.

34
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.970
My gracious lord, here inthe parliament

35
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.770
Let us assail the familyof York.

36
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.170
Well hast thou spoken,cousin: be it so.

37
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.170
Ah, know you not the cityfavours them,

38
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.270
And they have troops ofsoldiers at their beck?

39
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.970
But when the duke is slain,they'll quickly fly.

40
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.130
Far be the thought of thisfrom Henry's heart,

41
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.230
To make a shambles of theparliament-house!

42
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.970
Cousin of Exeter, frowns,words and threats

43
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.630
Shall be the war thatHenry means to use.

44
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.900
Thou factious Duke ofYork, descend my throne,

45
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.930
and kneel for grace andmercy at my feet;

46
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.330
I am thy sovereign.

47
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.030
I am thine.

48
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.200
For shame, come down: hemade thee Duke of York.

49
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.930
'Twas my inheritance, asthe earldom was.

50
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.400
Thy father was a traitorto the crown.

51
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.630
Exeter, thou art a traitorto the crown

52
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.530
In following this usurpingHenry.

53
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.930
Whom should he follow buthis natural king?

54
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.770
True, Clifford; and that'sRichard Duke of York.

55
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.270
And shall I stand, andthou sit in my throne?

56
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.270
It must and shall be so:content thyself.

57
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.870
Be Duke of Lancaster; lethim be king.

58
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.430
He is both king and Dukeof Lancaster;

59
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.670
And that the Lord ofWestmoreland shall maintain.

60
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.470
And Warwick shall disprove it.

61
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.070
You forget that we are thosewhich chased you from the field

62
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.170
And slew your fathers, andwith colours spread

63
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.400
March'd through the cityto the palace gates.

64
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.600
Yes, Warwick, I do rememberit to my grief;

65
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.370
And, by his soul, thou andthy house shall rue it.

66
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.770
Plantagenet, of thee andthese thy sons,

67
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.270
Thy kinsman and thy friends,I'll have more lives

68
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.070
Than drops of blood werein my father's veins.

69
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.170
Urge it no more; lestthat, instead of words,

70
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.330
I send thee, Warwick, sucha messenger

71
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.600
As shall revenge his deathbefore I stir.

72
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:23.400
Poor Clifford! how I scornhis worthless threats!

73
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.470
Will you we show our titleto the crown?

74
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.770
If not, our swords shallplead it in the field.

75
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.900
What title hast thou,traitor, to the crown?

76
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.530
Thy father was, as thouart, Duke of York;

77
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.370
Thy grandfather, RogerMortimer, Earl of March:

78
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.870
I am the son of Henry theFifth,

79
00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.730
Who made the Dauphin andthe French to stoop

80
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.730
And seized upon theirtowns and provinces.

81
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.770
Talk not of France, siththou hast lost it all.

82
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.370
The lord protector lostit, and not I:

83
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.230
When I was crown'd I wasbut nine months old.

84
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:53.700
You are old enough now, andyet, methinks, you lose.

85
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.900
Father, tear the crownfrom the usurper's head.

86
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.330
Sweet father, do so; setit on your head.

87
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.170
Good father, as thoulovest and honourest arms,

88
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.270
Let's fight it out and notstand cavilling thus.

89
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.230
Sound drums and trumpets,and the king will fly.

90
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.300
Sons, peace!

91
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.900
Peace, thou! and give KingHenry leave to speak.

92
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:14.270
Plantagenet shall speakfirst: hear him, lords;

93
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.470
And be you silent andattentive too,

94
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.600
For he that interrupts himshall not live.

95
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.870
Plantagenet, why seeks thou todipose thee?

96
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.900
Are we not bothplantagenets by birth

97
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.530
and from two brotherslinearly decent?

98
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.400
Suppose by right and equity,thou be king.

99
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.570
Think'st thou that I willleave my kingly throne,

100
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.530
Wherein my grandsire andmy father sat?

101
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.430
No: first shall warunpeople this my realm;

102
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.230
Ay, and their colours,often borne in France,

103
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.270
And now in England to ourheart's great sorrow,

104
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:55.170
Shall be my winding-sheet.Why faint you, lords?

105
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.300
My title's good, andbetter far than his.

106
00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.300
Prove it, Henry, and thoushalt be king.

107
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.500
Henry the Fourth byconquest got the crown.

108
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.700
'Twas by rebellion againsthis king.

109
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.470
I know not what to say; mytitle's weak.--

110
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:16.200
Tell me, may not a kingadopt an heir?

111
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.430
What then?

112
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.730
An if he may, then am Ilawful king;

113
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:22.000
For Richard, in the viewof many lords,

114
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Resign'd the crown toHenry the Fourth,

115
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.830
Whose heir my father was,and I am his.

116
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.470
He rose against him, beinghis sovereign,

117
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.570
And made him to resign hiscrown perforce.

118
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:38.070
Suppose, my lords, he didit unconstrain'd,

119
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.930
Think you 'twereprejudicial to his crown?

120
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:49.200
No; for he could not soresign his crown

121
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.230
But that the next heirshould succeed and reign.

122
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.870
Art thou against us, Dukeof Exeter?

123
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.070
His is the right, andtherefore pardon me.

124
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.700
Why whisper you, my lords,and answer not?

125
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.730
My conscience tells me heis lawful king.

126
00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:05.970
All will revolt from me,and turn to him.

127
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.570
King Henry, be thy titleright or wrong,

128
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.830
Lord Clifford vows tofight in thy defence:

129
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.430
May that ground gape andswallow me alive,

130
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.900
Where I shall kneel to himthat slew my father!

131
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.930
O Clifford, how thy wordsrevive my heart!

132
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.400
Henry of Lancaster, resignthy crown.

133
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.670
Do right unto thisprincely Duke of York,

134
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.430
Or I will fill the housewith armed men,

135
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.430
And over the chair ofstate, where now he sits,

136
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.030
Write up his title withusurping blood.

137
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:42.330
(drums sound)

138
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.970
My Lord of Warwick, hearme but one word:

139
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:53.370
Let me for this mylife-time reign as king.

140
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:06.070
Confirm the crown to meand to mine heirs,

141
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.400
And thou shalt reign inquiet while thou livest.

142
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.770
Convey the soldiers hence,and then I will.

143
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.600
Captain: Conduct them into thefields.

144
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.470
Away!

145
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:34.600
I am content: RichardPlantagenet,

146
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.770
Enjoy the kingdom after mydecease.

147
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.400
What wrong is this untothe prince your son!

148
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.470
What good is this toEngland and himself!

149
00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.500
Base, fearful anddespairing Henry!

150
00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.570
How hast thou injured boththyself and us!

151
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:48.700
I cannot stay to hearthese articles.

152
00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:49.800
Nor I.

153
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.570
Come, cousin, let us tellthe queen these news.

154
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:55.270
Farewell, faint-heartedand degenerate king,

155
00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.200
In whose cold blood nospark of honour bides.

156
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.470
Be thou a prey unto thehouse of York,

157
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:05.800
And die in bands for thisunmanly deed!

158
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.800
In dreadful war mayst thoube overcome,

159
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.630
Or live in peace abandon'dand despised!

160
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:15.570
Turn this way, Henry, andregard them not.

161
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.170
They seek revenge andtherefore will not yield.

162
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.600
Ah, Exeter!

163
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.570
Why should you sigh, mylord?

164
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.230
Not for myself, LordWarwick, but my son,

165
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.130
Whom I unnaturally shalldisinherit.

166
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.570
But be it as it may:

167
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:42.270
I here entail The crown to theeand to thine heirs for ever;

168
00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.800
Conditionally, that herethou take thine oath

169
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.230
To cease this civil war,and, whilst I live,

170
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.070
To honour me as thy kingand sovereign,

171
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:54.430
And neither by treason norhostility

172
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.670
To seek to put me down andreign thyself.

173
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:10.670
This oath I willingly takeand will perform.

174
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.470
Long live the King!

175
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.430
(crowd chants) Long live theKing!

176
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.070
And long live thou andthese thy forward sons!

177
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.630
Now York and Lancaster arereconciled.

178
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:33.200
Accursed be he that seeksto make them foes!

179
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.930
(horn sounds)

180
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.000
Farewell, my graciouslord; I'll take my leave.

181
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.600
But I'll to Wakefield to mycastle.

182
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:53.670
And I'll keep London withmy soldiers.

183
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.600
And I to Norfolk with myfollowers.

184
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.100
And I, with grief andsorrow, to the court.

185
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.470
Here comes the queen, whoselooks bewray her anger:

186
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:07.300
I'll steal away.

187
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.800
Exeter, so will I.

188
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.170
Nay, go not from me; Iwill follow thee.

189
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.370
Be patient, gentle queen,and I will stay.

190
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.630
Who can be patient in suchextremes?

191
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.930
Ah, wretched man! would Ihad died a maid

192
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:23.130
And never seen thee, neverborne thee son,

193
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.330
Seeing thou hast proved sounnatural a father

194
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.430
Hath he deserved to losehis birthright thus?

195
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.330
Father, you cannotdisinherit me:

196
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.970
If you be king, why shouldnot I succeed?

197
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:36.230
Pardon me, Margaret;pardon me, sweet son:

198
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.400
The Earl of Warwick andthe duke enforced me.

199
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.530
Enforced thee! art thouking, and wilt be forced?

200
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.200
I shame to hear thee speak.Ah, timorous wretch!

201
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.030
Thou hast undone thyself,thy son and me;

202
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.970
And given unto the houseof York such head

203
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.270
As thou shalt reign but bytheir sufferance.

204
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.670
To entail him and hisheirs unto the crown,

205
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.270
What is it, but to makethy sepulchre

206
00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:07.730
And creep into it farbefore thy time?

207
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:11.300
Warwick is chancellor. Salisburylord of Calais;

208
00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.100
And the duke is made protectorof the realm;

209
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.970
And yet shalt thou besafe? such safety finds

210
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.370
The trembling lambenvironed with wolves.

211
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:22.800
Had I been there, which ama silly woman,

212
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.600
The soldiers should havetoss'd me on their pikes

213
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.230
Before I would havegranted to that act.

214
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:32.770
But thou preferr'st thylife before thine honour:

215
00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.270
And seeing thou dost, Ihere divorce myself

216
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.000
Both from thy table,Henry, and thy bed,

217
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.300
Until that act ofparliament be repeal'd

218
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.500
Whereby my son isdisinherited.

219
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:50.500
The northern lords thathave forsworn thy colours

220
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.030
Will follow mine, if oncethey see them spread;

221
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:56.030
And spread they shall be,to thy foul disgrace

222
00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.130
And utter ruin of thehouse of York.

223
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:05.100
Thus do I leave thee.Come, son, let's away;

224
00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.470
Our army is ready; come,we'll after them.

225
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.000
Stay, gentle Margaret, andhear me speak.

226
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.800
Thou hast spoke too muchalready: get thee gone.

227
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.700
Gentle son Edward, thouwilt stay with me?

228
00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.830
Ay, to be murder'd by hisenemies.

229
00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:18.500
When I return with victoryfrom the field

230
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.330
I'll see your grace: tillthen I'll follow her.

231
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:28.830
Come, son, away; we maynot linger thus.

232
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:32.230
Poor queen! how love to meand to her son

233
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:35.930
Hath made her break outinto terms of rage!

234
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.070
Revenged may she be onthat hateful duke,

235
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:41.070
Whose haughty spirit,winged with desire,

236
00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.830
Will cost my crown, andlike an empty eagle

237
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:50.570
Tire on the flesh of meand of my son!

238
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:55.070
The loss of those threelords torments my heart:

239
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.430
I'll write unto them andentreat them fair.

240
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.470
Come, cousin you shall bethe messenger.

241
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.230
And I, I hope, shallreconcile them all.

242
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.030
Brother, though I beyoungest, give me leave.

243
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.500
No, I can better play theorator.

244
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.430
But I have reasons strongand forcible.

245
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:23.630
Why, how now, sons! At astrife?

246
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.600
What is your quarrel? howbegan it first?

247
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.530
No quarrel, but a slightcontention.

248
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:33.830
About what?

249
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.700
About that which concernsyour grace and us;

250
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.470
The crown of England,father, which is yours.

251
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.600
Mine boy? not till KingHenry be dead.

252
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.700
Your right depends not onhis life or death.

253
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.070
Now you are heir,therefore enjoy it now:

254
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.200
By giving the house ofLancaster leave to breathe,

255
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.730
It will outrun you,father, in the end.

256
00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.600
I took an oath that heshould quietly reign.

257
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.570
But for a kingdom any oathmay be broken:

258
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.700
I would break a thousandoaths to reign one year.

259
00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.500
No; God forbid your graceshould be forsworn.

260
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.700
I shall be, if I claim byopen war.

261
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.470
I'll prove the contrary,if you'll hear me speak.

262
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.800
Thou canst not, son; it isimpossible.

263
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:22.530
An oath is of no moment,being not took

264
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:24.770
Before a true and lawfulmagistrate,

265
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.370
That hath authority overhim that swears:

266
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.270
Henry had none, but didusurp the place;

267
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.770
Then, seeing 'twas he thatmade you to depose,

268
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.400
Your oath, my lord, isvain and frivolous.

269
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.130
Therefore, to arms! And,father, do but think

270
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.970
How sweet a thing it is towear a crown;

271
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.070
Within whose circuit isElysium

272
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.970
And all that poets feignof bliss and joy.

273
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.100
Why do we linger thus? Icannot rest

274
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.270
Until the white rose thatI wear be dyed

275
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.430
Even in the lukewarm bloodof Henry's heart.

276
00:17:54.430 --> 00:18:04.600
Richard, enough; I will beking, or die.

277
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.370
Cousin, thou shalt toLondon presently,

278
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.470
And whet on Warwick tothis enterprise.

279
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.600
Richard and George, you shalt toNorfolk straight,

280
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.970
And tell him privily ofour intent.

281
00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.230
You Edward, shall to EdmundBrooke, Lord Cobham,

282
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.930
With whom the Kentishmenwill willingly rise:

283
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:22.930
In them I trust; for theyare soldiers,

284
00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.930
Witty, courteous, liberal,full of spirit.

285
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:28.430
While you are thus employ'd,what resteth more,

286
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:33.900
But that I seek occasionhow to rise,

287
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.070
And yet the king not privyto my drift,

288
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.070
Nor any of the house ofLancaster?

289
00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.500
(horn sounds)

290
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.530
But, stay: what news? Whycomest thou in such post?

291
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.100
The queen with all thenorthern earls and lords

292
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.100
Intend here to besiege youin your castle:

293
00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:51.930
She is hard by with twentythousand men;

294
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.930
And therefore fortify yourhold, my lord.

295
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.370
Ay, with my sword.

296
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.370
What! think'st thouthat we fear them?

297
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.030
Edward and Richard, youshall stay with me;(bell rings)

298
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.330
Haste you to London cousinMontague:

299
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.430
Let noble Warwick, Cobham,and the rest,

300
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:11.200
Whom we have leftprotectors of the king,

301
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.070
With powerful policystrengthen themselves,

302
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.330
And trust not simple Henrynor his oaths.

303
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.030
Cousin, I go; I'll winthem, fear it not:

304
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.500
Sir John and Sir HughMortimer, mine uncles,

305
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.930
You are come to Sandal ina happy hour;

306
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.130
The army of the queen meanto besiege us.

307
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:39.570
She shall not need; we'llmeet her in the field.

308
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.970
What, with five thousandmen?

309
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.070
Ay, with five hundred,father, for a need:

310
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.800
A woman's general; whatshould we fear?

311
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.370
I hear their drums: let'sset our men in order,

312
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.700
And issue forth and bidthem battle straight.

313
00:19:54.700 --> 00:20:03.030
Five men to twenty! thoughthe odds be great,

314
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:05.200
I doubt not, uncle, of ourvictory.

315
00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.800
Many a battle have I wonin France,

316
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:13.330
When as the enemy hathbeen ten to one:

317
00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.030
Why should I not now havethe like success?

318
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:23.530
(bells ring, drums beat)

319
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.230
Ah, whither shall I fly to'scape their hands?

320
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:14.070
Ah, tutor, look wherebloody Clifford comes!

321
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:21.830
Chaplain, away! thypriesthood saves thy life.

322
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.170
As for the brat of thisaccursed duke,

323
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.730
Whose father slew myfather, he shall die.

324
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.500
And I, my lord, will bearhim company.

325
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.500
Soldiers, away with him!

326
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.800
Ah, Clifford, murder notthis innocent child,

327
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.400
Lest thou be hated both ofGod and man!

328
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.730
How now! is he dead already?

329
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.900
Or is it fear that makes himclose his eyes? I'll open them.

330
00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.330
So looks the pent-up liono'er the wretch

331
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.770
That trembles under hisdevouring paws;

332
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.930
Sweet Clifford, hear mespeak before I die.

333
00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.600
I am too mean a subjectfor thy wrath:

334
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.600
Be thou revenged on men,and let me live.

335
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.130
In vain thouspeak'st, poor boy;

336
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.170
my father's blood hathstopp'd the passage

337
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.700
where thy words should enter.

338
00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.070
Then let my father's bloodopen it again:

339
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.800
He is a man, and,Clifford, cope with him.

340
00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:16.600
Had thy brethren here,their lives and thine

341
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.130
Were not revengesufficient for me;

342
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:24.070
No, if I digg'd up thyforefathers' graves

343
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.930
And hung their rottencoffins up in chains,

344
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.370
It could not slake mineire, nor ease my heart.

345
00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.930
The sight of any of thehouse of York

346
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:36.400
Is as a fury to torment mysoul;

347
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:39.270
And till I root out theiraccursed line

348
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.830
And leave not one alive, Ilive in hell.

349
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:44.700
Therefore--

350
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.870
O, let me pray before Itake my death!

351
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:50.000
To thee I pray; sweetClifford, pity me!

352
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.630
Such pity as my rapier'spoint affords.

353
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.130
I never did thee harm: whywilt thou slay me?

354
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:55.530
Thy father hath.

355
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.470
But 'twas ere I was born.

356
00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.370
Thou hast one son; for hissake pity me,

357
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:06.600
Thy father slew my father;therefore, die.

358
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.830
Di faciant laudis summasit ista tuae!

359
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.630
Plantagenet! I come,Plantagenet!

360
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.600
And this thy son's bloodcleaving to my blade

361
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.930
Shall rust upon my weapon,till thy blood,

362
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:28.100
Congeal'd with this, domake me wipe off both.

363
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.630
The army of the queen hathgot the field:

364
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.730
My uncles both are slainin rescuing me;

365
00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.570
And all my followers tothe eager foe

366
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.000
Turn back and fly, likeships before the wind

367
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.230
Or lambs pursued byhunger-starved wolves.

368
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:53.500
My sons, God knows whathath bechanced them:

369
00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.130
But this I know, they havedemean'd themselves

370
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.370
Like men born to renown bylife or death.

371
00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.670
Three times did Richardmake a lane to me.

372
00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.400
And thrice cried 'Courage,father! fight it out!'

373
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.530
And full as oft cameEdward to my side,

374
00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.930
With purple falchion,painted to the hilt

375
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.370
In blood of those that hadencounter'd him:

376
00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.200
And when the hardiestwarriors did retire,

377
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.300
and George cried 'Charge! andgive no foot of ground!'

378
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:28.500
Edward.  'A crown, orelse a glorious tomb!

379
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.930
A sceptre, or an earthlysepulchre!'

380
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:37.000
With this, we chargedagain: but, out, alas!

381
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.330
We bodged again; as I haveseen a swan

382
00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.130
With bootless labour swimagainst the tide

383
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.730
And spend her strengthwith over-matching waves.

384
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.630
(trumpets sound)

385
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:59.170
Ah, hark! the fatalfollowers do pursue;

386
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:05.170
And I am faint and cannotfly their fury:

387
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:14.600
And were I strong, I wouldnot shun their fury:

388
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.130
The sands are number'dthat make up my life;

389
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:24.030
Here must I stay, and heremy life must end.

390
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:46.470
Come, bloody Clifford,rough Northumberland,

391
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:52.230
I dare your quenchlessfury to more rage:

392
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:57.570
I am your butt, and Iabide your shot.

393
00:26:57.570 --> 00:27:01.430
Yield to our mercy, proudPlantagenet.

394
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.270
Ay, to such mercy as hisruthless arm,

395
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.870
With downright payment,show'd unto my father.

396
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:11.070
My ashes, like the phoenix,may bring forth

397
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:16.870
A bird that will revengeupon you all:

398
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.730
And in that hope I throwmine eyes to heaven,

399
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:26.100
Scorning whate'er you canafflict me with.

400
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:31.330
Why come you not? what!multitudes, and fear?

401
00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:35.600
So cowards fight when theycan fly no further;

402
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:40.570
So doves do peck thefalcon's piercing talons;

403
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.930
So desperate thieves, allhopeless of their lives,

404
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.700
Breathe out invectives'gainst the officers.

405
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:54.900
O Clifford, but bethinkthee once again,

406
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.370
And in thy thoughto'er-run my former time;

407
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.970
And, if though canst forblushing, view this face,

408
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.400
And bite thy tongue, thatslanders him with cowardice

409
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.830
Whose frown hath made theefaint and fly ere this!

410
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.100
I will not bandy with theeword for word,

411
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.070
But buckle with theeblows, twice two for one.

412
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.370
Hold, valiant Clifford!for a thousand causes

413
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.700
I would prolong awhile thetraitor's life.

414
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.500
Wrath makes him deaf: speakthou, Northumberland.

415
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.570
Hold, Clifford! do nothonour him so much

416
00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.870
To prick thy finger,though to wound his heart:

417
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.000
What valour were it, whena cur doth grin,

418
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.200
For one to thrust his handbetween his teeth,

419
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.170
When he might spurn himwith his foot away?

420
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.270
It is war's prize to takeall vantages;

421
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:42.900
And ten to one is noimpeach of valour.

422
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.370
Ay, ay, so strives thewoodcock with the gin.

423
00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.100
So doth the cony strugglein the net.

424
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.530
So triumph thieves upontheir conquer'd booty;

425
00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:18.000
So true men yield, withrobbers so o'ermatch'd.

426
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.900
What would your grace havedone unto him now?

427
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:25.370
Brave warriors, Cliffordand Northumberland,

428
00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:30.270
Come, make him stand uponthis molehill here,

429
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.830
That raught at mountainswith outstretched arms,

430
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.000
Yet parted but the shadowwith his hand.

431
00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:53.170
(laughing)

432
00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:03.200
What! was it you thatwould be England's king?

433
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.400
Was't you that revell'd inour parliament,

434
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.830
And made a preachment ofyour high descent?

435
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:15.300
Where are your mess ofsons to back you now?

436
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.500
The wanton Edward, and thelusty George?

437
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:24.470
And where's that valiantcrook-back prodigy,

438
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.830
Dicky your boy, that withhis grumbling voice

439
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.970
Was wont to cheer his dadin mutinies?

440
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:37.630
Or, with the rest, whereis your darling Rutland?

441
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:46.970
Look, York: I stain'd thisnapkin with the blood

442
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.570
That valiant Clifford,with his rapier's point,

443
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:55.000
Made issue from thebosom of the boy;

444
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.770
And if thine eyes canwater for his death,

445
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:05.870
I give thee this to drythy cheeks withal.

446
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:15.670
Alas poor York! but that Ihate thee deadly,

447
00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:20.300
I should lament thymiserable state.

448
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:25.130
I prithee, grieve, to makeme merry, York.

449
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:29.870
What, hath thy fiery heartso parch'd thine entrails

450
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:34.470
That not a tear can fallfor Rutland's death?

451
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.270
Why art thou patient, man?thou shouldst be mad;

452
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.800
And I, to make thee mad,do mock thee thus.

453
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:54.930
Stamp, rave, and fret,that I may sing and dance.

454
00:31:54.930 --> 00:32:01.130
Thou wouldst be fee'd, Isee, to make me sport:

455
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:07.030
York cannot speak, unlesshe wears a crown.

456
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:17.130
A crown for York! and,lords, bow low to him:

457
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:24.000
Hold you his hands, whilstI do set it on.

458
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:36.170
Ay, marry, sir, now lookshe like a king!

459
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:42.570
Ay, this is he that tookKing Henry's chair,

460
00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:48.130
And this is he was hisadopted heir.

461
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.330
But how is it that greatPlantagenet

462
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:55.930
Is crown'd so soon, andbroke his solemn oath?

463
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.300
As I bethink me, youshould not be king

464
00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.330
Till our King Henry hadshook hands with death.

465
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.500
And will you pale yourhead in Henry's glory,

466
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.600
And rob his temples of thediadem,

467
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.270
Now in his life, againstyour holy oath?

468
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:19.530
O, 'tis a fault too toounpardonable!

469
00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:26.900
Off with the crown, andwith the crown his head;

470
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:36.100
And, whilst we breathe,take time to do him dead.

471
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.670
That is my office, for myfather's sake.

472
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:45.330
Nay, stay; lets hear theorisons he makes.

473
00:33:54.030 --> 00:34:00.200
She-wolf of France, butworse than wolves of France,

474
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.600
Whose tongue more poisonsthan the adder's tooth!

475
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.100
How ill-beseeming is it inthy sex

476
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.730
To triumph, like anAmazonian trull,

477
00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:15.900
Upon their woes whomfortune captivates!

478
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:21.300
But that thy face is,vizard-like, unchanging,

479
00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.630
Made impudent with use ofevil deeds,

480
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:29.170
I would assay, proudqueen, to make thee blush.

481
00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:32.200
To tell thee whence thoucamest, of whom derived,

482
00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:37.200
Were shame enough to shamethee, wert thou not shameless.

483
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:42.570
Thy father bears the typeof King of Naples,

484
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.670
Of both the Sicils andJerusalem,

485
00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.200
Yet not so wealthy as anEnglish yeoman.

486
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.700
Hath that poor monarchtaught thee to insult?

487
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:57.870
'Tis beauty that doth oftmake women proud;

488
00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:02.500
But, God he knows, thyshare thereof is small:

489
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.070
'Tis virtue that doth makethem most admired;

490
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:10.470
The contrary doth makethee wonder'd at:

491
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.870
'Tis government that makesthem seem divine;

492
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:19.330
The want thereof makesthee abominable:

493
00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:25.330
O tiger's heart wrapt in awoman's hide!

494
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.530
How couldst thou drain thelife-blood of the child,

495
00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.530
To bid the father wipe hiseyes withal,

496
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:37.630
And yet be seen to bear awoman's face?

497
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:43.570
Women are soft, mild,pitiful and flexible;

498
00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:49.830
Thou stern, obdurate,flinty, rough, remorseless.

499
00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:56.730
Bids't thou me rage? why,now thou hast thy wish:

500
00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:01.430
Wouldst have me weep? why,now thou hast thy will:

501
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.230
For raging wind blows upincessant showers,

502
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:09.100
And when the rage allays,the rain begins.

503
00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:17.330
These tears are my sweetRutland's obsequies:

504
00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:22.530
And every drop criesvengeance for his death,

505
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:28.400
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford,and thee, false Frenchwoman.

506
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:31.900
Beshrew me, but hispassion moves me so

507
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.570
That hardly can I chequemy eyes from tears.

508
00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:40.030
That face of his thehungry cannibals

509
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:42.970
Would not have touch'd, wouldnot have stain'd with blood:

510
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:48.570
But you are more inhuman,more inexorable,

511
00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:54.330
O, ten times more, thantigers of Hyrcania.

512
00:36:54.330 --> 00:37:02.300
See, ruthless queen, ahapless father's tears:

513
00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:12.300
This cloth thou dip'dst inblood of my sweet boy,

514
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:19.670
And I with tears do washthe blood away.

515
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:28.970
Keep thou the napkin, andgo boast of this:

516
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.000
And if thou tell'st theheavy story right,

517
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.900
Upon my soul, the hearerswill shed tears;

518
00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:40.770
Yea even my foes will shedfast-falling tears,

519
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:47.700
And say 'Alas, it was apiteous deed!'

520
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:08.230
There, take the crown, and,with the crown, my curse;

521
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.570
And in thy need suchcomfort come to thee

522
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:14.170
As now I reap at thy toocruel hand!

523
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.400
Hard-hearted Clifford,take me from the world:

524
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:31.270
My soul to heaven, myblood upon your heads!

525
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:35.630
Had he been slaughter-manto all my kin,

526
00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:39.100
I should not for my lifebut weep with him.

527
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.570
To see how inly sorrowgripes his soul.

528
00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:50.200
What, weeping-ripe, myLord Northumberland?

529
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.970
Think but upon the wronghe did us all,

530
00:38:53.970 --> 00:39:00.630
And that will quickly drythy melting tears.

531
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:09.030
Here's for my oath, here'sfor my father's death.

532
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:18.200
And here's to right ourgentle-hearted king.

533
00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.570
Open Thy gate of mercy,gracious God!

534
00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:35.030
My soul flies through thesewounds to seek out Thee.

535
00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:51.770
Off with his head, and setit on York gates;

536
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:57.300
That York may overlook thetown of York.

537
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:28.330
I wonder how our princelyfather 'scaped,

538
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:30.300
Or whether he be 'scapedaway or no

539
00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.170
From Clifford's andNorthumberland's pursuit:

540
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:34.430
Had he been ta'en, weshould have heard the news;

541
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:36.330
Had he been slain, weshould have heard the news;

542
00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:38.200
Or had he 'scaped, methinkswe should have heard

543
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.370
The happy tidings of hisgood escape.

544
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:48.070
How fares my brother? whyis he so sad?

545
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.900
I cannot joy, until I beresolved

546
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.330
Where our right valiantfather is become.

547
00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.470
I saw him in the battlerange about;

548
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.930
And watch'd him how hesingled Clifford forth.

549
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.670
Methought he bore him inthe thickest troop

550
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:07.500
As doth a lion in a herdof neat;

551
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.970
Or as a bear, encompass'dround with dogs,

552
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.430
Who having pinch'd a fewand made them cry,

553
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:15.400
The rest stand all aloof,and bark at him.

554
00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.270
So fared our father withhis enemies;

555
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.100
So fled his enemies mywarlike father:

556
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.600
Methinks, 'tis prizeenough to be his son.

557
00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.230
See how the morning opesher golden gates,

558
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.800
And takes her farewell ofthe glorious sun!

559
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.370
How well resembles it theprime of youth,

560
00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:42.230
Trimm'd like a younkerprancing to his love!

561
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:53.600
Dazzle mine eyes, or do Isee three suns?

562
00:41:54.570 --> 00:42:01.900
Three glorious suns, eachone a perfect sun;

563
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.900
Not separated with theracking clouds,

564
00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:08.230
But sever'd in a paleclear-shining sky.

565
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:14.000
See, see! they join,embrace, and seem to kiss,

566
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.270
As if they vow'd someleague inviolable:

567
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:22.870
Now are they but one lamp,one light, one sun.

568
00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:25.570
In this the heaven figuressome event.

569
00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:29.330
'Tis wondrous strange, thelike yet never heard of.

570
00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:34.670
I think it cites us,brother, to the field,

571
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.530
That we, the sons of bravePlantagenet,

572
00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.700
Each one already blazingby our meeds,

573
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.770
Should notwithstandingjoin our lights together

574
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.800
And over-shine the earthas this the world.

575
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.670
Whate'er it bodes,henceforward will I bear

576
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:56.570
Upon my target threefair-shining suns.

577
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:58.630
Nay, bear three daughters:by your leave I speak it,

578
00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.300
You love the breederbetter than the male.

579
00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:09.400
But what art thou, whoseheavy looks foretell

580
00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:12.430
Some dreadful storyhanging on thy tongue?

581
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:16.770
Ah, one that was a wofullooker-on

582
00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.200
When as the noble Duke ofYork was slain,

583
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.100
Your princely father andmy loving lord!

584
00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.730
O, speak no more, for Ihave heard too much.

585
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:28.900
Say how he died, for Iwill hear it all.

586
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.870
Environed he was with manyfoes,

587
00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:36.600
And stood against them, asthe hope of Troy

588
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.830
Against the Greeks thatwould have enter'd Troy.

589
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.630
But Hercules himself mustyield to odds;

590
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.030
And many strokes, thoughwith a little axe,

591
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:48.370
Hew down and fell thehardest-timber'd oak.

592
00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:51.430
By many hands your fatherwas subdued;

593
00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.130
But only slaughter'd bythe ireful arm

594
00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:56.400
Of unrelenting Cliffordand the queen,

595
00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:59.200
Who crown'd the graciousduke in high despite,

596
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.700
Laugh'd in his face; andwhen with grief he wept,

597
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.770
The ruthless queen gavehim to dry his cheeks

598
00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.400
A napkin steeped in theharmless blood

599
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.270
Of sweet young Rutland, byrough Clifford slain:

600
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:15.000
And after many scorns,many foul taunts,

601
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.070
They took his head, and onthe gates of York

602
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.730
They set the same; andthere it doth remain,

603
00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.100
The saddest spectacle thate'er I view'd.

604
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:38.230
Sweet Duke of York, ourprop to lean upon,

605
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:43.200
Now thou art gone, we haveno staff, no stay.

606
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:50.700
O Clifford, savageClifford! thou hast slain

607
00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:56.300
The flower of Europe forhis chivalry;

608
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.430
And treacherously hastthou vanquish'd him,

609
00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:01.270
For hand to hand he wouldhave vanquish'd thee.

610
00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.900
Now my soul's palace isbecome a prison:

611
00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.600
Ah, would she break fromhence, that this my body

612
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.100
Might in the ground beclosed up in rest!

613
00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:23.470
For never henceforth shallI joy again,

614
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:30.600
Never, O never shall I seemore joy!

615
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:37.970
I cannot weep; for all mybody's moisture

616
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:44.270
Scarce serves to quench myfurnace-burning heart:

617
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:48.470
Nor can my tongue unloadmy heart's great burthen;

618
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.470
For selfsame wind that Ishould speak withal

619
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:53.530
Is kindling coals thatfires all my breast,

620
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:57.100
And burns me up with flamesthat tears would quench.

621
00:45:59.270 --> 00:46:03.130
To weep is to make lessthe depth of grief:

622
00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:06.500
Tears then for babes;blows and revenge for me

623
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:09.600
Richard, I bear thy name;I'll venge thy death,

624
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.330
Or die renowned byattempting it.

625
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:15.200
His name that valiant dukehath left with thee;

626
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.170
His dukedom and his chairwith me is left.

627
00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:19.170
Nay, if thou be thatprincely eagle's bird,

628
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:22.000
Show thy descent by gazing'gainst the sun:

629
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.730
For chair and dukedom,throne and kingdom say;

630
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.130
Either that is thine, or elsethou wert not his.

631
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:32.570
(drums sound)

632
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:47.370
How now, fair lords! Whatfare? what news abroad?

633
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:53.100
Great Lord of Warwick, ifwe should recount

634
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:57.270
Our baleful news, and ateach word's deliverance

635
00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:01.370
Stab poniards in our fleshtill all were told,

636
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:05.230
The words would add moreanguish than the wounds.

637
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.300
O valiant lord, the Dukeof York is slain!

638
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:17.530
O Warwick, Warwick! thatPlantagenet,

639
00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:21.000
Which held three dearly ashis soul's redemption,

640
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.770
Is by the stern LordClifford done to death.

641
00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.530
Ten days ago I drown'dthese news in tears;

642
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:39.630
And now, to add moremeasure to your woes,

643
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:42.870
I come to tell you thingssith then befall'n.

644
00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:03.570
After the bloody fray atWakefield fought,

645
00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:07.600
Where your brave fatherbreathed his latest gasp,

646
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.470
Tidings, as swiftly as theposts could run,

647
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:14.170
Were brought me of yourloss and his depart.

648
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.570
I, then in London keeperof the king,

649
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:19.070
Muster'd my soldiers,gather'd flocks of friends,

650
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:23.130
And very well appointed,as I thought,

651
00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:26.670
March'd toward Saint Alban'sto intercept the queen,

652
00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.100
Bearing the king in mybehalf along;

653
00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.570
For by my scouts I wasadvertised

654
00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.070
That she was coming with afull intent

655
00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:33.370
To dash our late decree inparliament

656
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:38.300
Touching King Henry's oathand your succession.

657
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:45.100
Short tale to make, we atSaint Alban's met

658
00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:51.570
Our battles join'd, andboth sides fiercely fought:

659
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:56.170
But whether 'twas thecoldness of the king,

660
00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:58.770
Who look'd full gently onhis warlike queen,

661
00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:02.400
That robb'd my soldiers oftheir heated spleen;

662
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.630
Or whether 'twas report ofher success;

663
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.470
Or more than common fearof Clifford's rigour,

664
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:10.870
Who thunders to hiscaptives blood and death,

665
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:18.600
I cannot judge: but toconclude with truth,

666
00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.930
Their weapons like tolightning came and went;

667
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.830
Our soldiers', like thenight-owl's lazy flight,

668
00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.630
Or like an idle thresherwith a flail,

669
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:34.700
Fell gently down, as ifthey struck their friends.

670
00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:38.970
I cheer'd them up withjustice of our cause,

671
00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:42.830
With promise of high payand great rewards:

672
00:49:42.830 --> 00:49:50.170
But all in vain; they hadno heart to fight,

673
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:56.700
And we in them no hope towin the day;

674
00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:02.930
So that we fled; the kingunto the queen;

675
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:04.330
My Lord the Duke ofNorfolk and myself,

676
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:06.470
In haste, post-haste, arecome to join with you:

677
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.570
For in the marches here weheard you were,

678
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.770
Making another head tofight again.

679
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:17.300
Where is the Duke ofNorfolk, gentle Warwick?

680
00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:21.270
Some six miles off theduke is with the soldiers;

681
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:26.930
'Twas odds, belike, whenvaliant Warwick fled:

682
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:29.430
Oft have I heard hispraises in pursuit,

683
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:34.370
But ne'er till now hisscandal of retire.

684
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:41.100
Nor now my scandal,Richard, dost thou hear;

685
00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:44.500
For thou shalt know thisstrong right hand of mine

686
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.900
Can pluck the diadem fromfaint Henry's head,

687
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.370
And wring the awfulsceptre from his fist,

688
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.230
Were he as famous and asbold in war

689
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:57.600
As he is famed for mildness,peace, and prayer.

690
00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.270
I know it well, LordWarwick; blame me not:

691
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:04.830
'Tis love I bear thyglories makes me speak.

692
00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:08.430
But in this troublous timewhat's to be done?

693
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:11.830
Shall we go throw away ourcoats of steel,

694
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:14.030
And wrap our bodies inblack mourning gowns,

695
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:16.970
Numbering our Ave-Marieswith our beads?

696
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.670
Or shall we on the helmetsof our foes

697
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:21.430
Tell our devotion withrevengeful arms?

698
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:24.870
If for the last, say ay,and to it, lords.

699
00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:31.370
Why, therefore Warwickcame to seek you out;

700
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:35.730
And therefore comes mybrother Montague.

701
00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:44.300
Attend me, lords. Theproud insulting queen,

702
00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.630
With Clifford and thehaught Northumberland,

703
00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:47.500
And of their feather manymore proud birds,

704
00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.970
Have wrought theeasy-melting king like wax.

705
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:53.200
He swore consent to yoursuccession,

706
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.530
His oath enrolled in theparliament;

707
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.500
And now to London all thecrew are gone,

708
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.530
To frustrate both his oathand what beside

709
00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.500
May make against the houseof Lancaster.

710
00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:09.870
Their power, I think, isthirty thousand strong:

711
00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:14.170
Now, if the help ofNorfolk and myself,

712
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:17.170
With all the friends thatthou, brave Earl of March,

713
00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:19.270
Amongst the lovingWelshmen canst procure,

714
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:24.000
Will but amount to fiveand twenty thousand,

715
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.270
Why, Via! to London willwe march amain,

716
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:31.400
And once again cry 'Chargeupon our foes!'

717
00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.370
But never once again turnback and fly.

718
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.200
Ay, now methinks I heargreat Warwick speak:

719
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.400
Ne'er may he live to see asunshine day,

720
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.700
That cries 'Retire,' ifWarwick bid him stay.

721
00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.530
Lord Warwick, on thyshoulder will I lean;

722
00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.300
And when thou fail'st--asGod forbid the hour!--

723
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.370
Must Edward fall, whichperil heaven forfend!

724
00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:58.470
No longer Earl of March,but Duke of York:

725
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:02.700
The next degree isEngland's royal throne;

726
00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:05.130
For King of England shaltthou be proclaim'd

727
00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:07.530
In every borough as wepass along;

728
00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:10.300
And he that throws not uphis cap for joy

729
00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.170
Shall for the fault makeforfeit of his head.

730
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:22.730
King Edward, George, braveRichard, Montague,

731
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:27.300
Stay we no longer,dreaming of renown,

732
00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:30.000
But sound the trumpets,and about our task.

733
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.930
Then, Clifford, were thyheart as hard as steel,

734
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.070
As thou hast shown itflinty by thy deeds,

735
00:53:35.070 --> 00:53:37.470
I come to pierce it, or togive thee mine.

736
00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:42.200
Then strike up drums: Godand Saint George for us!

737
00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.800
(drums sound) (groupscreams) God and St. George!

738
00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.930
How now! what news?

739
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:49.630
The Duke of Norfolk sendsyou word by me,

740
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:51.370
The queen is coming with apuissant host;

741
00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:53.730
And craves your companyfor speedy counsel.

742
00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:59.270
Why then it sorts, bravewarriors, let's away.

743
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:13.530
(drums pounding, trumpetblaring)

744
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:34.430
Welcome, my lord, to thisbrave town of York.

745
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:36.370
Yonder's the head of thatarch-enemy

746
00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:39.830
That sought to beencompass'd with your crown:

747
00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:42.870
Doth not the object cheeryour heart, my lord?

748
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:48.870
Ay, as the rocks cheer themthat fear their wreck:

749
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:51.930
To see this sight, it irksmy very soul.

750
00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:53.430
Withhold revenge, dearGod! 'tis not my fault,

751
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.330
Nor wittingly have Iinfringed my vow.

752
00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:02.100
My gracious liege, thistoo much lenity

753
00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.430
And harmful pity must belaid aside.

754
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:09.830
To whom do lions casttheir gentle looks?

755
00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:13.970
Not to the beast thatwould usurp their den.

756
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:17.270
Whose hand is that theforest bear doth lick?

757
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:20.630
Not his that spoils heryoung before her face.

758
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:24.300
Who 'scapes the lurkingserpent's mortal sting?

759
00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.100
Not he that sets his footupon her back.

760
00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.400
The smallest worm willturn being trodden on,

761
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.870
And doves will peck insafeguard of their brood.

762
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:37.000
Ambitious York doth levelat thy crown,

763
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.770
Thou smiling while he knithis angry brows:

764
00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:44.530
He, but a duke, would havehis son a king,

765
00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:47.800
And raise his issue, likea loving sire;

766
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:52.500
Thou, being a king, blestwith a goodly son,

767
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.630
Didst yield consent todisinherit him,

768
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:57.530
Which argued thee a mostunloving father.

769
00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:01.630
Unreasonable creaturesfeed their young;

770
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.570
And though man's face befearful to their eyes,

771
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:06.970
Yet, in protection oftheir tender ones,

772
00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:09.830
Who hath not seen them,even with those wings

773
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.730
Which sometime they haveused with fearful flight,

774
00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:14.730
Make war with him thatclimb'd unto their nest,

775
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.430
Offer their own lives intheir young's defence?

776
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:23.900
For shame, my liege, makethem your precedent!

777
00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.430
Were it not pity thatthis goodly boy

778
00:56:26.430 --> 00:56:29.630
Should lose his birthrightby his father's fault,

779
00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:32.830
And long hereafter sayunto his child,

780
00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:34.900
'What my great-grandfatherand his grandsire got

781
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:38.600
My careless father fondlygave away'?

782
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:45.000
Ah, what a shame werethis! Look on the boy;

783
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.270
And let his manly face,which promiseth

784
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:50.230
Successful fortune, steelthy melting heart

785
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:54.530
To hold thine own andleave thine own with him.

786
00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:00.530
Full well hath Cliffordplay'd the orator,

787
00:57:00.530 --> 00:57:03.870
Inferring arguments ofmighty force.

788
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:06.070
But, Clifford, tell me,didst thou never hear

789
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:10.230
That things ill-got hadever bad success?

790
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:13.870
I'll leave my son myvirtuous deeds behind;

791
00:57:13.870 --> 00:57:16.030
And would my father hadleft me no more!

792
00:57:16.030 --> 00:57:19.000
For all the rest is heldat such a rate

793
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.630
As brings a thousand-foldmore care to keep

794
00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:26.430
Than in possession and jotof pleasure.

795
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:29.870
Ah, cousin York! would thybest friends did know

796
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:32.970
How it doth grieve me thatthy head stands here!

797
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:40.770
My lord, cheer up yourspirits: your foes are nigh,

798
00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:45.630
And this soft courage makesyour followers faint.

799
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:47.770
You promised knighthood toour forward son:

800
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:49.800
Unsheathe your sword, anddub him presently.

801
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.930
Edward, kneel down.

802
00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:04.800
Edward Plantagenet, arisea knight;

803
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:11.630
And learn this lesson,draw thy sword in right.

804
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.130
My gracious father, byyour kingly leave,

805
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:16.570
I'll draw it as apparentto the crown,

806
00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:18.630
And in that quarrel use itto the death.

807
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:22.200
Why, that is spoken like atoward prince.

808
00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.970
Royal commanders, be inreadiness:

809
00:58:23.970 --> 00:58:25.300
For with a band of thirtythousand men comes Warwick,

810
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:26.730
backing of the Duke of York;

811
00:58:26.730 --> 00:58:28.970
And in the towns, as theydo march along,

812
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:31.170
Proclaims him king, andmany fly to him:

813
00:58:31.170 --> 00:58:33.430
Darraign your battle, forthey are at hand.

814
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:35.070
I would your highnesswould depart the field:

815
00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:36.700
The queen hath best successwhen you are absent.

816
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:38.770
Ay, good my lord, andleave us to our fortune.

817
00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:40.800
Why, that's my fortunetoo; therefore I'll stay.

818
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.470
Be it with resolution thento fight.

819
00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.770
My royal father, cheerthese noble lords

820
00:58:46.770 --> 00:58:49.700
And hearten those thatfight in your defence:

821
00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.000
Unsheathe your sword, goodfather; cry 'Saint George!'

822
00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.530
Now, perjured Henry! wiltthou kneel for grace,

823
00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:13.030
And set thy diadem upon myhead;

824
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:15.900
Or bide the mortal fortuneof the field?

825
00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:22.130
Go, rate thy minions,proud insulting boy!

826
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:24.770
Becomes it thee to be thusbold in terms

827
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:28.830
Before thy sovereign andthy lawful king?

828
00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:32.370
I am his king, and heshould bow his knee;

829
00:59:32.370 --> 00:59:33.830
I was adopted heir by hisconsent:

830
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:36.600
Since when, his oath isbroke; for, as I hear,

831
00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:39.100
You, that are king, thoughhe do wear the crown,

832
00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.170
Have caused him, by newact of parliament,

833
00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:43.330
To blot out me, and puthis own son in.

834
00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.400
And reason too:

835
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.900
Who should succeed thefather but the son?

836
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:50.800
Are you there, butcher? O,I cannot speak!

837
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.130
Ay, crook-back, here Istand to answer thee,

838
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:56.270
Or any he the proudest ofthy sort.

839
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:57.970
'Twas you that kill'dyoung Rutland, was it not?

840
00:59:57.970 --> 01:00:01.200
Ay, and old York, and yetnot satisfied.

841
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.770
For God's sake, lords,give signal to the fight.

842
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:06.700
What say'st thou, Henry,wilt thou yield the crown?

843
01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:12.500
Why, how now, long-tonguedWarwick! dare you speak?

844
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.000
When you and I met atSaint Alban's last,

845
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.700
Your legs did betterservice than your hands.

846
01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:21.800
Then 'twas my turn to flee,and now 'tis thine.

847
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.130
You said so much before,and yet you fled.

848
01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.370
'Twas not your valour,Clifford, drove me thence.

849
01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:30.470
No, nor your manhood thatdurst make you stay.

850
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:33.000
Break off the parley; forscarce I can refrain

851
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.500
The execution of mybig-swoln heart

852
01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.900
Upon that Clifford, thatcruel child-killer.

853
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.770
I slew thy father, call'stthou him a child?

854
01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:43.400
Ay, like a dastard and atreacherous coward,

855
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.070
As thou didst kill ourtender brother Rutland;

856
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:49.400
But ere sunset I'll makethee curse the deed.

857
01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.870
Have done with words, mylords, and hear me speak.

858
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:53.900
Defy them then, or elsehold close thy lips.

859
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.500
I prithee, give no limitsto my tongue:

860
01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.130
I am a king, andprivileged to speak.

861
01:00:57.130 --> 01:00:58.800
My liege, the wound thatbred this meeting here

862
01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.300
Cannot be cured by words;therefore be still.

863
01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.930
Then, executioner,unsheathe thy sword:

864
01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:06.070
By him that made us all, Iam resolved

865
01:01:06.070 --> 01:01:09.100
that Clifford's manhoodlies upon his tongue.

866
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:13.570
Say, Henry, shall I havemy right, or no?

867
01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:14.700
A thousand men have broketheir fasts to-day,

868
01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.800
That ne'er shall dine unlessthou yield the crown.

869
01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.630
If thou deny, their bloodupon thy head;

870
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:23.500
For York in justice putshis armour on.

871
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.770
If that be right whichWarwick says is right,

872
01:01:25.770 --> 01:01:28.670
There is no wrong, butevery thing is right.

873
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:31.300
Whoever got thee, therethy mother stands;

874
01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.000
For, well I wot, thou hastthy mother's tongue.

875
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.870
But thou art neither likethy sire nor dam;

876
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:39.770
But like a foul mis-shapenstigmatic,

877
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:42.200
Mark'd by the destinies tobe avoided,

878
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.670
As venom toads, orlizards' dreadful stings.

879
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.970
Iron of Naples hid withEnglish gilt,

880
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:52.700
Whose father bears thetitle of a king,--

881
01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:55.070
As if a channel should becall'd the sea,--

882
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.800
Shamest thou not, knowingwhence thou art extraught,

883
01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.070
To let thy tongue detectthy base-born heart?

884
01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:04.530
A wisp of straw were wortha thousand crowns,

885
01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:07.930
To make this shamelesscallet know herself.

886
01:02:07.930 --> 01:02:11.200
Helen of Greece was fairerfar than thou,

887
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.770
Although thy husband maybe Menelaus;

888
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:15.930
And ne'er was Agamemnon'sbrother wrong'd

889
01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:19.630
By that false woman, asthis king by thee.

890
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:22.370
His father revell'd in theheart of France,

891
01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:25.030
And tamed the king, andmade the dauphin stoop;

892
01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:26.670
And had he match'daccording to his state,

893
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.430
He might have kept thatglory to this day;

894
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:33.100
But when he took a beggarto his bed,

895
01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:37.770
And graced thy poor sirewith his bridal-day,

896
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:40.670
Even then that sunshinebrew'd a shower for him,

897
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:43.970
That wash'd his father'sfortunes forth of France,

898
01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:47.130
And heap'd sedition on hiscrown at home.

899
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.530
For what hath broach'dthis tumult but thy pride?

900
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:53.700
Hadst thou been meek, ourtitle still had slept;

901
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.570
And we, in pity of thegentle king,

902
01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:57.800
Had slipp'd our claimuntil another age.

903
01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:00.130
But when we saw oursunshine made thy spring,

904
01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:01.830
And that thy summer bredus no increase,

905
01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:04.870
We set the axe to thyusurping root;

906
01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:06.870
And though the edge hathsomething hit ourselves,

907
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:09.200
Yet, know thou, since wehave begun to strike,

908
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.400
We'll never leave till wehave hewn thee down,

909
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.970
Or bathed thy growing withour heated bloods.

910
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:16.600
And, in this resolution, Idefy thee;

911
01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:18.130
Not willing any longerconference,

912
01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.130
Since thou deniest thegentle king to speak.

913
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.070
Sound trumpets! let ourbloody colours wave!

914
01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:24.300
And either victory, orelse a grave.

915
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.370
Stay, Edward.

916
01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:27.400
No, wrangling woman, we'llno longer stay:

917
01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.400
These words will cost tenthousand lives this day.

918
01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:40.430
(drums sound)

919
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:51.200
(drums sound)

920
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.870
(canons boom)

921
01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:52.930
Forspent with toil, asrunners with a race,

922
01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:57.930
I lay me down a littlewhile to breathe;

923
01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:02.170
For strokes received, andmany blows repaid,

924
01:05:02.170 --> 01:05:04.900
Have robb'd my strong-knitsinews of their strength,

925
01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:11.430
And spite of spite needsmust I rest awhile.

926
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.270
Smile, gentle heaven! orstrike, ungentle death!

927
01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:24.470
For this world frowns, andEdward's sun is clouded.

928
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:26.470
How now, my lord! whathap? what hope of good?

929
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:28.900
Our hap is loss, our hopebut sad despair;

930
01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:31.400
Our ranks are broke, andruin follows us:

931
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.470
What counsel give you?whither shall we fly?

932
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:35.870
Bootless is flight, theyfollow us with wings;

933
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:38.030
And weak we are and cannotshun pursuit.

934
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:42.500
Ah, Warwick, why hast thouwithdrawn thyself?

935
01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.770
Thy brother's blood thethirsty earth hath drunk,

936
01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:48.830
Broach'd with the steelypoint of Clifford's lance;

937
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:50.670
And in the very pangs ofdeath he cried,

938
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:53.800
Like to a dismal clangourheard from far,

939
01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:58.070
'Warwick, revenge! myson, revenge my death!'

940
01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:00.430
So, underneath the bellyof their steeds,

941
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:03.530
That stain'd their fetlocksin his smoking blood,

942
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:06.700
The noble Salisbury gaveup the ghost.

943
01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:16.900
Then let the earth bedrunken with our blood:

944
01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:22.030
I'll kill my horse,because I will not fly.

945
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:29.500
Why stand we likesoft-hearted women here,

946
01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:34.070
Wailing our losses, whilesthe foe doth rage;

947
01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:36.600
And look upon, as if thetragedy

948
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:41.730
Were play'd in jest bycounterfeiting actors?

949
01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:46.300
Here on my knee I vow toGod above,

950
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.170
I'll never pause again,never stand still,

951
01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.770
Till either death hathclosed these eyes of mine

952
01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:55.130
Or fortune given memeasure of revenge.

953
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:58.400
O Warwick, I do bend myknee with thine;

954
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.600
And in this vow do chainmy soul to thine!

955
01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.400
And, ere my knee rise fromthe earth's cold face,

956
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:09.200
I throw my hands, mineeyes, my heart to thee,

957
01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:12.870
Thou setter up and pluckerdown of kings,

958
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:14.400
Beseeching thee, if withthey will it stands

959
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:17.300
That to my foes this bodymust be prey,

960
01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.730
Yet that thy brazen gatesof heaven may ope,

961
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:22.570
And give sweet passage tomy sinful soul!

962
01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:32.300
Now, lords, take leaveuntil we meet again,

963
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:34.800
Where'er it be, in heavenor in earth.

964
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.530
Brother, give me thy hand;and, gentle Warwick,

965
01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:41.670
Let me embrace thee in myweary arms:

966
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:49.200
Away, away! Once more,sweet lords farewell.

967
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.030
Yet let us all together toour troops,

968
01:07:51.030 --> 01:07:53.500
And give them leave to flythat will not stay;

969
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.830
This may plant courage intheir quailing breasts;

970
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:59.200
For yet is hope of lifeand victory.

971
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.530
Forslow no longer, make wehence amain.

972
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:17.900
Clifford! Clifford!

973
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:35.930
Richard! Richard!

974
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:39.330
Now, Clifford, I havesingled thee alone:

975
01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:41.870
Suppose this arm is forthe Duke of York,

976
01:08:41.870 --> 01:08:44.800
And this for Rutland; bothbound to revenge,

977
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.370
Wert thou environ'd with abrazen wall.

978
01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:52.070
Now, Richard, I am withthee here alone:

979
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:56.900
This is the hand thatstabb'd thy father York;

980
01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:00.230
And this the hand thatslew thy brother Rutland;

981
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:04.300
And here's the heart thattriumphs in their death

982
01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:08.130
And cheers these hands thatslew thy sire and brother

983
01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:10.800
To execute the like uponthyself;

984
01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:13.230
And so, have at thee!

985
01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.500
Nay Warwick, single outsome other chase;

986
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:20.670
For I myself will huntthis wolf to death.

987
01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:33.630
(drums sound. bugles blaring.clanging swords)

988
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:23.070
This battle fares like tothe morning's war,

989
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:26.770
When dying clouds contendwith growing light,

990
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:28.900
What time the shepherd,blowing of his nails,

991
01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:33.530
Can neither call itperfect day nor night.

992
01:11:33.530 --> 01:11:35.470
Now sways it this way,like a mighty sea

993
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:38.770
Forced by the tide tocombat with the wind;

994
01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:41.400
Now sways it that way,like the selfsame sea

995
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.270
Forced to retire by furyof the wind:

996
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:48.770
Sometime the flood prevails,and then the wind;

997
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:51.100
Now one the better, thenanother best;

998
01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:53.270
Both tugging to bevictors, breast to breast,

999
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:57.530
Yet neither conqueror norconquered:

1000
01:11:57.530 --> 01:12:01.870
So is the equal poise of thisfell war.

1001
01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:13.330
Here on this molehill willI sit me down.

1002
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:17.730
To whom God will, there bethe victory!

1003
01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:20.730
For Margaret my queen, andClifford too,

1004
01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:22.200
Have chid me from thebattle; swearing both

1005
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.830
They prosper best of allwhen I am thence.

1006
01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:31.100
Would I were dead! ifGod's good will were so;

1007
01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:38.930
For what is in this worldbut grief and woe?

1008
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:43.170
O God! methinks it were ahappy life,

1009
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:46.970
To be no better than ahomely swain;

1010
01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:50.770
To sit upon a hill, as Ido now,

1011
01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:53.570
To carve out dialsquaintly, point by point,

1012
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:57.100
Thereby to see the minuteshow they run,

1013
01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.370
How many make the hourfull complete;

1014
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:03.800
How many hours bring aboutthe day;

1015
01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.830
How many days will finishup the year;

1016
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:10.870
How many years a mortalman may live.

1017
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:16.200
When this is known, thento divide the times:

1018
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.870
So many hours must I tendmy flock;

1019
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:23.270
So many hours must I takemy rest;

1020
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:26.600
So many hours must Icontemplate;

1021
01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:31.430
So many hours must I sportmyself;

1022
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:35.430
So many days my ewes havebeen with young;

1023
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:39.570
So many weeks ere the poorfools will ean:

1024
01:13:39.570 --> 01:13:44.370
So many years ere I shallshear the fleece:

1025
01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:49.930
So minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years,

1026
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:53.400
Pass'd over to the endthey were created,

1027
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:59.830
Would bring white hairsunto a quiet grave.

1028
01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:06.230
Ah, what a life were this!how sweet! how lovely!

1029
01:14:06.230 --> 01:14:08.370
Gives not the hawthorn-busha sweeter shade

1030
01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:11.530
To shepherds looking ontheir silly sheep,

1031
01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.300
Than doth a richembroider'd canopy

1032
01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:18.530
To kings that fear theirsubjects' treachery?

1033
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:23.330
O, yes, it doth; athousand-fold it doth.

1034
01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:28.830
And to conclude, theshepherd's homely curds,

1035
01:14:28.830 --> 01:14:32.470
His cold thin drink out ofhis leather bottle.

1036
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:35.930
His wonted sleep under afresh tree's shade,

1037
01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:39.600
All which secure andsweetly he enjoys,

1038
01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.370
Is far beyond a prince'sdelicates,

1039
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:46.400
His viands sparkling in agolden cup,

1040
01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.330
His body couched in acurious bed,

1041
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:54.070
When care, mistrust, andtreason waits on him.

1042
01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:10.430
Ill blows the wind thatprofits nobody.

1043
01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:14.070
This man, whom hand tohand I slew in fight,

1044
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:18.370
May be possessed with somestore of crowns;

1045
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:21.800
And I, that haply takethem from him now,

1046
01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.270
May yet ere night yieldboth my life and them

1047
01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.470
To some man else, as thisdead man doth me.

1048
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:32.500
Who's this?

1049
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:45.400
O God! it is my father's face,

1050
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:53.970
Whom in this conflict Iunwares have kill'd.

1051
01:15:53.970 --> 01:15:56.970
O heavy times, begettingsuch events!

1052
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:04.400
From London by the kingwas I press'd forth;

1053
01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.970
My father, being the Earlof Warwick's man,

1054
01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:11.170
Came on the part of York,press'd by his master;

1055
01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:18.470
And I, who at his handsreceived my life,

1056
01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:22.900
Have by my hands of lifebereaved him.

1057
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:31.330
Pardon me, God, I knew notwhat I did!

1058
01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:39.430
And pardon, father, for Iknew not thee!

1059
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:45.870
My tears shall wipe awaythese bloody marks;

1060
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:50.200
And no more words till theyhave flow'd their fill.

1061
01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:53.500
O piteous spectacle! Obloody times!

1062
01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.600
Whiles lions war andbattle for their dens,

1063
01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.170
Poor harmless lambs abidetheir enmity.

1064
01:16:59.170 --> 01:17:02.800
Weep, wretched man, I'llaid thee tear for tear;

1065
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:05.000
And let our hearts andeyes, like civil war,

1066
01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.070
Be blind with tears, andbreak o'ercharged with grief.

1067
01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:22.170
Thou that so stoutly hastresisted me,

1068
01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.770
Give me thy gold, if thouhast any gold:

1069
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:30.170
For I have bought it withan hundred blows.

1070
01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:42.030
But let me see: is thisour foeman's face?

1071
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:49.370
Ah, no, no, no, it is mineonly son!

1072
01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:54.570
Ah, boy, if any life beleft in thee,

1073
01:17:54.570 --> 01:18:02.270
Throw up thine eye! see,see what showers arise,

1074
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:06.370
Blown with the windytempest of my heart,

1075
01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:11.000
Upon thy wounds, that killsmine eye and heart!

1076
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.430
O, pity, God, thismiserable age!

1077
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:19.130
What stratagems, how fell,how butcherly,

1078
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:22.230
Erroneous, mutinous andunnatural,

1079
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:26.530
This deadly quarrel dailydoth beget!

1080
01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:30.870
O boy, thy father gavethee life too soon,

1081
01:18:30.870 --> 01:18:34.670
And hath bereft thee ofthy life too late!

1082
01:18:34.670 --> 01:18:39.130
Woe above woe! grief morethan common grief!

1083
01:18:39.130 --> 01:18:42.500
O that my death would staythese ruthful deeds!

1084
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.800
O pity, pity, gentleheaven, pity!

1085
01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.900
The red rose and the whiteare on his face,

1086
01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:54.430
The fatal colours of ourstriving houses:

1087
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:58.430
The one his purple bloodright well resembles;

1088
01:18:58.430 --> 01:19:05.030
The other his pale cheeks,methinks, presenteth:

1089
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:07.230
Wither one rose, and letthe other flourish;

1090
01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:10.770
If you contend, a thousandlives must wither.

1091
01:19:10.770 --> 01:19:13.870
How will my mother for afather's death

1092
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:16.770
Take on with me and ne'erbe satisfied!

1093
01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:18.930
How will my wife forslaughter of my son

1094
01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:22.200
Shed seas of tears andne'er be satisfied!

1095
01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:24.330
How will the country forthese woful chances

1096
01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:27.700
Misthink the king and notbe satisfied!

1097
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:30.770
Was ever son so rued afather's death?

1098
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:33.600
Was ever father sobemoan'd his son?

1099
01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.170
Was ever king so grievedfor subjects' woe?

1100
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:43.100
Much is your sorrow; mineten times so much.

1101
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:46.370
I'll bear thee hence,where I may weep my fill.

1102
01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:55.330
These arms of mine shallbe thy winding-sheet;

1103
01:19:55.330 --> 01:20:00.000
My heart, sweet boy, shallbe thy sepulchre,

1104
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.870
For from my heart thineimage ne'er shall go;

1105
01:20:04.870 --> 01:20:10.070
My sighing breast shall bethy funeral bell;

1106
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:13.730
And so obsequious will thyfather be,

1107
01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:17.570
Even for the loss of thee,having no more,

1108
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:22.800
As Priam was for all hisvaliant sons.

1109
01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:30.830
I'll bear thee hence; andlet them fight that will,

1110
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:36.970
For I have murdered whereI should not kill.

1111
01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:46.500
Sad-hearted men, muchovergone with care,

1112
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:50.870
Here sits a king morewoful than you are.

1113
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:53.930
Fly, father, fly! for allyour friends are fled,

1114
01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:56.670
And Warwick rages like achafed bull:

1115
01:20:56.670 --> 01:21:00.630
Away! for death doth holdus in pursuit.

1116
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:03.800
Mount you, my lord; towardsBerwick post amain:

1117
01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.870
Edward and Richard, like abrace of greyhounds

1118
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:08.930
Having the fearful flyinghare in sight,

1119
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:11.770
With fiery eyes sparklingfor very wrath,

1120
01:21:11.770 --> 01:21:15.800
And bloody steel grasp'din their ireful hands,

1121
01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.570
Are at our backs; andtherefore hence amain.

1122
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:21.330
Away! for vengeance comesalong with them:

1123
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:23.300
Nay, stay not toexpostulate, make speed;

1124
01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.830
Or else come after: I'llaway before.

1125
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:29.800
Nay, take me with thee,good sweet Exeter:

1126
01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:37.470
Not that I fear to stay,but love to go

1127
01:21:37.470 --> 01:21:42.800
Whither the queen intends.Forward; away!

1128
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.700


1129
01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:30.830
Here burns my candle out;ay, here it dies,

1130
01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:37.500
Which, whiles it lasted,gave King Henry light.

1131
01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:42.800
O Lancaster, I fear thyoverthrow

1132
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:47.500
More than my body'sparting with my soul!

1133
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:53.130
My love and fear gluedmany friends to thee;

1134
01:22:53.130 --> 01:22:59.470
And, now I fall, thy toughcommixture melts.

1135
01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:08.870
Impairing Henry,strengthening misproud York,

1136
01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:15.670
The common people swarmlike summer flies;

1137
01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:20.570
And whither fly the gnatsbut to the sun?

1138
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:24.330
And who shines now butHenry's enemies?

1139
01:23:24.330 --> 01:23:33.800
O, Henry, hadst thousway'd as kings should do,

1140
01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.730
Or as thy father and hisfather did,

1141
01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:40.370
Giving no ground unto thehouse of York,

1142
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:46.730
They never then had sprunglike summer flies;

1143
01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:53.030
I and ten thousand in thisluckless realm

1144
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:59.170
Had left no mourningwidows for our death;

1145
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:04.000
And thou this day hadstkept thy chair in peace.

1146
01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.600
For what doth cherishweeds but gentle air?

1147
01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:14.800
And what makes robbersbold but too much lenity?

1148
01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:25.200
Bootless are plaints, andcureless are my wounds;

1149
01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:31.300
No way to fly, nor strengthto hold out flight:

1150
01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:35.430
The foe is merciless, andwill not pity;

1151
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:40.230
For at their hands I havedeserved no pity.

1152
01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.370
The air hath got into mydeadly wounds,

1153
01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:53.330
And much effuse of blooddoth make me faint.

1154
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:59.230
Come, York and Richard,Warwick and the rest;

1155
01:24:59.230 --> 01:25:04.070
I stabb'd your fathers'bosoms, split my breast.

1156
01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:09.730
Now breathe we, lords: goodfortune bids us pause,

1157
01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:16.470
And smooth the frowns ofwar with peaceful looks.

1158
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:18.670
Some troops pursue thebloody-minded queen,

1159
01:26:27.570 --> 01:26:29.630
That led calm Henry,though he were a king,

1160
01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:35.100
No, 'tis impossible heshould escape,

1161
01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.830
For, though before hisface I speak the words

1162
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:40.830
Your brother Richardmark'd him for the grave:

1163
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:44.170
And wheresoe'er he is,he's surely dead.

1164
01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:50.630
(sound of someone's last exhale)

1165
01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.100
Whose soul is that whichtakes her heavy leave?

1166
01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.100
A deadly groan, like lifeand death's departing.

1167
01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:04.630
See who it is: and, nowthe battle's ended,

1168
01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:10.300
If friend or foe, let himbe gently used.

1169
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:16.570
Revoke that doom of mercy,for 'tis Clifford;

1170
01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.200
Who not contented that helopp'd the branch

1171
01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:25.930
In hewing Rutland when hisleaves put forth,

1172
01:27:25.930 --> 01:27:28.370
But set his murderingknife unto the root

1173
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:32.330
From whence that tenderspray did sweetly spring,

1174
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:36.170
I mean our princelyfather, Duke of York.

1175
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:44.800
From off the gates of Yorkfetch down the head,

1176
01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.930
Your father's head, whichClifford placed there;

1177
01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:52.730
Instead whereof let thissupply the room:

1178
01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:55.100
Measure for measure mustbe answered.

1179
01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:58.170
Bring forth that fatalscreech-owl to our house,

1180
01:27:58.170 --> 01:28:01.730
That nothing sung butdeath to us and ours:

1181
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:07.570
Now death shall stop hisdismal threatening sound,

1182
01:28:07.570 --> 01:28:12.270
And his ill-boding tongueno more shall speak.

1183
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:14.530
I think his understandingis bereft.

1184
01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:20.570
Speak, Clifford, dost thouknow who speaks to thee?

1185
01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:23.370
Dark cloudy death o'ershadeshis beams of life,

1186
01:28:23.370 --> 01:28:25.800
And he nor sees nor hearsus what we say.

1187
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:31.600
O, would he did! and soperhaps he doth:

1188
01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:33.170
'Tis but his policy tocounterfeit,

1189
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:35.030
Because he would avoidsuch bitter taunts

1190
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:37.300
Which in the time of deathhe gave our father.

1191
01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:41.670
If so thou think'st, vexhim with eager words.

1192
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:44.400
Clifford, ask mercy andobtain no grace.

1193
01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.970
Clifford, repent inbootless penitence.

1194
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:49.830
Clifford, devise excusesfor thy faults.

1195
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:52.530
While we devise felltortures for thy faults.

1196
01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:54.870
Thou didst love York, andI am son to York.

1197
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:57.370
Thou pitied'st Rutland; Iwill pity thee.

1198
01:28:57.370 --> 01:29:00.470
Where's Captain Margaret,to fence you now?

1199
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:03.770
They mock thee, Clifford:swear as thou wast wont.

1200
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:07.830
What, not an oath? nay,then the world goes hard

1201
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:11.230
When Clifford cannot sparehis friends an oath.

1202
01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:16.900
I know by that he's dead;and, by my soul,

1203
01:29:16.900 --> 01:29:19.400
If this right hand wouldbuy two hour's life,

1204
01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.270
That I in all despitemight rail at him,

1205
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:24.630
This hand should chop it off,and with it issuing blood

1206
01:29:24.630 --> 01:29:27.400
Stifle the villain whoseunstanched thirst

1207
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.270
York and young Rutlandcould not satisfy.

1208
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:41.400
Ay, but he's dead: offwith the traitor's head,

1209
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:43.930
And rear it in the placeyour father's stands.

1210
01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.300
And now to London withtriumphant march,

1211
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:56.670
There to be crownedEngland's royal king:

1212
01:29:56.670 --> 01:29:59.970
From whence shall Warwickcut the sea to France,

1213
01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:02.370
And ask the Lady Bona forthy queen:

1214
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:05.630
So shalt thou sinew boththese lands together;

1215
01:30:05.630 --> 01:30:07.630
And, having France thyfriend, thou shalt not dread

1216
01:30:07.630 --> 01:30:11.070
The scatter'd foe thathopes to rise again;

1217
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:13.600
For though they cannotgreatly sting to hurt,

1218
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.600
Yet look to have them buzzto offend thine ears.

1219
01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.830
First will I see thecoronation;

1220
01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:21.830
And then to Brittany I'llcross the sea,

1221
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:25.670
To effect this marriage,so it please my lord.

1222
01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:29.470
Even as thou wilt, sweetWarwick, let it be;

1223
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:33.570
For in thy shoulder do Ibuild my seat,

1224
01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:35.130
And never will I undertakethe thing

1225
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:38.200
Wherein thy counsel andconsent is wanting.

1226
01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:47.100
Richard, I will createthee Duke of Gloucester,

1227
01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:51.570
And George, of Clarence:Warwick, as ourself,

1228
01:30:51.570 --> 01:30:54.100
Shall do and undo as himpleaseth best.

1229
01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:56.030
Let me be Duke of Clarence,George of Gloucester;

1230
01:30:56.030 --> 01:30:57.830
For Gloucester's dukedomis too ominous.

1231
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:59.200
Tut, that's a foolishobservation:

1232
01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.630
Richard, be Duke ofGloucester. Now to London,

1233
01:31:01.630 --> 01:31:04.300
To see these honours inpossession.

1234
01:31:23.130 --> 01:31:27.570
Under this thick-grown brakewe'll shroud ourselves;

1235
01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:30.430
For through this gladeanon the deer will come;

1236
01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:33.600
And in this covert will wemake our stand,

1237
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.000
Culling the principal ofall the deer.

1238
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.800
I'll stay above the hill,so both may shoot.

1239
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:45.770
That cannot be; the noiseof thy cross-bow

1240
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:50.170
Will scare the herd, andso my shoot is lost.

1241
01:31:50.170 --> 01:31:53.770
Here stand we both, andaim we at the best:

1242
01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.230
And, for the time shallnot seem tedious,

1243
01:31:59.230 --> 01:32:02.000
I'll tell thee what befellme on a day

1244
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.100
In this self-place wherenow we mean to stand.

1245
01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:08.700
Hey, here comes a man; let'sstay till he be past.

1246
01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:15.670
From Scotland am I stol'n,even of pure love,

1247
01:32:15.670 --> 01:32:20.070
To greet mine own landwith my wishful sight.

1248
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:23.670
No, Harry, Harry, 'tis noland of thine;

1249
01:32:23.670 --> 01:32:28.730
Thy place is fill'd, thysceptre wrung from thee,

1250
01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:33.870
Thy balm wash'd off wherewiththou wast anointed:

1251
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:37.900
No bending knee will callthee Caesar now,

1252
01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:41.530
No humble suitors press tospeak for right,

1253
01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:44.570
No, not a man comes forredress of thee;

1254
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:46.870
For how can I help them,and not myself?

1255
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:53.970
Ay, here's a deer whoseskin's a keeper's fee:

1256
01:32:53.970 --> 01:32:58.730
This is the quondam king;let's seize upon him.

1257
01:32:58.730 --> 01:33:02.000
Let me embrace thee, souradversity,

1258
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.670
For wise men say it is thewisest course.

1259
01:33:04.670 --> 01:33:07.000
Why linger we? let us layhands upon him.

1260
01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:13.230
Forbear awhile; we'll heara little more.

1261
01:33:13.230 --> 01:33:17.270
My queen and son are goneto France for aid;

1262
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:19.400
And, as I hear, the greatcommanding Warwick

1263
01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.870
Is thither gone, to cravethe French king's sister

1264
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:26.500
To wife for Edward: ifthis news be true,

1265
01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:30.500
Poor queen and son, yourlabour is but lost;

1266
01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:32.100
For Warwick is a subtleorator,

1267
01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:37.500
And Lewis a prince soonwon with moving words.

1268
01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:41.300
By this account thenMargaret may win him;

1269
01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:44.800
For she's a woman to bepitied much:

1270
01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:51.670
Ay, but she's come to beg,Warwick to give;

1271
01:33:51.670 --> 01:33:54.100
She, on his left side,craving aid for Henry,

1272
01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:57.700
He, on his right, asking awife for Edward.

1273
01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:01.230
She weeps, and says herHenry is deposed;

1274
01:34:01.230 --> 01:34:05.900
He smiles, and says hisEdward is install'd;

1275
01:34:05.900 --> 01:34:09.600
That she, poor wretch, forgrief can speak no more;

1276
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:15.330
Whiles Warwick tells histitle, smooths the wrong,

1277
01:34:15.330 --> 01:34:18.230
Inferreth arguments ofmighty strength,

1278
01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:20.700
And in conclusion wins theking from her,

1279
01:34:20.700 --> 01:34:23.070
With promise of hissister, and what else,

1280
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:27.800
To strengthen and supportKing Edward's place.

1281
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:33.800
O Margaret, thus 'twillbe; and thou, poor soul,

1282
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:37.270
Art then forsaken, as thouwent'st forlorn!

1283
01:34:54.600 --> 01:35:01.230
Say, what art thou thattalk'st of kings and queens?

1284
01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:05.400
More than I seem, and lessthan I was born to:

1285
01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.570
A man at least, for less Ishould not be;

1286
01:35:07.570 --> 01:35:09.930
And men may talk of kings,and why not I?

1287
01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:14.130
Ay, but thou talk'st as ifthou wert a king.

1288
01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:17.600
Why, so I am, in mind; andthat's enough.

1289
01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:23.000
But, if thou be a king,where is thy crown?

1290
01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:28.500
My crown is in my heart,not on my head;

1291
01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.930
Not decked with diamondsand Indian stones,

1292
01:35:30.930 --> 01:35:36.070
Nor to be seen: my crownis called content:

1293
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:38.530
A crown it is that seldomkings enjoy.

1294
01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:43.470
Well, if you be a kingcrown'd with content,

1295
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:46.800
Your crown content and youmust be contented

1296
01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.170
To go along with us; foras we think,

1297
01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:52.800
You are the king KingEdward hath deposed;

1298
01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.570
And we his subjects swornin all allegiance

1299
01:35:54.570 --> 01:35:57.870
Will apprehend you as hisenemy.

1300
01:35:57.870 --> 01:36:00.070
But did you never swear,and break an oath?

1301
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:03.070
No, never such an oath;nor will not now.

1302
01:36:03.070 --> 01:36:06.230
Where did you dwell when Iwas King of England?

1303
01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:10.330
Here in this country,where we now remain.

1304
01:36:10.330 --> 01:36:15.270
I was anointed king atnine months old;

1305
01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:17.370
My father and mygrandfather were kings,

1306
01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:20.970
And you were sworn truesubjects unto me:

1307
01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:24.400
And tell me, then, haveyou not broke your oaths?

1308
01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.700
No;

1309
01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:31.800
For we were subjects butwhile you were king.

1310
01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:36.870
Why, am I dead? do I notbreathe a man?

1311
01:36:36.870 --> 01:36:43.530
Ah, simple men, you knownot what you swear!

1312
01:36:43.530 --> 01:36:50.630
Look, as I blow thisfeather from my face,

1313
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:53.200
And as the air blows it tome again,

1314
01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.800
Obeying with my wind whenI do blow,

1315
01:36:55.800 --> 01:36:58.370
And yielding to anotherwhen it blows,

1316
01:36:58.370 --> 01:37:01.000
Commanded always by thegreater gust;

1317
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.670
Such is the lightness ofyou common men.

1318
01:37:06.670 --> 01:37:09.570
But do not break youroaths; for of that sin

1319
01:37:09.570 --> 01:37:13.630
My mild entreaty shall notmake you guilty.

1320
01:37:13.630 --> 01:37:17.630
Go where you will, theking shall be commanded;

1321
01:37:17.630 --> 01:37:21.030
And be you kings, command,and I'll obey.

1322
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:25.470
We are true subjects tothe king, King Edward.

1323
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:28.230
So would you be again toHenry,

1324
01:37:28.230 --> 01:37:30.570
If he were seated as KingEdward is.

1325
01:37:30.570 --> 01:37:33.400
We charge you, in God'sname, and the king's,

1326
01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.030
To go with us unto theofficers.

1327
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:40.530
In God's name, lead; yourking's name be obey'd:

1328
01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:45.200
And what God will, thatlet your king perform;

1329
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.500
And what he will, I humblyyield unto.

1330
01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:19.030
Brother of Gloucester, atSaint Alban's field

1331
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:22.300
This lady's husband, SirJohn Grey, was slain,

1332
01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:25.230
His lands then seized onby the conqueror:

1333
01:39:25.230 --> 01:39:30.000
Her suit is now torepossess those lands;

1334
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.830
Which we in justice cannotwell deny,

1335
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:34.770
Because in quarrel of thehouse of York

1336
01:39:34.770 --> 01:39:37.430
The worthy gentleman didlose his life.

1337
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:39.670
Your highness shall dowell to grant her suit;

1338
01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:42.870
It were dishonour to denyit her.

1339
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:49.130
It were no less; but yetI'll make a pause.

1340
01:39:49.130 --> 01:39:51.900
Yea, is it so?

1341
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:54.100
I see the lady hath athing to grant,

1342
01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:57.270
Before the king will granther humble suit.

1343
01:39:57.270 --> 01:40:00.200
He knows the game: howtrue he keeps the wind!

1344
01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:01.730
Silence!

1345
01:40:01.730 --> 01:40:05.000
Widow, we will consider ofyour suit;

1346
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.130
And come some other timeto know our mind.

1347
01:40:07.130 --> 01:40:09.730
Right gracious lord, Icannot brook delay:

1348
01:40:09.730 --> 01:40:12.100
May it please your highnessto resolve me now;

1349
01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:14.200
And what your pleasure is,shall satisfy me.

1350
01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:17.030
Ay, widow? then I'll warrantyou all your lands,

1351
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:19.170
An if what pleases himshall pleasure you.

1352
01:40:19.170 --> 01:40:21.630
Fight closer, or, goodfaith, you'll catch a clap.

1353
01:40:21.630 --> 01:40:24.330
I fear her not, unlessshe chance to fall.

1354
01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:27.530
Merry. God's forbot! forhe'll take vantages.

1355
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:29.700
How many children hastthou, widow? tell me.

1356
01:40:29.700 --> 01:40:32.200
I think he means tobeg a child of her.

1357
01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:34.500
Nay, whip me then: he'llrather give her two.

1358
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.270
Three, my most graciouslord.

1359
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:38.730
You shall have four, ifyou'll be ruled by him.

1360
01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:42.070
'Twere pity they shouldlose their father's lands.

1361
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:44.900
Be pitiful, dread lord,and grant it then.

1362
01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.330
Lords, give us leave: I'lltry this widow's wit.

1363
01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:56.230
Ay, good leave have you;for you will have leave,

1364
01:40:56.230 --> 01:40:59.500
Till youth take leave andleave you to the crutch.

1365
01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:16.430
Now tell me, madam, do youlove your children?

1366
01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:19.070
Ay, full as dearly as Ilove myself.

1367
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:21.630
And would you not do muchto do them good?

1368
01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:24.800
To do them good, I wouldsustain some harm.

1369
01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:27.900
Then get your husband'slands, to do them good.

1370
01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.100
Therefore I came unto yourmajesty.

1371
01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:35.730
I'll tell you how theselands are to be got.

1372
01:41:35.730 --> 01:41:39.330
So shall you bind me toyour highness' service.

1373
01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:45.770
What service wilt thou dome, if I give them?

1374
01:41:45.770 --> 01:41:48.470
What you command, thatrests in me to do.

1375
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:50.770
But you will takeexceptions to my boon.

1376
01:41:50.770 --> 01:41:53.430
No, gracious lord, exceptI cannot do it.

1377
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:57.670
Ay, but thou canst do whatI mean to ask.

1378
01:41:57.670 --> 01:42:02.070
Why, then I will do whatyour grace commands.

1379
01:42:02.070 --> 01:42:04.930
He plies her hard; and muchrain wears the marble.

1380
01:42:04.930 --> 01:42:09.270
As red as fire! nay,then her wax must melt.

1381
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:12.370
Why stops my lord, shall Inot hear my task?

1382
01:42:12.370 --> 01:42:17.900
An easy task; 'tis but tolove a king.

1383
01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:20.430
That's soon perform'd,because I am a subject.

1384
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:23.930
Why, then, thy husband'slands I freely give thee.

1385
01:42:23.930 --> 01:42:28.430
I take my leave with manythousand thanks.

1386
01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:37.270
But stay thee, 'tis thefruits of love I mean.

1387
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:39.500
The fruits of love I mean,my loving liege.

1388
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:43.700
Ay, but, I fear me, inanother sense.

1389
01:42:43.700 --> 01:42:47.300
What love, think'st thou,I sue so much to get?

1390
01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:52.330
My love till death, myhumble thanks, my prayers;

1391
01:42:52.330 --> 01:42:56.430
That love which virtuebegs and virtue grants.

1392
01:42:56.430 --> 01:43:01.230
No, by my troth, I did notmean such love.

1393
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:03.030
Why, then you mean not asI thought you did.

1394
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:04.970
But now you partly mayperceive my mind.

1395
01:43:04.970 --> 01:43:06.670
My mind will never grantwhat I perceive

1396
01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:09.030
Your highness aims at, ifI aim aright.

1397
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:18.300
To tell thee plain, I aimto lie with thee.

1398
01:43:21.170 --> 01:43:25.370
To tell you plain, I hadrather lie in prison.

1399
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:29.700
Why, then thou shalt nothave thy husband's lands.

1400
01:43:29.700 --> 01:43:31.830
Why, then mine honestyshall be my dower;

1401
01:43:31.830 --> 01:43:33.930
For by that loss I willnot purchase them.

1402
01:43:33.930 --> 01:43:35.970
Therein thou wrong'st thychildren mightily.

1403
01:43:35.970 --> 01:43:38.730
Herein your highnesswrongs both them and me.

1404
01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:45.630
But, mighty lord, thismerry inclination

1405
01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:48.900
Accords not with thesadness of my suit:

1406
01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.300
Please you dismiss meeither with 'ay' or 'no.'

1407
01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:53.370
Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay'to my request;

1408
01:43:53.370 --> 01:43:55.970
No if thou dost say 'no'to my demand.

1409
01:43:55.970 --> 01:44:02.300
Then, no, my lord. My suitis at an end.

1410
01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:04.670
The widow likes him not,she knits her brows.

1411
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:07.670
He is the bluntestwooer in Christendom.

1412
01:44:07.670 --> 01:44:12.570
Her looks do argue herreplete with modesty;

1413
01:44:12.570 --> 01:44:16.570
Her words do show her witincomparable;

1414
01:44:16.570 --> 01:44:21.770
All her perfectionschallenge sovereignty:

1415
01:44:21.770 --> 01:44:25.370
One way or other, she isfor a king;

1416
01:44:25.370 --> 01:44:30.330
And she shall be my love,or else my queen.--

1417
01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:43.430
Say that King Edward takethee for his queen?

1418
01:44:46.230 --> 01:44:50.130
'Tis better said thandone, my gracious lord:

1419
01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:52.030
I am a subject fit to jestwithal,

1420
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:55.200
But far unfit to be asovereign.

1421
01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:00.800
Sweet widow, by my state Iswear to thee

1422
01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:03.470
I speak no more than whatmy soul intends;

1423
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:06.370
And that is, to enjoy theefor my love.

1424
01:45:06.370 --> 01:45:09.930
And that is more than Iwill yield unto:

1425
01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:13.570
I know I am too mean to beyour queen,

1426
01:45:13.570 --> 01:45:16.000
And yet too good to beyour concubine.

1427
01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.700
You cavil, widow: I didmean, my queen.

1428
01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:25.200
'Twill grieve your grace mysons should call you father.

1429
01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:27.600
No more than when mydaughters call thee mother.

1430
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:29.870
Thou art a widow, and thouhast some children;

1431
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:32.730
And, by God's mother, I,being but a bachelor,

1432
01:45:32.730 --> 01:45:35.100
Have other some: why, 'tisa happy thing

1433
01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:37.200
To be the father unto manysons.

1434
01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:46.030
Answer no more, for thoushalt be my queen.

1435
01:45:48.770 --> 01:45:51.430
The ghostly father nowhath done his shrift.

1436
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:54.630
When he was made ashriver, 'twas for shift.

1437
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.430
Brothers, you muse whatchat we two have had.

1438
01:45:59.430 --> 01:46:02.170
The widow likes it not,for she looks vexed.

1439
01:46:02.170 --> 01:46:05.200
You'll think it strange ifI should marry her.

1440
01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.470
To whom, my lord?

1441
01:46:08.470 --> 01:46:11.230
Why, Clarence, to myself.

1442
01:46:11.230 --> 01:46:14.170
That would be ten days'wonder at the least.

1443
01:46:14.170 --> 01:46:15.700
That's a day longer than awonder lasts.

1444
01:46:15.700 --> 01:46:17.930
By so much is the wonderin extremes.

1445
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:23.730
Well, jest on, brothers: Ican tell you both

1446
01:46:23.730 --> 01:46:26.200
Her suit is granted forher husband's lands.

1447
01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:33.770
My gracious lord, Henryyour foe is taken,

1448
01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:36.500
And brought your prisonerto your palace gate.

1449
01:46:37.670 --> 01:46:39.630
See that he be convey'dunto the Tower:

1450
01:46:39.630 --> 01:46:41.970
And go we, brothers, tothe man that took him,

1451
01:46:41.970 --> 01:46:44.630
To question of hisapprehension.

1452
01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:52.570
Sweet widow, go you along.Lords, use her honourably.

1453
01:46:59.570 --> 01:47:04.600
Ay, Edward will use womenhonourably.

1454
01:47:07.930 --> 01:47:10.870
Would he were wasted,marrow, bones and all,

1455
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:13.100
That from his loins nohopeful branch may spring,

1456
01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:18.930
To cross me from thegolden time I look for!

1457
01:47:18.930 --> 01:47:21.200
And yet, between my soul'sdesire and me--

1458
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.370
The lustful Edward's titleburied--

1459
01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:29.930
Is Clarence, Henry, andhis son young Edward,

1460
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:32.100
And all the unlook'd forissue of their bodies,

1461
01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:35.030
To take their rooms, ere Ican plant myself:

1462
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:41.600
A cold premeditation formy purpose!

1463
01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:44.230
Why, then, I do but dreamon sovereignty;

1464
01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:46.200
Like one that stands upona promontory,

1465
01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:49.030
And spies a far-off shorewhere he would tread,

1466
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:51.600
Wishing his foot wereequal with his eye,

1467
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.000
And chides the sea thatsunders him from thence,

1468
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.400
Saying, he'll lade it dryto have his way:

1469
01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.670
So do I wish the crown,being so far off;

1470
01:47:58.670 --> 01:48:02.530
And so I chide the meansthat keeps me from it;

1471
01:48:02.530 --> 01:48:03.770
And so I say, I'll cut thecauses off,

1472
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:06.070
Flattering me withimpossibilities.

1473
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:09.700
My eye's too quick, myheart o'erweens too much,

1474
01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:12.100
Unless my hand andstrength could equal them.

1475
01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:22.600
Well, say there is nokingdom then for Richard;

1476
01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:25.230
What other pleasure canthe world afford?

1477
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.300
I'll make my heaven in alady's lap,

1478
01:48:30.300 --> 01:48:32.870
And deck my body in gayornaments,

1479
01:48:32.870 --> 01:48:38.630
And witch sweet ladieswith my words and looks.

1480
01:48:38.630 --> 01:48:42.070
O miserable thought! andmore unlikely

1481
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:45.070
Than to accomplish twentygolden crowns!

1482
01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:50.270
Why, love forswore me inmy mother's womb:

1483
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:53.500
And, for I should not dealin her soft laws,

1484
01:48:53.500 --> 01:48:58.000
She did corrupt frailnature with some bribe,

1485
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.700
To shrink mine arm up likea wither'd shrub;

1486
01:49:01.700 --> 01:49:03.800
To make an enviousmountain on my back,

1487
01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.370
Where sits deformity tomock my body;

1488
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:10.730
To shape my legs of anunequal size;

1489
01:49:10.730 --> 01:49:12.770
To disproportion me inevery part,

1490
01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:15.200
Like to a chaos, or anunlick'd bear-whelp

1491
01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:17.300
That carries no impressionlike the dam.

1492
01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.530
And am I then a man to bebeloved?

1493
01:49:19.530 --> 01:49:23.330
O monstrous fault, toharbour such a thought!

1494
01:49:23.330 --> 01:49:26.800
Then, since this earthaffords no joy to me,

1495
01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:29.430
But to command, to cheque,to o'erbear such

1496
01:49:29.430 --> 01:49:32.430
As are of better personthan myself,

1497
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:35.730
I'll make my heaven todream upon the crown,

1498
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:39.400
And, whiles I live, toaccount this world but hell,

1499
01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.000
Until my mis-shaped trunkthat bears this head

1500
01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.070
Be round impaled with aglorious crown.

1501
01:49:47.070 --> 01:49:50.100
And yet I know not how toget the crown,

1502
01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:53.270
For many lives standbetween me and home:

1503
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:56.630
And I,--like one lost in athorny wood,

1504
01:49:56.630 --> 01:50:00.230
That rends the thorns andis rent with the thorns,

1505
01:50:00.230 --> 01:50:02.170
Seeking a way and strayingfrom the way;

1506
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:04.230
Not knowing how to findthe open air,

1507
01:50:04.230 --> 01:50:06.300
But toiling desperately tofind it out,--

1508
01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:09.930
Torment myself to catchthe English crown:

1509
01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:11.930
And from that torment Iwill free myself,

1510
01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:15.500
Or hew my way out with abloody axe.

1511
01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:21.470
Why, I can smile, andmurder whiles I smile,

1512
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:24.430
And cry 'Content' to thatwhich grieves my heart,

1513
01:50:24.430 --> 01:50:27.000
And wet my cheeks withartificial tears,

1514
01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.270
And frame my face to alloccasions.

1515
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:40.600
I'll drown more sailorsthan the mermaid shall;

1516
01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:45.200
I'll slay more gazers thanthe basilisk;

1517
01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.600
I'll play the orator aswell as Nestor,

1518
01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:51.270
Deceive more slily thanUlysses could,

1519
01:50:51.270 --> 01:50:54.330
And, like a Sinon, takeanother Troy.

1520
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:56.830
I can add colours to thechameleon,

1521
01:50:56.830 --> 01:50:59.430
Change shapes with Proteusfor advantages,

1522
01:50:59.430 --> 01:51:02.600
And set the murderousMachiavel to school.

1523
01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:05.300
Can I do this, and cannotget a crown?

1524
01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:09.430
Tut, were it farther off,I'll pluck it down.

1525
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:11.100


1526
01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.230
Fair Queen of England,worthy Margaret,

1527
01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:39.030
Sit down with us: it illbefits thy state

1528
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:42.330
And birth, that thou shouldststand while Lewis doth sit.

1529
01:51:42.330 --> 01:51:45.400
No, mighty King of France:now Margaret

1530
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:49.270
Must strike her sail andlearn awhile to serve

1531
01:51:49.270 --> 01:51:52.970
Where kings command. Iwas, I must confess,

1532
01:51:52.970 --> 01:51:56.800
Great Albion's queen informer golden days:

1533
01:51:56.800 --> 01:52:00.600
But now mischance hathtrod my title down,

1534
01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.870
And with dishonour laid meon the ground;

1535
01:52:03.870 --> 01:52:07.130
Where I must take likeseat unto my fortune,

1536
01:52:07.130 --> 01:52:09.970
And to my humble stateconform myself.

1537
01:52:09.970 --> 01:52:14.600
Why, say, fair queen, whencesprings this deep despair?

1538
01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:19.070
From such a cause as fillsmine eyes with tears

1539
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:23.970
And stops my tongue, whileheart is drown'd in cares.

1540
01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:29.600
Whate'er it be, be thoustill like thyself,

1541
01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.600
And sit thee by our side:

1542
01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:37.700
Yield not thy neck

1543
01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:41.330
To fortune's yoke, but letthy dauntless mind

1544
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:44.970
Still ride in triumph overall mischance.

1545
01:52:44.970 --> 01:52:47.830
Be plain, Queen Margaret,and tell thy grief;

1546
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:51.200
It shall be eased, ifFrance can yield relief.

1547
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.900
Those gracious words revivemy drooping thoughts

1548
01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:59.100
And give my tongue-tiedsorrows leave to speak.

1549
01:52:59.100 --> 01:53:03.100
Now, therefore, be itknown to noble Lewis,

1550
01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:06.430
That Henry, sole possessorof my love,

1551
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:09.700
Is of a king become abanish'd man,

1552
01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:13.370
And forced to live inScotland a forlorn;

1553
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:17.500
While proud ambitiousEdward Duke of York

1554
01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:19.300
Usurps the regal title andthe seat

1555
01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:23.270
Of England's true-anointedlawful king.

1556
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:26.630
This is the cause that I,poor Margaret,

1557
01:53:26.630 --> 01:53:30.570
With this my son, PrinceEdward, Henry's heir,

1558
01:53:30.570 --> 01:53:35.470
Am come to crave thy justand lawful aid;

1559
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:39.030
And if thou fail us, allour hope is done:

1560
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:43.330
Scotland hath will tohelp, but cannot help;

1561
01:53:43.330 --> 01:53:46.270
Our people and our peersare both misled,

1562
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:50.100
Our treasures seized, oursoldiers put to flight,

1563
01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:54.470
And, as thou seest,ourselves in heavy plight.

1564
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:59.000
Renowned queen, withpatience calm the storm,

1565
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.830
While we bethink a meansto break it off.

1566
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:06.100
The more we stay, thestronger grows our foe.

1567
01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.800
The more I stay, the moreI'll succor thee.

1568
01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:13.500
O, but impatience waitethon true sorrow.

1569
01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:22.570
And see where comes thebreeder of my sorrow!

1570
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:24.470
What's he approachethboldly to our presence?

1571
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:27.830
Our Earl of Warwick,Edward's greatest friend.

1572
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:32.230
Welcome, brave Warwick!What brings thee to France?

1573
01:54:32.230 --> 01:54:36.100
Ay, now begins a secondstorm to rise;

1574
01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:39.400
For this is he that movesboth wind and tide.

1575
01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:41.600
From worthy Edward, Kingof Albion,

1576
01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.600
My lord and sovereign, andthy vowed friend,

1577
01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.200
I come, in kindness andunfeigned love,

1578
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.670
First, to do greetings tothy royal person;

1579
01:54:50.670 --> 01:54:53.430
And then to crave a leagueof amity;

1580
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:55.370
And lastly, to confirmthat amity

1581
01:54:55.370 --> 01:54:58.570
With a nuptial knot, ifthou vouchsafe to grant

1582
01:54:58.570 --> 01:55:01.200
That virtuous Lady Bona,thy fair sister,

1583
01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.270
To England's king inlawful marriage.

1584
01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.900
If that go forward,Henry's hope is done.

1585
01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:13.670
And, gracious madam, inour king's behalf,

1586
01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:15.300
I am commanded, with yourleave and favour,

1587
01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:21.030
Humbly to kiss your hand,and with my tongue

1588
01:55:21.030 --> 01:55:23.100
To tell the passion of mysovereign's heart;

1589
01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:25.600
Where fame, late enteringat his heedful ears,

1590
01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:29.370
Hath placed thy beauty'simage and thy virtue.

1591
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:35.330
King Lewis and Lady Bona,hear me speak,

1592
01:55:35.330 --> 01:55:38.970
Before you answerWarwick. His demand

1593
01:55:38.970 --> 01:55:43.000
Springs not from Edward'swell-meant honest love,

1594
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.800
But from deceitbred by necessity;

1595
01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:47.800
For how can tyrants safelygovern home,

1596
01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:51.570
Unless abroad theypurchase great alliance?

1597
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:55.170
To prove him tyrant thisreason may suffice,

1598
01:55:55.170 --> 01:55:58.170
That Henry liveth still:but were he dead,

1599
01:55:58.170 --> 01:56:02.730
Yet here Prince Edwardstands, King Henry's son.

1600
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:06.470
Look, therefore, Lewis, thatby this league and marriage

1601
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:10.270
Thou draw not on thydanger and dishonour;

1602
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:13.530
For though usurpers swaythe rule awhile,

1603
01:56:13.530 --> 01:56:16.500
Yet heavens are just, andtime suppresseth wrongs.

1604
01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:17.770
Injurious Margaret!

1605
01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:20.000
And why not queen?

1606
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.100
Because thy father Henrydid usurp;

1607
01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:26.200
And thou no more areprince than she is queen.

1608
01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:28.600
Then Warwick disannulsgreat John of Gaunt,

1609
01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:30.900
Which did subdue thegreatest part of Spain;

1610
01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:33.130
And, after John of Gaunt,Henry the Fourth,

1611
01:56:33.130 --> 01:56:35.030
Whose wisdom was a mirrorto the wisest;

1612
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:38.430
And, after that wiseprince, Henry the Fifth,

1613
01:56:38.430 --> 01:56:40.730
Who by his prowessconquered all France:

1614
01:56:40.730 --> 01:56:44.500
From these our Henrylineally descends.

1615
01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:49.100
Oxford, how haps it, inthis smooth discourse,

1616
01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:51.730
You told not how Henry theSixth hath lost

1617
01:56:51.730 --> 01:56:54.170
All that which Henry Fifthhad gotten?

1618
01:56:54.170 --> 01:56:57.270
Methinks these peers ofFrance should smile at that.

1619
01:56:57.270 --> 01:56:59.870
But for the rest, you tella pedigree

1620
01:56:59.870 --> 01:57:03.600
Of threescore and twoyears; a silly time

1621
01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.200
To make prescriptionfor a kingdom's worth.

1622
01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.830
Why, Warwick, canst thouspeak against thy liege,

1623
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:09.600
Whom thou obeyed'st thirtyand six years,

1624
01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.130
And not bewray thy treasonwith a blush?

1625
01:57:12.130 --> 01:57:14.430
Can Oxford, that did everfence the right,

1626
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:16.970
Now buckler falsehood witha pedigree?

1627
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:22.170
For shame! leave Henry,and call Edward king.

1628
01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:23.870
Call him my king by whoseinjurious doom

1629
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:25.630
My elder brother, the LordAubrey Vere,

1630
01:57:25.630 --> 01:57:28.900
Was done to death? andmore than so, my father,

1631
01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:30.530
Even in the downfall ofhis mellow'd years,

1632
01:57:30.530 --> 01:57:32.370
When nature brought him tothe door of death?

1633
01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:35.630
No, Warwick, no; whilelife upholds this arm,

1634
01:57:35.630 --> 01:57:38.230
This arm upholds the houseof Lancaster.

1635
01:57:38.230 --> 01:57:39.630
And I the house of York.

1636
01:57:39.630 --> 01:57:44.130
Queen Margaret, PrinceEdward, and Oxford,

1637
01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:46.770
Vouchsafe, at our request,to stand aside,

1638
01:57:46.770 --> 01:57:51.030
While I use furtherconference with Warwick.

1639
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:54.630
Heavens grant that Warwick'swords bewitch him not!

1640
01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:01.130
Now Warwick, tell me, evenupon thy conscience,

1641
01:58:01.130 --> 01:58:03.170
Is Edward your true king?for I were loath

1642
01:58:03.170 --> 01:58:06.070
To link with him that werenot lawful chosen.

1643
01:58:06.070 --> 01:58:09.570
Thereon I pawn my creditand mine honour.

1644
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:12.100
But is he gracious in thepeople's eye?

1645
01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:15.300
The more that Henry wasunfortunate.

1646
01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:19.570
Then further, alldissembling set aside,

1647
01:58:19.570 --> 01:58:21.670
Tell me for truth themeasure of his love

1648
01:58:21.670 --> 01:58:24.470
Unto our sister Bona.

1649
01:58:24.470 --> 01:58:25.330
Such it seems

1650
01:58:25.330 --> 01:58:29.970
As may beseem amonarch like himself.

1651
01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:34.270
Myself have often heardhim say and swear

1652
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:38.270
That this his love was aneternal plant,

1653
01:58:38.270 --> 01:58:41.330
Whereof the root was fix'din virtue's ground,

1654
01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:44.770
The leaves and fruitmaintain'd with beauty's sun,

1655
01:58:44.770 --> 01:58:49.070
Exempt from envy, but notfrom disdain,

1656
01:58:49.070 --> 01:58:53.130
Unless the Lady Bona quithis pain.

1657
01:58:53.130 --> 01:58:59.270
Now, sister, let us hearyour firm resolve.

1658
01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:06.900
Your grant, or yourdenial, shall be mine:

1659
01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:09.970
Yet I confess that oftenere this day,

1660
01:59:09.970 --> 01:59:13.370
When I have heard yourking's desert recounted,

1661
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:16.730
Mine ear hath temptedjudgment to desire.

1662
01:59:17.930 --> 01:59:23.770
Then, Warwick, thus: oursister shall be Edward's;

1663
01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:25.600
And now forthwith shallarticles be drawn

1664
01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:27.770
Touching the jointure thatyour king must make,

1665
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:29.970
Which with her dowry shallbe counterpoised.

1666
01:59:29.970 --> 01:59:33.870
Draw near, Queen Margaret,and be a witness

1667
01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:36.930
That Bona shall be wife tothe English king.

1668
01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:39.970
To Edward, but not to theEnglish king.

1669
01:59:39.970 --> 01:59:42.870
Deceitful Warwick! it wasthy device

1670
01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:46.330
By this alliance to makevoid my suit:

1671
01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:48.430
Before thy coming Lewiswas Henry's friend.

1672
01:59:48.430 --> 01:59:51.730
And still is friend to himand Margaret:

1673
01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:54.330
But if your title to thecrown be weak,

1674
01:59:54.330 --> 01:59:57.270
As may appear by Edward'sgood success,

1675
01:59:57.270 --> 01:59:58.830
Then 'tis but reason thatI be released

1676
01:59:58.830 --> 02:00:00.930
From giving aid which lateI promised.

1677
02:00:00.930 --> 02:00:03.900
Yet shall you have allkindness at my hand

1678
02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:06.470
That your estate requiresand mine can yield.

1679
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:09.030
Henry now lives inScotland at his ease,

1680
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:12.270
Where having nothing,nothing can he lose.

1681
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:15.500
And as for you yourself,our quondam queen,

1682
02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:18.030
You have a father able tomaintain you;

1683
02:00:18.030 --> 02:00:20.770
And better 'twere youtroubled him than France.

1684
02:00:20.770 --> 02:00:25.230
Peace, impudent andshameless Warwick, peace,

1685
02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:29.800
Proud setter up and pullerdown of kings!

1686
02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:32.600
I will not hence, till,with my talk and tears,

1687
02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:37.170
Both full of truth, I makeKing Lewis behold

1688
02:00:37.170 --> 02:00:40.170
Thy sly conveyance and thylord's false love;

1689
02:00:40.170 --> 02:00:43.300
For both of you are birdsof selfsame feather.

1690
02:00:43.300 --> 02:00:46.330
(horns sound)

1691
02:00:46.330 --> 02:00:49.270
Warwick, this is some postto us or thee.

1692
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:52.030
My lord ambassador, theseletters are for you,

1693
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:53.730
Sent from your brother,Marquess Montague:

1694
02:00:53.730 --> 02:00:56.670
These from our king untoyour majesty:

1695
02:00:56.970 --> 02:01:01.330
And, madam, these for you;from whom I know not.

1696
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:25.400
Warwick, what are thy news?and yours, fair queen?

1697
02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:30.230
Mine, such as fill myheart with unhoped joys.

1698
02:01:30.230 --> 02:01:34.970
Mine, full of sorrow andheart's discontent.

1699
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:38.830
What! has your kingmarried the Lady Grey!

1700
02:01:38.830 --> 02:01:41.670
And now, to soothe yourforgery and his,

1701
02:01:41.670 --> 02:01:44.600
Sends me a paper topersuade me patience?

1702
02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.800
Is this the alliance thathe seeks with France?

1703
02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:50.900
Dare he presume to scornus in this manner?

1704
02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:53.730
I told your majesty asmuch before:

1705
02:01:53.730 --> 02:02:00.230
This proveth Edward's loveand Warwick's honesty.

1706
02:02:00.230 --> 02:02:03.330
King Lewis, I here protest,in sight of heaven,

1707
02:02:03.330 --> 02:02:05.230
And by the hope I have ofheavenly bliss,

1708
02:02:05.230 --> 02:02:10.330
That I am clear from thismisdeed of Edward's,

1709
02:02:10.330 --> 02:02:13.600
No more my king, for hedishonours me,

1710
02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:18.270
But most himself, if hecould see his shame.

1711
02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:25.100
Did I impale him with theregal crown?

1712
02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:26.930
Did I put Henry from hisnative right?

1713
02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:31.000
And am I guerdon'd at thelast with shame?

1714
02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.500
Shame on himself! for mydesert is honour:

1715
02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:43.200
And to repair my honourlost for him,

1716
02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:49.030
I here renounce him andreturn to Henry.

1717
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:53.100
My noble queen, let formergrudges pass,

1718
02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.000
And henceforth I am thytrue servitor:

1719
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.700
I will revenge his wrongto Lady Bona,

1720
02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:03.830
And replant Henry in hisformer state.

1721
02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:15.230
Warwick, these words haveturn'd my hate to love;

1722
02:03:15.230 --> 02:03:19.700
And I forgive and quiteforget old faults,

1723
02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:24.300
And joy that thou becomestKing Henry's friend.

1724
02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:29.530
So much his friend, ay,his unfeigned friend,

1725
02:03:29.530 --> 02:03:31.730
That, if King Lewisvouchsafe to furnish us

1726
02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:33.930
With some few bands ofchosen soldiers,

1727
02:03:33.930 --> 02:03:36.270
I'll undertake to landthem on our coast

1728
02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:38.530
And force the tyrant fromhis seat by war.

1729
02:03:38.530 --> 02:03:41.230
Dear brother, how shallBona be revenged

1730
02:03:41.230 --> 02:03:43.800
But by thy help to thisdistressed queen?

1731
02:03:43.800 --> 02:03:47.700
Renowned prince, how shallpoor Henry live,

1732
02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:50.000
Unless thou rescue himfrom foul despair?

1733
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.100
My quarrel and thisEnglish queen's are one.

1734
02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:54.800
And mine, fair lady Bona,joins with yours.

1735
02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:57.700
And mine with hers, andthine, and Margaret's.

1736
02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:59.330
Therefore at last I firmlyam resolved

1737
02:03:59.330 --> 02:04:00.670
You shall have aid.

1738
02:04:00.670 --> 02:04:03.170
Let me give humble thanksfor all at once.

1739
02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:05.430
Then, England's messenger,return in post,

1740
02:04:05.430 --> 02:04:08.400
And tell false Edward, thysupposed king,

1741
02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:11.030
That Lewis of France issending over masquers

1742
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:13.830
To revel it with him andhis new bride:

1743
02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:17.470
Thou seest what's past, gofear thy king withal.

1744
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:21.070
Tell him, in hope he'llprove a widower shortly,

1745
02:04:21.070 --> 02:04:24.300
I'll wear the willowgarland for his sake.

1746
02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:27.600
Tell him, my mourningweeds are laid aside,

1747
02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:29.530
And I am ready to putarmour on.

1748
02:04:29.530 --> 02:04:34.070
Tell him from me that hehath done me wrong,

1749
02:04:34.070 --> 02:04:38.830
And therefore I'll uncrownhim ere't be long.

1750
02:04:38.830 --> 02:04:41.270
There's thy reward: begone.

1751
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:44.270
But, Warwick,

1752
02:04:44.270 --> 02:04:46.100
Thou and Oxford, with fivethousand men,

1753
02:04:46.100 --> 02:04:48.230
Shall cross the seas, andbid false Edward battle;

1754
02:04:48.230 --> 02:04:50.230
And, as occasion serves,this noble queen

1755
02:04:50.230 --> 02:04:51.870
And prince shall followwith a fresh supply.

1756
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:58.370
Yet, ere thou go, butanswer me one doubt,

1757
02:04:58.370 --> 02:05:04.000
What pledge have we of thyfirm loyalty?

1758
02:05:09.270 --> 02:05:13.070
This shall assure myconstant loyalty,

1759
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:14.870
That if our queen and thisyoung prince agree,

1760
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:18.870
I'll join mine eldestdaughter and my joy

1761
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:22.530
To him forthwith in holywedlock bands.

1762
02:05:22.530 --> 02:05:27.630
Yes, I agree, and thankyou for your motion.

1763
02:05:27.630 --> 02:05:30.500
Son Edward, she is fairand virtuous,

1764
02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:32.530
Therefore delay not, givethy hand to Warwick;

1765
02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:34.670
And, with thy hand, thyfaith irrevocable,

1766
02:05:34.670 --> 02:05:39.330
That only Warwick'sdaughter shall be thine.

1767
02:05:39.330 --> 02:05:43.600
Yes, I accept her, for shewell deserves it;

1768
02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:48.070
And here, to pledge myvow, I give my hand.

1769
02:05:49.230 --> 02:05:53.370
Why stay we now? Thesesoldiers shall be levied,

1770
02:05:53.370 --> 02:05:56.870
I long till Edward fall bywar's mischance,

1771
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:59.030
For mocking marriage witha dame of France.

1772
02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:24.530
I came from Edward asambassador,

1773
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:28.830
But I return his sworn andmortal foe:

1774
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:31.970
Matter of marriage was thecharge he gave me,

1775
02:06:31.970 --> 02:06:37.270
But dreadful war shallanswer his demand.

1776
02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:41.300
Had he none else to make astale but me?

1777
02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:45.630
Then none but I shall turnhis jest to sorrow.

1778
02:06:45.630 --> 02:06:48.870
I was the chief thatraised him to the crown,

1779
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:53.700
And I'll be chief to bringhim down again:

1780
02:06:53.700 --> 02:06:57.030
Not that I pity Henry'smisery,

1781
02:06:57.030 --> 02:07:03.130
But seek revenge onEdward's mockery.

1782
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:08.170
(♪cheers and horns)

1783
02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:24.970
Now tell me, brotherClarence, what think you

1784
02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:27.730
Of this new marriage withthe Lady Grey?

1785
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:30.200
Hath not our brother madea worthy choice?

1786
02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:34.130
Alas, you know, 'tis farfrom hence to France;

1787
02:07:34.130 --> 02:07:36.600
How could he stay tillWarwick made return?

1788
02:07:36.600 --> 02:07:39.570
My lords, forbear thistalk; here comes the king.

1789
02:07:39.570 --> 02:07:41.930
And his well-chosen bride.

1790
02:07:41.930 --> 02:07:44.270
I mind to tell him plainlywhat I think.

1791
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:07.570
Now, brother of Clarence,how like you our choice,

1792
02:08:07.570 --> 02:08:10.930
That you stand pensive, ashalf malcontent?

1793
02:08:10.930 --> 02:08:13.870
As well as Lewis of France,or the Earl of Warwick,

1794
02:08:13.870 --> 02:08:16.300
Which are so weak ofcourage and in judgment

1795
02:08:16.300 --> 02:08:19.430
That they'll take nooffence at our abuse.

1796
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:22.130
Suppose they take offencewithout a cause,

1797
02:08:22.130 --> 02:08:24.030
They are but Lewis andWarwick: I am Edward,

1798
02:08:24.030 --> 02:08:27.830
Your king and Warwick's,and must have my will.

1799
02:08:27.830 --> 02:08:31.030
And shall have your will,because our king:

1800
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:33.670
Yet hasty marriage seldomproveth well.

1801
02:08:33.670 --> 02:08:35.800
Yea, brother Richard, areyou offended too?

1802
02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:38.870
No, God forbid that Ishould wish them sever'd

1803
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:41.730
Whom God hath join'dtogether; ay, and 'twere pity

1804
02:08:41.730 --> 02:08:44.200
To sunder them that yokeso well together.

1805
02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:45.870
(laughing)

1806
02:08:56.430 --> 02:08:59.300
Setting your scorns andyour mislike aside,

1807
02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:00.770
Tell me some reason whythe Lady Grey

1808
02:09:00.770 --> 02:09:04.570
Should not become my wifeand England's queen.

1809
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.170
And you too, Somerset andMontague,

1810
02:09:06.170 --> 02:09:08.070
Speak freely what youthink.

1811
02:09:08.070 --> 02:09:11.030
Then this is mine opinion:that King Lewis

1812
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:12.700
Becomes your enemy, formocking him

1813
02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:14.600
About the marriage of theLady Bona.

1814
02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:16.170
And Warwick, doing whatyou gave in charge,

1815
02:09:16.170 --> 02:09:18.800
Is now dishonoured by thisnew marriage.

1816
02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.600
What if both Lewis andWarwick be appeased

1817
02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.570
By such invention as I candevise?

1818
02:09:23.570 --> 02:09:26.270
Yet, to have join'd withFrance in such alliance

1819
02:09:26.270 --> 02:09:28.900
Would more have strengthen'dthis our commonwealth

1820
02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:33.770
'Gainst foreign storms thanany home-bred marriage.

1821
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:35.430
Why, knows not Montaguethat of itself

1822
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:38.070
England is safe, if truewithin itself?

1823
02:09:38.070 --> 02:09:39.800
But the safer when 'tisback'd with France.

1824
02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:42.470
'Tis better using Francethan trusting France:

1825
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:44.400
Let us be back'd with Godand with the seas

1826
02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:46.830
Which He hath given forfence impregnable,

1827
02:09:46.830 --> 02:09:49.200
And with their helps onlydefend ourselves;

1828
02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.900
In them and in ourselvesour safety lies.

1829
02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:54.200
For this one speech LordHastings well deserves

1830
02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:56.100
To have the heir of theLord Hungerford.

1831
02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:58.800
Ay, what of that? it wasmy will and grant;

1832
02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.030
And for this once my willshall stand for law.

1833
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:05.270
And yet methinks yourgrace hath not done well,

1834
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:07.330
To give the heir anddaughter of Lord Scales

1835
02:10:07.330 --> 02:10:10.100
Unto the brother of yourloving bride;

1836
02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:12.900
She better would havefitted me or Clarence:

1837
02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:15.330
But in your bride you burybrotherhood.

1838
02:10:15.330 --> 02:10:17.170
Or else you would not havebestow'd the heir

1839
02:10:17.170 --> 02:10:19.130
Of the Lord Bonville onyour new wife's son,

1840
02:10:19.130 --> 02:10:21.100
And leave your brothers togo speed elsewhere.

1841
02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:25.100
Alas, poor Clarence! is itfor a wife

1842
02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:30.070
That thou art malcontent?I will provide thee.

1843
02:10:30.070 --> 02:10:32.530
In choosing for yourself,you show'd your judgment,

1844
02:10:32.530 --> 02:10:34.300
Which being shallow, yougive me leave

1845
02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:36.230
To play the broker in mineown behalf;

1846
02:10:36.230 --> 02:10:38.900
And to that end I shortlymind to leave you.

1847
02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:42.030
Leave me, or tarry, Edwardwill be king,

1848
02:10:42.030 --> 02:10:44.630
And not be tied unto hisbrother's will.

1849
02:10:44.630 --> 02:10:48.900
My lords, before itpleased his majesty

1850
02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:50.500
To raise my state to titleof a queen,

1851
02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:52.930
Do me but right, and youmust all confess

1852
02:10:52.930 --> 02:10:55.670
That I was not ignoble ofdescent;

1853
02:10:55.670 --> 02:10:59.470
And meaner than myselfhave had like fortune.

1854
02:10:59.470 --> 02:11:01.100
But as this title honoursme and mine,

1855
02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:05.100
So your dislike, to whom Iwould be pleasing,

1856
02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:08.670
Doth cloud my joys withdanger and with sorrow.

1857
02:11:08.670 --> 02:11:12.070
My love, forbear to fawnupon their frowns:

1858
02:11:12.070 --> 02:11:14.400
What danger or what sorrowcan befall thee,

1859
02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.430
So long as Edward is thyconstant friend,

1860
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:20.170
And their true sovereign,whom they must obey?

1861
02:11:20.170 --> 02:11:23.800
Nay, whom they shall obey,and love thee too,

1862
02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:26.400
Unless they seek forhatred at my hands;

1863
02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.700
Which if they do, yet willI keep thee safe,

1864
02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:34.170
And they shall feel thevengeance of my wrath.

1865
02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:40.700
I hear, yet say not much,but think the more.

1866
02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.830
Now, messenger, whatletters or what news

1867
02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:48.830
From France?

1868
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:51.930
My sovereign liege, noletters; and few words,

1869
02:11:51.930 --> 02:11:54.300
But such as I, withoutyour special pardon,

1870
02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.270
Dare not relate.

1871
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:57.470
Go to, we pardon thee:therefore, in brief,

1872
02:11:57.470 --> 02:12:01.030
Tell me their words as nearas thou canst guess them.

1873
02:12:01.030 --> 02:12:03.370
What answer makes KingLewis unto our letters?

1874
02:12:03.370 --> 02:12:07.900
At my depart, these werehis very words:

1875
02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:10.830
'Go tell false Edward, thysupposed king,

1876
02:12:10.830 --> 02:12:13.570
That Lewis of France issending over masquers

1877
02:12:13.570 --> 02:12:16.430
To revel it with him andhis new bride.'

1878
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:23.100
Is Lewis so brave? belikehe thinks me Henry.

1879
02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:26.930
But what said Lady Bona tomy marriage?

1880
02:12:26.930 --> 02:12:31.100
These were her words,utter'd with mad disdain:

1881
02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:34.070
'Tell him, in hope he'llprove a widower shortly,

1882
02:12:34.070 --> 02:12:36.500
I'll wear the willowgarland for his sake.'

1883
02:12:38.230 --> 02:12:40.500
I blame not her, she couldsay little less;

1884
02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:45.270
She had the wrong. Butwhat said Henry's queen?

1885
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:47.030
For I have heard that shewas there in place.

1886
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:50.570
'Tell him,' quoth she, 'mymourning weeds are done,

1887
02:12:50.570 --> 02:12:53.470
And I am ready to putarmour on.'

1888
02:12:55.330 --> 02:12:57.230
Belike she minds to playthe Amazon.

1889
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:04.670
But what said Warwick tothese injuries?

1890
02:13:04.670 --> 02:13:07.170
He, more incensed againstyour majesty

1891
02:13:07.170 --> 02:13:11.200
Than all the rest, dischargedme with these words:

1892
02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.970
'Tell him from me that hehath done me wrong,

1893
02:13:14.970 --> 02:13:17.470
And therefore I'll uncrownhim ere't be long.'

1894
02:13:19.830 --> 02:13:28.930
Ha! durst the traitorbreathe out so proud words?

1895
02:13:33.370 --> 02:13:38.470
Well I will arm me, beingthus forewarn'd:

1896
02:13:39.370 --> 02:13:44.330
They shall have wars andpay for their presumption.

1897
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:50.000
But say, is Warwickfriends with Margaret?

1898
02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:53.030
Ay, gracious sovereign; theyare so link'd in friendship

1899
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:58.130
That young Prince Edwardmarries Warwick's daughter.

1900
02:13:58.130 --> 02:14:03.600
Belike the elder; Clarencewill have the younger.

1901
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:11.700
Now, brother king,farewell, and sit you fast,

1902
02:14:11.700 --> 02:14:15.130
For I will hence toWarwick's other daughter;

1903
02:14:15.130 --> 02:14:17.930
That, though I want akingdom, yet in marriage

1904
02:14:17.930 --> 02:14:21.400
I may not prove inferiorto yourself.

1905
02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:24.330
You that love me andWarwick, follow me.

1906
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:33.170
Not I:

1907
02:14:33.170 --> 02:14:34.930
My thoughts aim at afurther matter; I

1908
02:14:34.930 --> 02:14:37.700
Stay not for the love ofEdward, but the crown.

1909
02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:45.400
Clarence and Somerset bothgone to Warwick!

1910
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:51.100
Yet am I arm'd against theworst can happen;

1911
02:14:51.100 --> 02:14:53.230
And haste is needful inthis desperate case.

1912
02:14:53.230 --> 02:14:55.600
Go levy men, and makeprepare for war;

1913
02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:57.870
Myself in person willstraight follow you.

1914
02:14:57.870 --> 02:14:59.600
But, ere I go, Hastingsand Montague,

1915
02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:02.300
Resolve my doubt. Youtwain, of all the rest,

1916
02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:04.530
Are near to Warwick byblood and by alliance:

1917
02:15:04.530 --> 02:15:06.800
Tell me if you loveWarwick more than me?

1918
02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:08.470
If it be so, then bothdepart to him;

1919
02:15:08.470 --> 02:15:11.100
I rather wish you foesthan hollow friends:

1920
02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:13.270
But if you mind to holdyour true obedience,

1921
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:15.430
Give me assurance withsome friendly vow,

1922
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:17.300
That I may never have youin suspect.

1923
02:15:17.300 --> 02:15:20.930
So God help Montague as heproves true!

1924
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:24.070
And Hastings as he favoursEdward's cause!

1925
02:15:26.930 --> 02:15:30.730
Now, brother Richard, willyou stand by us?

1926
02:15:32.730 --> 02:15:39.300
Ay, in despite of all thatshall withstand you.

1927
02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:42.770
Why, so! then am I sure ofvictory.

1928
02:15:42.770 --> 02:15:45.730
Now therefore let ushence; and lose no hour,

1929
02:15:45.730 --> 02:15:48.700
Till we meet Warwick withhis foreign power.

1930
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:15.370
Trust me, my lord, allhitherto goes well;

1931
02:16:15.370 --> 02:16:19.030
The common people bynumbers swarm to us.

1932
02:16:20.130 --> 02:16:23.070
But see where Somerset andClarence come!

1933
02:16:24.470 --> 02:16:27.700
Speak suddenly, my lords,are we all friends?

1934
02:16:27.700 --> 02:16:31.270
Fear not that, my lord.

1935
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:33.770
Then, gentle Clarence,welcome unto Warwick;

1936
02:16:33.770 --> 02:16:39.330
And welcome, Somerset: Ihold it cowardice

1937
02:16:39.330 --> 02:16:41.730
To rest mistrustful wherea noble heart

1938
02:16:41.730 --> 02:16:45.230
Hath pawn'd an open handin sign of love;

1939
02:16:45.230 --> 02:16:49.730
Else might I think thatClarence, Edward's brother,

1940
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:52.230
Were but a feigned friendto our proceedings:

1941
02:16:53.900 --> 02:16:57.630
But come, sweet Clarence;my daughter shall be thine.

1942
02:16:57.630 --> 02:17:01.830
And now what rests but, innight's coverture,

1943
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:04.670
Thy brother beingcarelessly encamp'd,

1944
02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:06.800
His soldiers lurking inthe towns about,

1945
02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:08.270
And but attended by asimple guard,

1946
02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:11.930
We may surprise and takehim at our pleasure?

1947
02:17:11.930 --> 02:17:14.800
Our scouts have found theadventure very easy:

1948
02:17:14.800 --> 02:17:18.230
So we, well cover'd withthe night's black mantle,

1949
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:20.630
At unawares may beat downEdward's guard

1950
02:17:20.630 --> 02:17:25.270
And seize himself; I saynot, slaughter him,

1951
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:29.970
For I intend but only tosurprise him.

1952
02:17:29.970 --> 02:17:31.930
You that will follow me tothis attempt,

1953
02:17:31.930 --> 02:17:34.170
Applaud the name of Henrywith your leader.

1954
02:17:34.170 --> 02:17:36.170
Henry! Henry! Henry

1955
02:17:37.930 --> 02:17:40.470
Why, then, let's on ourway in silent sort:

1956
02:17:40.470 --> 02:17:46.330
For Warwick and his friends,God and Saint George!

1957
02:17:55.770 --> 02:18:07.230
Come on, my masters, eachman take his stand:

1958
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:11.230
The king by this is sethim down to sleep.

1959
02:18:11.230 --> 02:18:14.730
What, will he not to bed?

1960
02:18:14.730 --> 02:18:19.030
Why, no; for he hath madea solemn vow

1961
02:18:19.030 --> 02:18:20.800
Never to lie and take hisnatural rest

1962
02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:23.800
Till Warwick or himself bequite suppress'd.

1963
02:18:26.130 --> 02:18:29.470
To-morrow then belikeshall be the day,

1964
02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:31.670
If Warwick be so near asmen report.

1965
02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:34.500
But say, I pray, whatnobleman is that

1966
02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:37.100
That with the king hereresteth in his tent?

1967
02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:42.570
'Tis the Lord Hastings, theking's chiefest friend.

1968
02:18:42.570 --> 02:18:50.430
O, is it so? But whycommands the king

1969
02:18:50.430 --> 02:18:54.070
That his chief followerslodge in towns about him,

1970
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:59.170
While he himself keeps inthe cold field?

1971
02:18:59.170 --> 02:19:03.230
'Tis the more honour,because more dangerous.

1972
02:19:03.230 --> 02:19:06.830
Ay, but give me worshipand quietness;

1973
02:19:06.830 --> 02:19:09.870
I like it better than adangerous honour.

1974
02:19:09.870 --> 02:19:12.270
If Warwick knew in whatestate he stands,

1975
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:14.600
'Tis to be doubted hewould waken him.

1976
02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:17.400
Unless our halberds didshut up his passage.

1977
02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:21.570
Ay, wherefore else guardwe his royal tent,

1978
02:19:21.570 --> 02:19:24.600
But to defend his personfrom night-foes?

1979
02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:35.230
(whistles sound from differentdirections)

1980
02:19:35.930 --> 02:19:37.770
Who goes there?

1981
02:19:37.770 --> 02:19:40.330
(whistle)

1982
02:19:40.330 --> 02:19:42.300
Stay, or thou diest!

1983
02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:44.770
(screams)

1984
02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:52.500
What are they that flythere?

1985
02:19:52.500 --> 02:20:02.100
Richard and Hastings: letthem go; here is The duke.

1986
02:20:02.100 --> 02:20:05.070
Why, Warwick,when we parted,

1987
02:20:05.070 --> 02:20:07.230
Thou call'dst me king.

1988
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:10.230
Ay, but the case isalter'd:

1989
02:20:10.230 --> 02:20:13.770
When you disgraced me inmy embassade,

1990
02:20:13.770 --> 02:20:16.470
Then I degraded you frombeing king,

1991
02:20:16.470 --> 02:20:20.300
And come now to create youDuke of York.

1992
02:20:20.830 --> 02:20:25.070
Alas! how should yougovern any kingdom,

1993
02:20:25.070 --> 02:20:27.730
That know not how to useambassadors,

1994
02:20:27.730 --> 02:20:30.630
Nor how to be contentedwith one wife,

1995
02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:34.300
Nor how to use yourbrothers brotherly,

1996
02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:39.270
Nor how to study for thepeople's welfare,

1997
02:20:39.270 --> 02:20:43.870
Nor how to shroud yourselffrom enemies?

1998
02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:49.900
Yea, brother of Clarence,are thou here too?

1999
02:20:49.900 --> 02:20:53.470
Nay, then I see thatEdward needs must down.

2000
02:20:53.470 --> 02:20:58.670
Yet, Warwick, in despiteof all mischance,

2001
02:20:58.670 --> 02:21:02.670
Of thee thyself and allthy complices,

2002
02:21:02.670 --> 02:21:05.930
Edward will always bearhimself as king:

2003
02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:10.370
Though fortune's maliceoverthrow my state,

2004
02:21:10.370 --> 02:21:15.600
My mind exceeds thecompass of her wheel.

2005
02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:23.570
Then, for his mind, beEdward England's king:

2006
02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:31.430
But Henry now shall wearthe English crown,

2007
02:21:31.430 --> 02:21:38.400
And be true king indeed,thou but the shadow.

2008
02:21:39.630 --> 02:21:40.930
My Lord of Somerset, at myrequest,

2009
02:21:40.930 --> 02:21:42.700
See that forthwith DukeEdward be convey'd

2010
02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:45.400
Unto my brother,Archbishop of York.

2011
02:21:56.100 --> 02:22:01.000
So, for a while farewell,good Duke of York.

2012
02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.900
What fates impose, thatmen must needs abide;

2013
02:22:04.900 --> 02:22:10.400
It boots not to resistboth wind and tide.

2014
02:22:23.170 --> 02:22:24.570
What now remains, mylords, for us to do

2015
02:22:24.570 --> 02:22:28.070
But march to London withour soldiers?

2016
02:22:28.070 --> 02:22:31.530
Ay, that's the first thingthat we have to do;

2017
02:22:31.530 --> 02:22:34.930
To free King Henry fromimprisonment

2018
02:22:34.930 --> 02:22:38.500
And see him seated in theregal throne.

2019
02:22:41.370 --> 02:22:43.670
These news I must confessare full of grief;

2020
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:45.930
Yet, dearest sister, bearit as you may:

2021
02:22:45.930 --> 02:22:49.970
Warwick may lose, that nowhath won the day.

2022
02:22:50.470 --> 02:22:54.630
Till then fair hope musthinder life's decay.

2023
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:55.930
And I the rather wean mefrom despair

2024
02:22:55.930 --> 02:22:59.070
For love of Edward'soffspring in my womb:

2025
02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:01.770
This is it that makes mebridle passion

2026
02:23:01.770 --> 02:23:05.330
And bear with mildness mymisfortune's cross;

2027
02:23:05.330 --> 02:23:08.770
Ay, ay, for this I draw inmany a tear

2028
02:23:08.770 --> 02:23:10.770
And stop the rising ofblood-sucking sighs,

2029
02:23:10.770 --> 02:23:13.400
Lest with my sighs ortears I blast or drown

2030
02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:19.000
King Edward's fruit, trueheir to the English crown.

2031
02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.200
But, madam, where isWarwick then become?

2032
02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.670
I am inform'd that hecomes towards London,

2033
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:26.130
To set the crown once moreon Henry's head:

2034
02:23:26.130 --> 02:23:29.100
Guess thou the rest; KingEdward's friends must down,

2035
02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:31.230
But, to prevent thetyrant's violence,--

2036
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:33.400
For trust not him thathath once broken faith,--

2037
02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:35.670
I'll hence forthwith untothe sanctuary,

2038
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:37.830
To save at least the heirof Edward's right:

2039
02:23:37.830 --> 02:23:40.370
There shall I rest securefrom force and fraud.

2040
02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:43.670
Come, therefore, let usfly while we may fly:

2041
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:47.230
If Warwick take us we aresure to die.

2042
02:23:57.070 --> 02:23:59.400
Now, my Lord Hastings andSir William Stanley,

2043
02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:00.970
Leave off to wonder why Idrew you hither,

2044
02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:03.300
Into this chiefest thicketof the park.

2045
02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:05.630
Thus stands the case: youknow our king, my brother,

2046
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:07.730
Is prisoner to the bishophere, at whose hands

2047
02:24:07.730 --> 02:24:09.870
He hath good usage andgreat liberty,

2048
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:12.070
And, often but attendedwith weak guard,

2049
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:15.630
Comes hunting this way todisport himself.

2050
02:24:15.630 --> 02:24:17.430
I have advertised him bysecret means

2051
02:24:17.430 --> 02:24:19.300
That if about this hour hemake this way

2052
02:24:19.300 --> 02:24:21.400
He shall here find hisfriends with horse and men

2053
02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:23.630
To set him free from hiscaptivity.

2054
02:24:24.370 --> 02:24:27.200
This way, my lord; forthis way lies the game.

2055
02:24:27.200 --> 02:24:33.970
Nay, this way, man: seewhere the huntsmen stand.

2056
02:24:33.970 --> 02:24:36.600
Now, brother of Gloucester,Lord Hastings, and the rest,

2057
02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:39.730
Stand you thus close, tosteal the bishop's deer?

2058
02:24:39.730 --> 02:24:41.300
Brother, the time and caserequireth haste:

2059
02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:43.200
Your horse stands ready atthe park-corner.

2060
02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:44.470
But whither shall we then?

2061
02:24:44.470 --> 02:24:45.600
To Lynn, my lord,

2062
02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:47.100
And ship from thence toFlanders.

2063
02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.070
Well guess'd, believe me;for that was my meaning.

2064
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:51.730
Stanley, I will requitethy forwardness.

2065
02:24:51.730 --> 02:24:53.230
But wherefore stay we?'tis no time to talk.

2066
02:24:53.230 --> 02:24:56.900
Huntsman, what say'stthou? wilt thou go along?

2067
02:24:57.670 --> 02:24:59.300
Better do so than tarryand be hang'd.

2068
02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:02.230
Come then, away; let's ha'no more ado.

2069
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:05.470
Bishop, farewell: shieldthee from Warwick's frown;

2070
02:25:05.470 --> 02:25:10.770
And pray that I mayrepossess the crown.

2071
02:25:22.630 --> 02:25:29.700
Master lieutenant, nowthat God and friends

2072
02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:32.670
Have shaken Edward fromthe regal seat,

2073
02:25:32.670 --> 02:25:34.670
And turn'd my captivestate to liberty,

2074
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:36.900
My fear to hope, mysorrows unto joys,

2075
02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:39.600
At our enlargement whatare thy due fees?

2076
02:25:40.070 --> 02:25:43.670
Subjects may challengenothing of their sovereigns;

2077
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:45.930
But if an humble prayermay prevail,

2078
02:25:45.930 --> 02:25:48.730
I then crave pardon ofyour majesty.

2079
02:25:48.730 --> 02:25:51.800
For what, lieutenant? forwell using me?

2080
02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:54.870
Nay, be thou sure I'llwell requite thy kindness,

2081
02:25:54.870 --> 02:25:57.870
For that it made myimprisonment a pleasure;

2082
02:25:57.870 --> 02:26:00.630
Ay, such a pleasure asincaged birds

2083
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:04.330
Conceive when after manymoody thoughts

2084
02:26:04.330 --> 02:26:06.470
At last by notes ofhousehold harmony

2085
02:26:06.470 --> 02:26:09.300
They quite forget theirloss of liberty.

2086
02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:16.530
But, Warwick, after God,thou set'st me free,

2087
02:26:16.530 --> 02:26:19.900
And chiefly therefore Ithank God and thee;

2088
02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:22.300
He was the author, thouthe instrument.

2089
02:26:22.300 --> 02:26:27.800
Therefore, that I mayconquer fortune's spite

2090
02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:31.430
By living low, wherefortune cannot hurt me,

2091
02:26:31.430 --> 02:26:33.070
And that the people ofthis blessed land

2092
02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:37.100
May not be punish'd withmy thwarting stars,

2093
02:26:37.100 --> 02:26:40.900
Warwick, although my headstill wear the crown,

2094
02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:44.400
I here resign mygovernment to thee,

2095
02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:47.630
For thou art fortunate inall thy deeds.

2096
02:26:47.630 --> 02:26:49.700
Your grace hath still beenfamed for virtuous;

2097
02:26:49.700 --> 02:26:52.000
And now may seem as wiseas virtuous,

2098
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.930
By spying and avoidingfortune's malice,

2099
02:26:54.930 --> 02:26:58.100
For few men rightly temperwith the stars:

2100
02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:00.670
Yet in this one thing letme blame your grace,

2101
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:03.830
For choosing me whenClarence is in place.

2102
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:07.330
No, Warwick, thou artworthy of the sway,

2103
02:27:07.330 --> 02:27:09.170
To whom the heavens in thynativity

2104
02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:11.030
Adjudged an olive branchand laurel crown,

2105
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:13.470
As likely to be blest inpeace and war;

2106
02:27:13.470 --> 02:27:16.030
And therefore I yield theemy free consent.

2107
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:19.870
And I choose Clarence onlyfor protector.

2108
02:27:19.870 --> 02:27:24.670
Warwick and Clarence giveme both your hands:

2109
02:27:24.670 --> 02:27:28.230
Now join your hands, andwith your hands your hearts,

2110
02:27:28.230 --> 02:27:31.370
That no dissension hindergovernment:

2111
02:27:31.370 --> 02:27:34.230
I make you both protectorsof this land,

2112
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:37.370
While I myself will lead aprivate life

2113
02:27:37.370 --> 02:27:39.600
And in devotion spend mylatter days,

2114
02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:42.730
To sin's rebuke and myCreator's praise.

2115
02:27:42.730 --> 02:27:44.630
What answers Clarence tohis sovereign's will?

2116
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:47.470
That he consents, ifWarwick yield consent;

2117
02:27:47.470 --> 02:27:50.100
For on thy fortune Irepose myself.

2118
02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:54.730
Why, then, though loath,yet must I be content:

2119
02:27:57.930 --> 02:28:00.100
We'll yoke together, likea double shadow

2120
02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:02.830
To Henry's body, andsupply his place;

2121
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:05.230
I mean, in bearing weightof government,

2122
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:08.130
While he enjoys the honourand his ease.

2123
02:28:08.130 --> 02:28:10.200
And, Clarence, now then itis more than needful

2124
02:28:10.200 --> 02:28:13.400
Forthwith that Edward bepronounced a traitor,

2125
02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:16.500
And all his lands andgoods be confiscate.

2126
02:28:16.500 --> 02:28:20.300
What else? and thatsuccession be determined.

2127
02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:23.030
Ay, therein Clarence shallnot want his part.

2128
02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:25.470
But, with the first of allyour chief affairs,

2129
02:28:25.470 --> 02:28:29.100
Let me entreat, for Icommand no more,

2130
02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:31.130
That Margaret your queenand my son Edward

2131
02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:33.570
Be sent for, to returnfrom France with speed;

2132
02:28:33.570 --> 02:28:36.000
For, till I see them here,by doubtful fear

2133
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
My joy of liberty is halfeclipsed.

2134
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:42.130
It shall be done, mysovereign, with all speed.

2135
02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:46.400
My Lord of Somerset, whatyouth is that,

2136
02:28:46.400 --> 02:28:49.070
Of whom you seem to haveso tender care?

2137
02:28:49.070 --> 02:28:52.570
My liege, it is youngHenry, earl of Richmond.

2138
02:28:52.570 --> 02:28:58.670
Come hither, England'shope.

2139
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:59.600
If secret powers

2140
02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:02.800
Suggest but truth to mydivining thoughts,

2141
02:29:02.800 --> 02:29:07.200
This pretty lad will proveour country's bliss.

2142
02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:10.000
His looks are full ofpeaceful majesty,

2143
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:14.330
His head by nature framedto wear a crown,

2144
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:17.170
His hand to wield asceptre, and himself

2145
02:29:17.170 --> 02:29:24.470
Likely in time to bless aregal throne.

2146
02:29:24.470 --> 02:29:26.570
Make much of him, mylords, for this is he

2147
02:29:26.570 --> 02:29:29.630
Must help you more thanyou are hurt by me.

2148
02:29:29.630 --> 02:29:32.030
(trumpets sound)

2149
02:29:33.130 --> 02:29:34.270
What news, my friend?

2150
02:29:34.270 --> 02:29:36.770
That Edward is escapedfrom your brother,

2151
02:29:36.770 --> 02:29:38.130
And fled, as he hearssince, to Burgundy.

2152
02:29:38.130 --> 02:29:40.570
Unsavoury news! but howmade he escape?

2153
02:29:40.570 --> 02:29:42.170
He was convey'd by RichardDuke of Gloucester

2154
02:29:42.170 --> 02:29:44.370
And the Lord Hastings, whoattended him

2155
02:29:44.370 --> 02:29:45.930
In secret ambush on theforest side

2156
02:29:45.930 --> 02:29:47.600
And from the bishop'shuntsmen rescued him;

2157
02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:49.330
For hunting was his dailyexercise.

2158
02:29:49.330 --> 02:29:52.630
My brother was toocareless of his charge.

2159
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:53.900
But let us hence, mysovereign, to provide

2160
02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.330
A salve for any sore thatmay betide.

2161
02:30:10.170 --> 02:30:14.130
My lord, I like not ofthis flight of Edward's;

2162
02:30:14.130 --> 02:30:15.570
For doubtless Burgundywill yield him help,

2163
02:30:15.570 --> 02:30:19.070
And we shall have morewars before 't be long.

2164
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:21.800
As Henry's late presagingprophecy

2165
02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:24.230
Did glad my heart with hopeof this young Richmond,

2166
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:27.000
So doth my heart misgiveme, in these conflicts

2167
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:31.170
What may befall him, tohis harm and ours:

2168
02:30:31.170 --> 02:30:33.830
Therefore, Lord Oxford, toprevent the worst,

2169
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:35.500
Forthwith we'll send himhence to Brittany,

2170
02:30:35.500 --> 02:30:37.970
Till storms be past ofcivil enmity.

2171
02:30:37.970 --> 02:30:41.900
Ay, for if Edwardrepossess the crown,

2172
02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:44.670
'Tis like that Richmondwith the rest shall down.

2173
02:30:44.670 --> 02:30:47.270
It shall be so; he shallto Brittany.

2174
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:49.400
Come, therefore, let'sabout it speedily.

2175
02:31:09.130 --> 02:31:13.030
Now, brother Richard,Hastings, and Lord Stanley,

2176
02:31:13.030 --> 02:31:15.930
Yet thus far fortunemaketh us amends,

2177
02:31:15.930 --> 02:31:18.270
And says that once more Ishall interchange

2178
02:31:18.270 --> 02:31:21.430
My waned state for Henry'sregal crown.

2179
02:31:22.470 --> 02:31:25.800
Well have we pass'd andnow repass'd the seas

2180
02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:28.930
And brought desired helpfrom Burgundy:

2181
02:31:28.930 --> 02:31:30.330
What then remains, webeing thus arrived

2182
02:31:30.330 --> 02:31:32.770
From Ravenspurgh havenbefore the gates of York,

2183
02:31:32.770 --> 02:31:39.800
But that we enter, as intoour dukedom?

2184
02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:57.430
The gates made fast!Brother, I like not this;

2185
02:31:57.430 --> 02:31:58.730
For many men that stumbleat the threshold

2186
02:31:58.730 --> 02:32:01.500
Are well foretold thatdanger lurks within.

2187
02:32:01.500 --> 02:32:05.270
Tush, man, abodements mustnot now affright us:

2188
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:09.130
By fair or foul means wemust enter in,

2189
02:32:09.130 --> 02:32:10.330
For hither will ourfriends repair to us.

2190
02:32:10.330 --> 02:32:12.470
My liege, I'll knock oncemore to summon them.

2191
02:32:12.470 --> 02:32:17.870
My lords, we wereforewarned of your coming,

2192
02:32:17.870 --> 02:32:21.200
And shut the gates forsafety of ourselves;

2193
02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:23.500
For now we owe allegianceunto Henry.

2194
02:32:23.500 --> 02:32:26.600
But, master mayor, ifHenry be your king,

2195
02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:29.100
Yet Edward at the least isDuke of York.

2196
02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:31.970
True, my good lord; I knowyou for no less.

2197
02:32:31.970 --> 02:32:34.630
Why, and I challengenothing but my dukedom,

2198
02:32:34.630 --> 02:32:36.870
As being well content withthat alone.

2199
02:32:36.870 --> 02:32:38.770
But when the fox hath oncegot in his nose,

2200
02:32:38.770 --> 02:32:40.700
He'll soon find means tomake the body follow.

2201
02:32:40.700 --> 02:32:44.100
Why, master mayor, whystand you in a doubt?

2202
02:32:44.100 --> 02:32:49.700
Open the gates; we areKing Henry's friends.

2203
02:32:49.700 --> 02:33:01.570
Ay, say you so? the gatesshall then be open'd.

2204
02:33:02.470 --> 02:33:05.070
A wise stout captain, andsoon persuaded!

2205
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:06.730
The good old man wouldfain that all were well,

2206
02:33:06.730 --> 02:33:09.000
So 'twere not 'long ofhim; but being enter'd,

2207
02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.570
I doubt not, I, but weshall soon persuade

2208
02:33:10.570 --> 02:33:15.570
Both him and all hisbrothers unto reason.

2209
02:33:15.570 --> 02:33:19.630
So, master mayor: thesegates must not be shut

2210
02:33:19.630 --> 02:33:23.800
But in the night or in thetime of war.

2211
02:33:24.770 --> 02:33:26.600
What! fear not, man, butyield me up the keys;

2212
02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:29.500
For Edward will defend thetown and thee,

2213
02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:32.700
And all those friends thatdeign to follow me.

2214
02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:34.870
(♪drums)

2215
02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:36.630
Brother, this is Sir JohnMontgomery,

2216
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:39.800
Our trusty friend, unlessI be deceived.

2217
02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:42.570
Welcome, Sir John! But whycome you in arms?

2218
02:33:42.570 --> 02:33:45.300
To help King Edward in histime of storm,

2219
02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:48.670
As every loyal subjectought to do.

2220
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:52.100
Thanks, good Montgomery;but we now forget

2221
02:33:52.100 --> 02:33:54.070
Our title to the crown andonly claim

2222
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:57.070
Our dukedom till Godplease to send the rest.

2223
02:33:57.070 --> 02:33:59.400
Then fare you well, for Iwill hence again:

2224
02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:01.630
I came to serve a king andnot a duke.

2225
02:34:01.630 --> 02:34:03.630
Drummer, strike up, andlet us march away.

2226
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:07.730
Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate

2227
02:34:07.730 --> 02:34:10.770
By what safe means thecrown may be recover'd.

2228
02:34:10.770 --> 02:34:13.930
What talk you of debating?In few words,

2229
02:34:13.930 --> 02:34:16.070
If you'll not here proclaimyourself our king,

2230
02:34:16.070 --> 02:34:17.870
I'll leave you to yourfortune and be gone

2231
02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:20.330
To keep them back thatcome to succor you:

2232
02:34:20.330 --> 02:34:22.770
Why shall we fight, if youpretend no title?

2233
02:34:22.770 --> 02:34:24.300
(group) Ay!

2234
02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:26.500
Why, brother, whereforestand you on nice points?

2235
02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:29.070
Resolve yourself and let usclaim the crown.

2236
02:34:29.070 --> 02:34:31.370
When we grow stronger,then we'll make our claim:

2237
02:34:31.370 --> 02:34:34.130
Till then, 'tis wisdom toconceal our meaning.

2238
02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:36.600
Away with scrupulous wit!now arms must rule.

2239
02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:39.670
And fearless minds climbsoonest unto crowns.

2240
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:41.730
Brother, we will proclaimyou out of hand:

2241
02:34:41.730 --> 02:34:45.700
The brut thereof willbring you many friends.

2242
02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:51.900
Then be it as you will;for 'tis my right,

2243
02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:54.570
And Henry but usurps thediadem.

2244
02:34:54.570 --> 02:34:58.230
Ay, now my sovereignspeaketh like himself;

2245
02:34:58.230 --> 02:35:00.370
And now will I be Edward'schampion.

2246
02:35:00.370 --> 02:35:03.330
Sound trumpet; Edwardshall be here proclaim'd:

2247
02:35:03.330 --> 02:35:05.930
Come, master-mayor, makethou proclamation.

2248
02:35:05.930 --> 02:35:10.170
(trumpet sounds, crowd cheers)

2249
02:35:22.500 --> 02:35:27.700
Edward the Fourth, by thegrace of God, king of

2250
02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:33.470
England and France, andlord of Ireland.

2251
02:35:33.470 --> 02:35:40.030
True and just heir, Duke ofYork, Earl of March and Ulster

2252
02:35:40.030 --> 02:35:43.170
And whosoe'er gainsaysKing Edward's right,

2253
02:35:43.170 --> 02:35:45.970
By this I challenge him tosingle fight.

2254
02:35:45.970 --> 02:35:49.170
(trumpet sounds. crowd cheers)

2255
02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:55.200
Long live Edward theFourth!

2256
02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:00.070
Thanks, brave Montgomery;and thanks unto you all:

2257
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:03.900
If fortune serve me, I'llrequite this kindness.

2258
02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:07.230
Now, for this night, let'sharbour here in York;

2259
02:36:07.230 --> 02:36:10.570
And when the morning sunshall raise his car

2260
02:36:10.570 --> 02:36:12.600
Above the border of thishorizon,

2261
02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:16.800
We'll forward towardsWarwick and his mates;

2262
02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:20.000
For well I wot that Henryis no soldier.

2263
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.000
Come on, brave soldiers:doubt not of the day,

2264
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:27.170
And, that once gotten,doubt not of large pay.

2265
02:36:31.530 --> 02:36:34.870
(bells ring)

2266
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:37.800
What counsel, lords?

2267
02:36:37.800 --> 02:36:39.900
For Edward now dothmarch amain to London;

2268
02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:42.870
And many giddy peopleflock to him.

2269
02:36:42.870 --> 02:36:45.600
Let's levy men, and beathim back again.

2270
02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:47.170
A little fire is quicklytrodden out;

2271
02:36:47.170 --> 02:36:49.430
Which, being suffer'd,rivers cannot quench.

2272
02:36:49.430 --> 02:36:52.330
In Warwickshire I havetrue-hearted friends,

2273
02:36:52.330 --> 02:36:54.930
Those will I muster up:and thou, son Clarence,

2274
02:36:54.930 --> 02:36:57.270
Shalt stir up in Suffolk,Norfolk, and in Kent,

2275
02:36:57.270 --> 02:36:59.070
The knights and gentlemento come with thee:

2276
02:36:59.070 --> 02:37:01.170
Thou, brother Montague, inBuckingham,

2277
02:37:01.170 --> 02:37:02.770
Northampton and inLeicestershire, shalt find

2278
02:37:02.770 --> 02:37:04.970
Men well inclined to hearwhat thou command'st:

2279
02:37:04.970 --> 02:37:06.870
And thou, brave Oxford,wondrous well beloved,

2280
02:37:06.870 --> 02:37:09.230
In Oxfordshire shaltmuster up thy friends.

2281
02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:15.070
My sovereign, with theloving citizens,

2282
02:37:15.070 --> 02:37:17.170
Like to his island girt inwith the ocean,

2283
02:37:17.170 --> 02:37:19.530
Or modest Dian circledwith her nymphs,

2284
02:37:19.530 --> 02:37:22.400
Shall rest in London tillwe come to him.

2285
02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:25.200
Fair lords, take leave andstand not to reply.

2286
02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:26.300
Farewell, my sovereign.

2287
02:37:26.300 --> 02:37:29.070
Farewell, my Hector, andmy Troy's true hope.

2288
02:37:29.300 --> 02:37:31.730
In sign of truth, I kissyour highness' hand.

2289
02:37:31.730 --> 02:37:34.070
Well-minded Clarence, bethou fortunate!

2290
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:36.970
Comfort, my lord; and so Itake my leave.

2291
02:37:36.970 --> 02:37:39.670
And thus I seal my truth,and bid adieu.

2292
02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:42.770
Sweet Oxford, and myloving Montague,

2293
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:46.730
And all at once, once morea happy farewell.

2294
02:37:46.730 --> 02:37:49.000
Farewell, sweet lords:let's meet at Coventry.

2295
02:38:00.530 --> 02:38:03.870
Here at the palace I willrest awhile.

2296
02:38:03.870 --> 02:38:06.900
Cousin of Exeter, whatthinks your lordship?

2297
02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:10.870
Methinks the power thatEdward hath in field

2298
02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:12.200
Should not be able toencounter mine.

2299
02:38:13.700 --> 02:38:18.070
The doubt is that he willseduce the rest.

2300
02:38:18.070 --> 02:38:21.930
That's not my fear; mymeed hath got me fame:

2301
02:38:21.930 --> 02:38:24.530
I have not stopp'd mineears to their demands,

2302
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:29.770
Nor posted off their suitswith slow delays;

2303
02:38:29.770 --> 02:38:32.870
My pity hath been balm toheal their wounds,

2304
02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:36.830
My mildness hath allay'dtheir swelling griefs,

2305
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:42.230
My mercy dried theirwater-flowing tears;

2306
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:43.800
I have not been desirousof their wealth,

2307
02:38:43.800 --> 02:38:47.630
Nor much oppress'd themwith great subsidies.

2308
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:52.670
Nor forward of revenge,though they much err'd:

2309
02:38:52.670 --> 02:38:56.900
Then why should they loveEdward more than me?

2310
02:38:56.900 --> 02:39:00.230
No, Exeter, these graceschallenge grace:

2311
02:39:00.230 --> 02:39:02.200
And when the lion fawnsupon the lamb,

2312
02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:04.800
The lamb will never ceaseto follow him.

2313
02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:08.330
Hark, hark, my lord! whatshouts are these?

2314
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:11.670
Seize on the shame-facedHenry, bear him hence;

2315
02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:14.930
And once again proclaim usKing of England.

2316
02:39:21.330 --> 02:39:24.970
You are the fount thatmakes small brooks to flow:

2317
02:39:24.970 --> 02:39:29.070
Now stops thy spring; mysea shall suck them dry,

2318
02:39:29.070 --> 02:39:34.330
And swell so much thehigher by their ebb.

2319
02:39:34.330 --> 02:39:40.670
Hence with him to theTower; let him not speak.

2320
02:39:43.570 --> 02:39:46.200
And, lords, towardsCoventry bend we our course

2321
02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:48.570
Where peremptory Warwicknow remains:

2322
02:39:48.570 --> 02:39:51.100
The sun shines hot; and,if we use delay,

2323
02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:53.870
Cold biting winter marsour hoped-for hay.

2324
02:39:54.370 --> 02:40:01.130
(♪drums and trumpets)

2325
02:40:04.270 --> 02:40:08.430
Where is the post thatcame from valiant Oxford?

2326
02:40:08.900 --> 02:40:10.670
How far hence is thy lord,mine honest fellow?

2327
02:40:10.670 --> 02:40:12.370
By this at Dunsmore,marching hitherward.

2328
02:40:12.370 --> 02:40:15.330
Where is the post thatcame from Montague?

2329
02:40:15.330 --> 02:40:17.570
How far off is our brotherMontague?

2330
02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:20.800
By this at Daintry, with apuissant troop.

2331
02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:22.870
And, by thy guess, hownigh is Clarence now?

2332
02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:25.630
At Southam I did leave himwith his forces,

2333
02:40:25.630 --> 02:40:28.600
And do expect him heresome two hours hence.

2334
02:40:29.370 --> 02:40:31.500
Then Clarence is at hand,I hear his drum.

2335
02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:34.230
It is not his, my lord;here Southam lies:

2336
02:40:34.230 --> 02:40:37.300
The drum your honour hearsmarcheth from Warwick.

2337
02:40:37.300 --> 02:40:40.700
Who should that be? belike,unlook'd-for friends.

2338
02:40:40.700 --> 02:40:43.470
They are at hand, and youshall quickly know.

2339
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:50.430
O unbid spite! is sportfulEdward come?

2340
02:40:50.430 --> 02:40:53.330
Where slept our scouts, orhow are they seduced,

2341
02:40:53.330 --> 02:40:54.730
That we could hear no newsof his repair?

2342
02:40:54.730 --> 02:40:58.270
Now, Warwick, wilt thouope the city gates,

2343
02:40:58.270 --> 02:41:01.900
Speak gentle words andhumbly bend thy knee,

2344
02:41:01.900 --> 02:41:05.270
Call Edward king and athis hands beg mercy?

2345
02:41:05.270 --> 02:41:08.170
And he shall pardon theethese outrages.

2346
02:41:08.170 --> 02:41:12.230
Nay, rather, wilt thoudraw thy forces hence,

2347
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:15.600
Confess who set thee upand pluck'd thee down,

2348
02:41:15.600 --> 02:41:20.100
Call Warwick patron and bepenitent?

2349
02:41:20.100 --> 02:41:24.230
And thou shalt stillremain the Duke of York.

2350
02:41:24.230 --> 02:41:27.030
I thought, at least, hewould have said the king;

2351
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:29.570
Or did he make the jestagainst his will?

2352
02:41:29.570 --> 02:41:32.100
Is not a dukedom, sir, agoodly gift?

2353
02:41:32.100 --> 02:41:34.700
Ay, by my faith, for apoor earl to give:

2354
02:41:34.700 --> 02:41:37.500
I'll do thee service forso good a gift.

2355
02:41:37.500 --> 02:41:40.870
'Twas I that gave thekingdom to thy brother.

2356
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:43.730
Why then 'tis mine, if butby Warwick's gift.

2357
02:41:43.730 --> 02:41:47.170
Thou art no Atlas for sogreat a weight:

2358
02:41:47.170 --> 02:41:51.930
And weakling, Warwicktakes his gift again;

2359
02:41:51.930 --> 02:41:57.100
And Henry is my king,Warwick his subject.

2360
02:41:57.100 --> 02:42:01.970
But Warwick's king isEdward's prisoner:

2361
02:42:01.970 --> 02:42:05.130
And, gallant Warwick, dobut answer this:

2362
02:42:05.130 --> 02:42:07.600
What is the body when thehead is off?

2363
02:42:07.600 --> 02:42:10.630
Alas, that Warwick had nomore forecast,

2364
02:42:10.630 --> 02:42:13.200
But, whiles he thought tosteal the single ten,

2365
02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:16.970
The king was slilyfinger'd from the deck!

2366
02:42:16.970 --> 02:42:19.070
You left King Henry at theBishop's palace,

2367
02:42:19.070 --> 02:42:21.370
And, ten to one, you'llmeet him in the Tower.

2368
02:42:21.370 --> 02:42:25.800
'Tis even so; yet you areWarwick still.

2369
02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:31.100
Come, Warwick, take the time;kneel down, kneel down:

2370
02:42:32.670 --> 02:42:36.330
Nay, when? strike now, orelse the iron cools.

2371
02:42:36.330 --> 02:42:39.670
I had rather chop thishand off at a blow,

2372
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:42.470
And with the other flingit at thy face,

2373
02:42:42.470 --> 02:42:45.470
Than bear so low a sail,to strike to thee.

2374
02:42:45.470 --> 02:42:50.270
Sail how thou canst, havewind and tide thy friend,

2375
02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:54.130
This hand, fast woundabout thy coal-black hair

2376
02:42:54.130 --> 02:42:57.330
Shall, whiles thy head iswarm and new cut off,

2377
02:42:57.330 --> 02:43:01.100
Write in the dust thissentence with thy blood,

2378
02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:06.100
'Wind-changing Warwick nowcan change no more.'

2379
02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:10.000
O cheerful colours! seewhere Oxford comes!

2380
02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.500
Oxford, Oxford, forLancaster!

2381
02:43:17.500 --> 02:43:19.130
The gates are open, let usenter too.

2382
02:43:19.130 --> 02:43:20.730
So other foes may set uponour backs.

2383
02:43:20.730 --> 02:43:22.400
Stand we in good array;for they no doubt

2384
02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:24.330
Will issue out again andbid us battle:

2385
02:43:24.330 --> 02:43:25.800
If not, the city being butof small defence,

2386
02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:28.170
We'll quickly rouse thetraitors in the same.

2387
02:43:28.170 --> 02:43:31.100
O, welcome, Oxford! for wewant thy help.

2388
02:43:31.100 --> 02:43:36.700
Montague, Montague, forLancaster!

2389
02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:39.070
Thou and thy brother bothshall buy this treason

2390
02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:42.200
Even with the dearestblood your bodies bear.

2391
02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:44.730
The harder match'd, thegreater victory:

2392
02:43:44.730 --> 02:43:48.330
My mind presageth happygain and conquest.

2393
02:43:48.970 --> 02:43:51.800
Somerset, Somerset, forLancaster!

2394
02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:54.000
Two of thy name, bothDukes of Somerset,

2395
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.530
Have sold their lives untothe house of York;

2396
02:43:56.530 --> 02:43:58.930
And thou shalt be thethird if this sword hold.

2397
02:43:58.930 --> 02:44:02.200
And lo, where George ofClarence sweeps along,

2398
02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:05.200
Of force enough to bid hisbrother battle;

2399
02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:08.000
With whom an upright zealto right prevails

2400
02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.400
More than the nature of abrother's love!

2401
02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:14.000
Clarence. Clarence forLancaster.

2402
02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:18.400
et tu Brute. Wilt thou stabCaesar to?

2403
02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:20.970
A parley sent to George ofClarence.

2404
02:44:20.970 --> 02:44:24.930
(horn sounds)

2405
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:46.500
Come, Clarence, come; thouwilt, if Warwick call.

2406
02:44:51.600 --> 02:44:57.200
Father of Warwick, knowyou what this means?

2407
02:44:57.200 --> 02:45:01.000
Look here, I throw myinfamy at thee

2408
02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:02.900
I will not ruinate myfather's house,

2409
02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:04.870
Who gave his blood to linethe stones together,

2410
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:08.600
And set up Lancaster. Why,trow'st thou, Warwick,

2411
02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:11.300
That Clarence is so harsh,so blunt, unnatural,

2412
02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:13.370
To bend the fatalinstruments of war

2413
02:45:13.370 --> 02:45:16.230
Against his brother andhis lawful king?

2414
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:19.130
Perhaps thou wilt objectmy holy oath:

2415
02:45:19.130 --> 02:45:21.000
To keep that oath weremore impiety

2416
02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:24.730
Than Jephthah's, when hesacrificed his daughter.

2417
02:45:24.730 --> 02:45:26.970
I am so sorry for mytrespass made

2418
02:45:26.970 --> 02:45:28.930
That, to deserve well atmy brother's hands,

2419
02:45:28.930 --> 02:45:31.630
I here proclaim myself thymortal foe,

2420
02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:33.930
With resolution,wheresoe'er I meet thee--

2421
02:45:33.930 --> 02:45:37.400
As I will meet thee, ifthou stir abroad--

2422
02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:41.000
To plague thee for thyfoul misleading me.

2423
02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:45.600
And so, proud-heartedWarwick, I defy thee,

2424
02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:48.700
And to my brother turn myblushing cheeks.

2425
02:45:55.570 --> 02:46:00.830
Pardon me, Edward, I willmake amends:

2426
02:46:00.830 --> 02:46:04.770
And, Richard, do not frownupon my faults,

2427
02:46:04.770 --> 02:46:09.370
For I will henceforth beno more unconstant.

2428
02:46:09.370 --> 02:46:14.430
Now welcome more, and tentimes more beloved,

2429
02:46:14.430 --> 02:46:19.970
Than if thou never hadstdeserved our hate.

2430
02:46:19.970 --> 02:46:24.270
Welcome, good Clarence;this is brotherlike.

2431
02:46:24.270 --> 02:46:30.800
O passing traitor,perjured and unjust!

2432
02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:35.630
What, Warwick, wilt thouleave the town and fight?

2433
02:46:35.630 --> 02:46:37.930
Or shall we beat thestones about thine ears?

2434
02:46:37.930 --> 02:46:38.170


2435
02:46:39.600 --> 02:46:44.000
Alas, I am not coop'd herefor defence!

2436
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.800
I will away towards Barnetpresently,

2437
02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:49.970
And bid thee battle,Edward, if thou darest.

2438
02:46:49.970 --> 02:46:55.770
Yes, Warwick, Edwarddares, and leads the way.

2439
02:46:57.370 --> 02:47:04.300
Lords, to the field; SaintGeorge and victory!

2440
02:47:04.300 --> 02:47:11.330
(♪drums horns)

2441
02:49:06.430 --> 02:49:16.500
So, lie thou there: diethou, and die our fear;

2442
02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:20.070
For Warwick was a bug thatfear'd us all.

2443
02:49:22.500 --> 02:49:27.370
Now, Montague, sit fast; Iseek for thee,

2444
02:49:28.730 --> 02:49:33.000
That Warwick's bones maykeep thine company.

2445
02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:55.070
Ah, who is nigh? come tome, friend or foe,

2446
02:49:56.100 --> 02:50:06.100
And tell me who is victor,York or Warwick?

2447
02:50:10.530 --> 02:50:18.000
Why ask I that? my mangledbody shows,

2448
02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:26.100
My blood, my want of strength,my sick heart shows.

2449
02:50:26.100 --> 02:50:31.700
That I must yield my bodyto the earth

2450
02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:39.300
And, by my fall, theconquest to my foe.

2451
02:50:39.300 --> 02:50:46.600
Thus yields the cedar tothe axe's edge,

2452
02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:51.770
Whose arms gave shelter tothe princely eagle,

2453
02:50:51.770 --> 02:50:57.430
Under whose shade theramping lion slept,

2454
02:50:57.430 --> 02:51:02.000
Whose top-branch overpeer'dJove's spreading tree

2455
02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:10.430
And kept low shrubs fromwinter's powerful wind.

2456
02:51:10.430 --> 02:51:15.900
These eyes, that now are dimm'dwith death's black veil,

2457
02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:19.870
Have been as piercing asthe mid-day sun,

2458
02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:25.100
To search the secrettreasons of the world:

2459
02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:30.330
The wrinkles in my brows,now filled with blood,

2460
02:51:30.330 --> 02:51:34.370
Were liken'd oft to kinglysepulchres;

2461
02:51:34.370 --> 02:51:38.670
For who lived king, but Icould dig his grave?

2462
02:51:38.670 --> 02:51:43.500
And who durst smile whenWarwick bent his brow?

2463
02:51:47.300 --> 02:51:57.900
Lo, now my glory smear'din dust and blood!

2464
02:51:57.900 --> 02:52:04.770
My parks, my walks, mymanors that I had.

2465
02:52:04.770 --> 02:52:12.130
Even now forsake me, andof all my lands

2466
02:52:12.130 --> 02:52:15.470
Is nothing left me but mybody's length.

2467
02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:32.800
Why, what is pomp, rule,reign, but earth and dust?

2468
02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:41.430
And, live we how we can,yet die we must.

2469
02:52:47.470 --> 02:52:52.500
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wertthou as we are.

2470
02:52:52.500 --> 02:52:55.400
We might recover all ourloss again;

2471
02:52:55.400 --> 02:52:58.700
The queen from France hathbrought a puissant power:

2472
02:52:58.700 --> 02:53:03.030
Even now we heard the news:ah, could'st thou fly!

2473
02:53:03.030 --> 02:53:12.330
Why, then I would not fly.Ah, Montague,

2474
02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:18.300
If thou be there, sweetbrother, take my hand.

2475
02:53:18.300 --> 02:53:24.000
And with thy lips keep inmy soul awhile!

2476
02:53:26.330 --> 02:53:31.470
Thou lovest me not; for,brother, if thou didst,

2477
02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:36.100
Thy tears would wash thiscold congealed blood

2478
02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:42.770
That glues my lips andwill not let me speak.

2479
02:53:42.770 --> 02:53:46.400
Come quickly, Montague, orI am dead.

2480
02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:51.330
Ah, Warwick! Montague hathbreathed his last;

2481
02:53:51.330 --> 02:53:54.970
And to the latest gaspcried out for Warwick,

2482
02:53:54.970 --> 02:53:59.300
And said 'Commend me to myvaliant brother.'

2483
02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:02.100
And more he would havesaid, and more he spoke,

2484
02:54:02.100 --> 02:54:03.800
Which sounded like acanon in a vault,

2485
02:54:03.800 --> 02:54:07.770
That might not bedistinguished; but at last

2486
02:54:07.770 --> 02:54:10.900
I well might hear,delivered with a groan,

2487
02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:14.600
'O, farewell, Warwick!'

2488
02:54:16.170 --> 02:54:24.370
Sweet rest his soul! Fly,lords, and save yourselves;

2489
02:54:24.370 --> 02:54:30.300
For Warwick bids you allfarewell to meet in heaven.

2490
02:55:11.430 --> 02:55:23.930
Away, away, to meet thequeen's great power!

2491
02:55:24.800 --> 02:55:26.270


2492
02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:31.100
(♪horns and cheers)

2493
02:55:38.970 --> 02:55:41.600
Thus far our fortune keepsan upward course,

2494
02:55:41.600 --> 02:55:44.570
And we are graced withwreaths of victory.

2495
02:55:45.770 --> 02:55:50.930
But, in the midst of thisbright-shining day,

2496
02:55:50.930 --> 02:55:53.830
I spy a black, suspicious,threatening cloud,

2497
02:55:53.830 --> 02:55:57.000
That will encounter withour glorious sun,

2498
02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.300
Ere he attain his easefulwestern bed:

2499
02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:03.130
I mean, my lords, thosepowers that the queen

2500
02:56:03.130 --> 02:56:06.370
Hath raised in Gallia havearrived our coast

2501
02:56:06.370 --> 02:56:09.100
And, as we hear, march onto fight with us.

2502
02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:11.970
A little gale will soondisperse that cloud

2503
02:56:11.970 --> 02:56:15.100
And blow it to the sourcefrom whence it came:

2504
02:56:15.100 --> 02:56:18.630
Thy very beams will drythose vapours up,

2505
02:56:18.630 --> 02:56:21.230
For every cloud engendersnot a storm.

2506
02:56:21.230 --> 02:56:26.170
The queen is valued thirtythousand strong,

2507
02:56:26.170 --> 02:56:28.930
And Somerset, with Oxfordfled to her:

2508
02:56:28.930 --> 02:56:30.430
If she have time tobreathe be well assured

2509
02:56:30.430 --> 02:56:34.170
Her faction will be fullas strong as ours.

2510
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:37.830
We are advertised by ourloving friends

2511
02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:40.830
That they do hold theircourse toward Tewksbury:

2512
02:56:40.830 --> 02:56:42.600
We, having now the best atBarnet field,

2513
02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:47.330
Will thither straight, forwillingness rids way;

2514
02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:49.330
And, as we march, ourstrength will be augmented

2515
02:56:49.330 --> 02:56:52.630
In every county as we goalong.

2516
02:56:52.630 --> 02:56:56.700
Strike up the drum; cry'Courage!' and away.

2517
02:56:57.030 --> 02:57:01.430
(drums sounds) Courage!

2518
02:58:36.500 --> 02:58:44.770
Great lords, wise men ne'ersit and wail their loss,

2519
02:58:44.770 --> 02:58:50.370
But cheerly seek how toredress their harms.

2520
02:58:50.370 --> 02:58:53.930
What though the mast benow blown overboard,

2521
02:58:53.930 --> 02:58:56.500
The cable broke, theholding-anchor lost,

2522
02:58:56.500 --> 02:59:00.900
And half our sailorsswallow'd in the flood?

2523
02:59:00.900 --> 02:59:05.900
Yet lives our pilot still.Is't meet that he

2524
02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:09.170
Should leave the helm andlike a fearful lad

2525
02:59:09.170 --> 02:59:12.870
With tearful eyes addwater to the sea

2526
02:59:12.870 --> 02:59:17.830
And give more strength tothat which hath too much,

2527
02:59:17.830 --> 02:59:21.400
Whiles, in his moan, theship splits on the rocks,

2528
02:59:21.400 --> 02:59:26.400
Which industry and couragemight have saved?

2529
02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:33.970
Ah, what a shame! ah, whata fault were this!

2530
02:59:37.470 --> 02:59:43.370
Say Warwick was ouranchor; what of that?

2531
02:59:44.030 --> 02:59:50.800
And Montague our topmost;what of him?

2532
02:59:50.800 --> 02:59:55.600
Our slaughter'd friends thetackles; what of these?

2533
02:59:55.600 --> 03:00:00.470
Why, is not Oxford hereanother anchor?

2534
03:00:00.470 --> 03:00:05.100
And Somerset anothergoodly mast?

2535
03:00:05.100 --> 03:00:08.100
The friends of France ourshrouds and tacklings?

2536
03:00:08.100 --> 03:00:13.670
And, though unskilful, whynot Ned and I

2537
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:18.530
For once allow'd theskilful pilot's charge?

2538
03:00:18.530 --> 03:00:20.870
We will not from the helmto sit and weep,

2539
03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:28.070
But keep our course, thoughthe rough wind say no,

2540
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:32.670
From shelves and rocks thatthreaten us with wreck.

2541
03:00:32.670 --> 03:00:38.400
As good to chide the wavesas speak them fair.

2542
03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:45.870
And what is Edward butruthless sea?

2543
03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:52.200
What Clarence but aquicksand of deceit?

2544
03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:58.570
And Richard but a raggedfatal rock?

2545
03:00:58.570 --> 03:01:07.870
All these the enemies toour poor bark.

2546
03:01:07.870 --> 03:01:14.470
Say you can swim; alas,'tis but a while!

2547
03:01:14.470 --> 03:01:20.230
Tread on the sand; why,there you quickly sink:

2548
03:01:20.230 --> 03:01:25.200
Bestride the rock; thetide will wash you off,

2549
03:01:25.200 --> 03:01:35.870
Or else you famish; that'sa threefold death.

2550
03:01:35.870 --> 03:01:42.030
This speak I, lords, tolet you understand,

2551
03:01:42.030 --> 03:01:46.600
If case some one of youwould fly from us,

2552
03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:51.370
That there's no hoped-formercy with the brothers

2553
03:01:51.370 --> 03:02:01.930
More than with ruthlesswaves, with sands and rocks.

2554
03:02:01.930 --> 03:02:10.730
Why, courage then! whatcannot be avoided

2555
03:02:10.730 --> 03:02:19.130
'Twere childish weaknessto lament or fear.

2556
03:02:19.130 --> 03:02:22.500
Methinks a woman of thisvaliant spirit

2557
03:02:22.500 --> 03:02:25.870
Should, if a coward heardher speak these words,

2558
03:02:25.870 --> 03:02:29.830
Infuse his breast withmagnanimity

2559
03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:35.300
And make him, naked, foila man at arms.

2560
03:02:35.300 --> 03:02:40.900
I speak not this asdoubting any here

2561
03:02:40.900 --> 03:02:42.670
For did I but suspect afearful man

2562
03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:45.800
He should have leave to goaway betimes,

2563
03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:48.270
Lest in our need he mightinfect another

2564
03:02:48.270 --> 03:02:54.130
And make him of likespirit to himself.

2565
03:02:54.130 --> 03:02:58.930
If any such be here--asGod forbid!--

2566
03:02:58.930 --> 03:03:03.400
Let him depart before weneed his help.

2567
03:03:06.800 --> 03:03:08.930
Women and children of sohigh a courage,

2568
03:03:08.930 --> 03:03:16.500
And warriors faint! why,'twere perpetual shame.

2569
03:03:16.500 --> 03:03:19.700
O brave young prince! thyfamous grandfather

2570
03:03:19.700 --> 03:03:23.100
Doth live again in thee:long mayst thou live

2571
03:03:23.100 --> 03:03:26.370
To bear his image andrenew his glories!

2572
03:03:26.370 --> 03:03:29.270
And he that will not fightfor such a hope.

2573
03:03:29.270 --> 03:03:33.300
Go home to bed, and likethe owl by day,

2574
03:03:33.300 --> 03:03:37.930
If he arise, be mock'd andwonder'd at.

2575
03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:42.030
Thanks, gentle Somerset;sweet Oxford, thanks.

2576
03:03:42.030 --> 03:03:44.830
And take his thanks thatyet hath nothing else.

2577
03:03:44.830 --> 03:03:46.800
Prepare you, lords, forEdward is at hand.

2578
03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:50.300
Ready to fight; thereforebe resolute.

2579
03:03:50.300 --> 03:03:51.270
I thought no less: it ishis policy

2580
03:03:51.270 --> 03:03:52.800
To haste thus fast, tofind us unprovided.

2581
03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:56.300
But he's deceived; we arein readiness.

2582
03:03:56.300 --> 03:03:57.770
(crowd) Ay!

2583
03:03:57.770 --> 03:04:01.030
This cheers my heart, tosee your forwardness.

2584
03:04:01.030 --> 03:04:05.300
Here pitch our battle;hence we will not budge.

2585
03:04:05.670 --> 03:04:14.030
(♪trumpet, battle cries)

2586
03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:16.100
(Edward yells fromoutside the walls)

2587
03:04:16.100 --> 03:04:21.600
Brave followers, yonderstands the thorny wood,

2588
03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:26.330
Which, by the heavens'assistance and your strength,

2589
03:04:26.330 --> 03:04:30.270
Must by the roots be hewnup yet ere night.

2590
03:04:31.270 --> 03:04:34.470
I need not add more fuelto your fire,

2591
03:04:34.470 --> 03:04:40.070
For well I wot ye blaze toburn them out

2592
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:45.430
Give signal to the fight,and to it, lords!

2593
03:04:49.500 --> 03:04:57.870
Lords, knights, andgentlemen, what I should say

2594
03:04:57.870 --> 03:05:03.900
My tears gainsay; forevery word I speak,

2595
03:05:03.900 --> 03:05:07.970
Ye see, I drink the waterof my eye.

2596
03:05:07.970 --> 03:05:11.970
Therefore, no more but this:Henry, your sovereign,

2597
03:05:11.970 --> 03:05:16.100
Is prisoner to the foe;his state usurp'd,

2598
03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:20.200
His realm a slaughter-house,his subjects slain,

2599
03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:23.900
His statutes cancell'd andhis treasure spent;

2600
03:05:23.900 --> 03:05:29.630
And yonder stands the wolfthat makes this spoil.

2601
03:05:29.630 --> 03:05:36.200
You fight in justice lords:then, in God's name, lords,

2602
03:05:36.200 --> 03:05:41.400
Be valiant and give signalto the fight.

2603
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:13.130
Now here a period oftumultuous broils.

2604
03:08:15.300 --> 03:08:18.230
Away with Oxford to HamesCastle straight:

2605
03:08:18.230 --> 03:08:21.600
For Somerset, off with hisguilty head.

2606
03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:23.830
Go, bear them hence; Iwill not hear them speak.

2607
03:08:23.830 --> 03:08:26.100
For my part, I'll nottrouble thee with words.

2608
03:08:26.100 --> 03:08:31.770
Nor I, but stoop withpatience to my fortune.

2609
03:08:32.700 --> 03:08:35.830
So part we sadly in thistroublous world,

2610
03:08:35.830 --> 03:08:38.830
To meet with joy in sweetJerusalem.

2611
03:08:43.500 --> 03:08:45.670
Is proclamation made, thatwho finds Edward

2612
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:47.970
Shall have a high reward,and he his life?

2613
03:08:47.970 --> 03:08:53.030
It is: and lo, whereyouthful Edward comes!

2614
03:08:55.330 --> 03:08:58.130
Bring forth the gallant,let us hear him speak.

2615
03:09:03.370 --> 03:09:06.230
What! can so young a thornbegin to prick?

2616
03:09:13.870 --> 03:09:18.030
Edward, what satisfactioncanst thou make

2617
03:09:18.030 --> 03:09:24.530
For bearing arms, forstirring up my subjects,

2618
03:09:24.530 --> 03:09:28.770
And all the trouble thouhast turn'd me to?

2619
03:09:32.330 --> 03:09:36.570
Speak like a subject,proud ambitious York!

2620
03:09:36.570 --> 03:09:39.370
Suppose that I am now myfather's mouth;

2621
03:09:39.370 --> 03:09:43.600
Resign thy chair, andwhere I stand kneel thou,

2622
03:09:43.600 --> 03:09:46.230
Whilst I propose theselfsame words to thee,

2623
03:09:46.230 --> 03:09:49.470
Which traitor, thouwouldst have me answer to.

2624
03:09:49.470 --> 03:09:52.500
Ah, that thy father hadbeen so resolved!

2625
03:09:52.500 --> 03:09:53.900
That you might still haveworn the petticoat,

2626
03:09:53.900 --> 03:09:56.070
And ne'er have stol'n thebreech from Lancaster.

2627
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:57.830
Let AEsop fable in awinter's night;

2628
03:09:57.830 --> 03:10:00.300
His currish riddles sortnot with this place.

2629
03:10:00.300 --> 03:10:02.530
By heaven, brat, I'llplague ye for that word.

2630
03:10:02.530 --> 03:10:04.900
Ay, thou wast born to be aplague to men.

2631
03:10:04.900 --> 03:10:06.830
For God's sake, take awaythis captive scold.

2632
03:10:06.830 --> 03:10:09.100
Nay, take away thisscolding crookback rather.

2633
03:10:09.100 --> 03:10:11.070
Peace, wilful boy, or Iwill charm your tongue.

2634
03:10:11.070 --> 03:10:13.600
Untutor'd lad, thou arttoo malapert.

2635
03:10:13.600 --> 03:10:16.400
I know my duty; you areall undutiful:

2636
03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:21.300
Lascivious Edward, andthou perjured George,

2637
03:10:21.300 --> 03:10:25.570
And thou mis-shapen Dick,I tell ye all

2638
03:10:25.570 --> 03:10:27.900
I am your better, traitorsas ye are:

2639
03:10:27.900 --> 03:10:31.170
And thou usurp'st myfather's right and mine.

2640
03:10:31.170 --> 03:10:36.370
Take that, thou likenessof this railer here.

2641
03:10:36.370 --> 03:10:38.730
Sprawl'st thou? take that,to end thy agony.

2642
03:10:38.730 --> 03:10:42.400
And there's for twittingme with perjury.

2643
03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:44.230
O, kill me too!

2644
03:10:44.230 --> 03:10:45.230
Marry, and shall.

2645
03:10:45.230 --> 03:10:46.830
Hold, Richard, hold; forwe have done too much.

2646
03:10:46.830 --> 03:10:48.930
Why should she live, tofill the world with words?

2647
03:10:48.930 --> 03:10:51.400
What, doth she swoon? usemeans for her recovery.

2648
03:10:51.400 --> 03:10:54.630
Clarence, excuse me to theking my brother;

2649
03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:56.570
I'll hence to London on aserious matter:

2650
03:10:56.570 --> 03:10:58.370
Ere ye come there, be sureto hear some news.

2651
03:10:58.370 --> 03:11:00.500
What? what?

2652
03:11:00.500 --> 03:11:06.500
The Tower, the Tower. I'll rootthem out.

2653
03:11:09.730 --> 03:11:20.230
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak tothy mother, boy!

2654
03:11:22.530 --> 03:11:34.170
Canst thou not speak? Otraitors! murderers!

2655
03:11:35.730 --> 03:11:45.230
They that stabb'd Caesarshed no blood at all,

2656
03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:49.470
Did not offend, nor werenot worthy blame,

2657
03:11:49.470 --> 03:11:55.630
If this foul deed were byto equal it:

2658
03:11:56.470 --> 03:12:02.130
He was a man; this, inrespect, a child:

2659
03:12:03.700 --> 03:12:08.200
And men ne'er spend theirfury on a child.

2660
03:12:10.670 --> 03:12:15.030
What's worse than murderer,that I may name it?

2661
03:12:17.270 --> 03:12:25.670
No, no, my heart willburst, and if I speak:

2662
03:12:25.670 --> 03:12:32.770
And I will speak, that somy heart may burst.

2663
03:12:37.370 --> 03:12:44.200
Butchers and villains!bloody cannibals!

2664
03:12:46.230 --> 03:12:52.870
How sweet a plant have youuntimely cropp'd!

2665
03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:56.330
You have no children,butchers! if you had,

2666
03:12:56.330 --> 03:13:00.930
The thought of them wouldhave stirr'd up remorse:

2667
03:13:00.930 --> 03:13:05.370
But if you ever chance tohave a child,

2668
03:13:05.370 --> 03:13:07.570
Look in his youth to havehim so cut off

2669
03:13:07.570 --> 03:13:11.900
As, deathmen, you have ridthis sweet young prince!

2670
03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:13.470
Away with her; go, bearher hence perforce.

2671
03:13:13.470 --> 03:13:24.100
Nay, never bear me hence,dispatch me here,

2672
03:13:24.100 --> 03:13:28.130
Here sheathe thy sword,I'll pardon thee my death:

2673
03:13:28.130 --> 03:13:33.430
What, wilt thou not? then,Clarence, do it thou.

2674
03:13:33.730 --> 03:13:35.900
By heaven, I will not dothee so much ease.

2675
03:13:35.900 --> 03:13:38.600
Good Clarence, do; sweetClarence, do thou do it.

2676
03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:40.200
Didst thou not hear meswear I would not do it?

2677
03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:43.330
Ay, but thou usest toforswear thyself:

2678
03:13:43.330 --> 03:13:47.400
'Twas sin before, but now'tis charity.

2679
03:13:48.900 --> 03:13:58.830
What, wilt thou not? Where isthat devil's butcher? Richard.

2680
03:13:58.830 --> 03:14:05.300
Hard-favour'd Richard?Where art thou?

2681
03:14:05.300 --> 03:14:14.830
Thou art not here: murderis thy alms-deed;

2682
03:14:14.830 --> 03:14:18.630
Petitioners for blood thoune'er put'st back.

2683
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:21.000
Away, I say; I charge ye,bear her hence.

2684
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:32.030
So come to you and yours,as to this Prince!

2685
03:14:49.770 --> 03:14:51.600
Where's Richard gone?

2686
03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:54.070
To London, all in post;and, as I guess,

2687
03:14:54.070 --> 03:14:56.870
To make a bloody supper inthe Tower.

2688
03:14:59.430 --> 03:15:01.800
He's sudden, if a thingcomes in his head.

2689
03:15:16.270 --> 03:15:18.930
Now march we hence:discharge the common sort

2690
03:15:18.930 --> 03:15:23.300
With pay and thanks, andlet's away to London

2691
03:15:23.300 --> 03:15:26.530
To see our gentle queenhow well she fares:

2692
03:15:27.100 --> 03:15:30.270
By this, I hope, she hatha son for me.

2693
03:16:05.130 --> 03:16:10.570
Good day, my lord. What,at your book so hard?

2694
03:16:11.630 --> 03:16:15.670
Ay, my good lord:--mylord, I should say rather;

2695
03:16:15.670 --> 03:16:20.070
'Tis sin to flatter;'good' was little better:

2696
03:16:20.070 --> 03:16:21.700
'Good Gloucester' and'good devil' were alike,

2697
03:16:21.700 --> 03:16:25.570
And both preposterous;therefore, not 'good lord.'

2698
03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:33.300
Sirrah, leave us toourselves: we must confer.

2699
03:16:38.230 --> 03:16:42.170
So flies the recklessshepherd from the wolf;

2700
03:16:42.170 --> 03:16:45.300
So first the harmless sheepdoth yield his fleece

2701
03:16:45.300 --> 03:16:50.000
And next his throat unto thebutcher's knife.

2702
03:16:50.000 --> 03:17:00.100
What scene of death hathRoscius now to act?

2703
03:17:00.100 --> 03:17:18.830
What scene of death hathRoscius now to act?

2704
03:17:18.830 --> 03:17:23.370
Suspicion always hauntsthe guilty mind;

2705
03:17:23.370 --> 03:17:27.630
The thief doth fear eachbush an officer.

2706
03:17:27.630 --> 03:17:30.570
The bird that hath beenlimed in a bush,

2707
03:17:30.570 --> 03:17:34.230
With trembling wingsmisdoubteth every bush;

2708
03:17:34.230 --> 03:17:36.900
And I, the hapless male toone sweet bird,

2709
03:17:36.900 --> 03:17:38.830
Have now the fatal objectin my eye

2710
03:17:38.830 --> 03:17:43.530
Where my poor young waslimed, was caught and kill'd.

2711
03:17:43.530 --> 03:17:47.330
Why, what a peevish foolwas that of Crete,

2712
03:17:47.330 --> 03:17:50.130
That taught his son theoffice of a fowl!

2713
03:17:50.130 --> 03:17:53.900
An yet, for all his wings,the fool was drown'd.

2714
03:17:55.500 --> 03:18:00.730
I, Daedalus; my poor boy,Icarus;

2715
03:18:00.730 --> 03:18:05.000
Thy father, Minos, thatdenied our course;

2716
03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:08.970
The sun that sear'd thewings of my sweet boy

2717
03:18:08.970 --> 03:18:12.930
Thy brother Edward, andthyself the sea

2718
03:18:12.930 --> 03:18:17.170
Whose envious gulf didswallow up his life.

2719
03:18:17.170 --> 03:18:18.330
Ah, kill me with thyweapon, not with words!

2720
03:18:18.330 --> 03:18:20.000
My breast can better brookthy dagger's point

2721
03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.130
Than can my ears thattragic history.

2722
03:18:25.930 --> 03:18:31.670
But wherefore dost thoucome? is't for my life?

2723
03:18:33.530 --> 03:18:36.000
Think'st thou I am anexecutioner?

2724
03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:38.230
A persecutor, I am sure,thou art:

2725
03:18:38.230 --> 03:18:40.670
If murdering innocents beexecuting,

2726
03:18:40.670 --> 03:18:42.070
Why, then thou art anexecutioner.

2727
03:18:42.070 --> 03:18:44.100
Thy son I kill'd for hispresumption.

2728
03:18:44.100 --> 03:18:46.600
Hadst thou been kill'd whenfirst thou didst presume,

2729
03:18:46.600 --> 03:18:49.230
Thou hadst not lived tokill a son of mine.

2730
03:18:49.800 --> 03:18:54.330
And thus I prophesy, thatmany a thousand,

2731
03:18:54.330 --> 03:18:59.070
Which now mistrust noparcel of my fear,

2732
03:18:59.070 --> 03:19:01.500
And many an old man's sighand many a widow's,

2733
03:19:01.500 --> 03:19:05.770
And many an orphan'swater-standing eye--

2734
03:19:05.770 --> 03:19:08.000
Men for their sons, wivesfor their husbands,

2735
03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:11.500
And orphans for theirparents timeless death--

2736
03:19:11.500 --> 03:19:15.230
Shall rue the hour thatever thou wast born.

2737
03:19:16.030 --> 03:19:20.970
The owl shriek'd at thybirth,--an evil sign;

2738
03:19:20.970 --> 03:19:24.800
The night-crow cried,aboding luckless time;

2739
03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:30.100
Dogs howl'd, and hideoustempest shook down trees;

2740
03:19:30.100 --> 03:19:31.730
The raven rook'd her onthe chimney's top,

2741
03:19:31.730 --> 03:19:36.470
And chattering pies indismal discords sung.

2742
03:19:36.470 --> 03:19:38.530
Thy mother felt more thana mother's pain,

2743
03:19:38.530 --> 03:19:41.170
And, yet brought forthless than a mother's hope,

2744
03:19:41.170 --> 03:19:44.230
To wit, an indigested anddeformed lump,

2745
03:19:44.230 --> 03:19:48.230
Not like the fruit of sucha goodly tree.

2746
03:19:48.230 --> 03:19:51.270
Teeth hadst thou in thyhead when thou wast born,

2747
03:19:51.270 --> 03:19:55.170
To signify thou camest tobite the world:

2748
03:19:55.170 --> 03:19:58.170
And, if the rest be truewhich I have heard,

2749
03:19:58.170 --> 03:19:59.200
Thou camest--

2750
03:19:59.200 --> 03:20:02.830
I'll hear no more: die,prophet in thy speech:

2751
03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:05.270
For this amongst the rest,was I ordain'd.

2752
03:20:05.270 --> 03:20:09.500
Ay, and for much moreslaughter after this.

2753
03:20:09.500 --> 03:20:14.300
God forgive my sins, andpardon thee!

2754
03:20:17.400 --> 03:20:19.870
What, will the aspiringblood of Lancaster

2755
03:20:19.870 --> 03:20:25.030
Sink in the ground? I thoughtit would have mounted.

2756
03:20:25.030 --> 03:20:28.900
See how my sword weeps forthe poor king's death!

2757
03:20:28.900 --> 03:20:30.700
O, may such purple tearsbe alway shed

2758
03:20:30.700 --> 03:20:33.570
From those that wish thedownfall of our house!

2759
03:20:33.570 --> 03:20:37.200
If any spark of life beyet remaining,

2760
03:20:37.200 --> 03:20:42.530
Down, down to hell; andsay I sent thee thither:

2761
03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:49.670
I, that have neither pity,love, nor fear.

2762
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:53.600
Indeed, 'tis true thatHenry told me of;

2763
03:20:53.600 --> 03:20:54.930
For I have often heard mymother say

2764
03:20:54.930 --> 03:20:58.800
I came into the world withmy legs forward:

2765
03:20:58.800 --> 03:21:01.030
Had I not reason, thinkye, to make haste,

2766
03:21:01.030 --> 03:21:04.130
And seek their ruin thatusurp'd our right?

2767
03:21:04.130 --> 03:21:08.070
The midwife wonder'd andthe women cried

2768
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:12.030
'O, Jesus bless us, he isborn with teeth!'

2769
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:16.930
And so I was; whichplainly signified

2770
03:21:16.930 --> 03:21:23.770
That I should snarl andbite and play the dog.

2771
03:21:23.770 --> 03:21:27.470
Then, since the heavenshave shaped my body so,

2772
03:21:27.470 --> 03:21:32.430
Let hell make crook'd mymind to answer it.

2773
03:21:32.430 --> 03:21:37.600
I have no brother, I amlike no brother;

2774
03:21:37.600 --> 03:21:40.000
And this word 'love,' whichgraybeards call divine,

2775
03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:42.630
Be resident in men likeone another

2776
03:21:42.630 --> 03:21:48.670
And not in me: I am myselfalone.

2777
03:22:01.370 --> 03:22:06.770
Clarence, beware; thoukeep'st me from the light:

2778
03:22:06.770 --> 03:22:11.670
But I will sort a pitchyday for thee;

2779
03:22:11.670 --> 03:22:12.900
For I will buz abroad suchprophecies

2780
03:22:12.900 --> 03:22:15.570
That Edward shall befearful of his life,

2781
03:22:15.570 --> 03:22:20.200
And then, to purge hisfear, I'll be thy death.

2782
03:22:22.330 --> 03:22:25.130
King Henry and the princehis son are gone:

2783
03:22:25.130 --> 03:22:29.370
Clarence, thy turn isnext, and then the rest,

2784
03:22:30.130 --> 03:22:35.930
Counting myself but badtill I be best.

2785
03:22:37.230 --> 03:22:40.730
I'll throw thy body inanother room

2786
03:22:40.730 --> 03:22:44.770
And triumph, Henry, in thyday of doom.

2787
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:20.100

2790
03:24:25.600 --> 03:24:29.570
Once more we sit inEngland's royal throne,

2791
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:34.930
Re-purchased with theblood of enemies.

2792
03:24:34.930 --> 03:24:39.000
What valiant foemen, liketo autumn's corn,

2793
03:24:39.000 --> 03:24:44.370
Have we mow'd down, intops of all their pride!

2794
03:24:44.370 --> 03:24:47.870
Three Dukes of Somerset,threefold renown'd

2795
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:50.470
For hardy and undoubtedchampions;

2796
03:24:50.470 --> 03:24:54.970
Two Cliffords, as thefather and the son,

2797
03:24:54.970 --> 03:25:00.870
With them, the two bravebears, Warwick and Montague,

2798
03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:04.200
That in their chainsfetter'd the kingly lion

2799
03:25:04.200 --> 03:25:09.670
And made the foresttremble when they roar'd.

2800
03:25:09.670 --> 03:25:15.070
Thus have we sweptsuspicion from our seat

2801
03:25:15.070 --> 03:25:21.270
And made our footstool ofsecurity.

2802
03:25:21.270 --> 03:25:26.900
Come hither, Bess, and letme kiss my boy.

2803
03:25:42.830 --> 03:25:48.030
Young Ned, for thee, thineuncles and myself

2804
03:25:48.030 --> 03:25:51.530
Have in our armours watch'dthe winter's night,

2805
03:25:51.530 --> 03:25:55.470
Went all afoot in summer'sscalding heat,

2806
03:25:55.470 --> 03:26:00.900
That thou mightst repossessthe crown in peace;

2807
03:26:00.900 --> 03:26:05.770
And of our labours thoushalt reap the gain.

2808
03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:12.330
Clarence and Gloucester,love my lovely queen;

2809
03:26:12.330 --> 03:26:15.070
And kiss your princelynephew, brothers both.

2810

The duty that I owe untoyour majesty

2811
03:26:21.700 --> 03:26:24.400
I seal upon the lips ofthis sweet babe.

2812
03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:26.830
Thanks, noble Clarence;worthy brother, thanks.

2813
03:26:26.830 --> 03:26:29.900
And, that I love the treefrom whence thou sprang'st,

2814
03:26:29.900 --> 03:26:33.570
Witness the loving kiss Igive the fruit.

2815
03:26:34.470 --> 03:26:36.600
To say the truth soJudas kissed his master

2816
03:26:36.600 --> 03:26:39.770
And cried 'all hail!' whenas he meant all harm.

2817
03:26:39.770 --> 03:26:43.530
Now am I seated as my souldelights,

2818
03:26:43.530 --> 03:26:47.000
Having my country's peaceand brothers' loves.

2819
03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:49.970
What will your grace havedone with Margaret?

2820
03:26:49.970 --> 03:26:51.900
Reignier, her father, tothe king of France

2821
03:26:51.900 --> 03:26:54.600
Hath pawn'd the Sicils andJerusalem,

2822
03:26:54.600 --> 03:26:56.070
And hither have they sentit for her ransom.

2823
03:26:56.070 --> 03:26:58.930
Away with her, and wafther hence to France.

2824
03:26:59.930 --> 03:27:02.300
And now what rests butthat we spend the time

2825
03:27:02.300 --> 03:27:06.170
With stately triumphs,mirthful comic shows,

2826
03:27:06.170 --> 03:27:08.800
Such as befits thepleasure of the court?

Sound drums and trumpets!farewell sour annoy!
