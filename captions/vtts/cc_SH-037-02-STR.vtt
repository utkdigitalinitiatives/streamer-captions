00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.470


2
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.630
Neither my husband nor theslave return'd,

3
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.670
That in such haste I sentto seek his master!

4
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.000
Sure, Luciana, it is twoo'clock.

5
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.800
Perhaps some merchant hathinvited him,

6
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.600
And from the mart he'ssomewhere gone to dinner.

7
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.870
Good sister, let us dineand never fret:

8
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.370
A man is master of hisliberty:

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.530
Time is their master, and,when they see time,

10
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.770
They'll go or come: if so,be patient, sister.

11
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.370
Why should their libertythan ours be more?

12
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.330
Because their businessstill lies out o' door.

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.570
Look, when I serve him so,he takes it ill.

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.830
O, know he is the bridleof your will.

15
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.070
There's none but asseswill be bridled so.

16
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.000
Why, headstrong liberty islash'd with woe.

17
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.530
There's nothing situateunder heaven's eye

18
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.670
But hath his bound, inearth, in sea, in sky:

19
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.170
The beasts, the fishes,and the winged fowls,

20
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.130
Are their males' subjectsand at their controls:

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.230
Men, more divine, themasters of all these,

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.030
Lords of the wide worldand wild watery seas,

23
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.630
Indued with intellectualsense and souls,

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.000
Of more preeminence thanfish and fowls,

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.030
Are masters to theirfemales, and their lords:

26
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.230
Then let your will attendon their accords.

27
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.670
This servitude makes youto keep unwed.

28
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.370
Not this, but troubles ofthe marriage-bed.

29
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.600
But, were you wedded, youwould bear some sway.

30
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.800
Ere I learn love, I'llpractise to obey.

31
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.630
How if your husband startsome other where?

32
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.430
Till he come home again, Iwould forbear.

33
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.900
Patience unmoved! nomarvel though she pause;

34
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.070
They can be meek that haveno other cause.

35
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.470
A wretched soul, bruisedwith adversity,

36
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.930
We bid be quiet when wehear it cry;

37
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.630
But were we burdened withlike weight of pain,

38
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.770
As much or more would weourselves complain:

39
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.400
So thou, that hast nounkind mate to grieve thee,

40
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.600
With urging helplesspatience wouldst relieve me,

41
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.230
But, if thou live to seelike right bereft,

42
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.000
This fool-begg'd patiencein thee will be left.

43
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.570
Well, I will marry oneday, but to try.

44
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.070
Here comes your man; nowis your husband nigh.

45
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.430
Say, is your tardy masternow at hand?

46
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.970
Nay, he's at two hands withme, and that my two ears

47
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.470
can witness.

48
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.230
Say, didst thou speak withhim?

49
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.530
know'st thou hismind?

50
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.230
Ay, ay, he told his mindupon mine ear:

51
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.230
Beshrew his hand, I scarcecould understand it.

52
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.130
Spake he so doubtfully,

53
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.800
thou couldst not feel hismeaning?

54
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.800
Nay, he struck so plainly, Icould too well feel his blows;

55
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.830
and withal so doubtfullythat I could scarce

56
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.070
understand them.

57
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.500
But say, I prithee,is he coming home?

58
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.000
It seems he hath greatcare to please his wife.

59
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.530
Why, mistress, sure mymaster is horn-mad.

60
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.970
Horn-mad, thou villain!

61
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.900
I mean not cuckold-mad;

62
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.830
But, sure, he is starkmad.

63
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.800
When I desired him to comehome to dinner,

64
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.170
He ask'd me for a thousandmarks in gold:

65
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.470
''Tis dinner-time,' quothI; 'My gold!' quoth he;

66
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.630
'Your meat doth burn,' quothI; 'My gold!' quoth he:

67
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.930
'Will you come home?'quoth I;

68
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.170
'My gold!' quoth he.

69
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.070
'Where is the thousand marksI gave thee, villain?'

70
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.970
'The pig,' quoth I, 'isburn'd;'

71
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.630
'My gold!' quothhe:

72
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.370
'My mistress, sir' quothI; 'Hang up thy mistress!

73
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.630
I know not thy mistress;out on thy mistress!'

74
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.200
Quoth who?

75
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.600
Quoth my master:

76
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.070
'I know,' quoth he, 'nohouse, no wife, no mistress.'

77
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.530
So that my errand, dueunto my tongue,

78
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.930
I thank him, I bare homeupon my shoulders;

79
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.830
For, in conclusion, he didbeat me there.

80
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.930
Go back again, thou slave,and fetch him home.

81
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.170
Go back again, and be newbeaten home?

82
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.900
For God's sake, send someother messenger.

83
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.830
Back, slave, or I willbreak thy pate across.

84
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.370
And he will bless thatcross with other beating:

85
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.900
Between you I shall have aholy head.

86
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.770
Hence, prating peasant!fetch thy master home.

87
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.800
Am I so round with you asyou with me,

88
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.970
That like a football youdo spurn me thus?

89
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.330
You spurn me hence, and hewill spurn me hither:

90
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.630
If I last in this service,you must case me in leather.

91
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.770
Fie, how impatienceloureth in your face!

92
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.670
His company must do hisminions grace,

93
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.900
Whilst I at home starvefor a merry look.

94
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.000
Hath homely age thealluring beauty took

95
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.800
From my poor cheek? thenhe hath wasted it:

96
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.800
Are my discourses dull?barren my wit?

97
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.030
If voluble and sharpdiscourse be marr'd,

98
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.730
Unkindness blunts it morethan marble hard:

99
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.530
Do their gay vestments hisaffections bait?

100
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.700
That's not my fault: he'smaster of my state:

101
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.270
What ruins are in me thatcan be found,

102
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.000
By him not ruin'd? then ishe the ground

103
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.700
Of my defeatures. Mydecayed fair

104
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.270
A sunny look of his wouldsoon repair

105
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.200
But, too unruly deer, hebreaks the pale

106
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.900
And feeds from home; poorI am but his stale.

107
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.770
Self-harming jealousy!fie, beat it hence!

108
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.070
Unfeeling fools can withsuch wrongs dispense.

109
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.570
I know his eye doth homageotherwhere,

110
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.570
Or else what lets it buthe would be here?

111
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.070
Sister, you know hepromised me a chain;

112
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.570
Would that alone, alone hewould detain,

113
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.670
So he would keep fairquarter with his bed!

114
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.230
I see the jewel bestenamelled

115
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.870
Will lose his beauty; yetthe gold bides still,

116
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.000
That others touch, andoften touching will

117
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.730
Wear gold: and no man thathath a name,

118
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.170
By falsehood andcorruption doth it shame.

119
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.730
Since that my beautycannot please his eye,

120
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.430
I'll weep what's leftaway, and weeping die.

121
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.030
How many fond fools servemad jealousy!

122
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.700
The gold I gave to Dromiois laid up

123
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.470
Safe at the Centaur; andthe heedful slave

124
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.470
Is wander'd forth, in careto seek me out

125
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.730
By computation and minehost's report.

126
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.300
I could not speak withDromio since at first

127
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.970
I sent him from the mart.See, here he comes.

128
00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.270
How now sir! is your merryhumour alter'd?

129
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.870
As you love strokes, sojest with me again.

130
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.270
You know no Centaur? youreceived no gold?

131
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.430
Your mistress sent to haveme home to dinner?

132
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.970
My house was at thePhoenix? Wast thou mad,

133
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.530
That thus so madly thoudidst answer me?

134
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.830
What answer, sir? whenspake I such a word?

135
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.770
Even now, even here, nothalf an hour since.

136
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.870
I did not see you sinceyou sent me hence,

137
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.600
Home to the Centaur, withthe gold you gave me.

138
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.870
Villain, thou didst denythe gold's receipt,

139
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.400
And told'st me of amistress and a dinner;

140
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.430
For which, I hope, thoufelt'st I was displeased.

141
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.670
I am glad to see you inthis merry vein:

142
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:58.670
What means this jest? Ipray you, master, tell me.

143
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.730
Yea, dost thou jeer andflout me in the teeth?

144
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.530
Think'st thou I jest? Hold,take thou that, and that.

145
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.230
Hold, sir, for God's sake!now your jest is earnest:

146
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.600
Upon what bargain do yougive it me?

147
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.170
Because that I familiarlysometimes

148
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:20.430
Do use you for my fool andchat with you,

149
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.530
Your sauciness will jestupon my love

150
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:24.570
And make a common of myserious hours.

151
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.670
When the sun shines letfoolish gnats make sport,

152
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.330
But creep in crannies whenhe hides his beams.

153
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.630
If you will jest with me,know my aspect,

154
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.330
And fashion your demeanorto my looks,

155
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.100
Or I will beat this methodin your sconce.

156
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:39.470
Sconce call you it? so youwould leave battering,

157
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.500
I had rather have it a head:an you use these blows long,

158
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.100
I must get a sconce formy head

159
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.930
and ensconce it too; orelse I shall seek my wit

160
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:47.870
in my shoulders.

161
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.870
But, I pray, sir why am Ibeaten?

162
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.570
Dost thou not know?

163
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.170
Nothing, sir, but that Iam beaten.

164
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.430
Shall I tell you why?

165
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.170
Ay, sir, and wherefore;

166
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.670
for they say every whyhath a wherefore.

167
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.630
Why, first,--for floutingme; and then, wherefore--

168
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.630
For urging it the secondtime to me.

169
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.530
Was there ever any manthus beaten out of season,

170
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.930
When in the whyand the wherefore

171
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:11.900
is neither rhyme nor reason?

172
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:13.600
Well, sir, I thank you.

173
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.000
Thank me, sir, for what?

174
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.730
For this something

175
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.930
that you gave mefor nothing.

176
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:18.400
I'll make you amends next,to give you nothing

177
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.700
for something. But say,sir, is it dinner-time?

178
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.470
No, sir; I think the meatwants that I have.

179
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:24.530
In good time, sir; what'sthat?

180
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:25.800
Basting.

181
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.570
Well, sir, then 'twill bedry.

182
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.130
If it be, sir, I pray you,eat none of it.

183
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.830
Your reason?

184
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.130
Lest it make you cholericand purchase me another

185
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.030
dry basting.

186
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.770
Well, sir, learn tojest in good time:

187
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.570
there's a time forall things.

188
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:42.600
I durst have denied that,

189
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.800
before you were socholeric.

190
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.970
By what rule, sir?

191
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.430
Marry, sir, by a rule asplain as the plain bald pate

192
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.700
of father Time himself.

193
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.330
Let's hear it.

194
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.070
There's no time for aman to recover his hair

195
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.800
that grows bald by nature.

196
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.030
Why is Time such a niggardof hair, being, as it is,

197
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.400
so plentiful an excrement?

198
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.870
Because it is a blessingthat he bestows on beasts;

199
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.870
and what he hath scantedmen in hair

200
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.000
he hath giventhem in wit.

201
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.730
I knew it would be a bold conclusion.

202
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.230
But, soft! who wafts usyonder?

203
00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:00.070
Ay, ay, Antipholus, lookstrange and frown:

204
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.700
Some other mistress haththy sweet aspects;

205
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.070
I am not Adriana nor thywife.

206
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.900
The time was once whenthou unurged wouldst vow

207
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.000
That never words weremusic to thine ear,

208
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.800
That never object pleasingin thine eye,

209
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.930
That never touch wellwelcome to thy hand,

210
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.130
That never meatsweet-savor'd in thy taste,

211
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.170
Unless I spake, or look'd,or touch'd,

212
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.400
or carved tothee.

213
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.670
How comes it now, myhusband, O, how comes it,

214
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.170
That thou art thusestranged from thyself?

215
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.070
Thyself I call it, beingstrange to me,

216
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.800
That, undividable,incorporate,

217
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.730
Am better than thy dearself's better part.

218
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:57.200
Ah, do not tear awaythyself from me!

219
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.170
For know, my love, as easymayest thou fall

220
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.330
A drop of water in thebreaking gulf,

221
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.730
And take unmingled thatsame drop again,

222
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.070
Without addition ordiminishing,

223
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.170
As take from me thyselfand not me too.

224
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.000
How dearly would it touchme to the quick,

225
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.900
Shouldst thou but hear Iwere licentious

226
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.000
And that this body,consecrate to thee,

227
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.530
By ruffian lust should becontaminate!

228
00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.370
Wouldst thou not spit atme and spurn at me

229
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.400
And hurl the name ofhusband in my face

230
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.430
And tear the stain'd skinoff my harlot-brow

231
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.770
And from my false hand cutthe wedding-ring

232
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.970
And break it with adeep-divorcing vow?

233
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:42.600
I know thou canst; andtherefore see thou do it.

234
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.530
I am possess'd with anadulterate blot;

235
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.830
My blood is mingled withthe crime of lust:

236
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.870
For if we too be one andthou play false,

237
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.030
I do digest the poison ofthy flesh,

238
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.370
Being strumpeted by thycontagion.

239
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.270
Keep then far league andtruce with thy true bed;

240
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:14.000
I live unstain'd, thouundishonoured.

241
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.930
Plead you to me, fairdame? I know you not:

242
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.570
In Ephesus I am but twohours old,

243
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.070
As strange unto your townas to your talk;

244
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.170
Who, every word by all mywit being scann'd,

245
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.900
Want wit in all one wordto understand.

246
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.500
Fie, brother! how theworld is changed with you!

247
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.630
When were you wont to usemy sister thus?

248
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.630
She sent for you by Dromiohome to dinner.

249
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.270
By Dromio?

250
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.630
By me?

251
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:46.430
By thee;

252
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.070
Did you converse, sir,with this gentlewoman?

253
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.900
What is the course anddrift of your compact?

254
00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.770
I, sir? I never saw hertill this time.

255
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.570
Villain, thou liest; foreven her very words

256
00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.270
Didst thou deliver to meon the mart.

257
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.670
I never spake with her inall my life.

258
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.100
How can she thus then callus by our names,

259
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.500
Unless it be byinspiration.

260
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:12.870
How ill agrees it withyour gravity

261
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.270
To counterfeit thusgrossly with your slave,

262
00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.530
Abetting him to thwart mein my mood!

263
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.400
Be it my wrong you arefrom me exempt,

264
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.800
But wrong not that wrongwith a more contempt.

265
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:32.400
Come, I will fasten onthis sleeve of thine:

266
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:39.130
Thou art an elm, myhusband, I a vine,

267
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.770
Whose weakness, married tothy stronger state,

268
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.600
Makes me with thy strengthto communicate:

269
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.370
If aught possess thee fromme, it is dross,

270
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.770
Usurping ivy, brier, oridle moss;

271
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.400
Who, all for want ofpruning, with intrusion

272
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.600
Infect thy sap and live onthy confusion.

273
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.370
To me she speaks; shemoves me for her theme:

274
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.900
What, was I married to herin my dream?

275
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.270
Or sleep I now and think Ihear all this?

276
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.370
What error drives our eyesand ears amiss?

277
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:19.030
Until I know this sureuncertainty,

278
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.600
I'll entertain the offer'dfallacy.

279
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.670
Dromio, go bid the servantsspread for dinner.

280
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.800
O, for my beads! I crossme for a sinner.

281
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.100
This is the fairy land: Ospite of spites!

282
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.470
We talk with goblins, owlsand sprites:

283
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.400
If we obey them not, thiswill ensue,

284
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.270
They'll suck our breath, orpinch us black and blue.

285
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.230
Why pratest thou tothyself and answer'st not?

286
00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:02.700
Dromio, thou drone, thousnail, thou slug, thou sot!

287
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.100
I am transformed, master,am I not?

288
00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.100
I think thou art in mind,and so am I.

289
00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.870
Nay, master, both in mindand in my shape.

290
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.170
Thou hast thine own form.

291
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.370
No, I am an ape.

292
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.800
If thou art changed toaught, 'tis to an ass.

293
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.530
'Tis true; she rides meand I long for grass.

294
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.600
'Tis so, I am an ass; elseit could never be

295
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.530
But I should know her aswell as she knows me.

296
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.800
Come, come, no longer willI be a fool,

297
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.630
To put the finger in theeye and weep,

298
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.930
Whilst man and masterlaugh my woes to scorn.

299
00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.700
Come, sir, to dinner.

300
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.730
Dromio, keep the gate.

301
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:44.370
Husband, I'll dine abovewith you to-day

302
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.070
And shrive you of athousand idle pranks.

303
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.500
Sirrah, if any ask you foryour master,

304
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.930
Say he dines forth, andlet no creature enter.

305
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:59.070
Come, sister. Dromio, playthe porter well.

306
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:03.270
Am I in earth, in heaven,or in hell?

307
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:05.870
Sleeping or waking? mad orwell-advised?

308
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.230
Known unto these, and tomyself disguised!

309
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.470
I'll say as they say andpersever so,

310
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.270
And in this mist at alladventures go.

311
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:20.630
Master, shall I be porterat the gate?

312
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.830
Ay; and let none enter,lest I break your pate.

313
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.670
Come, come, Antipholus, wedine too late.

314
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.730
