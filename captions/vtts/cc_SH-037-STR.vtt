00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:53.030


2
00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:03.130
(music and voices in celebration)

3
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:26.770
(music and voices in celebration)

4
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.230
Make way for the Duke!

5
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.170
Stand back!

6
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.500
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall

7
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.430
And by the doom of death end woes and all.

8
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:32.530
(drumming)

9
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.000
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;

10
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.970
I am not partial to infringe our laws:

11
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.870
The enmity and discord which of late

12
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.770
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke

13
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.500
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,

14
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.630
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives

15
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.130
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,

16
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.300
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.

17
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.400
For, since the mortal and intestine jars

18
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.500
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,

19
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.800
It hath in solemn synods been decreed

20
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.270
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,

21
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.870
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,

22
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.400
If any born at Ephesus be seen

23
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.570
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;

24
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.830
Again: if any Syracusian born

25
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.470
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,

26
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.030
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,

27
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.330
Unless a thousand marks be levied,

28
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.800
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.

29
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.770
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,

30
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.100
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;

31
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.230
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.

32
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.070
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,

33
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.530
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

34
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:13.070
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause

35
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.500
Why thou departed'st from thy native home

36
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.400
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.

37
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.170
A heavier task could not have been imposed

38
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.000
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:

39
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.030
Yet, that the world may witness that my end

40
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.830
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,

41
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.270
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.

42
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.730
In Syracusa was I born, and wed

43
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.830
Unto a woman, happy but for me,

44
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.630
And by me, had not our hap been bad.

45
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.930
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased

46
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.670
By prosperous voyages I often made

47
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.470
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death

48
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.030
And the great care of goods at random left

49
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.200
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:

50
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.670
From whom my absence was not six months old

51
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.730
Before herself, almost at fainting under

52
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.500
The pleasing punishment that women bear,

53
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.830
Had made provision for her following me

54
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.300
And soon and safe arrived where I was.

55
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.130
There had she not been long, but she became

56
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.030
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;

57
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.500
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,

58
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.200
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.

59
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.530
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,

60
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.800
A meaner woman was delivered

61
00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.200
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:

62
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.800
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--

63
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.800
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.

64
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.400
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,

65
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.930
Made daily motions for our home return:

66
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.630
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,

67
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.200
We came aboard.

68
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.400
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,

69
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.300
Before the always wind-obeying deep

70
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.700
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:

71
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.900
But longer did we not retain much hope;

72
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.670
For what obscured light the heavens did grant

73
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.030
Did but convey unto our fearful minds

74
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.300
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;

75
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.730
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,

76
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.830
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,

77
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.430
Weeping before for what she saw must come,

78
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.330
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,

79
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.130
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,

80
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.070
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.

81
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:13.130
And this it was, for other means was none:

82
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.970
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,

83
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.500
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:

84
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.570
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,

85
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.930
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,

86
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.470
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;

87
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.300
To him one of the other twins was bound,

88
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.300
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:

89
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:51.670
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,

90
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.470
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,

91
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:59.200
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;

92
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.130
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,

93
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.800
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.

94
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.570
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,

95
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.230
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;

96
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.930
And by the benefit of his wished light,

97
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.600
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered

98
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.470
Two ships from far making amain to us,

99
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.500
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:

100
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.630
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!

101
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:38.330
Gather the sequel by that went before.

102
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.070
Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;

103
00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.500
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

104
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.100
O, had the gods done so, I had not now

105
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.600
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!

106
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.530
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,

107
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.900
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;

108
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.970
Which being violently borne upon,

109
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.300
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;

110
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.470
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,

111
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.200
Fortune had left to both of us alike

112
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.700
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.

113
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.030
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened

114
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.470
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,

115
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.000
Was carried with more speed before the wind;

116
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.070
And in our sight they three were taken up

117
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:33.400
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.

118
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.470
At length, another ship had seized on us;

119
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.230
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,

120
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.130
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;

121
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.300
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,

122
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.430
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;

123
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.970
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.

124
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.530
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;

125
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.770
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,

126
00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.130
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

127
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.030
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,

128
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.870
Do me the favour to dilate at full

129
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.530
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

130
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.370
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,

131
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.600
At eighteen years became inquisitive

132
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.430
After his brother: and importuned me

133
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.170
That his attendant--so his case was like,

134
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.730
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--

135
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.300
Might bear him company in the quest of him:

136
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.930
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,

137
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.870
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.

138
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:58.070
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,

139
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.700
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,

140
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.100
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;

141
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.070
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought

142
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.270
Or that or any place that harbours men.

143
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.300
But here must end the story of my life;

144
00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.870
And happy were I in my timely death,

145
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.770
Could all my travels warrant me they live.

146
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:51.700
Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd

147
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.070
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!

148
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.000
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,

149
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.570
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,

150
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:04.570
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,

151
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.630
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.

152
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.730
But, though thou art adjudged to the death

153
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.230
And passed sentence may not be recall'd

154
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.930
But to our honour's great disparagement,

155
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.870
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.

156
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:27.070
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day

157
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.930
To seek thy life by beneficial help:

158
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.970
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;

159
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.500
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,

160
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.630
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.

161
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.330
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

162
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.200
I will, my lord.

163
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:56.070
Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,

164
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.070
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

165
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:09.170
(clock chimes)

166
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:15.530
(clock chimes)

167
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.530
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,

168
00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.870
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.

169
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.600
This very day a Syracusian merchant

170
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.430
Is apprehended for arrival here;

171
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.630
And not being able to buy out his life

172
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.230
According to the statute of the town,

173
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.100
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.

174
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.070
There is your money that I had to keep.

175
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.130
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,

176
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.100
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.

177
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.330
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:

178
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:06.470
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,

179
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.200
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,

180
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.400
And then return and sleep within mine inn,

181
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.100
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.

182
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.070
Get thee away.

183
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.870
Many a man would take you at your word,

184
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.830
And go indeed, having so good a mean.

185
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.970
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,

186
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.700
When I am dull with care and melancholy,

187
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.730
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.

188
00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.070
What, will you walk with me about the town,

189
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.700
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

190
00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.100
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,

191
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.900
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;

192
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.870
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,

193
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.870
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart

194
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.230
And afterward consort you till bed-time:

195
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.430
My present business calls me from you now.

196
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.930
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself

197
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.270
And wander up and down to view the city.

198
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.700
Sir, I commend you to your own content.

199
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.530
He that commends me to mine own content

200
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:04.100
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.

201
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.330
I to the world am like a drop of water

202
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.600
That in the ocean seeks another drop,

203
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.130
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,

204
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.970
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:

205
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.800
So I, to find a mother and a brother,

206
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.670
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

207
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.230
Here comes the almanac of my true date.

208
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.970
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?

209
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.730
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:

210
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:40.070
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,

211
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:41.770
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;

212
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.130
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:

213
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.030
She is so hot because the meat is cold;

214
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.230
The meat is cold because you come not home;

215
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.270
You come not home because you have no stomach;

216
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.170
You have no stomach having broke your fast;

217
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.900
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray

218
00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.000
Are penitent for your default to-day.

219
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.570
Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:

220
00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.300
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

221
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.670
O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last

222
00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.400
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?

223
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.900
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.

224
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:11.670
I am not in a sportive humour now:

225
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:14.270
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?

226
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.330
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust

227
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.170
So great a charge from thine own custody?

228
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.070
I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:

229
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.000
I from my mistress come to you in post;

230
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.670
If I return, I shall be post indeed,

231
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:31.270
For she will score your fault upon my pate.

232
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:33.470
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,

233
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:35.070
And strike you home without a messenger.

234
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:36.930
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;

235
00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:38.530
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.

236
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.170
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

237
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.400
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.

238
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.900
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,

239
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.330
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

240
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.330
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart

241
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:57.270
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:

242
00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.130
My mistress and her sister stays for you.

243
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:59.670
Now, as I am a Christian, answer me

244
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.400
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,

245
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.730
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours

246
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.370
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:

247
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:10.070
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

248
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.400
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,

249
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.870
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,

250
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:18.700
But not a thousand marks between you both.

251
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.200
If I should pay your worship those again,

252
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.030
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.

253
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.430
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

254
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.870
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;

255
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.070
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,

256
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.900
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.

257
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.770
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,

258
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:42.330
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

259
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.470
What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!

260
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.400
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

261
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.300
Upon my life, by some device or other

262
00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.270
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.

263
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.700
They say this town is full of cozenage,

264
00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:00.400
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,

265
00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:03.530
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,

266
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.630
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,

267
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.230
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,

268
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.470
And many such-like liberties of sin:

269
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.900
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.

270
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.230
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:

271
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.900
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

272
00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:45.330
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,

273
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.370
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!

274
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:50.700
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

275
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.500
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,

276
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.300
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.

277
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.570
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:

278
00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.130
A man is master of his liberty:

279
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.300
Time is their master, and, when they see time,

280
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.530
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

281
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.130
Why should their liberty than ours be more?

282
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.100
Because their business still lies out o' door.

283
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.330
Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

284
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:18.600
O, know he is the bridle of your will.

285
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.770
There's none but asses will be bridled so.

286
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.700
Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.

287
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.230
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye

288
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:32.370
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:

289
00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:35.870
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,

290
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:38.830
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:

291
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.930
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,

292
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.730
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,

293
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.330
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,

294
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.700
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,

295
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.730
Are masters to their females, and their lords:

296
00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.930
Then let your will attend on their accords.

297
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.370
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

298
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:09.070
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

299
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.300
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

300
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.500
Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

301
00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.330
How if your husband start some other where?

302
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.130
Till he come home again, I would forbear.

303
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:25.530
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;

304
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.700
They can be meek that have no other cause.

305
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.070
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,

306
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.530
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;

307
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:36.230
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,

308
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:39.370
As much or more would we ourselves complain:

309
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:45.000
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,

310
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.200
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,

311
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:51.830
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,

312
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.600
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

313
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.170
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.

314
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.730
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.

315
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.030
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

316
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.570
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears

317
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.070
can witness.

318
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:32.830
Say, didst thou speak with him?

319
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.130
know'st thou his mind?

320
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.830
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:

321
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:38.830
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

322
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.730
Spake he so doubtfully,

323
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.400
thou couldst not feel his meaning?

324
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.400
Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his blows;

325
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.430
and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce

326
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.670
understand them.

327
00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.100
But say, I prithee, is he coming home?

328
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.600
It seems he hath great care to please his wife.

329
00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.200
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

330
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.630
Horn-mad, thou villain!

331
00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.570
I mean not cuckold-mad;

332
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.500
But, sure, he is stark mad.

333
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.400
When I desired him to come home to dinner,

334
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.770
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:

335
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.070
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;

336
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.230
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:

337
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.530
'Will you come home?' quoth I;

338
00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.770
'My gold!' quoth he.

339
00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.670
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'

340
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.570
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;'

341
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.230
'My gold!' quoth he:

342
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.970
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!

343
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.230
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

344
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:50.800
Quoth who?

345
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.200
Quoth my master:

346
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.670
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'

347
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:58.130
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,

348
00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.600
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;

349
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.500
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

350
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.600
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

351
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.830
Go back again, and be new beaten home?

352
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.530
For God's sake, send some other messenger.

353
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.470
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

354
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And he will bless that cross with other beating:

355
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.530
Between you I shall have a holy head.

356
00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.330
Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

357
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.370
Am I so round with you as you with me,

358
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:30.530
That like a football you do spurn me thus?

359
00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.900
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:

360
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.200
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

361
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.330
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

362
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.230
His company must do his minions grace,

363
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.470
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.

364
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.570
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took

365
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.370
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:

366
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.370
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?

367
00:23:57.370 --> 00:23:59.600
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,

368
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:03.370
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:

369
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.170
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?

370
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:11.330
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:

371
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.900
What ruins are in me that can be found,

372
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:18.630
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground

373
00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.330
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair

374
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.830
A sunny look of his would soon repair

375
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:30.770
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale

376
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.470
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

377
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.330
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

378
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:42.630
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.

379
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.130
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,

380
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.130
Or else what lets it but he would be here?

381
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:54.630
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;

382
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.130
Would that alone, alone he would detain,

383
00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.300
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!

384
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.870
I see the jewel best enamelled

385
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:07.500
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,

386
00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.630
That others touch, and often touching will

387
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.370
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,

388
00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:14.800
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.

389
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.370
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,

390
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.000
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

391
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:33.600
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

392
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.230
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up

393
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:26.000
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave

394
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out

395
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.270
By computation and mine host's report.

396
00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.830
I could not speak with Dromio since at first

397
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:39.500
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

398
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.800
How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?

399
00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.400
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.

400
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.800
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?

401
00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.970
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?

402
00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.500
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,

403
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.070
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

404
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.370
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?

405
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.370
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

406
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.470
I did not see you since you sent me hence,

407
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.200
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.

408
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:09.470
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,

409
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.000
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;

410
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.030
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

411
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:17.270
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:

412
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.270
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.

413
00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:24.270
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?

414
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:30.070
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

415
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.770
Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:

416
00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.130
Upon what bargain do you give it me?

417
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:39.700
Because that I familiarly sometimes

418
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.970
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,

419
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.070
Your sauciness will jest upon my love

420
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:46.100
And make a common of my serious hours.

421
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.200
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,

422
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.870
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.

423
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.170
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,

424
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.870
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,

425
00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.630
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

426
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.070
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering,

427
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.100
I had rather have it a head: an you use these blows long,

428
00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.700
I must get a sconce for my head

429
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.530
and ensconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit

430
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.470
in my shoulders.

431
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.470
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?

432
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.170
Dost thou not know?

433
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.770
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.

434
00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:20.030
Shall I tell you why?

435
00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.770
Ay, sir, and wherefore;

436
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.270
for they say every why hath a wherefore.

437
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.230
Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--

438
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.230
For urging it the second time to me.

439
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.130
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,

440
00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.530
When in the why and the wherefore

441
00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.500
is neither rhyme nor reason?

442
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.200
Well, sir, I thank you.

443
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.600
Thank me, sir, for what?

444
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.330
For this something

445
00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:38.530
that you gave me for nothing.

446
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:40.000
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing

447
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.270
for something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

448
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:45.030
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.

449
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:46.100
In good time, sir; what's that?

450
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.370
Basting.

451
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.130
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

452
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.700
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.

453
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.400
Your reason?

454
00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.700
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another

455
00:28:58.700 --> 00:28:59.600
dry basting.

456
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.400
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time:

457
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.200
there's a time for all things.

458
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.230
I durst have denied that,

459
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.430
before you were so choleric.

460
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:06.600
By what rule, sir?

461
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:11.070
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate

462
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.330
of father Time himself.

463
00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.970
Let's hear it.

464
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:19.700
There's no time for a man to recover his hair

465
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.430
that grows bald by nature.

466
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.600
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,

467
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.970
so plentiful an excrement?

468
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.430
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;

469
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.430
and what he hath scanted men in hair

470
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.570
he hath given them in wit.

471
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.300
I knew it would be  a bold conclusion.

472
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.800
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?

473
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.570
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:

474
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.200
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;

475
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.570
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.

476
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.400
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow

477
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.500
That never words were music to thine ear,

478
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.300
That never object pleasing in thine eye,

479
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.430
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,

480
00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.630
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,

481
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.670
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd,

482
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:46.900
or carved to thee.

483
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.170
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,

484
00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.670
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?

485
00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.570
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,

486
00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:02.370
That, undividable, incorporate,

487
00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.300
Am better than thy dear self's better part.

488
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:18.770
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!

489
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.630
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall

490
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:27.800
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,

491
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.200
And take unmingled that same drop again,

492
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.530
Without addition or diminishing,

493
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.630
As take from me thyself and not me too.

494
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.470
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,

495
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.370
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious

496
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.470
And that this body, consecrate to thee,

497
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.000
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!

498
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.830
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me

499
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:50.870
And hurl the name of husband in my face

500
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.900
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow

501
00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.230
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring

502
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.430
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?

503
00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:04.130
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.

504
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.070
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;

505
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:13.370
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:

506
00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.400
For if we too be one and thou play false,

507
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.570
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,

508
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:20.900
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.

509
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.730
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;

510
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.470
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.

511
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.400
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:

512
00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.030
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,

513
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.530
As strange unto your town as to your talk;

514
00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.630
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,

515
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:54.370
Want wit in all one word to understand.

516
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.970
Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!

517
00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.100
When were you wont to use my sister thus?

518
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.170
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.

519
00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:05.800
By Dromio?

520
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.170
By me?

521
00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:07.970
By thee;

522
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.600
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?

523
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.430
What is the course and drift of your compact?

524
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.300
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.

525
00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.030
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words

526
00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:24.730
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

527
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.130
I never spake with her in all my life.

528
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.570
How can she thus then call us by our names,

529
00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:31.970
Unless it be by inspiration.

530
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.330
How ill agrees it with your gravity

531
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.730
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,

532
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.000
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!

533
00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.870
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,

534
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.270
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.

535
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:53.870
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:

536
00:33:53.870 --> 00:34:00.670
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,

537
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:03.300
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,

538
00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.130
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:

539
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.870
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,

540
00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.270
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;

541
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:16.900
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion

542
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:21.100
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.

543
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.800
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:

544
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:33.330
What, was I married to her in my dream?

545
00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:35.700
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?

546
00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:37.800
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?

547
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:40.470
Until I know this sure uncertainty,

548
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:42.030
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

549
00:34:48.930 --> 00:34:51.100
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

550
00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.300
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.

551
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.600
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!

552
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.970
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:

553
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.900
If we obey them not, this will ensue,

554
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.770
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

555
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.730
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?

556
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:24.130
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

557
00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:27.530
I am transformed, master, am I not?

558
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:30.530
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

559
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.300
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

560
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.600
Thou hast thine own form.

561
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.800
No, I am an ape.

562
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.230
If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.

563
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.970
'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.

564
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:44.030
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be

565
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.970
But I should know her as well as she knows me.

566
00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.230
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,

567
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:52.070
To put the finger in the eye and weep,

568
00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:54.370
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.

569
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:58.130
Come, sir, to dinner.

570
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.230
Dromio, keep the gate.

571
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:05.870
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day

572
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.570
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.

573
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.000
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,

574
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.430
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.

575
00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:20.570
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.

576
00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.700
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?

577
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.300
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?

578
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.670
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!

579
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.900
I'll say as they say and persever so,

580
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.700
And in this mist at all adventures go.

581
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:42.070
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

582
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.270
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

583
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.100
Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

584
00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.830
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;

585
00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.900
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:

586
00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.100
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop

587
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.030
To see the making of her carcanet,

588
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.300
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.

589
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.530
But here's a villain that would face me down

590
00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.300
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,

591
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.570
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,

592
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:37.470
And that I did deny my wife and house.

593
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.630
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

594
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.030
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;

595
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.130
That you beat me at the mart,

596
00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.470
I have your hand to show:

597
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:47.400
If the skin were parchment,

598
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.370
and the blows you gave were ink,

599
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:51.700
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.

600
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:53.270
I think thou art an ass.

601
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.370
Marry, so it doth appear

602
00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.670
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.

603
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.200
I should kick, being kick'd;

604
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.530
and, being at that pass,

605
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:04.870
You would keep from my heels

606
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.770
and beware of an ass.

607
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:09.370
You're sad, Signior Balthazar:

608
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.470
pray God our cheer

609
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:12.430
May answer my good will

610
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:14.130
and your good welcome here.

611
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.470
I hold your dainties cheap, sir,

612
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.170
and your welcome dear.

613
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:21.570
O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,

614
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.600
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

615
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.830
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.

616
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:30.400
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

617
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.200
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

618
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.630
Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:

619
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.370
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;

620
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.330
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.

621
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.430
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

622
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:57.270
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

623
00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:01.130
Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,

624
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.330
idiot, patch!

625
00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.630
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.

626
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.500
Dost thou conjure for wenches,

627
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.400
that thou call'st for such store,

628
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.470
When one is one too many?

629
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:11.870
Go, get thee from the door.

630
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:13.400
What patch is made our porter?

631
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.100
My master stays in the street.

632
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:16.370
Let him walk from whence he came,

633
00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:19.070
lest he catch cold on's feet.

634
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.130
Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

635
00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:25.270
Right, sir; I'll tell you when,

636
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:26.830
an you tell me wherefore.

637
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.200
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

638
00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.330
Nor to-day here you must not;

639
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.730
come again when you may.

640
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.200
What art thou that keepest me out

641
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.230
from the house I owe?

642
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.370
The porter for this time, sir, and my name is Dromio.

643
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.430
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office

644
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.870
and my name.

645
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.330
The one ne'er got me credit,

646
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.030
the other mickle blame.

647
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.230
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,

648
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:57.930
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name

649
00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.430
or thy name for an ass.

650
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.370
What a coil is there, Dromio?

651
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.000
who are those at the gate?

652
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.630
Let my master in, Luce.

653
00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:08.830
Faith, no; he comes too late;

654
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:11.370
And so tell your master.

655
00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.970
O Lord, I must laugh!

656
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.030
Have at you with a proverb--

657
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:18.570
Shall I set in my staff?

658
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.300
Have at you with another; that's--

659
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.500
When? can you tell?

660
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.370
If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce,

661
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:29.070
thou hast answered him well.

662
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.800
Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?

663
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.730
I thought to have asked you.

664
00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.930
And you said no.

665
00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.100
So, come, help: well struck!

666
00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.670
there was blow for blow.

667
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:41.700
Thou baggage, let me in.

668
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.430
Can you tell for whose sake?

669
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:46.270
Master, knock the door hard.

670
00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:48.770
Let him knock till it ache.

671
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.000
You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

672
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.200
What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

673
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.370
Who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?

674
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:20.100
By my troth, your town is troubled

675
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.430
with unruly boys.

676
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:24.530
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

677
00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:28.570
Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.

678
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:33.670
If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

679
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:35.900
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome:

680
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:36.930
we would fain have either.

681
00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:38.230
In debating which was best,

682
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.300
we shall part with neither.

683
00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.730
They stand at the door, master;

684
00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.700
bid them welcome hither.

685
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.470
There is something in the wind,

686
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.270
that we cannot get in.

687
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.200
You would say so, master,

688
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.230
if your garments were thin.

689
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:56.100
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

690
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.700
Break any breaking here,

691
00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:59.070
and I'll break your knave's pate.

692
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.630
A man may break a word with you, sir,

693
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.200
and words are but wind,

694
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:05.970
Ay, and break it in your face,

695
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:07.930
so he break it not behind.

696
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.370
It seems thou want'st breaking:

697
00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.070
out upon thee, hind!

698
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:17.730
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

699
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.230
Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!

700
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.470
Herein you war against your reputation

701
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.000
And draw within the compass of suspect

702
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
The unviolated honour of your wife.

703
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.270
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,

704
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:36.530
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,

705
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:39.930
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:

706
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:43.270
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse

707
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:46.730
Why at this time the doors are made against you.

708
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:50.400
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,

709
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.470
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,

710
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:57.470
And about evening come yourself alone

711
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:00.330
To know the reason of this strange restraint.

712
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.370
If by strong hand you offer to break in

713
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:07.230
Now in the stirring passage of the day,

714
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.270
A vulgar comment will be made of it,

715
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.300
And that supposed by the common rout

716
00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.870
Against your yet ungalled estimation

717
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:17.900
That may with foul intrusion enter in

718
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.170
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;

719
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:24.400
For slander lives upon succession,

720
00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:27.530
For ever housed where it gets possession.

721
00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:38.670
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,

722
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:42.300
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.

723
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.200
I know a wench of excellent discourse,

724
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.500
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:

725
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.270
To her will we to dinner.

726
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.200
Get you home

727
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.600
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:

728
00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.870
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;

729
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.930
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--

730
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:04.670
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--

731
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:07.870
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.

732
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.800
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,

733
00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:13.630
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

734
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.570
I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.

735
00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:20.000
Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

736
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.070
And may it be that you have quite forgot

737
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:55.170
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.

738
00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:59.630
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?

739
00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:05.030
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?

740
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.870
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,

741
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:13.270
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:

742
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:22.800
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;

743
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:28.100
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:

744
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:31.030
Let not my sister read it in your eye;

745
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:35.900
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;

746
00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:42.830
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;

747
00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:46.770
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;

748
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:50.200
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;

749
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:55.270
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;

750
00:45:55.270 --> 00:46:02.870
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?

751
00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:09.730
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?

752
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:13.300
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed

753
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.730
And let her read it in thy looks at board:

754
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:23.330
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;

755
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:26.430
Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.

756
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:34.470
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,

757
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:38.230
Being compact of credit, that you love us;

758
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:42.030
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;

759
00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.700
We in your motion turn and you may move us.

760
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;

761
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.230
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:

762
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:00.970
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,

763
00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:04.330
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.

764
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:15.730
Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,

765
00:47:15.730 --> 00:47:17.770
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--

766
00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:20.700
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not

767
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:24.500
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.

768
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.500
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;

769
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.400
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,

770
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.930
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,

771
00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.130
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.

772
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.970
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you

773
00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:41.200
To make it wander in an unknown field?

774
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.500
Are you a god? would you create me new?

775
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.870
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.

776
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:48.330
But if that I am I, then well I know

777
00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.570
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,

778
00:47:51.570 --> 00:47:54.230
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe

779
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:58.430
Far more, far more to you do I decline.

780
00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.570
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,

781
00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:06.030
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:

782
00:48:06.030 --> 00:48:10.030
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:

783
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:13.270
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,

784
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.400
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,

785
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:17.970
And in that glorious supposition think

786
00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.630
He gains by death that hath such means to die:

787
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.970
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

788
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.700
What, are you mad, that you do reason so?

789
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.800
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

790
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.570
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.

791
00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:40.400
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.

792
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.730
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.

793
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.630
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.

794
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:48.170
Why call you me love? call my sister so.

795
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:50.330
Thy sister's sister.

796
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:51.830
That's my sister.

797
00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:55.630
No; It is thyself, mine own self's better part,

798
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.470
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,

799
00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:02.900
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,

800
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:07.170
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.

801
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.000
All this my sister is, or else should be.

802
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.430
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.

803
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.330
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:

804
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.800
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.

805
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:21.200
Give me thy hand.

806
00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.800
O, soft, air! hold you still:

807
00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:29.830
I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.

808
00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.830
Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?

809
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:46.400
Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?

810
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.570
am I myself?

811
00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:50.830
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.

812
00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:59.630
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.

813
00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:02.300
What woman's man? and how besides thyself?

814
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.970
Marry, sir, besides myself,

815
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.200
I am due to a woman;

816
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.070
one that claims me, one that haunts me,

817
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.630
one that will have me.

818
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.430
What claim lays she to thee?

819
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.130
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay

820
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:18.000
to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that,

821
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.400
I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,

822
00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.370
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.

823
00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:24.700
What is she?

824
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:29.270
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man

825
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.400
may not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.'

826
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.000
I have but lean luck in the match,

827
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.870
and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage.

828
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.830
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

829
00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:41.330
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;

830
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:42.970
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp

831
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.170
of her and run from her by her own light.

832
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:47.430
I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them

833
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.070
will burn a Poland winter:

834
00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:57.170
if she lives till doomsday,

835
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.970
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.

836
00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:01.200
What complexion is she of?

837
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:05.630
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing

838
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.130
half so clean kept: for why, she sweats;

839
00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:10.130
a man may go over shoes in the grime of it.

840
00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:15.170
That's a fault that water will mend.

841
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:19.830
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.

842
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:20.830
What's her name?

843
00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:23.800
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters,

844
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.600
that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure her

845
00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:29.000
from hip to hip.

846
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:32.770
she is spherical, like a globe;

847
00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.170
I could find out countries in her.

848
00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:38.430
In what part of her body stands Ireland?

849
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:42.600
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.

850
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.270
Where Scotland?

851
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.570
I found it by the barrenness;

852
00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:47.100
hard in the palm of the hand.

853
00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.870
Where France?

854
00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.300
In her forehead; armed and reverted,

855
00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:52.970
making war against her heir.

856
00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:55.130
Where England?

857
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:56.400
I looked for the chalky cliffs,

858
00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.400
but I could find no whiteness in them;

859
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.130
but I guess it stood in her chin,

860
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.230
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.

861
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:04.870
Where Spain?

862
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:09.070
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.

863
00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:13.630
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

864
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:16.400
Oh, sir, I did not look so low.

865
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:28.170
To conclude, this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me,

866
00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:31.600
call'd me Dromio; swore I was assured to her;

867
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:33.570
told me what privy marks I had about me,

868
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:36.800
as, the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck,

869
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.570
the great wart on my left arm,

870
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:42.000
that I amazed ran from her as a witch:

871
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.700
And, I think, if my breast had not been made

872
00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.000
of faith and my heart of steel,

873
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.700
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog

874
00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:48.830
and made me turn i' the wheel.

875
00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:54.770
Go hie thee presently, post to the road:

876
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:56.370
An if the wind blow any way from shore,

877
00:52:56.370 --> 00:52:58.330
I will not harbour in this town to-night:

878
00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.230
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,

879
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.430
Where I will walk till thou return to me.

880
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:04.800
If every one knows us and we know none,

881
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:07.870
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

882
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.900
As from a bear a man would run for life,

883
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:13.130
So fly I from her that would be my wife.

884
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.500
There's none but witches do inhabit here;

885
00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.900
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.

886
00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:42.330
She that doth call me husband,

887
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:44.770
even my soul Doth for a wife abhor.

888
00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.470
But her fair sister,

889
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.300
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,

890
00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.770
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,

891
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.200
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:

892
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.770
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,

893
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:59.470
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

894
00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:01.930
Master Antipholus,--

895
00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.400
Ay, that's my name.

896
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.500
I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.

897
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:13.000
I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:

898
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.130
The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.

899
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:22.270
What is your will that I shall do with this?

900
00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.500
What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.

901
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:29.270
Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

902
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:33.270
Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.

903
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.400
Go home with it and please your wife withal;

904
00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.400
And soon at supper-time I'll visit you

905
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.670
And then receive my money for the chain.

906
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.400
I pray you, sir, receive the money now,

907
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:48.530
For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

908
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.670
You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.

909
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:58.630
What I should think of this, I cannot tell:

910
00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.470
But this I think, there's no man is so vain

911
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:05.870
That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.

912
00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.530
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,

913
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:12.030
When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.

914
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.270
I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay

915
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:19.870
If any ship put out, then straight away.

916
00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:48.900
You know since Pentecost the sum is due,

917
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.900
And since I have not much importuned you;

918
00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.900
Nor now I had not, but that I am bound

919
00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:56.130
To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:

920
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:57.770
Therefore make present satisfaction,

921
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:59.830
Or I'll attach you by this officer.

922
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.570
Even just the sum that I do owe to you

923
00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.570
Is growing to me by Antipholus,

924
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:07.100
And in the instant that I met with you

925
00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.770
He had of me a chain: at five o'clock

926
00:56:09.770 --> 00:56:12.230
I shall receive the money for the same.

927
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:14.730
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,

928
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.970
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.

929
00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.570
That labour may you save: see where he comes.

930
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:26.330
While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou

931
00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:29.170
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow

932
00:56:29.170 --> 00:56:30.800
Among my wife and her confederates,

933
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.070
For locking me out of my doors by day.

934
00:56:33.070 --> 00:56:35.800
But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;

935
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.600
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.

936
00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:45.700
I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.

937
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:48.800
A man is well holp up that trusts to you:

938
00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.700
I promised your presence and the chain;

939
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:52.800
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.

940
00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.130
Belike you thought our love would last too long,

941
00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:56.670
If it were chain'd together,

942
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:58.130
and therefore came not.

943
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:04.230
Saving your merry humour, here's the note

944
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:07.100
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,

945
00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.570
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.

946
00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:12.170
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more

947
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:14.470
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:

948
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:16.070
I pray you, see him presently discharged,

949
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:18.430
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.

950
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.100
I am not furnish'd with the present money;

951
00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:22.000
Besides, I have some business in the town.

952
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.300
Good signior, take the stranger to my house

953
00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.930
And with you take the chain and bid my wife

954
00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.000
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:

955
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.900
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

956
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.930
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?

957
00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:37.000
No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.

958
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.100
Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?

959
00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.000
An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;

960
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.800
Or else you may return without your money.

961
00:57:49.830 --> 00:57:52.200
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:

962
00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.370
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,

963
00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.930
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.

964
00:57:56.930 --> 00:58:00.330
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse

965
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:02.670
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.

966
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:04.500
I should have chid you for not bringing it,

967
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:06.830
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.

968
00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:10.470
The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.

969
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:13.500
You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!

970
00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:16.330
Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.

971
00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:20.870
Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.

972
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:23.830
Either send the chain or send me by some token.

973
00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:25.200
Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,

974
00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:27.370
Come, where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.

975
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.330
My business cannot brook this dalliance.

976
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:31.430
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:

977
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:33.330
If not, I'll leave him to the officer.

978
00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:36.400
I answer you! what should I answer you?

979
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.370
The money that you owe me for the chain.

980
00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:41.600
I owe you none till I receive the chain.

981
00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.800
You know I gave it you half an hour since.

982
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.000
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.

983
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.470
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:

984
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:51.370
Consider how it stands upon my credit.

985
00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:53.670
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

986
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:58.030
I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.

987
00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:01.070
This touches me in reputation.

988
00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:02.870
Either consent to pay this sum for me

989
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:05.400
Or I attach you by this officer.

990
00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:07.970
Consent to pay thee that I never had!

991
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:11.370
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.

992
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:15.030
Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,

993
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:16.800
I would not spare my brother in this case,

994
00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.670
If he should scorn me so apparently.

995
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:22.400
I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.

996
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.370
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.

997
00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:26.600
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear

998
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.630
As all the metal in your shop will answer.

999
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:30.230
Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,

1000
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.470
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.

1001
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.330
Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum

1002
00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:50.500
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,

1003
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:55.100
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,

1004
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:56.430
I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought

1005
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.830
The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.

1006
00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:01.130
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind

1007
01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.700
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all

1008
01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:06.130
But for their owner, master, and yourself.

1009
01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:10.270
How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,

1010
01:00:10.270 --> 01:00:12.970
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

1011
01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:15.430
A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.

1012
01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:18.430
Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;

1013
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.770
And told thee to what purpose and what end.

1014
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.930
You sent me for a rope's end as soon:

1015
01:00:25.930 --> 01:00:28.830
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.

1016
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:34.130
I will debate this matter at more leisure

1017
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:37.000
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.

1018
01:00:38.970 --> 01:00:42.070
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:

1019
01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:44.730
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk

1020
01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.070
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,

1021
01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:50.170
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:

1022
01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:52.430
Tell her I am arrested in the street

1023
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:56.230
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!

1024
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:58.870
On, officer, to prison till it come.

1025
01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:08.300
To Adriana! that is where we dined,

1026
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:12.000
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:

1027
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.170
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.

1028
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:17.030
Thither I must, although against my will,

1029
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:19.700
For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

1030
01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:29.130
Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?

1031
01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye

1032
01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.070
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?

1033
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:42.270
Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?

1034
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:45.230
What observation madest thou in this case

1035
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:48.230
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

1036
01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:52.370
First he denied you had in him no right.

1037
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.530
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

1038
01:01:55.530 --> 01:01:58.400
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

1039
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.270
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

1040
01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:03.170
Then pleaded I for you.

1041
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:04.430
And what said he?

1042
01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:08.130
That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

1043
01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.200
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

1044
01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.100
With words that in an honest suit might move.

1045
01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.400
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

1046
01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.600
Didst speak him fair?

1047
01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.400
Have patience, I beseech.

1048
01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.900
I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;

1049
01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.700
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.

1050
01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:31.970
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,

1051
01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:37.230
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;

1052
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:42.270
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;

1053
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.600
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

1054
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.530
Who would be jealous then of such a one?

1055
01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:53.530
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

1056
01:02:54.130 --> 01:02:57.800
Ah, but I think him better than I say,

1057
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:02.200
And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.

1058
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:08.830
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:

1059
01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:14.970
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

1060
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:30.100
Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.

1061
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.030
How hast thou lost thy breath?

1062
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:33.130
By running fast.

1063
01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:36.270
Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?

1064
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:39.100
No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.

1065
01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.170
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;

1066
01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:44.370
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;

1067
01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:47.630
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;

1068
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:51.230
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;

1069
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:53.800
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper,

1070
01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.800
one that countermands

1071
01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.100
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;

1072
01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:03.400
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;

1073
01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.430
One that before the judgement

1074
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:07.100
carries poor souls to hell.

1075
01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.170
Why, man, what is the matter?

1076
01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:12.330
I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.

1077
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:15.970
What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

1078
01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:18.570
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;

1079
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:20.870
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him,

1080
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:22.530
that can I tell.

1081
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.600
Will you send him, mistress, redemption,

1082
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.070
the money in his desk?

1083
01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:27.900
Go fetch it, sister.

1084
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.200
This I wonder at,

1085
01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:31.630
That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.

1086
01:04:32.270 --> 01:04:36.030
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

1087
01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:37.930
Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;

1088
01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:41.670
A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?

1089
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.170
What, the chain?

1090
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:46.200
No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:

1091
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.470
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.

1092
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:50.930
The hours come back! that did I never hear.

1093
01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:52.770
O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant,

1094
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:54.630
a' turns back for very fear.

1095
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:57.570
As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!

1096
01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.730
Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more

1097
01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:05.200
than he's worth, to season.

1098
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.930
Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say

1099
01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:14.900
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?

1100
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:17.300
If Time be in debt and theft,

1101
01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.470
and a sergeant in the way,

1102
01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:23.700
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

1103
01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:28.170
Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;

1104
01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:29.970
And bring thy master home immediately.

1105
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:37.670
Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--

1106
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:42.570
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

1107
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.600
There's not a man I meet but doth salute me

1108
01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.430
As if I were their well-acquainted friend;

1109
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:27.370
And every one doth call me by my name.

1110
01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:29.230
Some tender money to me; some invite me;

1111
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:30.630
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;

1112
01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.800
Some offer me commodities to buy:

1113
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.270
Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop

1114
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.600
And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,

1115
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.700
And therewithal took measure of my body.

1116
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.400
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles

1117
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.900
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

1118
01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:49.230
Master, here's the gold you sent me for.

1119
01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:53.000
What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?

1120
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.900
What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?

1121
01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.100
Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam

1122
01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:01.630
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's skin

1123
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:03.100
that was killed for the Prodigal; he that

1124
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.400
came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you

1125
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.130
forsake your liberty.

1126
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:10.100
I understand thee not.

1127
01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.630
No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went,

1128
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:15.870
like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,

1129
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:17.830
that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob

1130
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:20.430
and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity

1131
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:23.200
on decayed men and gives them suits of durance;

1132
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:25.900
he that sets up his rest

1133
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.630
to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.

1134
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:30.100
What, thou meanest an officer?

1135
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.930
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band,

1136
01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:33.300
he that brings any man to answer

1137
01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.530
it that breaks his band;

1138
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:36.430
one that thinks a man always going to bed, and says,

1139
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:38.170
'God give you good rest!'

1140
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:39.730
Well, sir, there rest in your foolery.

1141
01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:43.100
Is there any ship puts forth tonight? May we be gone?

1142
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:48.670
Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since

1143
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:51.300
that the bark Expedition put forth to-night;

1144
01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.970
and then were you hindered by the sergeant,

1145
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:55.200
to tarry for the hoy delay.

1146
01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.300
Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you.

1147
01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:59.130
The fellow is distract, and so am I;

1148
01:07:59.130 --> 01:08:00.800
And here we wander in illusions:

1149
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.300
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

1150
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:09.100
Master Antipholus. Well met, well met.

1151
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:15.270
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:

1152
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:18.730
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?

1153
01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.170
Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.

1154
01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:27.370
Master, is this Mistress Satan?

1155
01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:28.900
It is the devil.

1156
01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:31.700
Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam;

1157
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:33.900
and here she comes in the habit of a light wench:

1158
01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:36.530
and thereof comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;'

1159
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:39.430
that's as much to say 'God make me a light wench.'

1160
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:44.930
It is written, they appear to men like angels of light:

1161
01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:49.330
light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;

1162
01:08:49.330 --> 01:08:54.100
ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.

1163
01:08:55.930 --> 01:08:58.030
Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.

1164
01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.170
Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?

1165
01:09:04.230 --> 01:09:06.500
Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat;

1166
01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.070
or bespeak a long spoon.

1167
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:10.470
Why, Dromio?

1168
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:11.430
Marry, he must have a long spoon

1169
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:12.800
that must eat with the devil.

1170
01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.970
Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?

1171
01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:16.630
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:

1172
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.670
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

1173
01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:21.600
Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,

1174
01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.130
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,

1175
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:28.400
And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

1176
01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:31.730
Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,

1177
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:34.600
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,

1178
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.570
A nut, a cherry-stone;

1179
01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:41.000
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.

1180
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.470
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,

1181
01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.400
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.

1182
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:52.330
I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:

1183
01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:54.830
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.

1184
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:59.500
Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.

1185
01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.930
'Fly pride,' says the peacock:

1186
01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:08.130
mistress, that you know.

1187
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.400
Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,

1188
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.700
Else would he never so demean himself.

1189
01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:26.900
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,

1190
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.070
And for the same he promised me a chain:

1191
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:33.770
Both one and other he denies me now.

1192
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.400
The reason that I gather he is mad,

1193
01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.530
Besides this present instance of his rage,

1194
01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:42.270
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,

1195
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:46.400
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.

1196
01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,

1197
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.000
On purpose shut the doors against his way.

1198
01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:55.730
My way is now to hie home to his house,

1199
01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:58.470
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,

1200
01:10:58.470 --> 01:11:00.930
He rush'd into my house and took perforce

1201
01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:04.770
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;

1202
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:06.930
For forty ducats is too much to lose.

1203
01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:24.200
Fear me not, man; I will not break away:

1204
01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.630
I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,

1205
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:28.400
To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.

1206
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:31.130
My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,

1207
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:32.970
And will not lightly trust the messenger

1208
01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:34.970
That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,

1209
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:38.230
I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.

1210
01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:41.400
Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.

1211
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.630
How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?

1212
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:46.570
Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.

1213
01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:48.630
But where's the money?

1214
01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:51.530
Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.

1215
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:54.670
Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

1216
01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:57.670
I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.

1217
01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:01.370
To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?

1218
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:04.330
To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.

1219
01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:07.370
And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

1220
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.130
Good sir, be patient.

1221
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:13.730
Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.

1222
01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:14.930
Good, now, hold thy tongue.

1223
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:17.200
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.

1224
01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:20.500
Thou whoreson, senseless villain!

1225
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.070
I would I were senseless, sir,

1226
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:25.100
that I might not feel your blows.

1227
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:27.600
Thou art sensible in nothing but blows,

1228
01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.170
and so is an ass.

1229
01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.270
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long ears.

1230
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:38.130
I have served him from the hour of my nativity

1231
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:39.630
to this instant, and have nothing

1232
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:42.030
at his hands for my service but blows.

1233
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:44.130
When I am cold, he heats me with beating;

1234
01:12:44.130 --> 01:12:46.570
when I am warm, he cools me with beating;

1235
01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:48.270
I am waked with it when I sleep;

1236
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:50.770
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors

1237
01:12:50.770 --> 01:12:54.330
with it when I go from home; welcomed home with it

1238
01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:57.470
when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders,

1239
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:59.170
as a beggar wont her brat;

1240
01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:00.830
and, I think when he hath lamed me,

1241
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:03.000
I shall beg with it from door to door.

1242
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.270
Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.

1243
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:10.400
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end;

1244
01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.230
or rather, the prophecy like the parrot,

1245
01:13:12.230 --> 01:13:13.470
'beware the rope's-end.'

1246
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:15.470
Wilt thou still talk?

1247
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:17.700
How say you now? is not your husband mad?

1248
01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.570
His incivility confirms no less.

1249
01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.970
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;

1250
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:24.600
Establish him in his true sense again,

1251
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.070
And I will please you what you will demand.

1252
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:30.230
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!

1253
01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:32.830
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!

1254
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:45.730
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.

1255
01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:50.570
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

1256
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:53.700
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,

1257
01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.930
To yield possession to my holy prayers

1258
01:13:56.930 --> 01:14:00.500
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:

1259
01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:03.370
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!

1260
01:14:03.370 --> 01:14:07.270
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.

1261
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:11.070
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!

1262
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:15.000
You minion, you, are these your customers?

1263
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.400
Did this companion with the saffron face

1264
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.470
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,

1265
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.400
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut

1266
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.530
And I denied to enter in my house?

1267
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:27.930
O husband, God doth know you dined at home;

1268
01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.730
Where would you had remain'd until this time,

1269
01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:33.730
Free from these slanders and this open shame!

1270
01:14:33.730 --> 01:14:35.300
Dined at home!

1271
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:46.170
Thou villain, what sayest thou?

1272
01:14:46.170 --> 01:14:51.530
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.

1273
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:54.930
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?

1274
01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:58.030
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.

1275
01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:01.470
And did not she herself revile me there?

1276
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:04.300
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.

1277
01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:08.130
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?

1278
01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:10.770
Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.

1279
01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:14.370
And did not I in rage depart from thence?

1280
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:17.370
In verity you did; my bones bear witness,

1281
01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:20.970
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.

1282
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:29.130
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?

1283
01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:32.500
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,

1284
01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.700
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.

1285
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:42.370
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

1286
01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:48.100
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,

1287
01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.900
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

1288
01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:56.170
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;

1289
01:15:56.170 --> 01:15:58.870
But surely master, not a rag of money.

1290
01:15:58.870 --> 01:16:02.500
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?

1291
01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.630
He came to me and I deliver'd it.

1292
01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:08.630
And I am witness with her that she did.

1293
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.170
God and the rope-maker bear me witness

1294
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:14.970
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

1295
01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:22.030
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;

1296
01:16:22.030 --> 01:16:26.430
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:

1297
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:30.800
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.

1298
01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.830
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?

1299
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:37.170
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

1300
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:41.130
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

1301
01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:46.200
And, gentle master, I received no gold;

1302
01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.370
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.

1303
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.830
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.

1304
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:53.470
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;

1305
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:55.570
And art confederate with a damned pack

1306
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.600
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:

1307
01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.300
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes

1308
01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:04.970
That would behold in me this shameful sport.

1309
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:08.100
O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

1310
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.070
More company! The fiend is strong within him.

1311
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:15.130
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!

1312
01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.670
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,

1313
01:17:17.670 --> 01:17:19.470
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them

1314
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:20.530
To make a rescue?

1315
01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:21.670
Masters, let him go

1316
01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:24.030
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.

1317
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:28.970
Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.

1318
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:32.370
What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?

1319
01:17:32.370 --> 01:17:33.900
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man

1320
01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:35.670
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

1321
01:17:35.670 --> 01:17:37.730
He is my prisoner: if I let him go,

1322
01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:39.900
The debt he owes will be required of me.

1323
01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.630
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:

1324
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:44.130
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,

1325
01:17:44.130 --> 01:17:46.400
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.

1326
01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.870
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd

1327
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:55.270
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

1328
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:58.770
O most unhappy strumpet!

1329
01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:01.700
Master, I am here entered in bond for you.

1330
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:06.570
Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?

1331
01:18:06.570 --> 01:18:08.700
Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:

1332
01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:09.700
cry 'The devil!'

1333
01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.430
God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!

1334
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:16.370
Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.

1335
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:32.970
Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

1336
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:35.930
One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?

1337
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.600
I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

1338
01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.030
Two hundred ducats.

1339
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:40.530
Say, how grows it due?

1340
01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:43.230
Due for a chain your husband had of him.

1341
01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:46.300
He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

1342
01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.870
When as your husband all in rage to-day

1343
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:51.530
Came to my house and took away my ring--

1344
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:54.170
The ring I saw upon his finger now--

1345
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:56.930
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.

1346
01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:00.500
It may be so, but I did never see it.

1347
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.400
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:

1348
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:04.630
I long to know the truth hereof at large.

1349
01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:09.430
God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

1350
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:10.500
And come with naked swords.

1351
01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.230
Let's call more help to have them bound again.

1352
01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:14.030
Away! they'll kill us.

1353
01:19:16.270 --> 01:19:18.730
I see these witches are afraid of swords.

1354
01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:21.270
She that would be your wife now ran from you.

1355
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:24.070
Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:

1356
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:27.030
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

1357
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:29.500
Faith, stay here this night;

1358
01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.570
they will surely do us no harm:

1359
01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:35.700
you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:

1360
01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:38.830
methinks they are such a gentle nation that,

1361
01:19:38.830 --> 01:19:40.230
but for the mountain of mad flesh

1362
01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:41.570
that claims marriage of me,

1363
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:43.070
I could find in my heart

1364
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:45.000
to stay here still and turn witch.

1365
01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.070
I will not stay to-night for all the town;

1366
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:49.270
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

1367
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:12.630
I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;

1368
01:20:12.630 --> 01:20:14.400
But, I protest, he had the chain of me,

1369
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.100
Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

1370
01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.000
How is the man esteemed here in the city?

1371
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.170
Of very reverend reputation, sir,

1372
01:20:21.170 --> 01:20:23.900
Of credit infinite, highly beloved,

1373
01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.900
Second to none that lives here in the city:

1374
01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:27.970
His word might bear my wealth at any time.

1375
01:20:27.970 --> 01:20:31.770
Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.

1376
01:20:31.770 --> 01:20:34.970
'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck

1377
01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:37.070
Which he forswore most monstrously to have.

1378
01:20:37.070 --> 01:20:39.000
Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.

1379
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:45.470
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much

1380
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:47.970
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;

1381
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:50.470
And, not without some scandal to yourself,

1382
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:52.070
With circumstance and oaths so to deny

1383
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:55.200
This chain which now you wear so openly:

1384
01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:57.100
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,

1385
01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.300
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,

1386
01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:01.200
Who, but for staying on our controversy,

1387
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.900
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:

1388
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:05.930
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?

1389
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:07.700
I think I had; I never did deny it.

1390
01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:10.130
Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

1391
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:11.700
Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

1392
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.770
These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.

1393
01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:15.930
Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest

1394
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:17.800
To walk where any honest man resort.

1395
01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.500
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:

1396
01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.330
I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty

1397
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:25.930
Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

1398
01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:28.670
I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

1399
01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:35.400
Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.

1400
01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:37.870
Some get within him, take his sword away:

1401
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:39.870
Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

1402
01:21:39.870 --> 01:21:41.870
Run, master, run;

1403
01:21:57.230 --> 01:21:58.970
for God's sake, take a house!

1404
01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:01.170
This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!

1405
01:22:24.430 --> 01:22:30.970
Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

1406
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:37.600
To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.

1407
01:22:38.630 --> 01:22:40.670
Let us come in, that we may bind him fast

1408
01:22:40.670 --> 01:22:42.600
And bear him home for his recovery.

1409
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.700
I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

1410
01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.670
I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

1411
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.870
How long hath this possession held the man?

1412
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:56.300
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,

1413
01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:58.930
And much different from the man he was;

1414
01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:00.300
But till this afternoon his passion

1415
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:02.430
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

1416
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:07.030
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?

1417
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:09.630
Buried some dear friend?

1418
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:11.300
Hath not else his eye

1419
01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.370
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?

1420
01:23:14.370 --> 01:23:17.330
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,

1421
01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:20.370
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.

1422
01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:23.500
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

1423
01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.470
To none of these, except it be the last;

1424
01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:30.000
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

1425
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.830
You should for that have reprehended him.

1426
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:32.700
Why, so I did.

1427
01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:34.370
Ay, but not rough enough.

1428
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:36.530
As roughly as my modesty would let me.

1429
01:23:36.530 --> 01:23:38.200
Haply, in private.

1430
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.430
And in assemblies too.

1431
01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:41.900
Ay, but not enough.

1432
01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:44.230
It was the copy of our conference:

1433
01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:46.200
In bed he slept not for my urging it;

1434
01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.700
At board he fed not for my urging it;

1435
01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.330
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;

1436
01:23:50.330 --> 01:23:52.070
In company I often glanced it;

1437
01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:54.270
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

1438
01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:56.870
And thereof came it that the man was mad.

1439
01:23:58.270 --> 01:24:00.770
The venom clamours of a jealous woman

1440
01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:03.600
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.

1441
01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:08.430
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,

1442
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:12.670
And therefore comes it that his head is light.

1443
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:19.430
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:

1444
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:22.130
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;

1445
01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:24.870
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;

1446
01:24:24.870 --> 01:24:28.230
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?

1447
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:34.330
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:

1448
01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:39.170
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue

1449
01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:42.030
But moody and dull melancholy,

1450
01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:44.770
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,

1451
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:47.570
And at her heels a huge infectious troop

1452
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:51.000
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?

1453
01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:56.170
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest

1454
01:24:56.170 --> 01:25:00.930
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:

1455
01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:06.130
The consequence is then thy jealous fits

1456
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:09.300
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

1457
01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.370
She never reprehended him but mildly,

1458
01:25:12.370 --> 01:25:17.870
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.

1459
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:20.300
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

1460
01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.170
She did betray me to my own reproof.

1461
01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:26.800
Good people enter and lay hold on him.

1462
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:31.370
No, not a creature enters in my house.

1463
01:25:31.370 --> 01:25:34.230
Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

1464
01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:38.200
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,

1465
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.970
And it shall privilege him from your hands

1466
01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:43.030
Till I have brought him to his wits again,

1467
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:44.900
Or lose my labour in assaying it.

1468
01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:48.800
I will attend my husband, be his nurse,

1469
01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:51.400
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,

1470
01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.930
And will have no attorney but myself;

1471
01:25:52.930 --> 01:25:55.100
And therefore let me have him home with me.

1472
01:25:55.100 --> 01:26:00.530
Be patient; for I will not let him stir

1473
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:03.270
Till I have used the approved means I have,

1474
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:07.470
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,

1475
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:09.400
To make of him a formal man again:

1476
01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:13.230
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,

1477
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:16.530
A charitable duty of my order.

1478
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:20.870
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.

1479
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:24.070
I will not hence and leave my husband here:

1480
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:25.730
And ill it doth beseem your holiness

1481
01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.500
To separate the husband and the wife.

1482
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:34.330
Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.

1483
01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:43.000
Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

1484
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:49.770
Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet

1485
01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:51.400
And never rise until my tears and prayers

1486
01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.300
Have won his grace to come in person hither

1487
01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:58.530
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

1488
01:26:58.530 --> 01:27:00.900
By this, I think, the dial points at five:

1489
01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:04.430
Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person

1490
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:06.970
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,

1491
01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:09.430
The place of death and sorry execution,

1492
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:11.330
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

1493
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:12.270
Upon what cause?

1494
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:14.130
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,

1495
01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:16.130
Who put unluckily into this bay

1496
01:27:16.130 --> 01:27:18.500
Against the laws and statutes of this town,

1497
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:20.630
Beheaded publicly for his offence.

1498
01:27:22.730 --> 01:27:25.900
See where they come: we will behold his death.

1499
01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:29.170
Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.

1500
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:58.830
Yet once again proclaim it publicly,

1501
01:27:58.830 --> 01:28:01.870
If any friend will pay the sum for him,

1502
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:05.500
He shall not die; so much we tender him.

1503
01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:17.370
Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

1504
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:22.670
The abbess?

1505
01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:24.770
She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:

1506
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:26.370
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

1507
01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:30.770
May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,

1508
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:32.530
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,

1509
01:28:32.530 --> 01:28:36.500
At your important letters,--this ill day

1510
01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.600
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;

1511
01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.870
That desperately he hurried through the street,

1512
01:28:41.870 --> 01:28:43.900
With him his bondman, all as mad as he--

1513
01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:45.300
Doing displeasure to the citizens

1514
01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:47.630
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence

1515
01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:50.900
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.

1516
01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:54.970
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,

1517
01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:57.300
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,

1518
01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.670
He broke from those that had the guard of him;

1519
01:28:59.670 --> 01:29:02.000
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,

1520
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.030
We came again to bind them. Then they fled

1521
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:07.530
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:

1522
01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:10.500
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us

1523
01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.800
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,

1524
01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:16.600
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command

1525
01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.100
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

1526
01:29:20.270 --> 01:29:24.030
Long since thy husband served me in my wars,

1527
01:29:24.030 --> 01:29:26.800
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,

1528
01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.830
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,

1529
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:33.070
To do him all the grace and good I could.

1530
01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:38.530
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate

1531
01:29:38.530 --> 01:29:40.730
And bid the lady abbess come to me.

1532
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:50.970
I will determine this before I stir.

1533
01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:57.970
O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!

1534
01:29:57.970 --> 01:30:00.900
My master and his man are both broke loose,

1535
01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:04.470
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor

1536
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:07.700
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;

1537
01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:09.600
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him

1538
01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.930
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:

1539
01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:15.530
My master preaches patience to him

1540
01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:19.530
and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool,

1541
01:30:19.530 --> 01:30:21.670
And sure, unless you send some present help,

1542
01:30:21.670 --> 01:30:24.630
Between them they will kill the conjurer.

1543
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:29.900
Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,

1544
01:30:29.900 --> 01:30:32.300
And that is false thou dost report to us.

1545
01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:34.370
Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;

1546
01:30:34.370 --> 01:30:38.030
I have not breathed almost since I did see it.

1547
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:40.830
He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,

1548
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:44.430
To scorch your face and to disfigure you.

1549
01:30:44.430 --> 01:30:48.300
Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!

1550
01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:56.700
Come, stand by me; fear nothing.

1551
01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.600
Guard with halberds!

1552
01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:02.030
Ay me, it is my husband!

1553
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.600
Witness you,

1554
01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.700
That he is borne about invisible:

1555
01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.570
Even now we housed him in the abbey here;

1556
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:15.270
And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

1557
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:19.600
Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!

1558
01:31:20.670 --> 01:31:23.800
Even for the service that long since I did thee,

1559
01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.600
When I bestrid thee in the wars and took

1560
01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:29.530
Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood

1561
01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:32.800
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

1562
01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.070
Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,

1563
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:39.230
I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.

1564
01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:43.300
Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!

1565
01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.370
She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,

1566
01:31:45.370 --> 01:31:47.630
That hath abused and dishonour'd me

1567
01:31:47.630 --> 01:31:50.100
Even in the strength and height of injury!

1568
01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:52.570
Beyond imagination is the wrong

1569
01:31:52.570 --> 01:31:54.930
That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

1570
01:31:54.930 --> 01:31:57.870
Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.

1571
01:31:57.870 --> 01:32:02.800
This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,

1572
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.470
While she with harlots feasted in my house.

1573
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:14.300
A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

1574
01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:18.930
No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister

1575
01:32:18.930 --> 01:32:23.000
To-day did dine together. So befall my soul

1576
01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.400
As this is false he burdens me withal!

1577
01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:27.870
Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,

1578
01:32:27.870 --> 01:32:30.470
But she tells to your highness simple truth!

1579
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:33.530
O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:

1580
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:36.130
In this the madman justly chargeth them.

1581
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:42.500
My liege, I am advised what I say,

1582
01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:44.870
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,

1583
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:48.070
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,

1584
01:32:48.070 --> 01:32:52.730
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:

1585
01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:56.800
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,

1586
01:32:56.800 --> 01:32:59.230
Could witness it, for he was with me then;

1587
01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:02.670
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,

1588
01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:06.070
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,

1589
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:10.330
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.

1590
01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:15.770
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,

1591
01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:19.170
I went to seek him: in the street I met him

1592
01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:21.900
And in his company that gentleman.

1593
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:26.430
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down

1594
01:33:26.430 --> 01:33:29.300
That I this day of him received the chain,

1595
01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:33.130
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which

1596
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:35.770
He did arrest me with an officer.

1597
01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:42.400
I did obey, and sent my peasant home

1598
01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.670
For certain ducats: he with none return'd

1599
01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.730
Then fairly I bespoke the officer

1600
01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:54.530
To go in person with me to my house.

1601
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:55.970
By the way we met

1602
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:58.630
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more

1603
01:33:58.630 --> 01:34:01.230
Of vile confederates. Along with them

1604
01:34:01.230 --> 01:34:06.700
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,

1605
01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:10.230
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,

1606
01:34:10.230 --> 01:34:11.970
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,

1607
01:34:11.970 --> 01:34:14.400
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,

1608
01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:17.900
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together

1609
01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:20.770
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence

1610
01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:23.370
And in a dark and dankish vault at home

1611
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:26.170
There left me and my man, both bound together;

1612
01:34:26.170 --> 01:34:30.600
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,

1613
01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:32.970
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately

1614
01:34:32.970 --> 01:34:35.300
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech

1615
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.500
To give me ample satisfaction

1616
01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:41.430
For these deep shames and great indignities.

1617
01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:49.800
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,

1618
01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:52.770
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.

1619
01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:57.630
But had he such a chain of thee or no?

1620
01:34:57.630 --> 01:35:00.200
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,

1621
01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.270
These people saw the chain about his neck.

1622
01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:05.730
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine

1623
01:35:05.730 --> 01:35:08.430
Heard you confess you had the chain of him

1624
01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:10.730
After you first forswore it on the mart:

1625
01:35:10.730 --> 01:35:12.330
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;

1626
01:35:12.330 --> 01:35:15.030
And then you fled into this abbey here,

1627
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:18.100
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.

1628
01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:20.230
I never came within these abbey-walls,

1629
01:35:20.230 --> 01:35:22.970
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:

1630
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:25.500
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!

1631
01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:27.970
And this is false you burden me withal.

1632
01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:33.930
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!

1633
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:37.670
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.

1634
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:41.270
If here you housed him, here he would have been;

1635
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:45.170
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:

1636
01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:47.870
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here

1637
01:35:47.870 --> 01:35:49.070
Denies that saying.

1638
01:35:52.870 --> 01:35:54.470
Sirrah, what say you?

1639
01:35:59.730 --> 01:36:05.500
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.

1640
01:36:10.230 --> 01:36:14.500
He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.

1641
01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:17.700
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

1642
01:36:20.170 --> 01:36:26.100
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

1643
01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:28.700
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.

1644
01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:35.030
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.

1645
01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:38.400
I think you are all mated or stark mad.

1646
01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:44.900
Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:

1647
01:36:46.730 --> 01:36:50.330
Haply I see a friend will save my life

1648
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:52.930
And pay the sum that may deliver me.

1649
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:57.400
Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

1650
01:36:58.330 --> 01:37:02.170
Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?

1651
01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:04.970
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

1652
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:10.430
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,

1653
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:13.300
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:

1654
01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:15.930
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

1655
01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:18.470
I am sure you both of you remember me.

1656
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:24.100
Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;

1657
01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:27.500
For lately we were bound, as you are now

1658
01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:30.400
You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

1659
01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.970
Why look you strange on me? you know me well.

1660
01:37:33.970 --> 01:37:36.330
I never saw you in my life till now.

1661
01:37:36.330 --> 01:37:40.030
O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,

1662
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:42.670
And careful hours with time's deformed hand

1663
01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:45.800
Have written strange defeatures in my face:

1664
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:49.930
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

1665
01:37:49.930 --> 01:37:51.930
Neither.

1666
01:37:53.070 --> 01:37:54.170
Dromio, nor thou?

1667
01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.000
No, trust me, sir, nor I.

1668
01:37:58.230 --> 01:37:59.700
I am sure thou dost.

1669
01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:03.030
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not;

1670
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:04.400
and whatsoever a man denies,

1671
01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.870
you are now bound to believe him.

1672
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:12.200
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,

1673
01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:14.270
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue

1674
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:16.930
In seven short years, that here my only son

1675
01:38:16.930 --> 01:38:19.970
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?

1676
01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:23.470
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,

1677
01:38:23.470 --> 01:38:26.870
Yet hath my night of life some memory,

1678
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:30.800
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,

1679
01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:36.670
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:

1680
01:38:36.670 --> 01:38:40.300
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--

1681
01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:42.730
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.

1682
01:38:43.970 --> 01:38:46.830
I never saw my father in my life.

1683
01:38:46.830 --> 01:38:49.270
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,

1684
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:54.430
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,

1685
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:57.930
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.

1686
01:38:57.930 --> 01:38:59.570
The duke and all that know me in the city

1687
01:38:59.570 --> 01:39:01.400
Can witness with me that it is not so

1688
01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.530
I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

1689
01:39:03.530 --> 01:39:06.730
I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years

1690
01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:08.600
Have I been patron to Antipholus,

1691
01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:12.330
During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:

1692
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:16.370
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

1693
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:22.000
Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

1694
01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:50.870
I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

1695
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:56.130
One of these men is Genius to the other;

1696
01:39:56.130 --> 01:39:59.670
And so of these. Which is the natural man,

1697
01:39:59.670 --> 01:40:02.900
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

1698
01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:07.530
I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

1699
01:40:08.230 --> 01:40:12.030
I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.

1700
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:16.000
AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

1701
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.800
O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

1702
01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:23.370
Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds

1703
01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:27.230
And gain a husband by his liberty.

1704
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:35.930
Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man

1705
01:40:35.930 --> 01:40:40.470
That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia

1706
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:44.670
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:

1707
01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:50.830
O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,

1708
01:40:50.830 --> 01:40:53.830
And speak unto the same AEmilia!

1709
01:40:55.030 --> 01:41:00.300
If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:

1710
01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.630
If thou art she, tell me where is that son

1711
01:41:03.630 --> 01:41:06.030
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

1712
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:10.600
By men of Epidamnum he and I

1713
01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:13.300
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;

1714
01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:16.330
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth

1715
01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:19.500
By force took Dromio and my son from them

1716
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.700
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.

1717
01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:25.930
What then became of them I cannot tell

1718
01:41:25.930 --> 01:41:30.600
I to this fortune that you see me in.

1719
01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:36.670
Why, here begins his morning story right;

1720
01:41:36.670 --> 01:41:40.430
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,

1721
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:43.770
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--

1722
01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:47.970
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--

1723
01:41:47.970 --> 01:41:51.430
These are the parents to these children,

1724
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:54.130
Which accidentally are met together.

1725
01:41:56.930 --> 01:42:02.300
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?

1726
01:42:02.300 --> 01:42:04.670
No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

1727
01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:11.300
Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.

1728
01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:13.730
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

1729
01:42:13.730 --> 01:42:14.800
And I with him.

1730
01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.870
Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,

1731
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:20.870
Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

1732
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:25.630
Which of you two did dine with me to-day?

1733
01:42:25.630 --> 01:42:27.770
I, gentle mistress.

1734
01:42:28.270 --> 01:42:29.630
And are not you my husband?

1735
01:42:29.630 --> 01:42:32.200
No; I say nay to that.

1736
01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.400
And so do I; yet did she call me so:

1737
01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:36.800
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,

1738
01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:38.570
Did call me brother.

1739
01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:39.800
What I told you then,

1740
01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.800
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;

1741
01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:44.130
If this be not a dream I see and hear.

1742
01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.130
That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.

1743
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:51.070
I think it be, sir; I deny it not.

1744
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:58.970
And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

1745
01:43:00.430 --> 01:43:03.770
I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

1746
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:07.700
I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,

1747
01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:11.070
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

1748
01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:13.100
No, none by me.

1749
01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.670
This purse of ducats I received from you,

1750
01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:17.700
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.

1751
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:19.570
I see we still did meet each other's man,

1752
01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.400
And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,

1753
01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:23.200
And thereupon these errors are arose.

1754
01:43:30.330 --> 01:43:34.200
These ducats pawn I for my father here.

1755
01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:37.670
It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

1756
01:43:44.630 --> 01:43:46.800
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.

1757
01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:51.030
There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

1758
01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:02.970
Renowned duke,

1759
01:44:06.930 --> 01:44:08.770
vouchsafe to take the pains

1760
01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:11.370
To go with us into the abbey here

1761
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:14.800
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:

1762
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.430
And all that are assembled in this place,

1763
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:23.800
That by this sympathized one day's error

1764
01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:28.430
Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,

1765
01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:32.170
And we shall make full satisfaction.

1766
01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:42.870
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail

1767
01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:48.330
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour

1768
01:44:48.330 --> 01:44:51.570
My heavy burden ne'er delivered.

1769
01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:59.130
The duke, my husband and my children both,

1770
01:44:59.130 --> 01:45:03.970
And you the calendars of their nativity,

1771
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:13.170
Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;

1772
01:45:13.170 --> 01:45:21.900
After so long grief, such festivity!

1773
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:32.100
With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

1774
01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:43.070
Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?

1775
01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:46.170
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

1776
01:45:46.170 --> 01:45:48.900
Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.

1777
01:45:48.900 --> 01:45:52.100
He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:

1778
01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:56.400
Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:

1779
01:46:13.570 --> 01:46:15.870
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

1780
01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:20.430
There is a fat friend at your master's house,

1781
01:46:20.430 --> 01:46:23.770
That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:

1782
01:46:23.770 --> 01:46:27.200
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

1783
01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:31.170
Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:

1784
01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:34.670
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.

1785
01:46:34.670 --> 01:46:36.370
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

1786
01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:38.570
Not I, sir; you are my elder.

1787
01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:42.070
That's a question: how shall we try it?

1788
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:43.630
We'll draw cuts for the senior:

1789
01:46:43.630 --> 01:46:45.470
till then lead thou first.

1790
01:46:46.370 --> 01:46:47.730
Nay, then, thus:

1791
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:50.830
We came into the world like brother and brother;

1792
01:46:50.830 --> 01:46:56.330
And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

1793
01:46:57.530 --> 01:47:07.630
(music and celebration)

1794
01:47:07.630 --> 01:47:22.530
(music and celebration)

1795
01:49:16.530 --> 01:49:19.530
