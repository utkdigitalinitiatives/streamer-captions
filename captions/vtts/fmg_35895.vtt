00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.800
DISEASES KNOWN TO
MEDICAL SCIENCE.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.800
IT CAN BE TRANSMITTED
THROUGH PERSON-TO-PERSON

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.800
CONTACT OR SIMPLY BY
TOUCHING AN INFECTED SURFACE.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
AND EVERY YEAR IN THE
UNITED STATES ALONE,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
IT PLAYS A MAJOR
ROLE IN THE DEATH

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
OF TENS OF
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.800
IT'S INFLUENZA
- THE "FLU".

WELCOME TO HEALTHY
BODY, HEALTHY MIND,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.830
I'M DR. PERRY KRICHMAR.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.830
FOR AS LONG AS HUMANS
HAVE ROAMED THE EARTH,

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830
DISEASE HAS LEFT
ITS MARK ON THE

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.830
QUALITY AND
LONGEVITY OF LIFE.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.830
THE INFLUENZA VIRUS IS
CHIEF AMONG SUCH DISEASES.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.830
IT CAN BRING ABOUT A
MISERABLE FEW DAYS

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.830
OF ILLNESS AT BEST, OR AT
WORST, ALLOW COMPLICATIONS

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.830
THAT CAN LEAD TO DEATH.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.830
AND THAT'S JUST THE
TYPICAL FLU STRAIN

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.830
WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.830
THIS IS NOT A
TRIVIAL ILLNESS.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.800
INFLUENZA CAUSES 35,000 TO
50,000 DEATHS EVERY YEAR,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.800
INFLUENZA CAUSES
200,000 TO 300,000

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800
HOSPITALIZATIONS
EVERY YEAR -

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.800
THIS IS NOT A
TRIVIAL ILLNESS.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.800
YES INDEED, IN FACT WE
KNOW THAT DURING INFLUENZA

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.800
SEASON, HOSPITALIZATIONS
AND DEATHS DUE TO OTHER

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.860
CONDITIONS SUCH AS
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE,

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.860
HEART ATTACK OR
STROKE, ALL GO UP.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.860
INFLUENZA VIRUSES ARE
VIRUSES WHICH INFECT

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.860
THE CELLS OF THE
RESPIRATORY TRACT,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.860
AND THEY INFECT THOSE
CELLS, GROW IN THOSE CELLS,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.860
AND KILL THOSE CELLS.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.860
AND THAT PROCESS CAUSES
THE SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.830
OF THE DISEASE, INFLUENZA.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.830
AND INFLUENZA'S ABILITY TO
CHEMICALLY CHANGE ITSELF

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.830
JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE LAST
YEAR'S VACCINE INEFFECTIVE,

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.830
GIVES IT A
STEALTH-LIKE QUALITY

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.830
THAT KEEPS SCIENCE
ON ITS TOES.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.830
TRACKING INFLUENZA VIRUSES
AND THEIR CHANGES OVER TIME

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.830
IS A TRICKY GAME BECAUSE
THE ULTIMATE REASON

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.830
WE WANT TO TRACK
INFLUENZA VIRUSES

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.830
IS TO PRODUCE A VACCINE
FOR THE NEXT SEASON.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.800
AND THE INFLUENZA VIRUSES
ARE A MOVING TARGET REALLY.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.800
AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT
EVERY 30 TO 50 YEARS

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800
AN INFLUENZA
VIRUS SHOWS UP

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.800
THAT CAUSES A
WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.860
THE CONSEQUENCE IS THE
DEATH OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.860
WE'LL LEARN MORE ABOUT
INFLUENZA EPIDEMICS

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.860
AND PANDEMICS
IN A MOMENT.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.860
BUT FIRST, HERE'S TODAY'S
HEALTHY BODY, HEALTHY MIND

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.860
"DID YOU KNOW".

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.830
ONE OF THE HALLMARKS OF
INFLUENZA IS THAT IT AFFECTS

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.830
VIRTUALLY 100% OF THE
POPULATION AT SOME POINT.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.830
AND THE FLU VIRUS FROM
LAST YEAR WON'T BE

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.830
THE SAME ONE THIS YEAR.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.830
AND THAT'S WHERE
CORRESPONDENT

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:54.830
JULIE DONALDSON
BEGINS THE STORY.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.830
THANKS PERRY.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.800
FOR MANY OF US, JUST
MENTIONING THE WORD "FLU"

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.860
CAN BRING A FLOOD
OF BAD MEMORIES:

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.860
FEVER, MUSCLE ACHE,
COUGHING AND CONGESTION.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.860
BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE
TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.860
THIS MYSTERIOUS DISEASE.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.860
HUMAN-TO-HUMAN CONTACT
IS A NORMAL PART OF LIFE.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.860
AND IT'S THIS CLOSENESS
TO OTHERS THAT SPREADS

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.860
THE INFLUENZA VIRUS.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.860
BUT WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THE VIRUS ITSELF?

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.860
TO START WITH, THERE
ISN'T JUST ONE TYPE

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.860
OF INFLUENZA VIRUS
- THERE ARE THREE.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.830
DR. STEFAN GRAVENSTEIN IS
PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.830
AT EASTERN VIRGINIA
MEDICAL SCHOOL IN NORFOLK.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.830
WE HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES
OF INFLUENZA VIRUSES

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.830
AND USUALLY WE TALK
ABOUT INFLUENZA A VIRUS,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.830
BUT THERE'S ALSO INFLUENZA
B AND INFLUENZA C VIRUS.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.830
THE INFLUENZA C VIRUS
TYPICALLY CAUSES A MILD

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.830
FLU EXPERIENCE, SIMILAR
TO A COMMON COLD.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.830
TYPES A AND B INFLUENZA
ARE DIFFERENT THAN TYPE C.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.900
BOTH ATTACK THE BODY
IN A MORE SEVERE WAY.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.860
FROM ONE YEAR TO THE
NEXT WE GET WHAT WE CALL

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.860
"ANTIGENIC DRIFT" WHERE
A SINGLE RNA NUCLEOTIDE,

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.860
A SINGLE PIECE OF A RNA
GENE, MIGHT SWITCH

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.860
AND GIVE IT A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT LOOK

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.860
TO THE PROTEIN THAT'S
ON THE SURFACE.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.860
AND THAT DIFFERENT
LOOK IS MORE IMPORTANT

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.860
THAN IT MAY SEEM.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.860
IT ACTUALLY MARKS THE
BEGINNING OF A PROCESS

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.860
THAT CREATES A BRAND
NEW STRAIN OF FLU;

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:31.860
AND WITH IT, THE
NEED FOR SCIENCE

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.860
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
VIRUS HAS CHANGED

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.830
SO A NEW VACCINE
CAN BE CREATED.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:39.830
ONE OF THE SPECIAL
CHARACTERISTICS OF

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.830
INFLUENZA VIRUSES
IS THAT THEY HAVE

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.830
AN AMAZING ABILITY
TO CHANGE.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.830
DR. KRISTIN NICHOL IS
CHIEF OF MEDICINE

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.830
AT THE MINNEAPOLIS
VETERAN'S ADMINISTRATION

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.830
MEDICAL CENTER AND
PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.830
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF MINNESOTA.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.830
BECAUSE THE INFLUENZA
VIRUS IS CHANGING,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.900
SOMETIMES, USUALLY
GRADUALLY OVER TIME,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.900
WE NEED TO MAKE NEW
VACCINES EVERY YEAR

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.860
TO KEEP UP WITH THE
CHANGES IN THE

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.860
INFLUENZA VIRUSES
THAT OCCUR WORLDWIDE.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.860
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.860
IN CHARLOTTESVILLE,
DR. FREDERICK HAYDEN

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.860
IS PROFESSOR OF INTERNAL
MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.860
THESE ARE THE TWO
PROTEINS ON THE SURFACE

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.860
OF THE VIRUS THAT
KEEP CHANGING.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.860
SO THE FLU VIRUS IS
REALLY LIKE A CHAMELEON;

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.860
IT CAN CHANGE ITS COLOR
AND TEXTURE SO THAT OUR

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.860
IMMUNE SYSTEM, ALTHOUGH
IT RECOGNIZES FLU VIRUS

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.860
VERY EFFICIENTLY,
WON'T PROTECT AGAINST

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.860
THE NEW STRAINS
THAT KEEP EVOLVING.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.830
AND IT IS THE DRIFT OR
THE MINOR CHANGES IN

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.830
THOSE VIRUSES THAT ARE
RESPONSIBLE EVERY YEAR

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.830
FOR MORE OR LESS
LOCALIZED OUTBREAKS

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.830
OF INFLUENZA THAT
WE CALL EPIDEMICS.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.830
AND AGAIN, A FLU
EPIDEMIC IS SPREAD

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.900
BY THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY OF PEOPLE.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.900
THE MORE PEOPLE THERE ARE
AND THE CLOSER TOGETHER

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.900
THEY ARE, THE FASTER
THE DISEASE IS SPREAD.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.900
WELL, FOR HUMAN INFLUENZA
VIRUSES THE MAJOR ROUTES

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.900
OF TRANSMISSION ARE BOTH
SMALL AND LARGE DROPLETS

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.900
IN THE AIR.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.860
SO THAT AS WE SIT HERE AT
A DISTANCE OF ROUGHLY A

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.860
YARD APART, LARGE DROPLETS
ARE BEING GENERATED WHILE

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.860
WE TALK AND THESE CAN
SPREAD OVER THOSE KINDS OF

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.860
DISTANCES WHERE THEY'RE
DEPOSITED IN THE UPPER

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.860
AND LOWER RESPIRATORY
TRACT TO START INFECTION.

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.860
AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
AS WELL, LIKE COMING INTO

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.860
CONTACT WITH A SURFACE
THAT HAS BEEN CONTAMINATED

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.860
FROM SNEEZING,
FOR INSTANCE.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.860
AS WE TOUCH THESE
SURFACES WE CAN

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.860
UNKNOWINGLY INTRODUCE THE
VIRUS INTO OUR BODIES

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.830
BY RUBBING OUR EYES,
OR BY NOT THOROUGHLY

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.830
WASHING OUR HANDS
BEFORE EATING.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.830
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF
INFLUENZA VACCINES

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.830
THAT ARE AVAILABLE
RIGHT NOW FOR PREVENTING

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.900
INFLUENZA IN THE UNITED
STATES - THE SO-CALLED

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.900
"INACTIVATED VACCINE",
WHICH IS THE FLU SHOT,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.900
WHICH IS VERY SAFE
AND VERY EFFECTIVE.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.900
THE SECOND KIND OF INFLUENZA
VACCINE IS A NASAL SPRAY

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.900
CALLED "ALIVE ATTENUATED
INFLUENZA VACCINE".

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.900
IT'S ACTUALLY A LIVE VIRUS
VACCINE THAT'S WEAKENED

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.900
AND CAN ONLY SURVIVE IN
THE UPPER AIRWAY PASSAGES

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.860
OF THE ONE
BEING IMMUNIZED.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.860
ANTIVIRAL PRESCRIPTION
DRUGS ARE USED TO BOTH

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.860
PREVENT AND
TREAT INFLUENZA.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.860
ACCORDING TO THE WORLD
HEALTH ORGANIZATION,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.860
WHEN USED FOR PREVENTION,
THEY ARE ABOUT

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.860
70% TO 90% EFFECTIVE.

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.860
WHEN USED AS A TREATMENT
ONCE A PERSON HAS THE FLU,

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.860
THEY CAN SHORTEN SICK
TIME BY ONE OR TWO DAYS.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.860
STUDIES ARE UNDERWAY AT
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.860
TO TEST HOW EFFECTIVE
AN ANTIVIRAL DRUG IS

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.860
AS DIFFERENT AMOUNTS
OF THE DRUG ARE USED.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.830
THIS TIME THE CULPRIT
IS A VIRUS THAT CAUSES

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.830
THE COMMON COLD
AND NOT THE FLU.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:04.830
LAB SPECIALIST CAROLYN
CRUMP CONDUCTS THE STUDY.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.830
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
WHAT IS THE EFFECTIVE

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:11.830
CONCENTRATION OF THIS
DRUG TO USE SO THAT

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:19.830
YOU WILL BE PROTECTED
FROM GETTING A COLD.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:22.830
THIS LAYER OF CELLS IS
HEALTHY AND HAS NEITHER

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.830
THE VIRUS NOR THE DRUG.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.830
NOW WE MOVE ON TO THE
CELLS THAT HAVE THE VIRUS

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.800
AND THE HIGHEST
CONCENTRATION OF THE DRUG.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.800
IN THE LEFT LOWER QUARTER
OF THE CIRCLE WE SEE CELLS

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.800
THAT FORM A CHAIN.

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800
THESE ARE THE
INFECTED CELLS.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.800
THIS MEANS THAT THE DRUG,
AT THIS HIGHEST STRENGTH,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.800
KEPT 70% TO 75% OF THE CELLS
FROM BECOMING INFECTED.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.800
THEN WE MOVE TO THE NEXT
BATCH OF CELLS WHERE

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.800
THE DRUG HAS BEEN
DILUTED TEN-FOLD.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.860
HERE, THE INFECTED CELLS
ARE BIG AND HAVE TAKEN ON

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:02.860
A BALLOONING EFFECT.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.830
THE FLATTER LOOKING CELLS
ARE THE UNINFECTED CELLS.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.830
ANOTHER TEN-FOLD DILUTION
OF THE DRUG HAS CAUSED

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.830
ABOUT HALF THE CELLS IN THIS
GROUP TO BECOME INFECTED.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:19.830
AND FINALLY THE DYING CELLS
HAVE BALLOONED OUT FURTHER,

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:23.830
AND THE DEAD CELLS HAVE
DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.830
PEOPLE OVER 65 TEND TO
HAVE A MUCH HARDER TIME

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.830
FIGHTING OFF
INFLUENZA VIRUSES.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.830
AND HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF EASTERN VIRGINIA,

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:40.800
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR YUPING
DENG IS LOOKING FOR A LINK

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.800
BETWEEN THE DECLINE IN THE
LEVEL OF T-CELLS IN OLDER

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.800
PEOPLE AND THE REDUCED
EFFECTS THAT INFLUENZA

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.800
VACCINES TEND TO HAVE
IN THIS AGE GROUP.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.800
T-CELLS ARE ONE OF
THE MAJOR COMPONENTS

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.800
OF THE BODY'S
IMMUNE SYSTEM.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.800
SO, THAT'S ONE REASON THAT
WE LOOK INTO T-CELLS.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.860
SO IF ELDERLY PEOPLE
DO NOT RESPOND WELL

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.860
TO A VACCINE WE NEED TO
LOOK INTO THE SOURCE

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.830
OF THE NON-RESPONSENESS.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.830
ELDER PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR
ARE MORE VULNERABLE

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:20.830
TO INFLUENZA, COMPARED TO
HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.830
SO IT IS AN IMPORTANT
ASPECT OF THE STUDY.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.830
AND 200 ELDERLY PATIENTS
HERE ARE PARTICIPATING IN

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.830
AN ONGOING CLINICAL TRIAL,
DESIGNED TO STUDY HOW THE

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:39.830
PROCESS OF AGING AFFECTS
THE BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEMS.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.830
STAYING AHEAD OF THE
INFLUENZA CURVE IS NOT EASY

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:45.800
AND GETTING BEHIND
IS NOT AN OPTION

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.800
BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES
COULD BE GREAT.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.800
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
EVERY 30 TO 50 YEARS

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.800
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENS.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.800
AND THAT'S WHEN PANDEMICS
COME ON THE SCENE.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.800
EXCEPT FOR HOW A
PANDEMIC GETS HERE,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.800
IN THE END, THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.860
FROM AN EPIDEMIC IS
THAT SCIENCE HASN'T

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.860
HAD THE TIME TO CREATE
A SUITABLE VACCINE.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.860
SO WITHOUT IT THE VIRUS
IS SPREAD QUICKLY.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.860
IN A MOMENT WE'LL
TAKE A LOOK AT

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.860
WHAT MANY SCIENTISTS
BELIEVE IS ANOTHER

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.860
INFLUENZA PANDEMIC
IN THE MAKING.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.860
THANKS, JULIE.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.860
OVER THE LAST 100 YEARS,
INFLUENZA VIRUS PANDEMICS

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:16.860
HAVE LEFT THEIR MARK.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.830
TO SEE HOW DEVASTATING
THEY CAN BE, JUST LOOK AT

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.830
THIS HEALTHY BODY,
HEALTHY MIND Q & A.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.860
AS WE'VE SEEN, THE
INFLUENZA A VIRUS

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.860
HAS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE
ITS APPEARANCE AND RETURN

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:14.860
ON THE SCENE AS A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT VIRUS.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.860
THIS PROCESS IS CAREFULLY
STUDIED TO HELP MAINTAIN

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.860
THE BALANCE BETWEEN
VIRUS AND VACCINE.

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.830
CORRESPONDENT CARLOS BAINE
LOOKS AT WHY THIS IS

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.830
ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN THE
POTENTIAL OF A PANDEMIC

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:27.830
IS ON THE HORIZON.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:28.830
THAT'S RIGHT PERRY.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.830
A GREAT DEAL OF WORK
GOES ON AROUND THE WORLD,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:33.830
LOOKING FOR NEW ANSWERS
AND APPROACHES TO

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.830
THE PROBLEM OF
INFLUENZA A VIRUSES.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.830
BUT WHERE DO THEY COME
FROM IN THE FIRST PLACE

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.830
AND HOW DO THEY FIND THEIR
WAY INTO HUMAN BEINGS?

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:47.830
ACTUALLY, I THINK OF
FLU - INFLUENZA A,

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.830
AS BEING A NATURAL
PATHOGEN OF BIRDS.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.830
DR. JOHN TREANOR IS
PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.800
IN THE INFECTIOUS DISEASE
UNIT AT THE UNIVERSITY

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.800
OF ROCHESTER.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.860
THAT'S REALLY THE NATURAL
HOST OF INFLUENZA A VIRUSES.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.860
AND IN BIRDS, THERE IS
AN ENORMOUS DIVERSITY

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.860
OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF
INFLUENZA A VIRUSES.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.860
THE CONNECTION OF BIRDS TO
HUMANS IS OF MAJOR INTEREST

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.860
TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE
CONTROL AND PREVENTION

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.860
IN ATLANTA.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.860
DR. NIRANJAN BHAT IS AN
EPIDEMIC INTELLIGENCE

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.860
SERVICE OFFICER
FOR THE CDC.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.860
DR. BHAT SAYS THAT BIRD
POPULATIONS ARE THE

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.860
BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS
FOR NEW AND DANGEROUS

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.830
INFLUENZA A VIRUS STRAINS.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.830
WE THINK THAT THESE
NEW VIRUSES COME FROM

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.830
A RESERVOIR IN THE BIRD
POPULATION, PARTICULARLY

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:41.830
MIGRATORY BIRDS, AND THESE
VIRUSES CAN COME INTO THE

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:44.830
HUMAN POPULATION EITHER
DIRECTLY FROM A BIRD

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.830
TO A HUMAN, USUALLY
THROUGH SOME SORT OF

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:51.830
INTERMEDIATE HOST
LIKE A PIG OR A DUCK.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.900
IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM,
AND IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.860
THERE IS A LOT OF
CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.860
SOME OF THESE BIRD
SPECIES AND HUMANS.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.860
AND WHEN WE HAVE
OUTBREAKS OF THE AVIAN

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:16.860
OR BIRD INFLUENZA IN THE
BIRDS, BECAUSE THERE'S

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.860
SUCH CLOSE PROXIMITY BETWEEN
THE PEOPLE AND THE BIRDS,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.860
YOU INCREASE THE RISK
THAT THERE COULD BE

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.860
JUMPING OF THAT
SPECIES BARRIER.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.860
AND JUMPING THE SPECIES
BARRIER IS PERHAPS

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.860
THE MOST FRIGHTENING
SCENARIO OF ALL.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.860
IT'S THE INFLUENZA A VIRUS
THAT CAUSES THE PANDEMIC

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:35.860
AND WHEN YOU HEAR, FOR
EXAMPLE, SPANISH FLU

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.830
OR THE 1968 FLU OR THE
SWINE FLU PANDEMICS,

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:48.830
THOSE WERE ALL
INFLUENZA A VIRUSES.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.830
WHEN THE INFLUENZA PROTEIN
HEMAGGLUTININ CHANGES

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.830
SLOWLY, SCIENTISTS CALL
THIS PROCESS "DRIFTING",

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.830
WHICH IS THE NORMAL
YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGE

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.900
IN INFLUENZA A AND
B VIRUS STRAINS.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.900
BUT "SPECIES JUMPING"
HAPPENS WHEN THE

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.900
INFLUENZA A HEMAGGLUTININ
ALTERS ITSELF COMPLETELY.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.900
THIS SPECIES "JUMP" GIVES
THE NEW VIRUS A TREMENDOUS

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.860
HEAD START, FAR AHEAD
OF SCIENCE'S ABILITY

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.860
TO CREATE NEW VACCINE.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.860
THIS IS CALLED AN
"ANTIGENIC SHIFT",

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.860
WHICH CAN CREATE A WORLDWIDE
PANDEMIC SITUATION.

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.860
SO WHEN PANDEMICS OCCUR -
FOR EXAMPLE, 1918 IS ONE

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.860
OF THE CLASSIC ONES WE TALK
ABOUT - YOU HAVE A VIRUS

00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:30.860
THAT VERY EFFORTLESSLY
MOVES FROM PERSON TO PERSON

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:34.860
AND DOES SO WITH A
HIGH DEGREE OF MORBIDITY

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.860
AND ALSO MORTALITY.

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.860
WELL, THE 1918 PANDEMIC
WAS REALLY ONE OF THE

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.830
GREATEST MEDICAL
CATASTROPHES IN HISTORY.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:47.830
THE ESTIMATES RANGE AS
HIGH AS 40 TO 50 MILLION

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.830
DEATHS WORLDWIDE,
PERHAPS MORE THAN THAT,

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:53.830
OVER A HALF MILLION DEATHS
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.830
OVER THE MULTIPLE WAVES OF
THAT PANDEMIC VIRUS SPREAD.

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.900
BUT WHAT COULD AN
INFLUENZA PANDEMIC

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.900
FROM THE EARLY DAYS
OF THE 20TH CENTURY

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.900
HAVE TO DO WITH THE
SCIENCE OF THE 21ST?

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:07.900
A LOT.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.900
THAT'S BECAUSE THE STUDY
OF INFLUENZA STILL HAS

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.900
LIMITS WHEN DEALING WITH
A SPECIES-JUMPING VIRUS.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:17.860
WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING
NOW IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.860
IS REALLY UNPRECEDENTED
BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SCOPE

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:25.860
OF THE EPIDEMIC THAT'S
OCCURRING WITHIN BIRDS,

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.860
THE NUMBERS OF DIFFERENT
SPECIES AFFECTED, AND THE

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.860
WIDESPREAD NATURE OF THE
INFECTION AS WELL AS THE

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.860
UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF
TRANSMISSION TO HUMANS.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.860
WE'VE NEVER SEEN
THIS BEFORE.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.860
THE BIRD FLU VIRUS
STRAIN IS CALLED

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.860
THE H5N1 AVIAN
INFLUENZA VIRUS.

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:47.860
AND PEOPLE ARE VERY
CONCERNED THAT THIS MIGHT

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.830
BE THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS
A SCENARIO WHERE THOSE

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:54.830
BIRD FLU VIRUSES GAIN THE
ABILITY TO BE TRANSMITTED

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:57.830
FROM PERSON TO PERSON
AND START EFFICIENTLY

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.830
INFECTING PEOPLE AND
SPREADING THROUGHOUT

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.900
THE WORLD.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.900
AND THOUGH THE OVERALL
NUMBERS OF INFECTED

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.900
PERSONS HAS BEEN SMALL,
ABOUT HALF HAVE DIED.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:14.900
AND SO THROUGH THE WHO, I
WAS PART OF A TEAM THAT WAS

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:20.900
INVITED TO VIETNAM TO HELP
INVESTIGATE THIS OUTBREAK.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.900
VIETNAM IS ONE OF A
HANDFUL OF COUNTRIES

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.860
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AFFECTED
BY THE AVIAN FLU TO DATE.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.860
DR. BHAT'S TEAM HELPED
THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT

00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.860
DEVELOP A SURVEILLANCE
SYSTEM SO THEY CAN MORE

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.860
ACCURATELY AND QUICKLY
LOCATE THESE CASES.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.860
WORK IS BEING DONE IN THE
UNITED STATES AS WELL.

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.860
TAKING WHAT SCIENCE
CURRENTLY KNOWS ABOUT THE

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.860
H5 VIRUS, CLINICAL TRIALS
ARE UNDERWAY IN A HANDFUL

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:50.860
OF LABS ACROSS THE COUNTRY
TO SEARCH FOR A VACCINE.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.860
THE UNIVERSITY OF
ROCHESTER IS ONE.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.860
HERE, DR. TREANOR AND
HIS TEAM ARE CONDUCTING

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.830
A PHASE I TRIAL USING
AN INACTIVATED SAMPLE

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.830
OF ACTUAL H5
BIRD FLU VIRUS.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.830
AND THE FIRST ACTIVITY IS
TO DRAW BLOOD SAMPLES FROM

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.830
PARTICIPANTS TO ESTABLISH
BASELINE DATA FOR THE TRIAL.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.830
WELL, THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME ANYONE HAS TESTED

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:18.830
A VACCINE AGAINST
THIS PARTICULAR STRAIN

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.830
OF BIRD FLU.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:22.830
WE'RE DETERMINING WHETHER
OR NOT THAT VACCINE

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.830
WILL BE WELL TOLERATED
IN HEALTHY ADULTS,

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:28.830
AND WHETHER IT WILL
GENERATE THE KIND OF

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.800
IMMUNE RESPONSE THAT
WE THINK WOULD PROVIDE

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.800
PROTECTION
AGAINST BIRD FLU.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.800
 HOLD THE GAUZE FOR ME.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.800
 YOU CAN REACH OVER AND
 TIGHTEN IT, THAT'S GOOD.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.800
PARTICIPANTS LIKE DAVID
BELL SEE THE VALUE

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.800
OF TAKING PART.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.800
IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT
DISEASE THAT CAN BE SPREAD

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.800
AND BECAUSE IT CAN BE
SPREAD SO QUICKLY, AND

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.800
ESPECIALLY AFTER, AGAIN,
THE PANDEMIC OF 1918,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.860
IT CAN TURN INTO
SOMETHING EVEN WORSE.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.860
IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS' TIME
PARTICIPANTS RETURN

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.830
FOR MORE BLOOD SAMPLES.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:07.830
THESE SAMPLES THEN GO
TO THE ON-SITE LAB

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.830
WHERE THEY'RE SPUN IN A
HIGH SPEED CENTRIFUGE

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.830
AT 2000 REVOLUTIONS
PER MINUTE.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:17.830
RESEARCH ASSISTANT PROFESSOR
CARRIE DYKES EXPLAINS.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.830
SO, AFTER THE BLOOD IS
CENTRIFUGED, THE SERUM,

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:23.830
WHICH IS THE YELLOW
LIQUID SHOWN ON THE TOP

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:27.830
AND HE ALOQUOTS SMALL
VOLUMES INTO THESE VIALS

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:30.830
WHICH THEN ARE
CAPPED WITH A CAP

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.830
AND STORED AT VERY
COLD TEMPERATURES.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:38.800
THEY'RE STORED AT -70
DEGREES CENTIGRADE

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.800
WHICH IS ABOUT 50
DEGREES COLDER

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.800
THAN YOUR FREEZER
AT HOME WOULD BE.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.800
THOSE SAMPLES ARE THEN
SHIPPED TO A TESTING LAB

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.800
WHERE THE SERUM CAN THEN
BE TESTED TO DETERMINE

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.800
WHETHER THERE'S ANY
ANTIBODIES THAT HAVE BEEN

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:59.800
GENERATED FROM THE VACCINE
FOR THE FLU VACCINE.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.860
WELL, ONE ROADBLOCK
HAS BEEN THAT SO FAR

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.860
THE VACCINES HAVE
NOT BEEN AS POWERFUL

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.860
AT INDUCING IMMUNITY
AS WE HAD HOPED.

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.830
AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
WE WILL NEED TO USE

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.830
RELATIVELY HIGH DOSES
OR ADD THINGS TO THE

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.830
VACCINES CALLED
"ADJUVANTS" WHICH ARE

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:18.830
DESIGNED TO STIMULATE
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.830
IN ORDER TO GET
EFFECTIVE IMMUNITY

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.830
TO THE GREATEST NUMBER
OF PEOPLE POSSIBLE.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.830
AND SO, THE
WORK CONTINUES.

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.830
BIRD FLU IS DEFINITELY
A CONCERN FOR US NOW

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.830
BUT IT IS NOT
A PANDEMIC YET.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.830
IT'S A VERY TRICKY TOPIC
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BALANCE

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:41.830
THE NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE PUBLIC IS AWARE

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:45.800
OF THE DANGER AND ARE
ADEQUATELY PREPARED,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.800
BUT NOT TO
PANIC EVERYONE.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.800
IT'S A VERY
UNPREDICTABLE SITUATION.

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.800
WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED
THIS BEFORE AND THIS MAKES

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.800
IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAN
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.800
TO OVER REACT, BUT
ON THE OTHER HAND

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:05.860
WE DON'T WANT TO
REACT TOO LATE EITHER.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.860
ALTHOUGH NO ONE CAN
PREDICT EXACTLY WHAT

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.860
WILL HAPPEN WITH BIRD
FLU, SCIENTISTS ARE

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.860
WORKING HARD TO UNDERSTAND
THE H5 VIRUS BEFORE IT CAN

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.860
SPREAD BY WAY OF PERSON
TO PERSON CONTACT,

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.830
SETTING THE STAGE
FOR A PANDEMIC.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.830
ALTHOUGH THE MEDICAL AND
SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.830
ARE CONCERNED, THERE IS NO
GUARANTEE THAT THE BIRD FLU

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.830
WILL EVOLVE INTO A
FULL-FLEDGED PANDEMIC.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.830
WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE
IS TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.830
OURSELVES AGAINST THE
NORMAL FLU EPIDEMIC.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.830
GOOD ADVICE
CARLOS, THANKS.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.830
AND WHETHER IT'S THE
ANNUAL INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.830
OR THE POSSIBILITY OF A
PANDEMIC, ONE THING IS KEY;

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.830
IN THE END IT'S
VACCINE THAT FIGHTS OFF

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.830
THE DEBILITATING
EFFECTS OF THE DISEASE.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:47.830
I THINK EVENTUALLY
WE'LL BE MOVING TO A

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.800
PATTERN OF UNIVERSAL
INFLUENZA IMMUNIZATION

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.800
IN THIS COUNTRY AND
ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.800
IN PART BECAUSE WE'RE
APPRECIATING HOW MUCH

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.860
DISEASE AND MORTALITY
INFLUENZA INFECTIONS CAUSE,

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.860
AND ALSO THE SOCIAL AND
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:09.860
SO IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE
TO USE VACCINES TO TRY TO

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.860
REDUCE THAT BURDEN AND
INDEED TO EXTEND THAT

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.860
BENEFIT IN TERMS OF
PROTECTION TO A

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.860
MUCH BROADER PORTION
OF THE POPULATION.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.860
FOR EXAMPLE, SOMETHING
AS SIMPLE AND OBVIOUS

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.830
AS THE HEALTHCARE
PROVIDER GIVING A STRONG,

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.830
CLEAR RECOMMENDATION
TO THEIR PATIENT,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.830
THAT YOU ARE AT RISK, THAT
INFLUENZA IS A BAD DISEASE,

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.830
THAT VACCINATION IS
A GOOD THING FOR YOU,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.830
MOST PEOPLE WILL
ACCEPT IMMUNIZATION

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.830
EVEN IF THEY'RE OTHERWISE
MAYBE SOMEWHAT HESITANT

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.830
ABOUT GETTING
A VACCINATION.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.830
THE VIRUS DOESN'T CARE
WHETHER YOU GET SICK OR NOT.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.830
THE VIRUS JUST WANTS TO
MAKE MORE COPIES OF ITSELF.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:52.830
BUT SOMETIMES THAT PROCESS
OF MAKING COPIES CAN MAKE

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.830
THE PERSON WHO'S CELLS
THE VIRUS IS BORROWING

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.800
GET VERY ILL AND
THAT'S THE DISEASE,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.800
THAT'S A VIRAL
DISEASE LIKE THE FLU.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.860
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO PREVENT

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.860
BY VACCINATIONS.

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.860
ONLY ABOUT 25% TO 30%
OF PEOPLE 65 AND UNDER

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.860
GET AN ANNUAL FLU
SHOT IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.860
BUT, HAVING THE SHOT
COULD HELP REDUCE

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.860
THE OVERALL NUMBER
OF 50 MILLION AMERICANS

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.860
WHO SUFFER FROM
INFLUENZA EVERY SEASON.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.860
THAT'S IT FOR
