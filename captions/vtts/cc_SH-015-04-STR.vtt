00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770


2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.930


3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.330
dares me to personal combat, Caesar to Antony.

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.230
Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die,

5
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.870
meantime laugh at his challenge.

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.870
Caesar must think,

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.600
when one so great begins to rage,

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
he's hunted even to falling.

9
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.070
Give him no breath but now make boot of his distraction.

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.370
Never anger made good guard for itself.

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.070
Let our best heads know that tomorrow

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.900
the last of many battles we mean to fight.

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.700
Within our files there are of those

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.230
that served Mark Antony but lateó

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.130
enough to fetch him in.

16
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.200
See it done.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.270
And feast the army.

18
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.130
We have store to do it, and they have earned the waste.

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.370
Poor Antony.

20
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.130
He will not fight with me, Domitius.

21
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.700
No.

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.230
And why should he not?

23
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.370
He thinks being 20 times of better fortune,

24
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.600
he is 20 men to 1.

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.930
Tomorrow, soldier, by sea and land I'll fight,

26
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.100
or I will live or bathe my dying honor

27
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.370
in the blood shall make it live again.

28
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.670
Will thou fight well?

29
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.830
I'll strike and cry, "Take all."

30
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.870
Well said; come on.

31
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.300
Call forth my household servants.

32
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.470
Let's tonight be bounteous at our meal.

33
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.670
Oh, give me thy hand.

34
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.130
Thou hast been rightly honest.

35
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.400
So hast thou.

36
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.500
Thou and thou and thou.

37
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.670
You have served me well,

38
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.370
and kings have been your fellows.

39
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.870
What means this?

40
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.300
'Tis one of those odd tricks

41
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.530
which sorrow shoots out of the mind.

42
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.800
And thou art honest too.

43
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.270
I wish I could be made so many men,

44
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.170
and all of you clapped up together in an Antony

45
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.300
that I might do you service so good as you have done.

46
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.330
The gods forbid.

47
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.530
Well..

48
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.330
Well, my good fellows, wait on me tonight.

49
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.970
Scant not my cups and make as much of me

50
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.830
as when mine empire was your fellow too

51
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.500
and suffered my command.

52
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.500
What does he mean?

53
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.730
To make his followers weep.

54
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.800
Tend me tonight.

55
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.700
May be it is the period of your duty.

56
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.600
Haply you shall not see me moreó

57
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.000
or if, a mangled shadow.

58
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
Perchance tomorrow you'll serve another master.

59
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.130
I look on you as one that takes his leave.

60
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.000
Mine honest friends, I turn you not away.

61
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.770
But like a master married to your good service,

62
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.030
stay till death.

63
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.000
Tend me tonight two hours, I ask no more.

64
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.770
And the gods yield you for it.

65
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.930
What mean you, sir, to give them this discomfort?

66
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.770
Look, they weep.

67
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.130
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed.

68
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.500
For shame, transform us not to women.

69
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.100
Ho, ho, ho!

70
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.070
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!

71
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.700
Oh.

72
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.930
Grace grow where those drops fall!

73
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.930
My hearty friends, you take me in too dolorous a sense.

74
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.300
For I spake to you for your comfort,

75
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.630
did desire you to burn this night with torches.

76
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.070
Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow

77
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.670
and will lead you where rather I'll expect victorious life

78
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.330
than death and honor.

79
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.800
Let's to supper, come, and drown consideration.

80
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.370
Eros! Mine armor, Eros!

81
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.530
Sleep a little.

82
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.330
No, my chuck.

83
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.400
Eros, come; mine armor, Eros!

84
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.070
Come good fellow, put mine iron on.

85
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.370
If fortune be not ours today,

86
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.300
it is because we brave her; come.

87
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.330
Nay, I'll help too.

88
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.100
What's this for?

89
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:22.900
Ah, let be, let be!

90
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:32.930
Thou art the armorer of my heart.

91
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.600
Thou art the armorer of my heart.

92
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.500
False, false; this, this.

93
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.070
Sooth, la, I'll help, thus it must be.

94
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.130
Well, well, we shall thrive now.

95
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.030
Seest thou, my good fellow?

96
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.000
Go put on thy defences.

97
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.100
Briefly, sir.

98
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.430
Is not this buckled well?

99
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.970
Rarely, rarely.

100
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.330
He that unbuckles this till we do please

101
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.100
to daff it for our repose shall hear a storm.

102
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.470
Thou fumblest, Eros.

103
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.800
My queen's a squire more tight at this than thou.

104
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.000
Dispatch.

105
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.100
O love, that thou could see my wars today

106
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.870
and knew'st the royal occupation,

107
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.600
thou should see a workman in it.

108
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.770
The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

109
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.330
This morning, like the spirit of a youth

110
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.430
that means to be of note, begins betimes.

111
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.630
So, so; come, give me that.

112
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.970
Oh, oh, this way.

113
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.270
Fare thee well, dame.

114
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.000
Whatever becomes of me, this is a soldier's kiss.

115
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.500
He goes forth gallantly.

116
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.630
That he and Caesar might determine this great war

117
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:05.130
in single fight, then Antonyó

118
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:10.600
But nowó Well, on.

119
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.030
The gods make this a happy day to Antony.

120
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.230
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevailed

121
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:18.800
to make me fight at land.

122
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.030
Hadst thou done so, the kings that have revolted

123
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.870
and the soldier that has this morning left thee

124
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.700
would have still have followed your heels.

125
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.270
Who's gone this morning?

126
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.700
Who?

127
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.900
One ever near thee.

128
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.570
Call for Enobarbus, he shall not hear thee

129
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.470
or from Caesar's camp, say, "I am none of thine."

130
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.530
What say'st thou?

131
00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.130
Sir, he is with Caesar.

132
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.370
Sir, his chests and treasure he has not with him.

133
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.470
Is he gone?

134
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.470
Most certain.

135
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:55.700
Go, Eros; send his treasure after.

136
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.800
Do it.

137
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.830
Detain no jot, I charge thee.

138
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.600
Write to him.

139
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.030
I will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings,

140
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:10.500
say that I wish he never find more cause to change a master.

141
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.170
O my fortunes have corrupted honest men!

142
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.570
Dispatch.

143
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.730
Enobarbus!

144
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.900
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight.

145
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.470
Our will is Antony be took alive.

146
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.430
Make it so known.

147
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.000
Caesar, I shall.

148
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.030
The time of universal peace is near.

149
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.600
Prove this a prosperous day,

150
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.100
the three-nooked world shall bear the olive freely.

151
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.970
Antony is come into the field.

152
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.570
Go charge Agrippa.

153
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:53.430
Plant those that have revolted in the van,

154
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.570
that Antony may seem to spend his fury upon himself.

155
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:06.430
Enobarbus, Antony hath after thee

156
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.300
sent all thy treasure with his bounty overplus.

157
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.300
I give it you.

158
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.500
Mock not, Enobarbus.I tell you true.

159
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.670
Best you safed the bringer out of the host.

160
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.870
I must attend mine office or would have done it myself.

161
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:23.600
Your emperor continues still a Jove.

162
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.570
I am alone the villain of the earth,

163
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.400
and feel I am so most.

164
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.900
O Antony, thou mine of bounty,

165
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.500
how wouldst thou have paid my better service

166
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.500
when my turpitude thou dost so crown with gold.

167
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.270
This blows my heart.

168
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.930
If swift thought break it not,

169
00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.600
a swifter mean shall outstrike thought.

170
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.770
But thought will do it, I feel.

171
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.470
I fight against thee.

172
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:18.670
No, I will go seek some ditch wherein to die.

173
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:24.170
The foulest best fits my latter part of life.

174
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.670
We have beat him to his camp!

175
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.900
Run one before!

176
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.300
Let the queen know of our gests.

177
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.170
Tomorrow before the sun shall see us,

178
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.930
we'll spill the blood that has today escaped.

179
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.130
Oh, I thank you all, for doughty-handed are you

180
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.400
and have fought not as you served the cause

181
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.570
but as it had been each man's like mine.

182
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.130
You have shown all Hectors.

183
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.030
Enter the city, clip our wives, your friends.

184
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.070
Tell them your feats whilst they with joyful tears

185
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.170
wash the congealment from your wounds

186
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.570
and kiss the honored gashes whole.

187
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.600
Lord of lords.

188
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.700
O infinite virtue,

189
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.170
comest thou smiling from the world's great snare uncaught?

190
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.230
My nightingale, we have beat them to their beds.

191
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.900
Behold this man.

192
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.130
Commend unto his lips thy favoring hand.

193
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:27.400
Kiss it, my warrior!

194
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.670
He hath fought today as if a god in hate of mankind

195
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.030
had destroyed in such a shape.

196
00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.000
I'll give thee, friend, an armor all of gold.

197
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.030
It was a king's.

198
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:36.200
He has deserved it,

199
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.630
were it carbuncled like holy Phoebus' car.

200
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.530
Give me thy hand.

201
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.370
Through Alexandria make a jolly march.

202
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:47.630
Bear our hacked targets like the men that owe them.

203
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.830
Had our great palace the capacity to camp this host?

204
00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.530
We all would sup together and drink carouses

205
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.600
to the next day's fate which promises royal peril.

206
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.770
Trumpeters,

207
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.270
with brazen din blast you the city's ear.

208
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.500
Make mingle with rattling tambourines,

209
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.470
that heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,

210
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.030
applauding our approach.

211
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.300
O, bear me witness, night.

212
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.100
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,

213
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.570
when men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory,

214
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:34.400
poor Enobarbus did before thy face repent.

215
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.100
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,

216
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.230
the poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,

217
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.870
that life, a very rebel to my will,

218
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:45.600
may hang no longer on me.

219
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.970
Throw my heart against the flint and hardness of my fault,

220
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.200
which, being dried with grief, will break to powder

221
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.130
and finish all foul thoughts.

222
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:07.470
O Antony, nobler than my revolt is infamous,

223
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.200
forgive me in thine own particular,

224
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.830
but let the world rank me in register

225
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:20.070
a master-leaver and a fugitive.

226
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.400
O Antony!

227
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:27.170
O Antony!

228
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.630
Their preparation is today by sea.

229
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.170
We please them not by land.

230
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.830
For both, my lord.

231
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:37.930
I would they fight in the fire or in the air;

232
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:38.930
we'd fight there too.

233
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.070
But thus it is.

234
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.630
Our foot upon the hills adjoining to the city

235
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.400
shall stay with us.

236
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.270
Order for sea is given.

237
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:47.400
They've put forth the haven,

238
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.930
where their appointment we may best discover

239
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.630
and look on their endeavour.

240
00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.270
But being charged, we will be still by land,

241
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.930
which, as I take it, we shall,

242
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.070
for his best force is forth to man his galleys.

243
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.330
To the vales and hold our best advantage.

244
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.370
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.

245
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.430
My fleet hath yielded to the foe,

246
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.730
and yonder they cast their caps up and carouse together

247
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.970
like friends long lost.

248
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.500
Triple-turned whore!

249
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.600
'Tis thou hast sold me to this novice!

250
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.170
And my heart makes only wars on thee.

251
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.200
Bid them all fly,

252
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.170
for when I am revenged upon my charm, I have done all.

253
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.930
Bid them all fly; begone!

254
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.400
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more.

255
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.400
Fortune and Antony part here.

256
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.770
Even here do we shake hands.

257
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.470
All come to this?

258
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.830
The hearts that spanieled me at heels,

259
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.770
to whom I gave their wishes, do discandy,

260
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.330
melt their sweets on blossoming Caesar.

261
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.530
And this pine is barked that overtopped them all.

262
00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:11.070
Betrayed I am.

263
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.170
O this false soul of Egypt!

264
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:21.000
This grave charm whose eye becked forth my wars

265
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.600
and called them home,

266
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.230
whose bosom was my crownet, my chief endó

267
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:29.300
like a right gypsy hath at fast and loose

268
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.470
beguiled me to the very heart of loss.

269
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:48.300
What, Eros! Eros!

270
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.200
Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

271
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.270
Why is my lord enraged against his love?

272
00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.130
Vanish or I shall give thee thy deserving

273
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.870
and blemish Caesar's triumph.

274
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:08.730
Let him take thee

275
00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.430
and hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians,

276
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.630
follow his chariot

277
00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.130
like the greatest spot of all thy sex.

278
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.370
Oh, most monster-like be shown

279
00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.970
for poorest diminutives for doits;

280
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.730
and let patient Octavia plow thy visage up

281
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:26.970
with her prepared nails.

282
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.400
'Tis well thou art gone.

283
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.530
If it be well to live,

284
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.530
but better 'twere thou fell'st into my fury,

285
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:41.700
for one death might have prevented many.

286
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.930
The witch shall die

287
00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.700
to the young Roman boy she hath sold me,

288
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.030
and I fall under this plot.

289
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.530
She dies for it.

290
00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.870
Help me, my women!

291
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.770
O, he is more mad than Telamon for his shield.

292
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.870
The boar of Thessaly was never so embossed.

293
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.130
To the monument.

294
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.200
There, lock yourself and send him word you are dead.

295
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.200
The soul and body rive not more in parting

296
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200
than greatness going off.

297
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.370
To the monument.

298
00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.670
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself.

299
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:14.970
Say that the last I spoke was "Antony,"

300
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.100
and word it prithee piteously.

301
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.170
Hence, Mardian, and bring me how he takes my death.

302
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.000
To the monument!

303
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.030
Eros, thou yet behold'st me?

304
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.070
Ay, noble lord.

305
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.000
Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish,

306
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.600
a vapor sometime like a bear or lion,

307
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.370
a towered citadel, a pendent rock,

308
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:53.400
a forked mountain or blue promontory with trees upon it,

309
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.100
that nod unto the world and mock our eyes with air.

310
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.700
Thou hast seen these signs.

311
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.830
They are black vesper's pageants.

312
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.300
Ay, my lord.

313
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.030
That which is now a horse, even with a thought,

314
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:11.500
the rack dislimns and makes it indistinct

315
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.330
as water is in water.

316
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:14.870
It does, my lord.

317
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.870
My good knave Eros,

318
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.470
now thy captain is even such a body.

319
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.030
Here I am Antony,

320
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.900
yet cannot hold this visible shape.

321
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:33.130
My knave, I made these wars for Egypt.

322
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:35.530
And the queenó

323
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.400
whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine,

324
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:46.270
which whilst it was mine had annexed unto it a million more,

325
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.600
now lost.

326
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.830
She, Eros, has packed cards with Caesar

327
00:17:53.830 --> 00:18:00.970
and false-played my glory unto an enemy's triumph.

328
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.870
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros.

329
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:10.370
There is left us ourselves to end ourselves.

330
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.400
O! Thy vile lady!

331
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.870
She has robbed me of my sword.

332
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:19.000
No, Antony.

333
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.900
My mistress loved thee,

334
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.070
and her fortunes mingled with thine entirely.

335
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.500
Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!

336
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.400
She hath betrayed me and shall die the death.

337
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.630
Death of one person can be paid but once,

338
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:36.100
and that she has discharged.

339
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.330
What thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand.

340
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:44.530
The last she spoke was, "Antony! Most noble Antony!"

341
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.100
Then in the midst,

342
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.230
a tearing groan did break the name of Antony.

343
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:52.470
It was divided between her heart and lips.

344
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:58.870
She rendered life thy name so buried in her.

345
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.670
Dead, then?

346
00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:09.800
Dead.

347
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.500
Unarm, Eros.

348
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.970
The long day's task is done, and we must sleep.

349
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.630
Off, pluck off.

350
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:32.570
The seven-fold shield of Ajax

351
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.900
cannot keep the battery from my heart.

352
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.930
O, cleave, my sides!

353
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.300
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,

354
00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.700
crack thy frail case!

355
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.700
Apace, Eros, apace.

356
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.530
No more a soldier; bruised pieces, go.

357
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.370
You have been nobly borne.

358
00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.430
From me awhile.

359
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:06.830
I will overtake thee, Cleopatra,

360
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:11.700
and weep for my pardon.

361
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:18.200
So it must be, for now all length is torture.

362
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:28.970
Since the torch is out, lie down and stray no farther.

363
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.170
Now all labor Mars what it does.

364
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:41.630
Yea, very force entangles itself with strength.

365
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.270
Seal then, and all is done.

366
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.730
Eros!

367
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.170
I come, my queen.

368
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.530
Eros!

369
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.700
Stay for me.

370
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:04.430
Where souls do couch on flowers,

371
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:07.100
we'll hand-in-hand

372
00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:13.270
and with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze.

373
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.430
Dido and her Aeneas shall want troops,

374
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:23.970
and all the haunt be ours.

375
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.670
Come, Eros, Eros!

376
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.970
What would my lord?

377
00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:37.500
Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor

378
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.530
that the gods detest my baseness.

379
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.900
I, that with my sword quartered the world

380
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.230
and over green Neptune's back with ships made cities,

381
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.430
condemn myself to lack the courage of a woman.

382
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.630
Less noble mind than she which by her death

383
00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:00.270
our Caesar tells "I am conqueror of myself."

384
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:04.200
Thou art sworn, Eros,

385
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.330
that when the exigent should come,

386
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.930
which now is come indeed,

387
00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:10.200
when I should see behind me

388
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.300
the inevitable prosecution of disgrace and horror,

389
00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.630
that on my command, thou then wouldst kill me.

390
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.900
Do it; the time is come.

391
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.500
Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.

392
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.200
Put color in thy cheek.

393
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.570
The gods withhold me!

394
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.530
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,

395
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.030
though enemy lost aim and could not?

396
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.400
Eros.

397
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.400
Wouldst thou be windowed in great Rome

398
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.370
and see thy master thus with pleached arms,

399
00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.630
bending down his corrigible neck,

400
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:40.730
his face subdued to penetrative shame

401
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:42.830
whilst the wheeled seat of fortunate Caesar

402
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.970
drawn before him,

403
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.130
branded his baseness that ensued?

404
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.300
I would not see it.

405
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.600
Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.

406
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.670
Draw that thy honest sword,

407
00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.430
which thou hast worn most useful for thy country.

408
00:22:55.430 --> 00:23:00.100
O, sir, pardon me!

409
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.270
When I did make thee free,

410
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:05.130
sworest thou not then to do this when I bade thee?

411
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.330
Do it at once, or thy precedent services

412
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.300
are all but accidents unpurposed.

413
00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.530
Draw and come.

414
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.200
Turn from me then, that noble countenance,

415
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.170
wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

416
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.830
Lo thee!

417
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.530
My sword is drawn.

418
00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:28.870
Then let it do at once the thing why thou hast drawn it!

419
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.870
My dear master, my captain, and my emperor,

420
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.900
let me say, before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

421
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.930
'Tis said, man; and farewell.

422
00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.600
Farewell, great chief.

423
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.730
Shall I strike now?

424
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.730
Now, Eros.

425
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.300
Why, there then!

426
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:03.930
Thus do I escape the sorrow of Antony's death.

427
00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:21.270
Thrice nobler than myself!

428
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.000
Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros,

429
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.730
what I should and thou couldst not.

430
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:37.930
My queen and Eros have got upon me a nobleness in record,

431
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.600
but I will be a bridegroom in my death

432
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.100
and run into it as to a lover's bed.

433
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.930
Come then.

434
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:53.430
And, Eros, thy master dies thy scholar.

435
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:56.700
To do thus, I learned of thee.

436
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.870
How nowónot dead? Not dead?

437
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.970
The guard, ho!

438
00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.900
O, dispatch me!

439
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.700
What's the noise?

440
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.400
I have done my work in, friends.

441
00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.270
Make an end of what I have begun.

442
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.900
The star is fallen.

443
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.130
And time is at his period.

444
00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.400
Alas, and woe!

445
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.030
Let him that loves me strike me dead.

446
00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.730
Not I.

447
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.430
Nor I.

448
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.170
Nor anyone.

449
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:36.900
Where's Antony?

450
00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.630
There, Alexas, there.

451
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:41.730
Lives he?

452
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:44.100
Will thou not answer, man?

453
00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.400
Art thou there, Alexas?

454
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.670
Draw thy sword and give me sufficing strokes for death.

455
00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:56.170
Most absolute lord,

456
00:25:56.170 --> 00:26:02.300
my mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

457
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:04.300
When did she send thee?

458
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.900
Now, my lord.

459
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.100
Where is she?

460
00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.630
Locked in her monument.

461
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.230
She had a prophesying fear of what hath come to pass.

462
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.670
For when she sawó

463
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:23.470
which never shall be foundó

464
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.230
you did suspect she had disposed with Caesar

465
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.300
and that your rage would not be purged,

466
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.600
she sent you word she was dead.

467
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:35.370
But fearing since how it might work,

468
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:39.230
hath sent me to proclaim the truth.

469
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.330
And I am come, I dread, too late.

470
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:49.830
Too late, good Alexas.

471
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.100
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides.

472
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.630
It is the last service that I shall command you.

473
00:26:57.630 --> 00:26:59.400
I have led you oft.

474
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.800
Carry me now, good friends, and have my thanks for all.

475
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:31.630
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

476
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.430
Be comforted, dear madam.

477
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.230
No, I will not.

478
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.870
All strange and terrible events are welcome,

479
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:43.970
but comforts we despise.

480
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.070
Our size of sorrow proportioned to our cause

481
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.670
must be as great as that which makes it.

482
00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.470
How now!

483
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:58.870
Is he dead?

484
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.970
His death's upon him but not dead.

485
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:06.900
His guard have brought him hither.

486
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:17.470
O sun, burn the great sphere thou movest in.

487
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.470
Darkling stand the varying shore of the world.

488
00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:28.330
O Antony.

489
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:32.630
Antony, Antony!

490
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.170
Help, Charmian, help.

491
00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.070
Iras, help.

492
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.670
Help, friends below.

493
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.870
Let's draw him hither.

494
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.130
Peace.

495
00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:58.400
Not Caesar's valor hath overthrown Antony,

496
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.200
but Antony's hath triumphed on itself.

497
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.100
So it should be that none but Antony should conquer Antony.

498
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.770
But woe 'tis so!

499
00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:17.070
I am dying, Egypt, dying.

500
00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.530
Only I here importune death awhile

501
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.170
until of many thousand kisses

502
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:26.700
the poor last I lay upon thy lips.

503
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.070
I dare not, dear.

504
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.900
Dear my lord, pardon,

505
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.370
I dare not, lest I be taken.

506
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:35.330
Not the imperious show of the full-fortuned Caesar

507
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.230
ever shall be broached with me.

508
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:39.900
If knife, drugs, serpents have edge, sting, or operation,

509
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.230
I am safe.

510
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.670
Your wife Octavia,

511
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.770
with her modest eyes and still conclusion,

512
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.430
shall acquire no honor demuring upon demurringe.

513
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:52.070
Come, come, Antony.

514
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.600
Help me, my women.

515
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.030
We must draw thee up.

516
00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:59.030
Assist, good friends.

517
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.070
O, quick or I am gone.

518
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.130
Here's sport indeed!

519
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:09.000
How heavy weighs my lord.

520
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.700
Our strength is all gone into heaviness

521
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:13.500
that makes the weight.

522
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.030
Had I great Juno's power,

523
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.430
the strong-winged Mercury should fetch thee up

524
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.230
and set thee by Jove's side.

525
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:24.100
Yet come a little.

526
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.470
Wishes were ever fools.

527
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:33.100
O, come, come, come.

528
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.630
And welcome, welcome!

529
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:41.330
Die where thou hast lived.

530
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:43.900
Quicken with kissing.

531
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.030
Had my lips that power, thus would I wear them out.

532
00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:50.370
A heavy sight!

533
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:59.830
I am dying, Egypt, dying.

534
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:04.400
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

535
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.070
No, let me speak.

536
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.270
And let me rail so high

537
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.370
that the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,

538
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.400
provoked by my offence.

539
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.570
One word, sweet queen.

540
00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:23.770
Of Caesar, seek your honor with your safety.

541
00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.830
They do not go together.

542
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.530
Gentle, hear me.

543
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:33.970
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

544
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.970
My resolution and my hands I'll trust.

545
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.430
None about Caesar.

546
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.630
The miserable change now at my end.

547
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.600
Lament nor sorrow at,

548
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.500
but please thy thoughts in feeding them

549
00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.930
with those my former fortunes

550
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:56.700
wherein I lived the greatest prince of the whole world,

551
00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:03.400
the noblest and do now not basely die,

552
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.130
not cowardly put off my helmet to my countrymanó

553
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:16.630
a Roman by a Romanó valiantly vanquished.

554
00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:24.270
Now my spirit is going.

555
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.230
I can no more.

556
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:32.770
Noblest of men, woo't die?

557
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.700
Hast thou no care of me?

558
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:40.800
Shall I abide in this dull world,

559
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:46.470
which in thy absence is no better than a sty?

560
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:53.370
O, see, my women.

561
00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:58.170
The crown of the earth doth melt.

562
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.670
My lord!

563
00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:12.170
O, withered is the garland of the war!

564
00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:17.130
The soldier's pole is fallen.

565
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:23.370
Young boys and girls are level now with men.

566
00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:26.530
The odds is gone,

567
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:31.370
and there is nothing left remarkable

568
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.570
beneath the visiting moon.

569
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:39.900
O, quietness, lady!

570
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.830
She's dead too, our sovereign.

571
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:42.870
Lady!

572
00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:43.870
Madam!

573
00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.470
O madam, madam, madam!

574
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.400
Royal Egypt Empress!

575
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.030
Peace, peace, Iras!

576
00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.870
No more but even a woman

577
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.930
and commanded by such poor passion

578
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.100
as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares.

579
00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:12.470
It were for me to throw my scepter at the injurious gods,

580
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:17.200
to tell them that this world did equal theirs

581
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:23.670
till they had stolen our jewel.

582
00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.100
All's but naught.

583
00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.470
Patience is sottish,

584
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:36.870
and impatience does become a dog that's mad.

585
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:46.270
Then is it sin to rush into the secret house of death?

586
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:51.530
Ere death dare come to us?

587
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.400
How do you, women?

588
00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:02.170
What, what! Good cheer!

589
00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:06.230
Why, how now, Charmian!

590
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:10.500
My noble girls!

591
00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:16.330
Ah, women, women, look, our lamp is spent.

592
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.300
It's out.

593
00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.570
Good sirs, take heart.

594
00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.900
We'll bury him.

595
00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.100
And then what's brave, what's noble,

596
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:34.230
let's do it after the high Roman fashion

597
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:39.770
and make death proud to take us.

598
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:44.770
Come. Away.

599
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:59.830
This case of that huge spirit now is cold.

600
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.930
Ah, women, women!

601
00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:06.470
Come.

602
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.730
We have no friend but resolution

603
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:14.970
and the briefest end.

604
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.970
