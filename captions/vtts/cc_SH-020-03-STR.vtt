That I shall losedistinction in my joys;

179
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.130
As doth a battle, whenthey charge on heaps

180
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.100
The enemy flying.

181
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.670
She's making her ready,she'll come straight:

182
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.800
you must be witty now.She does so blush,

183
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.700
and fetches her wind so short,

184
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.130
as if she were frayed witha sprite: I'll fetch her.

185
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.630
It is the prettiest villain:

186
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.100
she fetches her breath asshort as a new-ta'en sparrow.

187
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.900
Even such a passion dothembrace my bosom:

188
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.170
My heart beats thickerthan a feverous pulse;

189
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.730
And all my powers do theirbestowing lose,

190
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.830
Like vassalage at unawaresencountering

191
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.430
The eye of majesty.

192
00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:04.970
Come, come, what need youblush? shame's a baby.

193
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.700
Here she is now: swear theoaths now to her that

194
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.870
you have sworn to me.What, are you gone again?

195
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.930
you must be watched ere yoube made tame, must you?

196
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.900
Come your ways, come yourways; an you draw backward,

197
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:27.000
we'll put you i' the fills.Why do you not speak to her?

198
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.100
Come, draw this curtain, andlet's see your picture.

199
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.670
Alas the day, how loath youare to offend daylight!

200
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.700
an 'twere dark,you'ld close sooner.

201
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:49.070
So, so; rub on, andkiss the mistress.

202
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.730
How now! a kiss in fee-farm!build there, carpenter;

203
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.870
the air is sweet.

204
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.030
Nay, you shall fight yourhearts out ere I part you.

205
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.000
The falcon as the tercel, forall the ducks i' the river:

206
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.830
go to, go to.

207
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.600
You have bereft meof all words, lady.

208
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.800
Words pay no debts,give her deeds:

209
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.530
but she'll bereave youo' the deeds too,

210
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:32.630
if she call your activity inquestion. What, billing again?

211
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.900
Come in, come in: I'll goget a fire.

212
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.270
Will you walk in, my lord?

213
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.230
O Cressida, how often haveI wished me thus!

214
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:49.700
Wished, my lord! The godsgrant,--O my lord!

215
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.830
What should they grant? whatmakes this pretty abruption?

216
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.300
What too curious dregespies my sweet lady

217
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.330
in the fountain of our love?

218
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.170
More dregs than water, ifmy fears have eyes.

219
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.230
Fears make devils of cherubims;they never see truly.

220
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.830
Blind fear, that seeingreason leads, finds safer

221
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.370
footing than blind reasonstumbling without fear:

222
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.800
to fear the worst oftcures the worse.

223
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.030
O, let my ladyapprehend no fear:

224
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.800
in all Cupid's pageant thereis presented no monster.

225
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.800
Nor nothing monstrousneither?

226
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.630
Nothing, but our undertakings;when we vow to weep seas,

227
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.030
live in fire, eatrocks, tame tigers;

228
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.370
thinking it harder for ourmistress to devise imposition

229
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.000
enough than for us to undergoany difficulty imposed.

230
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.070
This is the monstruosityin love, lady,

231
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.630
that the will is infiniteand the execution confined,

232
00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:05.700
that the desire is boundlessand the act a slave to limit.

233
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.430
They say all lovers swear moreperformance than they are able

234
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.170
and yet reserve an abilitythat they never perform,

235
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.230
vowing more than theperfection of ten

236
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.470
and discharging less thanthe tenth part of one.

237
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.900
They that have the voice oflions and the act of hares,

238
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.700
are they not monsters?

239
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:35.030
Are there such?such are not we:

240
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.600
praise us as we are tasted,allow us as we prove;

241
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.300
our head shall go baretill merit crown it:

242
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.600
no perfection in reversion shallhave a praise in present:

243
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.700
we will not name desertbefore his birth,

244
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.570
and, being born, hisaddition shall be humble.

245
00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.800
Few words to fair faith:

246
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.070
Troilus shall be such to Cressidas what envy can say worst

247
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.430
shall be a mock for histruth, and what truth can

248
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:17.170
speak truest not truerthan Troilus.

249
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.200
Will you walk in, my lord?

250
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.100
What, blushing still? haveyou not done talking yet?

251
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.400
Well, uncle, what folly Icommit, I dedicate to you.

252
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.430
I thank you for that: ifmy lord get a boy of you,

253
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.430
you'll give him me.Be true to my lord:

254
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.200
if he flinch, chide me for it.

255
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.730
You know now your hostages;

256
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.400
your uncle's wordand my firm faith.

257
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.130
Nay, I'll give my word forher too: our kindred,

258
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.270
though they be longere they are wooed,

259
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.330
they are constant being won:they are burs, I can tell you;

260
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.400
they'll stick where theyare thrown.

261
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:57.070
Boldness comes to me now,and brings me heart.

262
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:07.400
Prince Troilus, I haveloved you night and day

263
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.970
For many weary months.

264
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.700
Why was my Cressid then sohard to win?

265
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.200
Hard to seem won: but Iwas won, my lord,

266
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:22.100
With the first glance thatever--pardon me--

267
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.970
If I confess much, youwill play the tyrant.

268
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.200
No.

269
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.830
I love you now; but not,till now, so much

270
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.970
But I might master it: infaith, I lie;

271
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.730
My thoughts were likeunbridled children, grown

272
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.570
Too headstrong for theirmother. See, we fools!

273
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.870
Why have I blabb'd? whoshall be true to us,

274
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.000
When we are so unsecret toourselves?

275
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.370
But, though I loved youwell, I woo'd you not;

276
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.570
And yet, good faith, Iwish'd myself a man,

277
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.970
Or that we women had men'sprivilege Of speaking first.

278
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.170
Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,

279
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.870
For in this rapture Ishall surely speak

280
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:03.700
The thing I shall repent.See, see, your silence,

281
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.330
Cunning in dumbness, frommy weakness draws

282
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.270
My very soul of counsel!stop my mouth.

283
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:16.100
And shall, albeit sweetmusic issues thence.

284
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.170
Pretty, i' faith.

285
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.070
My lord, I do beseech you,pardon me;

286
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.700
'Twas not my purpose, thusto beg a kiss:

287
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.130
I am ashamed. O heavens!what have I done?

288
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.270
For this time will I takemy leave, my lord.

289
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.500
Your leave, sweet Cressid!

290
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.500
Leave! an you take leavetill to-morrow morning,--

291
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.100
Pray you, content you.

292
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.570
What offends you, lady?

293
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.070
Sir, mine own company.

294
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.770
You cannot shun Yourself.

295
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.000
Let me go and try:

296
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.130
I have a kind of selfresides with you;

297
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.300
But an unkind self, thatitself will leave,

298
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.430
To be another's fool. Iwould be gone:

299
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.400
Where is my wit? I knownot what I speak.

300
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.300
Well know they what theyspeak that speak so wisely.

301
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.270
Perchance, my lord, I showmore craft than love;

302
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.170
And fell so roundly to alarge confession,

303
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:26.000
To angle for your thoughts:but you are wise,

304
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.600
Or else you love not, forto be wise and love

305
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:36.300
Exceeds man's might; thatdwells with gods above.

306
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:43.930
O that I thought it couldbe in a woman--

307
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.970
As, if it can, I willpresume in you--

308
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:57.670
To feed for aye her rampand flames of love;

309
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:02.130
To keep her constancy inplight and youth,

310
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.800
Outliving beauty'soutward, with a mind

311
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.670
That doth renew swifterthan blood decays!

312
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.170
Or that persuasion couldbut thus convince me,

313
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.800
That my integrity andtruth to you

314
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.130
Might be affronted withthe match and weight

315
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.030
Of such a winnow'd purityin love;

316
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:24.200
How were I then uplifted!but, alas!

317
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.330
I am as true as truth'ssimplicity

318
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.970
And simpler than theinfancy of truth.

319
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.170
In that I'll war with you.

320
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.770
O virtuous fight,

321
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.930
When right with right warswho shall be most right!

322
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.830
True swains in love shallin the world to come

323
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.100
Approve their truths byTroilus: when their rhymes,

324
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.570
Full of protest, of oathand big compare,

325
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.530
Want similes, truth tiredwith iteration,

326
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.830
As true as steel, asplantage to the moon,

327
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:04.130
As sun to day, as turtleto her mate,

328
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:12.600
As iron to adamant, asearth to the centre,

329
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:20.500
Yet, after all comparisonsof truth,

330
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.730
As truth's authenticauthor to be cited,

331
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:33.000
'As true as Troilus' shallcrown up the verse,

332
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.870
And sanctify the numbers.

333
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.770
Prophet may you be!

334
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:45.700
If I be false, or swerve ahair from truth,

335
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.000
When time is old and hathforgot itself,

336
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
When waterdrops have wornthe stones of Troy,

337
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.770
And blind oblivionswallow'd cities up,

338
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.200
And mighty statescharacterless are grated

339
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.230
To dusty nothing, yet letmemory,

340
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.870
From false to false, amongfalse maids in love,

341
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.400
Upbraid my falsehood! whenthey've said 'as false

342
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.570
As air, as water, wind, orsandy earth,

343
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.270
As fox to lamb, as wolf toheifer's calf,

344
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:25.300
Pard to the hind, orstepdame to her son,'

345
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:32.100
'Yea,' let them say, to stickthe heart of falsehood,

346
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.900
'As false as Cressid.'

347
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:45.570
Go to, a bargain made: seal it,seal it; I'll be the witness.

348
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.630
Here I hold your hand,here my cousin's.

349
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.400
If ever you provefalse one to another,

350
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.970
since I have taken such painsto bring you together,

351
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.830
let all pitiful goers-betweenbe called to the world's end

352
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.570
after my name; callthem all Pandars;

353
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.600
let all constantmen be Troiluses,

354
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:14.830
all false women Cressids, andall brokers-between Pandars!

355
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.770
say, amen.

356
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.300
Amen.

357
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.830
Amen.

358
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.400
Amen. Whereupon I will showyou a chamber with a bed;

359
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.570
which bed, because itshall not speak of your

360
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:41.300
pretty encounters, pressit to death: away!

361
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.430
And Cupid grant alltongue-tied maidens here

362
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:56.230
Bed, chamber, Pandarto provide this gear!

363
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.470


364
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.470
Now, princes, for theservice I have done,

365
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.400
The advantage of the timeprompts me aloud

366
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.170
To call for recompense.Appear it to your mind

367
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.770
That, through the sight Ibear in things to love,

368
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.870
I have abandon'd Troy,left my possession,

369
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.900
Incurr'd a traitor's name;exposed myself,

370
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.070
From certain and possess'dconveniences,

371
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.030
To doubtful fortunes;sequestering from me all

372
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.630
That time, acquaintance,custom and condition

373
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.070
Made tame and mostfamiliar to my nature,

374
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.830
And here, to do youservice, am become

375
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:46.300
As new into the world,strange, unacquainted:

376
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.730
I do beseech you, as inway of taste,

377
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.930
To give me now a littlebenefit,

378
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.430
Out of those manyregister'd in promise,

379
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.170
Which, you say, live tocome in my behalf.

380
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.930
What wouldst thou of us,Trojan? make demand.

381
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.630
You have a Trojanprisoner, call'd Antenor,

382
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.370
Yesterday took: Troy holdshim very dear.

383
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.500
Oft have you--often haveyou thanks therefore--

384
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.400
Desired my Cressid inright great exchange,

385
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.600
Whom Troy hath still denied:

386
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.170
but this Antenor, I know, issuch a wrest in their affairs

387
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.200
That their negotiationsall must slack,

388
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.500
Wanting his manage; andthey will almost

389
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.070
Give us a prince of blood,a son of Priam,

390
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.970
In change of him: let himbe sent, great princes,

391
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.570
And he shall buy mydaughter; and her presence

392
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.400
Shall quite strike off allservice I have done,

393
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.300
In most accepted pain.

394
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.000
Let Diomedes bear him,

395
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.770
And bring us Cressidhither: Calchas shall have

396
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.030
What he requests of us.Good Diomed,

397
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.930
Furnish you fairly forthis interchange:

398
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.170
Withal bring word ifHector will to-morrow

399
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.470
Be answer'd in hischallenge: Ajax is ready.

400
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.500
This shall I undertake;and 'tis a burden

401
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.170
Which I am proud to bear.

402
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.570
Achilles stands i' theentrance of his tent:

403
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.170
Please it our general topass strangely by him,

404
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.930
As if he were forgot; and,princes all,

405
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.270
Lay negligent and looseregard upon him:

406
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.400
I will come last. 'Tislike he'll question me

407
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.900
Why such unplausive eyesare bent on him:

408
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.600
If so, I have derisionmedicinable,

409
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.530
To use between yourstrangeness and his pride,

410
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.900
Which his own will shallhave desire to drink:

411
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.870
It may be good: pride hathno other glass

412
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.200
To show itself but pride,for supple knees

413
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.370
Feed arrogance and are theproud man's fees.

414
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.500
We'll execute yourpurpose, and put on

415
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.030
A form of strangeness aswe pass along:

416
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.100
So do each lord, andeither greet him not,

417
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.370
Or else disdainfully,which shall shake him more

418
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:22.370
Than if not look'd on. Iwill lead the way.

419
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.170
Supple knead.

420
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.370
What, comes the general tospeak with me?

421
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.330
You know my mind, I'llfight no more 'gainst Troy.

422
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.170
What says Achilles? wouldhe aught with us?

423
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.430
Would you, my lord, aughtwith the general?

424
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.870
No.

425
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:49.870
Nothing, my lord.

426
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.400
The better.

427
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.770
Good day, good day.

428
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.200
How do you? how do you?

429
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.430
What, does the cuckoldscorn me?

430
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.600
How now, Patroclus!

431
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.230
Good morrow, Ajax.

432
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.230
Ha?

433
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.400
Good morrow.

434
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.430
Ay, and good next day too.

435
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.530
What mean these fellows?Know they not Achilles?

436
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.230
They pass by strangely:they were used to bend

437
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.670
To send their smilesbefore them to Achilles;

438
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.430
To come as humbly as theyused to creep

439
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.370
To holy altars.

440
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.970
What, am I poor of late?

441
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.530
'Tis certain, greatness, oncefall'n out with fortune,

442
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.330
Must fall out with mentoo: what the declined is

443
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.800
He shall as soon read inthe eyes of others

444
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.400
As feel in his own fall;for men, like butterflies,

445
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.200
Show not their mealy wingsbut to the summer,

446
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.670
And not a man, for beingsimply man,

447
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.570
Hath any honour, buthonour for those honours

448
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.070
That are without him, asplace, riches, favour,

449
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.930
Prizes of accident as oftas merit:

450
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.600
Which when they fall, asbeing slippery standers,

451
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.000
The love that lean'd onthem as slippery too,

452
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.070
Do one pluck down anotherand together

453
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.970
Die in the fall. But 'tisnot so with me:

454
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.970
Fortune and I are friends:I do enjoy

455
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.630
At ample point all that Idid possess,

456
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.030
Save these men's looks;who do, methinks,

457
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.470
find out Something not worthin me such rich beholding

458
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.200
As they have often given.Here is Ulysses;

459
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.870
I'll interrupt hisreading.

460
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.300
How now Ulysses!

461
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.300
Now, great Thetis' son!

462
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.100
What are you reading?

463
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.430
A strange fellow here

464
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.200
Writes me: 'That man, howdearly ever parted,

465
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.800
How much in having, orwithout or in,

466
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.830
Cannot make boast to havethat which he hath,

467
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.230
Nor feels not what heowes, but by reflection;

468
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.430
As when his virtuesshining upon others

469
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.000
Heat them and they retortthat heat again

470
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.370
To the first giver.'

471
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.730
This is not strange,Ulysses.

472
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.000
The beauty that is bornehere in the face

473
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.030
The bearer knows not, butcommends itself

474
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.930
To others' eyes; nor doththe eye itself,

475
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.570
That most pure spirit ofsense, behold itself,

476
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.700
Not going from itself; buteye to eye opposed

477
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.530
Salutes each other witheach other's form;

478
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.000
For speculation turns notto itself,

479
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Till it hath travell'd andis mirror'd there

480
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.500
Where it may see itself.This is not strange at all.

481
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.970
I do not strain at theposition,--

482
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.770
It is familiar,--but atthe author's drift;

483
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.770
Who, in his circumstance,expressly proves

484
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.630
That no man is the lord ofany thing,

485
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.970
Though in and of him therebe much consisting,

486
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.400
Till he communicate hisparts to others:

487
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.800
Nor doth he of himselfknow them for aught

488
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.100
Till he behold them form'din the applause

489
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.670
Where they're extended;who, like an arch,

490
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.500
reverberates

491
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.300
The voice again, or, likea gate of steel

492
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.570
Fronting the sun, receivesand renders back

493
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.800
His figure and his heat. Iwas much wrapt in this;

494
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.800
And apprehended hereimmediately

495
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.330
The unknown Ajax.

496
00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.530
Heavens, what a man isthere! a very horse,

497
00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:16.370
That has he knows not what.Nature, what things there are

498
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.300
Most abject in regard anddear in use!

499
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.270
What things again mostdear in the esteem

500
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.500
And poor in worth! Nowshall we see to-morrow--

501
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.670
An act that very chancedoth throw upon him--

502
00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:34.200
Ajax renown'd. O heavens,what some men do,

503
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.930
While some men leave todo!

504
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.770
How some men creep inskittish fortune's hall,

505
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.570
Whiles others play theidiots in her eyes!

506
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.430
How one man eats intoanother's pride,

507
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.170
While pride is fasting inhis wantonness!

508
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.530
To see these Grecianlords!--why, even already

509
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.970
They clap the lubber Ajaxon the shoulder,

510
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.270
As if his foot were onbrave Hector's breast

511
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.630
And great Troy shrieking.

512
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.200
I do believe it; for theypass'd by me

513
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.770
As misers do by beggars,neither gave to me

514
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:08.930
Good word nor look: what,are my deeds forgot?

515
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.670
Time hath, my lord, awallet at his back,

516
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:18.130
Wherein he puts alms foroblivion,

517
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.270
A great-sized monster ofingratitudes:

518
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:25.370
Those scraps are good deedspast; which are devour'd

519
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.200
As fast as they are made,forgot as soon

520
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.400
As done: perseverance,dear my lord,

521
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.700
Keeps honour bright: tohave done is to hang

522
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.000
Quite out of fashion,like a rusty mail

523
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.370
In monumental mockery.Take the instant way;

524
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.670
For honour travels in astrait so narrow,

525
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.470
Where one but goes abreast:keep then the path;

526
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.130
For emulation hath athousand sons

527
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.700
That one by one pursue: ifyou give way,

528
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.830
Or hedge aside from thedirect forthright,

529
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.800
Like to an enter'd tide,they all rush by

530
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.300
And leave you hindmost;

531
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.170
Or like a gallant horsefall'n in first rank,

532
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.630
Lie there for pavement tothe abject rear,

533
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:12.430
O'er-run and trampled on:then what they do in present,

534
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.370
Though less than yours inpast, must o'ertop yours;

535
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:20.770
For time is like afashionable host

536
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.530
That slightly shakes hisparting guest by the hand,

537
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.470
And with his armsoutstretch'd, as he would fly,

538
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.800
Grasps in the comer:welcome ever smiles,

539
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.470
And farewell goes out sighing.O, let not virtue seek

540
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.400
Remuneration for the thingit was;

541
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.930
For beauty, wit,

542
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.530
High birth, vigour ofbone, desert in service,

543
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.570
Love, friendship, charity,are subjects all

544
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.430
To envious andcalumniating time.

545
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.700
One touch of nature makesthe whole world kin,

546
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.830
That all with one consentpraise new-born gawds,

547
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.100
Though they are made andmoulded of things past,

548
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.670
And give to dust that is alittle gilt

549
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.970
More laud than gilto'er-dusted.

550
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:11.400
The present eye praisesthe present object.

551
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.400
Then marvel not, thougreat and complete man,

552
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.230
That all the Greeks beginto worship Ajax;

553
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.170
Since things in motionsooner catch the eye

554
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:24.130
Than what not stirs. Thecry went once on thee,

555
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.200
And still it might, andyet it may again,

556
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.670
If thou wouldst not entombthyself alive

557
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.400
And case thy reputation inthy tent;

558
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.830
Whose glorious deeds, butin these fields of late,

559
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.830
Made emulous missions'mongst the gods themselves

560
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.970
And drave great Mars tofaction.

561
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.470
Of this my privacy

562
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.800
I have strong reasons.

563
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.600
But 'gainst your privacy

564
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.070
The reasons are morepotent and heroical:

565
00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:01.130
'Tis known, Achilles, thatyou are in love

566
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.030
With one of Priam'sdaughters.

567
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.070
Ha! known!

568
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.730
Is that a wonder?

569
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:07.770
The providence that's in awatchful state

570
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.770
Knows almost every grainof Plutus' gold,

571
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.430
Finds bottom in theuncomprehensive deeps,

572
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.030
Keeps place with thoughtand almost, like the gods,

573
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:19.000
Does thoughts unveil intheir dumb cradles.

574
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.570
There is a mystery--in thesoul of state

575
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.700
with whom relation-- Durst nevermeddle;

576
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.230
Which hath an operationmore divine

577
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.000
Than breath or pen cangive expressure to:

578
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.430
All the commerce that youhave had with Troy

579
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:36.330
As perfectly is ours asyours, my lord;

580
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.130
And better would it fitAchilles much

581
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:43.600
To throw down Hector thanPolyxena:

582
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.100
But it must grieve youngPyrrhus now at home,

583
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.070
When fame shall in ourislands sound her trump,

584
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.630
And all the Greekish girlsshall tripping sing,

585
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.330
'Great Hector's sister didAchilles win,

586
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.470
But our great Ajax bravelybeat down him.'

587
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:07.170
Farewell, my lord: I asyour lover speak;

588
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:13.400
The fool slides o'er theice that you should break.

589
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.570
To this effect, Achilles,have I moved you:

590
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.700
A woman impudent andmannish grown

591
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.900
Is not more loathed thanan effeminate man

592
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.430
In time of action. I standcondemn'd for this;

593
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.200
They think my littlestomach to the war

594
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.130
And your great love to merestrains you thus:

595
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.500
Sweet, rouse yourself; andthe weak wanton Cupid

596
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.470
Shall from your neckunloose his amorous fold,

597
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:38.200
And, like a dew-drop fromthe lion's mane,

598
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.530
Be shook to air.

599
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.170
Shall Ajax fight withHector?

600
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.500
Ay, and perhaps receivemuch honour by him.

601
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.400
I see my reputation is atstake

602
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.470
My fame is shrewdly gored.

603
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.170
O, then, beware;

604
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.130
Those wounds heal ill thatmen do give themselves:

605
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.800
Omission to do what isnecessary

606
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.570
Seals a commission to ablank of danger;

607
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.770
And danger, like an ague,subtly taints

608
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:08.870
Even then when we sit idlyin the sun.

609
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.130
Go call Thersites hither,sweet Patroclus:

610
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.830
I'll send the fool to Ajaxand desire him

611
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:20.700
To invite the Trojan lordsafter the combat

612
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.030
To see us here unarm'd: Ihave a woman's longing,

613
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.800
An appetite that I am sickwithal,

614
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.000
To see great Hector in hisweeds of peace,

615
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.030
To talk with him and tobehold his visage,

616
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.900
Even to my full of view.

617
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.100
A labour saved!

618
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.200
A wonder!

619
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.330
What?

620
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.200
Ajax goes up and down thefield, asking for himself.

621
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.170
How so?

622
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.570
He must fight singlyto-morrow with Hector,

623
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.330
and is so prophetically proudof an heroical cudgelling

624
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.230
that he raves insaying nothing.

625
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.600
Stalks up anddown like a peacock,

626
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.400
--a stride and a stand:

627
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.030
The man's undone forever; forif Hector break not his neck

628
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.370
i' the combat, he'll break't himself in vain-glory.

629
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.200
He knows not me: Isaid 'Good morrow,

630
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.270
Ajax;' and he replies'Thanks, Agamemnon.'

631
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.170
What think you of this man thattakes me for the general?

632
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.370
He's grown a very land-fish,language-less, a monster.

633
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.170
Thou must be my ambassadorto him, Thersites.

634
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.300
Who, I? why, he'llanswer nobody;

635
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.500
he professes not answering:speaking is for beggars;

636
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.530
he wears his tongue in's arms.I will put on his presence:

637
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.700
let Patroclus makedemands to me,

638
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.400
you shall see thepageant of Ajax.

639
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.570
To him, Patroclus;

640
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.700
tell him I humbly desirethe valiant Ajax

641
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.670
to invite the mostvalorous Hector

642
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.270
to come unarmedto my tent,

643
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.630
and to procure safe-conduct forhis person of the magnanimous

644
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.730
and most illustrioussix-or-seven-times-honoure d

645
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.230
captain-general of theGrecian army, Agamemnon,

646
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.400
et cetera. Do this.

647
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.000
Jove bless great Ajax!

648
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.500
Hum!

649
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.100
I come from the worthyAchilles,--

650
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.330
Ha!

651
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.000
Who most humbly desires you toinvite Hector to his tent,--

652
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.970
Hum!

653
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.600
And to procure safe-conductfrom Agamemnon.

654
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.770
Agamemnon!

655
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:03.870
Ay, my lord.

656
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.700
Ha!

657
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.270
What say you to't?

658
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.800
God b' wi' you, with allmy heart.

659
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.300
Your answer, sir.

660
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.600
If to-morrow be a fairday, by eleven o'clock

661
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.400
it will go one way or other:howsoever, he shall pay for me

662
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.900
ere he has me.

663
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.800
Your answer, sir.

664
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800
Fare you well, with all myheart.

665
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.000
Why, but he is not in thistune, is he?

666
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.330
No, but he's out o' tunethus. What music will be in

667
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.400
him when Hector hasknocked out his brains,

668
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.700
I know not;

669
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.900
Come, thou must deliver aletter to him straight.

670
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.800
Let me carry another to hishorse; for that's the more

671
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.330
capable creature.

672
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.000
My mind is troubled, likea fountain stirr'd;

673
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.070
And I myself see not thebottom of it.

674
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.500
Would the fountain of yourmind were clear again,

675
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.100
that I might water an assat it! I had rather be a

676
00:37:54.100 --> 00:38:00.170
tick in a sheep than sucha valiant ignorance.

677
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.070
