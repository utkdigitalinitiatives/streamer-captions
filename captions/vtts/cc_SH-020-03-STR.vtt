00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.370
Friend, you! pray you, a word:

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.430
do not you follow the young Lord Paris?

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.570
Ay, sir, when he goes before me.

5
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.600
You depend upon him, I mean?

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.630
Sir, I do depend upon the lord.

7
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.830
You depend upon a noble gentleman;

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.870
I must needs praise him.

9
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.530
The lord be praised!

10
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.130
You know me, do you not?

11
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.600
Faith, sir, superficially.

12
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.800
Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.

13
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.270
I hope I shall know your honour better.

14
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.430
I do desire it.

15
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.400
You are in the state of grace.

16
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.600
Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.

17
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.130
(♪music within)

18
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.430
What music is this?

19
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.930
I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.

20
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.200
Know you the musicians?

21
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.370
Wholly, sir.

22
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.330
Who play they to?

23
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.000
To the hearers, sir.

24
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
At whose pleasure, friend

25
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.730
At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.

26
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.630
Command, I mean, friend.

27
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.700
Who shall I command, sir?

28
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.830
Friend, we understand not one another:

29
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.870
I am too courtly and thou art too cunning.

30
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.600
At whose request do these men play?

31
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.770
That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir,

32
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.830
at the request of Paris my lord,

33
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.730
who's there in person; with him,

34
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.470
the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty,

35
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.600
love's invisible soul,--

36
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.870
Who, my cousin Cressida?

37
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.830
No, sir, Helen:

38
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.230
could you not find out that by her attributes?

39
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.330
It should seem, fellow,

40
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.670
that thou hast not seen the Lady Cressida.

41
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.670
I come to speak with Paris from the Prince Troilus:

42
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.000
I will make a complimental assault

43
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.670
upon him, for my business seethes.

44
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.170
Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!

45
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.430
Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair company!

46
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.230
fair desires, in all fair measure,

47
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.300
fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!

48
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.970
fair thoughts be your fair pillow!

49
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.470
Dear lord, you are full of fair words.

50
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.030
You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen.

51
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.770
Fair prince, here is good broken music.

52
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.900
You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life,

53
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.670
you shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out

54
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.470
with a piece of your performance.

55
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.470
Nell, he is full of harmony.

56
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.330
Truly, lady, no.

57
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.270
O, sir,--

58
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.770
Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.

59
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.730
Well said, my lord!

60
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.470
I have business to my lord, dear queen.

61
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.200
My lord, will you vouchsafe me a word?

62
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.970
Nay, this shall not hedge us out:

63
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.830
we'll hear you sing, certainly.

64
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.330
Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me.

65
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.770
But, marry, thus, my lord:

66
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.330
my dear lord and most esteemed friend, your brother Troilus,--

67
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.730
My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--

68
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.770
Go to, sweet queen, to go:

69
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.030
--commends himself most affectionately to you,--

70
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.130
You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,

71
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.300
our melancholy upon your head!

72
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.230
Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.

73
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.230
And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.

74
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.770
Nay, that shall not serve your turn;

75
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.730
that shall not, in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words;

76
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.470
no, no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king

77
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.300
call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.

78
00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.430
My Lord Pandarus,--

79
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.870
What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?

80
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.030
What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?

81
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.070
Nay, but, my lord,--

82
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.500
What says my sweet queen?

83
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.900
You must not know where he sups.

84
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.170
I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.

85
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.630
No, no, no such matter; you are wide:

86
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.000
come, your disposer is sick.

87
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.330
Well, I'll make excuse.

88
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.600
Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?

89
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.570
no, your poor disposer's sick.

90
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.730
I spy.

91
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.670
You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an instrument.

92
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.630
Now, sweet queen.

93
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.200
Why, this is kindly done.

94
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.400
My niece is horribly in love

95
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.630
with a thing you have.

96
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.800
She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.

97
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.530
He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.

98
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.730
My cousin will fall out with you.

99
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.130
Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.

100
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.100
Come, come, I'll hear no more of this;

101
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.700
I'll sing you a song now.

102
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.430
Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord,

103
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.070
thou hast a fine forehead.

104
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.230
Ay, you may, you may.

105
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.200
Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.

106
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.170
Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.

107
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.200
Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.

108
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.900
In good troth, it begins so.

110
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.900
Love, love, nothing but love, still love. still more!

Shoots buck and doe:

The shaft confounds,

114
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.900
Not that it wounds,

115
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.400
But tickles still the sore.

116
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.730
These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!

117
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.470
Yet that which seems the wound to kill,

Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!

Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!

In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.

126
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.770
He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot blood,

127
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.300
and hot blood begets hot thoughts,

128
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.600
and hot thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.

129
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.670
Is this the generation of love?

130
00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:07.930
hot blood, hot thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:

131
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.770
is love a generation of vipers?

132
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.430
Sweet lord, who's a-field to-day?

133
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.600
Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor,

134
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.030
and all the gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day,

135
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.130
but my Nell would not have it so.

136
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:29.830
How chance my brother Troilus went not?

137
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.570
He hangs the lip at something:

138
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.530
you know all, Lord Pandarus.

139
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.770
Not I, honey-sweet queen.

140
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.770
I long to hear how they sped to-day.

141
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.500
You'll remember your brother's excuse?

142
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.800
To a hair.

143
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.530
Farewell, sweet queen.

144
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.600
Commend me to your niece.

145
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.770
I will, sweet queen.

They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.270
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you

149
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.900
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,

150
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.570
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,

151
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.770
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel

152
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:23.030
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more

153
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.330
Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.

Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,

Yea, overshines ourself.

Sweet, above thought I love thee.

159
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.170
Have you seen my cousin?

160
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.000
No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,

161
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.170
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks

162
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.470
Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,

163
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:14.670
And give me swift transportance to those fields

164
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.130
Where I may wallow in the lily-beds

165
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.300
Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,

166
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.270
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings

167
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.370
And fly with me to Cressid!

168
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.730
I'll bring her straight.

169
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.700
I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.

170
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.970
The imaginary relish is so sweet

171
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:45.300
That it enchants my sense: what will it be,

172
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.530
When that the watery palate tastes indeed

173
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:55.470
Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,

174
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.200
Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,

175
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.870
Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,

176
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.800
For the capacity of my ruder powers:

177
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.200
I fear it much; and I do fear besides,

178
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.800
That I shall lose distinction in my joys;

179
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.130
As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps

180
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.100
The enemy flying.

181
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.670
She's making her ready, she'll come straight:

182
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.800
you must be witty now. She does so blush,

183
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.700
and fetches her wind so short,

184
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.130
as if she were frayed with a sprite: I'll fetch her.

185
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.630
It is the prettiest villain:

186
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.100
she fetches her breath as short as a new-ta'en sparrow.

187
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.900
Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:

188
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.170
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;

189
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.730
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,

190
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.830
Like vassalage at unawares encountering

191
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.430
The eye of majesty.

192
00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:04.970
Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.

193
00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.700
Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that

194
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.870
you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?

195
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.930
you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?

196
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.900
Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,

197
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:27.000
we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to her?

198
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:37.100
Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your picture.

199
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.670
Alas the day, how loath you are to offend daylight!

200
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.700
an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.

201
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:49.070
So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress.

202
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.730
How now! a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter;

203
00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.870
the air is sweet.

204
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:10.030
Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you.

205
00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.000
The falcon as the tercel, for all the ducks i' the river:

206
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.830
go to, go to.

207
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.600
You have bereft me of all words, lady.

208
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.800
Words pay no debts, give her deeds:

209
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.530
but she'll bereave you o' the deeds too,

210
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:32.630
if she call your activity in question. What, billing again?

211
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.900
Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.

212
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.270
Will you walk in, my lord?

213
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.230
O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!

214
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:49.700
Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!

215
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:58.830
What should they grant? what makes this pretty abruption?

216
00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.300
What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady

217
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.330
in the fountain of our love?

218
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.170
More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.

219
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.230
Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.

220
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.830
Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer

221
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:18.370
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear:

222
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.800
to fear the worst oft cures the worse.

223
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.030
O, let my lady apprehend no fear:

224
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.800
in all Cupid's pageant there is presented no monster.

225
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.800
Nor nothing monstrous neither?

226
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.630
Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep seas,

227
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.030
live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers;

228
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.370
thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition

229
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.000
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.

230
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.070
This is the monstruosity in love, lady,

231
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.630
that the will is infinite and the execution confined,

232
00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:05.700
that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.

233
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.430
They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able

234
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.170
and yet reserve an ability that they never perform,

235
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.230
vowing more than the perfection of ten

236
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:20.470
and discharging less than the tenth part of one.

237
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.900
They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,

238
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.700
are they not monsters?

239
00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:35.030
Are there such? such are not we:

240
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.600
praise us as we are tasted, allow us as we prove;

241
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.300
our head shall go bare till merit crown it:

242
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:47.600
no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present:

243
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.700
we will not name desert before his birth,

244
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.570
and, being born, his addition shall be humble.

245
00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.800
Few words to fair faith:

246
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:07.070
Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst

247
00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:11.430
shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can

248
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:17.170
speak truest not truer than Troilus.

249
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:21.200
Will you walk in, my lord?

250
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.100
What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?

251
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.400
Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.

252
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.430
I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,

253
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.430
you'll give him me. Be true to my lord:

254
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:36.200
if he flinch, chide me for it.

255
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.730
You know now your hostages;

256
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.400
your uncle's word and my firm faith.

257
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.130
Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,

258
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:46.270
though they be long ere they are wooed,

259
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.330
they are constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;

260
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.400
they'll stick where they are thrown.

261
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:57.070
Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.

262
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:07.400
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day

263
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:09.970
For many weary months.

264
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.700
Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?

265
00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.200
Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,

266
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:22.100
With the first glance that ever--pardon me--

267
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.970
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.

268
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.200
No.

269
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.830
I love you now; but not, till now, so much

270
00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.970
But I might master it: in faith, I lie;

271
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.730
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown

272
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:38.570
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!

273
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.870
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,

274
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.000
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?

275
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.370
But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;

276
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.570
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,

277
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.970
Or that we women had men's privilege Of speaking first.

278
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.170
Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,

279
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.870
For in this rapture I shall surely speak

280
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:03.700
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,

281
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.330
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws

282
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.270
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.

283
00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:16.100
And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.

284
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.170
Pretty, i' faith.

285
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.070
My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;

286
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.700
'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:

287
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.130
I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?

288
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.270
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.

289
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.500
Your leave, sweet Cressid!

290
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.500
Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--

291
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.100
Pray you, content you.

292
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.570
What offends you, lady?

293
00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.070
Sir, mine own company.

294
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.770
You cannot shun Yourself.

295
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.000
Let me go and try:

296
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.130
I have a kind of self resides with you;

297
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.300
But an unkind self, that itself will leave,

298
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.430
To be another's fool. I would be gone:

299
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.400
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.

300
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.300
Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.

301
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.270
Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;

302
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.170
And fell so roundly to a large confession,

303
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:26.000
To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,

304
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.600
Or else you love not, for to be wise and love

305
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:36.300
Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.

306
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:43.930
O that I thought it could be in a woman--

307
00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.970
As, if it can, I will presume in you--

308
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:57.670
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;

309
00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:02.130
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,

310
00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:03.800
Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind

311
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.670
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!

312
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.170
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,

313
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:11.800
That my integrity and truth to you

314
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.130
Might be affronted with the match and weight

315
00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:19.030
Of such a winnow'd purity in love;

316
00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:24.200
How were I then uplifted! but, alas!

317
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.330
I am as true as truth's simplicity

318
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.970
And simpler than the infancy of truth.

319
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.170
In that I'll war with you.

320
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.770
O virtuous fight,

321
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:40.930
When right with right wars who shall be most right!

322
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.830
True swains in love shall in the world to come

323
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:50.100
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,

324
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.570
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,

325
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:56.530
Want similes, truth tired with iteration,

326
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:59.830
As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,

327
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:04.130
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,

328
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:12.600
As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,

329
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:20.500
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,

330
00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.730
As truth's authentic author to be cited,

331
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:33.000
'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,

332
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.870
And sanctify the numbers.

333
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:39.770
Prophet may you be!

334
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:45.700
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,

335
00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.000
When time is old and hath forgot itself,

336
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,

337
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.770
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,

338
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:58.200
And mighty states characterless are grated

339
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:02.230
To dusty nothing, yet let memory,

340
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:05.870
From false to false, among false maids in love,

341
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:10.400
Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false

342
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:16.570
As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,

343
00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:20.270
As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,

344
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:25.300
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'

345
00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:32.100
'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,

346
00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.900
'As false as Cressid.'

347
00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:45.570
Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the witness.

348
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.630
Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.

349
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.400
If ever you prove false one to another,

350
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.970
since I have taken such pains to bring you together,

351
00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.830
let all pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end

352
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.570
after my name; call them all Pandars;

353
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.600
let all constant men be Troiluses,

354
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:14.830
all false women Cressids, and all brokers-between Pandars!

355
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.770
say, amen.

356
00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:16.300
Amen.

357
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.830
Amen.

358
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.400
Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a bed;

359
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:27.570
which bed, because it shall not speak of your

360
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:41.300
pretty encounters, press it to death: away!

361
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.430
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here

362
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:56.230
Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!

363
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.470


364
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.470
Now, princes, for the service I have done,

365
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:09.400
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud

366
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.170
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind

367
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.770
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,

368
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:19.870
I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,

369
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:23.900
Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,

370
00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.070
From certain and possess'd conveniences,

371
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.030
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all

372
00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:32.630
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition

373
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.070
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,

374
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.830
And here, to do you service, am become

375
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:46.300
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:

376
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.730
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,

377
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.930
To give me now a little benefit,

378
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.430
Out of those many register'd in promise,

379
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:56.170
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

380
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:59.930
What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.

381
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.630
You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,

382
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:18.370
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.

383
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.500
Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--

384
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.400
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,

385
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.600
Whom Troy hath still denied:

386
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.170
but this Antenor, I know, is such a wrest in their affairs

387
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.200
That their negotiations all must slack,

388
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.500
Wanting his manage; and they will almost

389
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.070
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,

390
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.970
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,

391
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.570
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence

392
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:53.400
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,

393
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.300
In most accepted pain.

394
00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.000
Let Diomedes bear him,

395
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.770
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have

396
00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.030
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,

397
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:06.930
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:

398
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.170
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow

399
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.470
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.

400
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.500
This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden

401
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.170
Which I am proud to bear.

402
00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.570
Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:

403
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:28.170
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,

404
00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.930
As if he were forgot; and, princes all,

405
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.270
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:

406
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.400
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me

407
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.900
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:

408
00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.600
If so, I have derision medicinable,

409
00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.530
To use between your strangeness and his pride,

410
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:50.900
Which his own will shall have desire to drink:

411
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.870
It may be good: pride hath no other glass

412
00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:59.200
To show itself but pride, for supple knees

413
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.370
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.

414
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.500
We'll execute your purpose, and put on

415
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.030
A form of strangeness as we pass along:

416
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.100
So do each lord, and either greet him not,

417
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.370
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more

418
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:22.370
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.

419
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.170
Supple knead.

420
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.370
What, comes the general to speak with me?

421
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.330
You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.

422
00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.170
What says Achilles? would he aught with us?

423
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.430
Would you, my lord, aught with the general?

424
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:48.870
No.

425
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:49.870
Nothing, my lord.

426
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.400
The better.

427
00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.770
Good day, good day.

428
00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.200
How do you? how do you?

429
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.430
What, does the cuckold scorn me?

430
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:59.600
How now, Patroclus!

431
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.230
Good morrow, Ajax.

432
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.230
Ha?

433
00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.400
Good morrow.

434
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.430
Ay, and good next day too.

435
00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.530
What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?

436
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.230
They pass by strangely: they were used to bend

437
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.670
To send their smiles before them to Achilles;

438
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.430
To come as humbly as they used to creep

439
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.370
To holy altars.

440
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.970
What, am I poor of late?

441
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.530
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,

442
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.330
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is

443
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.800
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others

444
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:33.400
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,

445
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.200
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,

446
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.670
And not a man, for being simply man,

447
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.570
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours

448
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.070
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,

449
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.930
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:

450
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.600
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,

451
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.000
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,

452
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.070
Do one pluck down another and together

453
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:59.970
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:

454
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.970
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy

455
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.630
At ample point all that I did possess,

456
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:09.030
Save these men's looks; who do, methinks,

457
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:12.470
find out Something not worth in me such rich beholding

458
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.200
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;

459
00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.870
I'll interrupt his reading.

460
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.300
How now Ulysses!

461
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.300
Now, great Thetis' son!

462
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.100
What are you reading?

463
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.430
A strange fellow here

464
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.200
Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,

465
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.800
How much in having, or without or in,

466
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.830
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,

467
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:42.230
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;

468
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.430
As when his virtues shining upon others

469
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.000
Heat them and they retort that heat again

470
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.370
To the first giver.'

471
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.730
This is not strange, Ulysses.

472
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:55.000
The beauty that is borne here in the face

473
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.030
The bearer knows not, but commends itself

474
00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.930
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,

475
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.570
That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,

476
00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.700
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed

477
00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.530
Salutes each other with each other's form;

478
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:14.000
For speculation turns not to itself,

479
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there

480
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.500
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

481
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.970
I do not strain at the position,--

482
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.770
It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;

483
00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:29.770
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves

484
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.630
That no man is the lord of any thing,

485
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.970
Though in and of him there be much consisting,

486
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.400
Till he communicate his parts to others:

487
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:43.800
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught

488
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.100
Till he behold them form'd in the applause

489
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.670
Where they're extended; who, like an arch,

490
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.500
reverberates

491
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.300
The voice again, or, like a gate of steel

492
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.570
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back

493
00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.800
His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;

494
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.800
And apprehended here immediately

495
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.330
The unknown Ajax.

496
00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.530
Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,

497
00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:16.370
That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are

498
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.300
Most abject in regard and dear in use!

499
00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.270
What things again most dear in the esteem

500
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:24.500
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--

501
00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.670
An act that very chance doth throw upon him--

502
00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:34.200
Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,

503
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.930
While some men leave to do!

504
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:39.770
How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,

505
00:29:39.770 --> 00:29:42.570
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!

506
00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.430
How one man eats into another's pride,

507
00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.170
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!

508
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:51.530
To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already

509
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.970
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,

510
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.270
As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast

511
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.630
And great Troy shrieking.

512
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.200
I do believe it; for they pass'd by me

513
00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.770
As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me

514
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:08.930
Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?

515
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.670
Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,

516
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:18.130
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,

517
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:21.270
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:

518
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:25.370
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd

519
00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.200
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon

520
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.400
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,

521
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.700
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang

522
00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.000
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail

523
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.370
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;

524
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.670
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,

525
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.470
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;

526
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.130
For emulation hath a thousand sons

527
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.700
That one by one pursue: if you give way,

528
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.830
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,

529
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.800
Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by

530
00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:02.300
And leave you hindmost;

531
00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.170
Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,

532
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.630
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,

533
00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:12.430
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,

534
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.370
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;

535
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:20.770
For time is like a fashionable host

536
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.530
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,

537
00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.470
And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,

538
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.800
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,

539
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.470
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not virtue seek

540
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.400
Remuneration for the thing it was;

541
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:43.930
For beauty, wit,

542
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:47.530
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,

543
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.570
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all

544
00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:52.430
To envious and calumniating time.

545
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.700
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,

546
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.830
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,

547
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:02.100
Though they are made and moulded of things past,

548
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.670
And give to dust that is a little gilt

549
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.970
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.

550
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:11.400
The present eye praises the present object.

551
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.400
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,

552
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.230
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;

553
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.170
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye

554
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:24.130
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,

555
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.200
And still it might, and yet it may again,

556
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.670
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive

557
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.400
And case thy reputation in thy tent;

558
00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.830
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,

559
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.830
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves

560
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.970
And drave great Mars to faction.

561
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.470
Of this my privacy

562
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.800
I have strong reasons.

563
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.600
But 'gainst your privacy

564
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.070
The reasons are more potent and heroical:

565
00:32:57.070 --> 00:33:01.130
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love

566
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.030
With one of Priam's daughters.

567
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.070
Ha! known!

568
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:06.730
Is that a wonder?

569
00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:07.770
The providence that's in a watchful state

570
00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:09.770
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,

571
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.430
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,

572
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:15.030
Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,

573
00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:19.000
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.

574
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.570
There is a mystery--in the soul of state

575
00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.700
with whom relation-- Durst never meddle;

576
00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:27.230
Which hath an operation more divine

577
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:30.000
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:

578
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.430
All the commerce that you have had with Troy

579
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:36.330
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;

580
00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.130
And better would it fit Achilles much

581
00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:43.600
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:

582
00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.100
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,

583
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.070
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,

584
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.630
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,

585
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.330
'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,

586
00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:59.470
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'

587
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:07.170
Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;

588
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:13.400
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.

589
00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.570
To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:

590
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.700
A woman impudent and mannish grown

591
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.900
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man

592
00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.430
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;

593
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.200
They think my little stomach to the war

594
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.130
And your great love to me restrains you thus:

595
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.500
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid

596
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:36.470
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,

597
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:38.200
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,

598
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.530
Be shook to air.

599
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.170
Shall Ajax fight with Hector?

600
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.500
Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.

601
00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.400
I see my reputation is at stake

602
00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.470
My fame is shrewdly gored.

603
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:53.170
O, then, beware;

604
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:56.130
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:

605
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:57.800
Omission to do what is necessary

606
00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.570
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;

607
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.770
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints

608
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:08.870
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.

609
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.130
Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:

610
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.830
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him

611
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:20.700
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat

612
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.030
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,

613
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.800
An appetite that I am sick withal,

614
00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:32.000
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,

615
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.030
To talk with him and to behold his visage,

616
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.900
Even to my full of view.

617
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.100
A labour saved!

618
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.200
A wonder!

619
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.330
What?

620
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:45.200
Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.

621
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.170
How so?

622
00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:47.570
He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector,

623
00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.330
and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling

624
00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.230
that he raves in saying nothing.

625
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.600
Stalks up and down like a peacock,

626
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.400
--a stride and a stand:

627
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.030
The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his neck

628
00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.370
i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in vain-glory.

629
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.200
He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,

630
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.270
Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.'

631
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.170
What think you of this man that takes me for the general?

632
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.370
He's grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.

633
00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.170
Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.

634
00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.300
Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody;

635
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.500
he professes not answering: speaking is for beggars;

636
00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:24.530
he wears his tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence:

637
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.700
let Patroclus make demands to me,

638
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.400
you shall see the pageant of Ajax.

639
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.570
To him, Patroclus;

640
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.700
tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax

641
00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.670
to invite the most valorous Hector

642
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.270
to come unarmed to my tent,

643
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.630
and to procure safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous

644
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.730
and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoure d

645
00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:46.230
captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,

646
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:47.400
et cetera. Do this.

647
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.000
Jove bless great Ajax!

648
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.500
Hum!

649
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.100
I come from the worthy Achilles,--

650
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.330
Ha!

651
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.000
Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--

652
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.970
Hum!

653
00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:00.600
And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.

654
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.770
Agamemnon!

655
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:03.870
Ay, my lord.

656
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:04.700
Ha!

657
00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:06.270
What say you to't?

658
00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.800
God b' wi' you, with all my heart.

659
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.300
Your answer, sir.

660
00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.600
If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock

661
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.400
it will go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me

662
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.900
ere he has me.

663
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:20.800
Your answer, sir.

664
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.800
Fare you well, with all my heart.

665
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.000
Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

666
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.330
No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in

667
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:29.400
him when Hector has knocked out his brains,

668
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.700
I know not;

669
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.900
Come, thou must deliver a letter to him straight.

670
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.800
Let me carry another to his horse; for that's the more

671
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.330
capable creature.

672
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.000
My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;

673
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.070
And I myself see not the bottom of it.

674
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.500
Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,

675
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.100
that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a

676
00:37:54.100 --> 00:38:00.170
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.

677
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.070
