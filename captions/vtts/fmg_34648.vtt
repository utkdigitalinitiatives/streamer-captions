NOWADAYS THE BOUNDARIES
ARE A BIT MORE BLURRED.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
BUT AT FIVE, DO OUR
CHILDREN EVEN UNDERSTAND

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
WHAT IT MEANS TO
BE RICH OR POOR,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
AND THAT THEIR SOCIAL
CLASS MAY GIVE THEM

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
MORE OR LESS
OPPORTUNITY IN LIFE?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
THIS IS PECKHAM, THE
HOME OF JAMES CACHIA.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
HE'S BEING RAISED IN
ONE OF THE POOREST

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
COUNCIL ESTATES IN
SOUTH-EAST LONDON.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
JAMES LIVES WITH HIS MOM
CAROL AND SISTER BERNIE.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
WHICH ONE OF YOU'S
GOING CHIP SHOP?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
PUT YOUR SOCKS
AND TROUSERS ON.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
CAROL DOESN'T WORK BUT
LIFE AT HOME IS NEVER DULL.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
THE HOUSE IS ALWAYS
FULL OF VISITORS.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
JAMES IS NO STRANGER TO
CHAOS, BUT HOW WILL HIS

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
ENVIRONMENT AFFECT
HOW HE SEES HIMSELF?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
THINGS HAVE NEVER
BEEN EASY FOR CAROL.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
SHE WAS BROUGHT
UP IN CARE,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
AND WHEN JAMES WAS BORN SHE
AND HER BOYFRIEND, JAMIE,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
WERE DETERMINED TO GIVE
HIM A DIFFERENT LIFE.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
BUT THINGS DIDN'T GO
ACCORDING TO PLAN.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
THREE YEARS LATER
JAMES'S DAD LEFT

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
AND CAROL FOUND
A NEW BOYFRIEND.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
THE RELATIONSHIP
WAS SHORT LIVED.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
JAMES, GET OFF
THERE, PLEASE.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
JAMES, GET OFF PLEASE.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
BUT ITS SHADOW STILL
HANGS OVER THE FAMILY.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
CAROL'S BOYFRIEND HAD
A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
AND NOW JAMES'S WHOLE
FAMILY COULD BE AT RISK.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:56.000
HE CAME ROUND THREATENING ME
- TOOK A KNIFE TO ME AND THAT.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I'VE GONE TO THE POLICE
AND THEY'RE GONNA GET ME

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
MOVED OUT OF HERE BECAUSE
I'M UNDER RISK WHAT WITH

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
THE THREATS AND THAT AND
THE POLICE ARE SAYING

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
THAT I'M NOT SAFE
HERE ANYMORE.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
CAROL FEELS TOO SCARED
TO SLEEP AT THE FLAT.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I JUST DON'T WANT TO STAY
HERE 'CUZ I DON'T WANT

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
TO TAKE ANY RISKS.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
SO SHE AND THE CHILDREN ARE
TRYING TO STAY WITH FRIENDS

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
WHENEVER THEY CAN.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
WHERE DID YOU STAY
 LAST NIGHT, JAMES?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I STAYED AT MY
FRIEND'S HOUSE.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
IS HE NICE?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
NO.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
HE'S A BIG FAT MAN.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
THAT'S NOT NICE!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
AND HE'S AN IDIOT.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
THEY ARE STARTING TO PICK
UP ON IT A LITTLE BIT.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
ASKING ME WHAT'S GOING ON
AND THAT AND ME AND MY

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
FRIEND JUST TELLS THEM
THAT THERE'S A BOGEYMAN

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
HANGING AROUND AND WE
CAN'T STAY IN THE HOUSE.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
BUT CAROL'S STORIES
AREN'T FOOLING ANYONE.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
WHY DID YOU STAY AT
 YOUR FRIEND'S HOUSE?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I'LL TELL YOU.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
ALRIGHT THEN, YOU
 CAN BOTH TELL ME.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
WE AIN'T SAFE HERE.
WE AIN'T SAFE HERE.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
WHY IS THAT?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
BECAUSE OF THE HEARTS.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
NO, NO, IT'S
BECAUSE OF HIM.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
DON'T MENTION THAT MAN.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
HE'S JUST RUINED IT ALL
NOW 'CUZ I THOUGHT THAT

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
ME AND HIM WOULD BE GETTING
ON REALLY WELL AND THAT

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
AND I THOUGHT
WE'D BE CLOSE.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I THOUGHT HE'D PROTECT
ME BUT NOT ANY MORE.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
AND JAMES IS LEARNING NOT
TO EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM LIFE.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
WHERE'S YOUR DREAM
 PLACE TO LIVE?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
LET GO OF MY HAND!

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
ALL THE CHANGES IN JAMES'S
LIFE ARE TAKING THEIR TOLL

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
AND HIS BEHAVIOR HAS TAKEN
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
YOU'RE GOING TO
YOUR BED TONIGHT

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
WITH SO MUCH
GOING ON AT HOME,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
WILL JAMES'S
EDUCATION BE AFFECTED?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
ONCE HE ARRIVES AT NURSERY
HE'S A DIFFERENT CHILD.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
HE'S HAD TO HANDLE A
LOT OF CHANGES THAT'S

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
HAPPENING IN HIS LIFE ALL
THE TIME - GOOD AND BAD -

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
THERE'S CHANGES
HAPPENING WITH HIM,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
BUT HE'S HANDLING IT VERY,
VERY WELL. VERY WELL.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
IT IS VERY GOOD FOR A
CHILD OF THIS AGE

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
TO BE ABLE TO SEPARATE
HOME AND, YOU KNOW,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
COME TO A NURSERY SETTING
AND JUST GET ON WITH IT

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
AND NOT REALLY
LET IT DISTURB HIM

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
THROUGHOUT THE
DAY, YOU KNOW?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY
GOOD SKILL JAMES HAS GOT.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
JAMES SEEMS TO HAVE
LEARNED TO PROTECT HIMSELF

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
FROM WHAT GOES ON AT HOME.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
HE'S WORKING HARD AT
NURSERY AND, WHAT'S MORE,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST
POPULAR BOYS AT SCHOOL

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
WITH A FIRM BEST FRIEND.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
JAMES, TELL ME WHO
 YOUR BEST FRIEND IS.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
YOU KNOW!

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
YHAVANI!

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
THE LITTLE PUPPY DOGGY.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
BUT JAMES COULD BE ABOUT
TO LOSE HIS SANCTUARY.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
FOR THEIR SAFETY, CAROL
IS TRYING TO MOVE,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
AND JAMES MAY HAVE TO SAY
GOODBYE TO HIS FRIENDS.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
HE AIN'T PLEASED
TO SEE ME, LOOK.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
WAIT!

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
AT THE END OF THE DAY
JAMES RETURNS TO HIS MOM

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
AND THE TURBULENT
WORLD OUTSIDE NURSERY.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
SEE, I PICKED YOU UP
NOW, GARLIC BREATH.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
GARLIC BREATH.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
OH, YOUR BREATH STINKS.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
SMELL MY BREATH!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
UGH, YUCKY!

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
JAMES MAY BE RESILIENT,
BUT ARE HIS EXPERIENCES

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:59.000
ALREADY AFFECTING HIS
EXPECTATIONS FOR THE FUTURE?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
WHEN DO WE BECOME AWARE
OF LIFE'S INEQUALITIES?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
WE'VE ASKED OUR CHILDREN
TO IMAGINE THE PEOPLE

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
LIVING IN TWO
DIFFERENT HOUSES.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
CAN YOU TELL ME, DO YOU
 THINK THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
IN THIS HOUSE HAVE MORE
 MONEY OR LESS MONEY?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000
MORE MONEY.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
SO, ARE THEY RICH OR POOR?

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
RICH.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
THEY'RE RICH.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
AND THAT ONE'S POOR.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
AND WHICH CHILD IS HAPPY?

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
THE CHILD WHO LIVES
 IN THIS HOUSE

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
OR THE CHILD WHO
 LIVES IN THIS HOUSE?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
THAT ONE.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
IS THIS GIRL HAPPY OR
 IS THIS GIRL HAPPY?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
THIS GIRL.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.000
THIS HOUSE.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
THIS HOUSE.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
WHO DO YOU LIKE, THE
 PEOPLE IN THIS HOUSE

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
OR THE PEOPLE
 IN THIS HOUSE?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
THE GOOD PEOPLE.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
THE GOOD PEOPLE. WHERE
 DO THE GOOD PEOPLE LIVE?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
IN THIS HOUSE?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
WHAT DOES THIS CHILD
 GET TEASED ABOUT?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
BECAUSE HER FAMILY
AREN'T VERY NICE TO HER.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
WHAT DO THEY DO TO HER?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000
THEY BASH HER AND CRUSH
HER AND MAKE HER GET BUMPS.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
AND WHAT DO CHILDREN
 TEASE THIS BOY ABOUT?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
THEY DON'T TEASE HIM.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
NO ONE TEASES HER.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
HOW COME?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
HOW COME NOBODY
 TEASES THIS CHILD?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO LIVE WITH
HER MOMMY AND DADDY SAFELY.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
NO MATTER WHAT
THEIR BACKGROUND,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
OUR CHILDREN HAVE
VERY SET IDEAS ABOUT

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
THE CONSEQUENCES OF
BEING RICH OR POOR.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
WHAT DOES THIS CHILD WANT
 TO BE WHEN SHE GROWS UP?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
A MOMMY.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
SHE WANTS TO BE A MOMMY?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
WHAT KIND OF JOB
 DOES SHE WANT?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
TIDY UP THE HOUSE.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
HER HOUSE OR OTHER
 PEOPLE'S HOUSES?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS GIRL?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
WHAT KIND OF JOB
 DOES SHE WANT TO BE?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
SHE THINKS SHE WANTS
TO BE A TEACHER.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
SO, DOES THE ECONOMIC
POSITION OF THEIR OWN

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
FAMILIES INFLUENCE
WHAT THEY WANT TO BE?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
ARE YOU GOING TO
 OWN THIS BUSINESS?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I'M GOING TO OWN
THIS BUSINESS.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
 PEOPLE WORK FOR YOU?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
YES.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
NOW DO YOU THINK THAT'S
 REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
IN YOUR LIFE?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
YES.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
HOW COME?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
HOW COME YOU'RE GONNA
 BE ABLE TO DO THAT?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
IT'S A SECRET.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
HELENA COMES FROM
A WELL-OFF FAMILY.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
HER CERTAINTY ABOUT THE
FUTURE IS VERY DIFFERENT

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
TO JAMES'S.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
WHAT WILL THE CHILD IN THIS
 HOUSE BE WHEN HE GROWS UP?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
NO, I'M IN THAT HOUSE.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
WHAT IS HE GOING TO
 BE IN THIS HOUSE?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
WHAT'S HE WANT TO BE?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
UM.. I DON'T KNOW.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
JUST GUESS.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
DON'T KNOW.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
OKAY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
 THIS CHILD WANTS TO BE

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
WHEN HE GROWS UP?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I'M THE CHILD.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
YES. OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU
 WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
YOU DON'T KNOW?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
 ABOUT SOME THINGS? NO?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I'M THE CHILD!

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
IN YORKSHIRE, FOR WILLIAM
ROBERTS, THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
HE'S LEARNING SOME VERY
DIFFERENT LESSONS AS TO

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
WHAT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
HE'S BEING BROUGHT
UP IN THE HEART OF

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THE YORKSHIRE DALES.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
WITH A STABLE, AFFLUENT HOME
LIFE AND A PRIVATE EDUCATION,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
WILLIAM HAS ALL THE ODDS
STACKED IN HIS FAVOR.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
IT'S A RECIPE FOR SUCCESS.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
BUT THIS ISN'T THE WORLD
HIS MOM, GILLIAN, GREW UP IN.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
MY PARENTS WERE
WORKING CLASS.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
MY MOTHER HAS ALWAYS
WORKED AT THE LOCAL

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
OLD PEOPLE'S HOME IN THE
LAUNDRY AND MY FATHER

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
USED TO WORK AT
THE WATER BOARD.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
GILLIAN MARRIED
INTO A WELL-OFF,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
ESTABLISHED
LOCAL FAMILY.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
WILLIAM'S DAD, NEIL, IS A
THOROUGHBRED YORKSHIRE MAN.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
IN HIS FAMILY, KEEPING UP
TRADITION IS IMPORTANT.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
HE'S FOLLOWED IN HIS
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS AS A VET.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
BOTH OUR FAMILIES FOR
GENERATIONS HAVE LIVED IN

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF
SETTLE AND GIGGLESWICK.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
AT THE MOMENT THERE'S QUITE
A HEATED DEBATE IN SETTLE

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
AS TO WHETHER WE SHOULD
HAVE A SUPERMARKET OR NOT.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
NEIL WANTS HIS CHILDREN TO
ENJOY THE SAME PRIVILEGES

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
THAT LIFE IN A RURAL
COMMUNITY HAS GIVEN HIM.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
THE QUALITY OF LIFE
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
IS GREATER THAN
THE QUALITY OF LIFE

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
BROUGHT UP IN
TOWNS OR CITIES.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
DEEP DOWN, ANY FATHER
WOULD PROBABLY LIKE A SON

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
AND HEIR TO FOLLOW IN
THEIR FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
AND I MAKE NO BONES ABOUT
IT, I WOULD BE PROUD IF

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
ANY OF MY CHILDREN WANTED
TO FOLLOW IN MY FOSTEPS.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
NEIL SPENDS VIRTUALLY ALL
HIS SPARE TIME DOING SPORT.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
AND WILLIAM'S TURNING OUT
TO BE JUST LIKE HIS DAD.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
WILLIAM LOVES ANYTHING TO
DO WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000
- FOOTBALL,
RUNNING AROUND -

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
HE'S DEAD KEEN SO I'M SURE
HE'LL FOLLOW IN MY FOOTSTEPS.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
NEIL AND WILLIAM ARE
THE SAME PERSON ALMOST.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
THEY ARE, AND I'VE KNOWN
THAT FOR A LONG WHILE.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
THEY'RE JUST THE SAME.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
IN FACT, I SAID TO NEIL
ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
"I LOVE YOU VERY MUCH AND
HOPEFULLY WE'LL ALWAYS

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
BE TOGETHER,
BUT I DO WORRY THAT

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
SOMEONE'S GOING TO END
UP DIVORCING WILLIAM".

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(LAUGHS)

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
DO YOU WANT A
SANDWICH, WILLIAM?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
WILLIAM'S THE YOUNGEST
IN THE FAMILY.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
HE'S GOT 6-YEAR-OLD TWIN
SIBLINGS CHARLES AND ALICE.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT
WILLIAM HAS A SPECIAL BOND

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
WITH HIS DAD.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
IT'S A TRADITIONAL FAMILY
WHERE NEIL EARNS THE MONEY

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
AND GILLIAN
STAYS AT HOME.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
AND WILLIAM'S NEVER BEEN
ENCOURAGED TO STRAY

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
TOO FAR FROM HIS
GENDER STEREOTYPE.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I'M A BIT OF A
TRADITIONALIST AND

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I MUST ADMIT I DO GET
BOYS' THINGS FOR THE BOYS

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
AND GIRLS' THINGS
FOR ALICE.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
IF HE WANTS NOTHING TO DO
WITH DOLLS AND JUST WANTS

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
TO PLAY WITH TRAINS AND
CARS I'LL BE QUITE HAPPY.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
MOMMY'S NAUGHTY.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
IT'S THE YEAR 2000,
WE'RE NOT MEANT TO

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
DO THAT SORT OF
THING, ARE WE?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
NO. YOU'RE MEANT TO
BE A NEW MAN.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
THERE. WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- PLEASE.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
AND THEN?
- THANK YOU.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
GILLIAN MIGHT NOT WANT
HER SON TO BREAK THE MOULD

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
WHEN IT COMES TO
BEING A PROPER BOY.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
BUT WITH WILLIAM'S FUTURE
SHE'S MORE ADVENTUROUS.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I DON'T PARTICULARLY WANT
HIM JUST HANGING ROUND HERE.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I'D BE VERY HAPPY FOR HIM
TO GO OFF AND WORK ABROAD

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
OR ANYWHERE.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
KEEN TO GET WILLIAM
OUT OF SETTLE,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
GILLIAN'S ALREADY STARTED
TO PLAN HIS ESCAPE.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
SHE WANTS TO MOVE - EVEN
IF IT'S JUST A FEW MILES

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
DOWN THE ROAD.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I'M...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
"I'M HAPPY WHERE I AM".

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I LIKE WHERE WE LIVE
NOW BUT I CAN SEE

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
GILLIAN'S REASONS
FOR WANTING TO MOVE.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I DO SOMETIMES THINK THAT
LIFE'S TOO SHORT TO WANT TO

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
BE STUCK IN THIS SAME LITTLE
PATCH OF EARTH FOREVER.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
MOMMY, WHERE'S WILLIAM?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
HMM? WHO KNOWS
WHERE WILLIAM IS?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
NOT ONE TO BE DETERRED ONCE
SHE'S GOT A GOAL IN MIND,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
GILLIAN'S PUT THE FAMILY
HOUSE ON THE MARKET

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S THE ONLY
ONE WHO WANTS TO MOVE.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
IF WILLIAM'S GOT HIS
DAD'S MANLY SPORTINESS,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
HE'S GOT A STEELY
DETERMINATION FROM HIS MOM.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
IT CAN BE A DEADLY
COMBINATION.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(CRYING)

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
ALICE! YOU DON'T DO THAT!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:11.000
YOU DON'T DO THAT!

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(CRYING)

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
(CRYING)

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
BEING A BOY IS A VERY
IMPORTANT PART OF

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
WILLIAM'S IDENTITY.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
IT'S ONE OF THE EARLIEST
LESSONS CHILDREN LEARN

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
ABOUT WHO THEY ARE.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
COME BEDTIME, HE'S GOT
A FIGHT ON HIS HANDS

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
AS HIS MOTHER THREATENS TO
INTRODUCE A GIRLY TOUCH.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
WILLIAM DID SEE SOME PINK
THINGS THAT HE WANTED

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
FOR HIS BEDROOM.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
NO, I DIDN'T!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
NO, HE SAW A NICE PINK
BED WITH A PINK DUVET.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
NOOO!

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE
IF YOU HAD SOME PINK THINGS.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
SO, YOU DON'T WANT
A PINK BEDROOM THEN?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
NO.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000
WHY NOT?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE LONG HAIR.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I WANT TO BE A BOY.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
I DON'T SEE WHAT'S
WRONG WITH PINK.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE
A BOY'S BEDROOM?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I DON'T MIND IF MY
BEDROOM'S GREEN OR BLUE.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
GOD WILL TURN
YOU INTO A BOY.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
THERE'S A GOOD REASON WHY
WILLIAM'S UNSETTLED

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
BY ANYTHING
REMOTELY FEMININE.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
BY THE AGE OF TWO,
MOST CHILDREN CAN

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
TELL YOU THEIR SEX.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
ARE YOU A GIRL OR A BOY?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
BOY.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
GIRL.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
BOY.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
GIRL.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I'M A MAN, MY
MOMMY TOLD ME.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
AT THIS AGE THEY PREFER TO
STICK WITH THEIR OWN GROUP.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I'VE ONLY GOT TWO FRIENDS,
JEMIMA AND JESSICA.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000
GUY.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
ALEX.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
CAITLIN.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
CAROLINE.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
KIRSTY.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
AIDEN.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
PHOEBE.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
MY MOM AND MY DAD.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
BUT WHAT DO THEY THINK
THEY'LL BE WHEN THEY GROW UP?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
WOMAN.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
MAN.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
WOMAN.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I'LL BE A MAN.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
BUT THERE'S A MAJOR FLAW
IN THEIR UNDERSTANDING.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
IS KEN A BOY OR A GIRL?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000
A BOY.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
MAN.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
BOY.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
CHANGE THE CLOTHES?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
IS KEN A BOY
 OR A GIRL NOW?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
A GIRL.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
AMAZINGLY, THEY
THINK GENDER CHANGES

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
WITH CLOTHES
AND HAIR LENGTH.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
A GIRL.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
WHAT IF WE CUT THAT
 DOLL'S HAIR OFF?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
IT'LL BE A BOY AND IF
WE PUT HIS LONG HAIR

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
THEN IT
WOULD BE A GIRL.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
FOR 4-YEAR-OLDS, GENDER
IS STILL SO FLUID

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
IT'S SAFER TO STICK WITH
THE RULES RIGIDLY.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
BUT IT DON'T HAVE TO
HAVE THIS DRESS ON.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
'CUZ MEN DON'T
WEAR DRESSES.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
HE DOESN'T WEAR
BALLET CLOTHES!

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
AT THIS AGE, APPEARANCE
IS ALL IMPORTANT.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
I WANT YOU TO
DO IT LIKE THIS.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
DO IT LIKE THAT?
- YEAH.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
OUR CHILDREN ARE STARTING
TO FORM SOME STRONG IDEAS

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
ABOUT HOW THEY
SHOULD LOOK.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
EVEN AT THIS YOUNG AGE
THEY'RE ABSORBING SOME

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
IMPORTANT MESSAGES.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
LIKE THIS.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
YOU LIKE IT LIKE THAT?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
YEAH.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
HOW CONFIDENT WE ARE ABOUT
OUR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
FORMS A CRUCIAL PART
OF OUR IDENTITY AND

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
HAS A POWERFUL IMPACT ON
OUR PATH THROUGH LIFE.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
I'LL DO YOUR HAIR.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
GO ON THEN, YOU CAN
DO MY HAIR, COME ON.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
BY THE TIME WE'RE ADULTS,
OUR APPEARANCE IS

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
FUNDAMENTAL TO HOW WE
FEEL ABOUT OURSELVES.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
THERE YOU ARE.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
YOU CUT MY HAIR.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
YOU CAN.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME
LOOK LIKE A WILD PROFESSOR,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
AREN'T YOU?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
CAN YOU REACH?

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
OH, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
DO YOU THINK
I LOOK BETTER?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
YEAH.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I THINK I LOOK TERRIBLE.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
THE SAUNDERS FAMILY
LIVE IN ESSEX.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
IN 1999 THEY ALREADY
HAD A SON, DAVID.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
WHEN GILL FOUND
OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
SHE HAD VERY STRONG
IDEAS ABOUT HOW

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
SHE WOULD WANT A
DAUGHTER TO LOOK.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I HOPE I DON'T, IF I HAVE
A GIRL, IT'S NOT INTO

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
FRILLY DRESSES AND HAIR
BANDS 'CUZ I'M NOT INTO

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
ALL OF THAT AND I WOULDN'T
KNOW WHERE TO START.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I REALLY WOULDN'T KNOW.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
BUT WHEN REBECCA WAS BORN
GILL KNEW JUST WHERE TO START.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
IT'S A NOVELTY
HAVING A GIRL.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I KEEP LOOKING
DOWN AND THINKING

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
"WHY IS DAVID IN PINK"?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
FIVE YEARS ON, THIS IS HOW
GILL'S NO FRILLS DAUGHTER

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
TURNED OUT.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
IT'S VERY PRETTY.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
THESE ARE PRETTY COLORS.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
WHO CHOSE THE COLORS?

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
ME.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
I DIDN'T WANT BLUE.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
DRESSED IN PINK
FROM DAY ONE,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
REBECCA'S ALWAYS
BEEN A GIRLS' GIRL.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
MY EARS ARE COVERED IN
MAKE-UP, MY EYES ARE

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
COVERED IN MAKE-UP, MY
LIPS ARE COVERED IN MAKE-UP.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
LIKE WILLIAM ROBERTS,
REBECCA'S LATCHED ONTO

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
THE MESSAGE THAT PINK
MAKES YOU A GIRL

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
AND BLUE MAK YOU A BOY.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
SO, WHAT OTHER MESSAGES
IS REBECCA PICKING UP

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
ABOUT HOW SHE SHOULD
OR SHOULDN'T LOOK?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT
OUR SELF-CONFIDENCE AND

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
HOW WE FEEL ABOUT OUR
BODIES IS GREATLY INFLUENCED

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
BY HOW OUR PARENTS FELT
ABOUT THEIR BODIES.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
WE'VE ASKED OUR PARENTS
HOW THEY RATE THEMSELVES.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
I LOVE MY WRISTS.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:50.000
FOR MY LEFT FOOT, FOUR;
FOR MY RIGHT FOOT, TWO.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
I'LL GIVE THAT A
FIVE, MY CHEST.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I'M QUITE HAPPY WITH THAT.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
THEY'VE BEEN ASKED TO
GIVE ALL THE PARTS

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
OF THEIR BODIES A
SCORE OUT OF FIVE.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
ONE, OH.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:10.000
I'M QUITE PROUD OF MY CHEST
SO I'LL GIVE IT A FOUR.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
MY HANDS ARE THE HANDS OF A
SURGEON AND I LOVE MY HANDS.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
SO, HOW DOES REBECCA'S
MOM, GILL, RATE HER BODY?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
MY BUM IS 100%
A NUMBER ONE.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
BIG WIDE HIPS -
CHILD BEARING HIPS.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
MY FINGERS ARE TOO FAT.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
MY WAIST IS TOO FAT.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
OH, MY LEGS.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
WE DON'T LIKE MY LEGS.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
NO, I DON'T LIKE MY TOES
EITHER, THEY'RE FUNNY SHAPES.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
I WEIGH FAR TOO MUCH.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
ENORMOUS.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
ONE. ONE.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I HATE MY BODY.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
TOO BIG AND TOO CHUNKY.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
NOT A PEACH.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
MORE LIKE A WATERMELON.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
EVERYTHING APART FROM
MY EYES ABOUT MY FACE.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I HATE THE WAY I LOOK.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000
I ABSOLUTELY HATE
THE WAY I LOOK.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
I'D CHANGE EVERYTHING.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
IF I COULD AFFORD
PLASTIC SURGERY

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
I WOULD GO FOR
THE FULL WORKS.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
GILL GAVE HERSF BY FAR THE
LOWE SCORE IN THE GROUP.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
AND SHE'S ALREADY MAKING
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
HOW REBECCA'S BODY
IMAGE WILL TURN OUT.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000
WITH HOW SHE LOOKS, I
DOUBT VERY MUCH SHE'LL

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
LIKE HOW SHE LOOKS
BECAUSE I THINK SHE'S

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
GONNA BE SHORT LIKE ME
AND I THINK SHE'S GOING

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
TO BE PRONE TO PUT ON
WEIGHT LIKE ME AND

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL BE
HAPPY WITH THAT;

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK...
I DON'T THINK SHE WILL.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
SHE MIGHT PROVE ME WRONG.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000
AT THE MOMENT, REBECCA'S
FAR FROM BEING FAT.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
ONE OF THE DOCTORS
RECOMMENDED THAT WE HAD

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
HER CHECKED BECAUSE SHE
WAS BELOW THE GUIDE

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
FOR HER HEIGHT.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I MEAN, CLOTHES-WISE NOW
SHE'S STILL IN AGE 2-3.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
SHE IS SMALL.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
HE SAID WE MIGHT
LIKE TO THINK ABOUT

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
GROWTH HORMONES
AT SOME FUTURE STAGE.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
HE DIDN'T SUGGEST
SHE HAD TO HAVE IT,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
HE SAID WE MIGHT
LIKE TO CONSIDER IT.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
BUT WE WON'T CONSIDER
THAT AT ALL.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
GILL'S WORRIED THAT
REBECCA WILL SUCCUMB TO

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
THE TEMPTATIONS OF THEIR
PARTICULAR WAY OF LIFE.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I'M CONVINCED JEWISH PEOPLE
ARE NOT MADE TO BE THIN

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
BECAUSE EVERY FESTIVAL
THERE'S A SPECIAL FOOD

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
CONNECTED WITH IT, WHICH I
SUPPOSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
BUT I LIKE TO KEEP THINGS
PROPERLY SO I DO EAT.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
THAT'S NOT TOO
HEAVY. GOT IT?

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000
NO, USE TWO HANDS.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
WELL, I HOPE THAT
WASN'T THE EGGS.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
REBECCA'S GETTING LOTS
OF COMPLICATED MESSAGES

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN FOOD AND BODY SIZE.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000
AND MEAL TIMES ARE STARTING
TO BECOME A BIT OF AN ISSUE.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
CAN YOU EAT IT RATHER
THAN PLAY WITH IT, PLEASE.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
IT'S TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
THE KIDS CAN HAVE A
CHOICE IN WHAT THEY EAT

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
AND THEN I MAKE IT AND
IF THEY DON'T EAT IT,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
THEY LEAVE IT AND THEY
DON'T GET ANYTHING ELSE.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
SAME FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
SHE TAKES IT OR
SHE LEAVES IT.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
WHAT DO YOU NORMALLY
 DO, REBECCA?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
LEAVE IT.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
OH, HOW TRUE.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
I DON'T EAT A LOT.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
WHY DON'T YOU EAT A LOT?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I DON'T FEEL HUNGRY.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000
REBECCA'S APPETITE MAY BE
SMALL SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE IS.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I'M GOING TO CAST A
MAGIC SPELL ON YOU.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
IZZY WIZZY,
LET'S GET BUSY.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
WHAT SHOULD WE
TURN YOU INTO?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
A PRINCESS.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000
YOU ARE ONE.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
WHAT ELSE CAN WE
TURN YOU INTO?

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.000
YOU.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
YOU WANT TO BECOME ME?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE ?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE M

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
BUT SHE MAY BE RESPONDING
TO HER MOTHER'S

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT
FOOD AND BODY SIZE.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
JAMES CACHIA'S FAMILY
HAD TO LEAVE HOME

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
IN A HURRY LAST
NIGHT AFTER ANOTHER

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
VISIT FROM CAROL'S
EX-BOYFRIEND.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
IN DESPERATION SHE'S
ENDED UP IN A HOTEL.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
HE RANG ME ON MY MOBILE
FROM MY HOUSE PHONE.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
HE'S BROKEN A WINDOW TO
GET IN AND HE'S SAYING

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
THAT HE'S SMASHED
UP A FEW THINGS.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
COME AND LAY DOWN
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
GET ME JAMES'S
TRAINERS PLEASE.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
JAMES, PUT YOUR FOOT IN.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
CAN YOU STOP NOW.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
EVERY YEAR I SEEM TO
BE HAVING PROBLEMS.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
EVERY TIME I SEE SOMEONE
IT JUST ENDS UP AS DISASTER.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
I'M DREADING MY FUTURE
'CUZ I DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
IT'S GOING TO HOLD.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
INHE YEARS TO COME.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
I JUST WANT HIM TO GO TO
COLLEGE AND HAVE A GOOD FUTURE.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
OH, SOMETIMES THEIR NAN SAYS
IT COULD BE ALL TOO LATE,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
YOU KNOW, TO MAKE THEM
HAPPY BUT I CAN DO IT.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
I CAN MAKE THEM HAPPY.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
TAKE THEM TO THE SEASIDE,
TO THE PARK AND THAT.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
IT'LL BE GOOD.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
CAROL'S LEAVING JAMES AND
BERNIE WITH RELATIVES

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
FOR A FEW DAYS.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I'M GONNA DROP THE
KIDS TO SEE THEIR NAN

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
AND WE'LL SEE HOW
THINGS GO FROM THERE.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I'M A BIT UPSET 'CUZ
I'D RATHER TAKE THEM

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
HOME WITH ME, BUT
DEFINITELY BE SAFE.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
WITH THE CHILDREN SAFE
ELSEWHERE, CAROL'S GOING

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
BACK TO THE FLAT TO
INSPECT THE DAMAGE.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
HE'S BROKEN THE AIR VENT.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
MUST HAVE PUT HIS HAND THROUGH
TO OPEN THE WINDOW THERE.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
TALK ABOUT BEING SAFE.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000
HE BROKE MY CHEST OF
DRAWERS THAT I HAD IN HERE.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:08.000
AND A PLATE'S BEEN
SMASHED BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
WITH STILL NO WORD FROM
THE HOUSING OFFICE,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
SHE'S TAKING MATTERS
INTO HER OWN HANDS.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
CAN YOU PUT ME THROUGH
TO THE HOMELESS UNIT?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
YEAH, IS THERE ANY ADVICE
THAT YOU CAN GIVE ME

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
'CUZ I WENT TO GO TO A
DIFFERENT BOROUGH TO FLEE

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
SOUTHWARK BUT I DIDN'T FIND
THEM VERY HELPFUL, SO...

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I JUST WANT ME AND
THE KIDS TO BE HAPPY.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000
I'M ONLY DOING
IT FOR THE KIDS.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
I'M NOT EVEN THINKING
ABOUT MYSELF.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
CAROL STARTS GOING TO THE
HOUSING OFFICE EVERY DAY

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
TO TRY TO SPEED
THINGS UP.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
SHE DOESN'T GET FAR.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
A FEW DAYS LATER SHE HAS
TO HAVE THE CHILDREN BACK.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
CAROL'S DESPERATE TO GO BUT
JAMES FEELS DIFFERENTLY.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING
MOVED OUT OF HERE, JAMES?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:03.000
ANGRY!

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
WHY?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO
MOVE OUT OF HERE, JAMES?

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
DO YOU WANT IAN
TO THREATEN US?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
SHUT UP, BERNIE!

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000
WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO
MOVE OUT OF HERE, JAMES?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
BECAUSE I WANT TO
PLAY WITH DAPPO.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
WE CAN COME AND
VISIT DAPPO.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
DO YOU WANT TO LEAVE HERE
AND MOVE INTO A HOUSE

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
WITH A GARDEN?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.000
OH, YEAH!

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
I SAID MAYBE.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000
THANK YOU!

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
ACTUALLY, WE CAN
LIVE IN BUTLINS.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
OUR CHILDREN ARE NOW FIVE
AND NOW THEY'RE STARTING

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
TO SHIFT FROM BEING
ALL ME, ME, ME, ME

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
TO NOTICING
OTHER PEOPLE -

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
THAT THEY'RE VERY
SIMILAR TO SOME PEOPLE

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
AND ENTIRELY DIFFERENT
FROM OTHERS;

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
THAT SOME HAVE THE SAME
SKIN COLOR; AND OTHERS

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
HAVE A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SKIN COLOR.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
AND HOW QUICKLY YOU
LEARN THAT DIFFERENCE

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
DEPENDS VERY LARGELY
ON THE ENVIRONMENT

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
WHERE YOU GROW UP.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
TYRESE BLAKE-HAKEEM IS
GROWING UP IN INNER CITY

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
BIRMINGHAM WHERE MOST
OF HIS FRIENDS AND THE

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
OTHER CHILDREN IN HIS
NURSERY ARE BLACK.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
HIS MOM, MARIE, HAS
ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
THAT TYRESE WOULD HAVE A HARD
TIME BEING BLACK AND MALE.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
SO MUCH SO THAT SHE HOPED
TYRESE WOULD BE A GIRL.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
I DIDN'T WANT BOYS. I
ALWAYS WANTED GIRLS.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000
I WAS GLAD WHEN
I HAD TWO GIRLS.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
AND WHEN I FOUND OUT TYRESE
WAS A BOY IT WAS LIKE, OKAY.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
LAST YEAR MARIE WAS TOLD
TYRESE MIGHT HAVE DYSLEXIA.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
I THINK TYRESE WILL HAVE
A HARDER TIME COMPARED

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000
TO SOME OF THE OTHER
CHILDREN, YES, BECAUSE

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
HE'S BLACK, BUT ALSO
BECAUSE HE'S A BLACK MALE

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
AND BECAUSE HE'S
DYSLEXIC, SO HE'S GOT

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
A LOT OF THINGS
STACKED AGAINST HIM.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
HER FEARS AREN'T
UNFOUNDED.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
BLACK MALES TEND TO DO
WORSE AT SCHOOL AND ARE

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
MORE LIKELY TO
GET INTO TROUBLE.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
BUT NOW TYRESE FACES
ANOTHER CHALLENGE.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
LAST YEAR HIS
PARENTS SEPARATED.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
MARIE'S CONCERNED ABOUT
THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
THE THING THAT I'M
WORRIED ABOUT IS MORE

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
HIM GETTING IN TROUBLE WITH
THE POLICE, GOING DOWN

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
THE DRUGS ROUTE, GETTING
INTO FIGHTS, GUNS.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF IS
WHAT I'M REALLY, REALLY

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
WORRIED ABOUT AND THAT WOULD
BE MY WORST CASE SCENARIO

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY
I'M COLD AND HEARTLESS

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
BUT IF HE GETS
HIMSELF INVOLVED IN THAT

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
THEN I'M STEPPING AWAY.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
AT NURSERY THE STRAIN OF
HIS PARENTS' SEPARATION

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
IS STARTING TO SHOW.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
AT THE BEGINNING IT WAS
SORT OF WHAT HAVE I DONE,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
YOU KNOW?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
I'VE, YOU KNOW, BROKEN
THE FAMILY HOME AND I'VE

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
MESSED UP THIS CHILD'S
HEAD AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
THE SCHOOL SORT OF ASKED
ME TO GO IN AND SORT OF

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
HAVE A WORD AND THEY WERE
CONCERNED, SAYING THAT

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
HIS BEHAVIOR AT SCHOOL
IS BECOMING QUITE BAD

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
WHERE HE'S NOT
LISTENING TO ANYTHING

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
THAT THEY'RE
TELLING HIM TO DO.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000
WHEN THEY SAY "SIT DOWN"
HE WILL STAND UP AND

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
ALWAYS THE OPPOSITE OF
WHAT HE'S BEING TOLD;

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
WETTING HIMSELF - HE WAS
ALSO POOING HIMSELF.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000
NOW HE'S A BIG BOY, HE KNOWS
HOW TO GO TO THE TOILET.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
HE HAS NO ISSUES WITH
GOING TO THE TOILET

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF
HE'S SORT OF SAYING

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
"I'M WET, NOW YOU'VE GOT
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT".

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
WHILST EVERYONE ELSE IS
HAVING FUN, TYRESE OFTEN

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
SEEMS WITHDRAWN AND
HE'S EASILY UPSET.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
WELL, IT'S THE ORANGE ONE
 OR YOU CAN'T HAVE A GO.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I WANT THE BLUE ONE.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
WE'LL LEAVE IT ON THE
 FLOOR AND IF YOU WANT

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.000
A TURN YOU CAN HAVE IT.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
HE WANTED A BLUE RIBBON AND
WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT HE

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
DOESN'T ALWAYS HAVE EXACTLY
WHAT HE SAYS HE WANTS.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
TYRESE'S TEACHERS HAVE BEEN
KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON HIM.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
TO BEGIN WITH, I DON'T
THINK IT DID AFFECT HIM

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
BUT WHEN HE REALIZED THAT
MOM AND DAD WERE NOT

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
GOING TO BE PERMANENTLY
TOGETHER, AND, I THINK,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
THE HOUSE WHERE HE'D BEEN
LIVING WITH BOTH MOM AND DAD,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
THEY MOVED OUT OF, I THINK IT
BECAME MORE REAL TO HIM THEN

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
AND I THINK HE FOUND IT
DIFFICULT TO COPE WITH.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
ARE YOU GOING TO
 GO BACK IN NOW?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:20.000
(CRYING LOUDLY)

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
(CRYING LOUDLY)

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
WE HAVE WORKED WITH HIM,
TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
AND THAT IT'S OKAY
TO FEEL SAD, YOU KNOW,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000
BUT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
YOU JUST GOT YOURSELF
IN A BIT OF A STATE,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
DIDN'T YOU, MATE?

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
WOULD YOU LIKE
ANOTHER TISSUE?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
BUT AT HOME THERE'S NOT A
LOT OF TIME FOR TALKING

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
ABOUT FEELINGS.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
TYRESE HAS SPENT MOST
OF THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
BEING LOOKED AFTER
BY HIS OLDER SISTERS,

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
TANEISHA AND CHANEL.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
SINCE SHE'S BEEN ON HER
OWN, MARIE'S STRUGGLED

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND IS
WORKING SIX DAYS A WEEK.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
EVEN THOUGH TYRESE IS
ONLY FOUR, HE'S EXPECTED

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
TO DO HIS FAIR SHARE
AROUND THE HOUSE.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
THEY DO STUFF FOR THEMSELVES.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I GET TYRESE TO DO AS MUCH...
I GET THEM ALL TO DO AS MUCH,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
'CUZ AT THE END OF THE DAY I
NEVER MADE ALL THIS MESS

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
SO WHY MUST I BE CLEANING
THAT UP, YOU KNOW?

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
THEY MADE THE MESS, THEY
SHOULD CLEAN IT UP.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
YEAH!

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:38.000
(LAUGHTER)

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000
MARIE HAD A
TOUGH CHILDHOOD.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
SHE WAS BROUGHT UP TO
BE SELF-RELIANT AND SHE

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
WANTS TYRESE TO BE ABLE
TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
JUST 'CUZ HE'S THE
MAN OR HE'S YOUNGER.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
ONE FOR ALL AND
ALL FOR ONE.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
EVERYBODY IN THERE
GIVING IT THEIR BEST.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
CHANEL, DON'T DO THAT.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
GIMME THE BALL.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
TYRESE!

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
BUT THERE'S ONE ASPECT
OF TYRESE'S IDENTITY

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000
THAT MARIE DOESN'T WANT
TO LEAVE TO CHANCE.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
SHE WANTS HIM TO FEEL
POSITIVE ABOUT BEING BLACK.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
*

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
LAST YEAR ON A TRIP TO NEW
YORK HE GOT HIS FIRST TASTE

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
OF BLACK HISTORY WITH A
GUIDED TOUR OF HARLEM.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
YOU'RE WALKING DOWN MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR. BOULEVARD.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000
DO YOU KNOW THAT, MY MAN?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
'S SLIGHTLY OVER
TYRESE'S HEAD.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
HE'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN
LISTENING TO A WORD

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
THE GUY'S SAYING
BUT I'LL BE ABLE TO

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
RECOUNT IT BACK TO
HIM AT LATER TIMES.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
SO IS MARIE'S
STRATEGY WORKING?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
WHAT DO 4-YEAR-OLDS
UNDERSTAND ABOUT

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
ETHNIC IDENTITY?

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
WE COMMISSIONED THE
UNIVERSITY OF KENT

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
TO DO SOME RESEARCH.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
MOST 4-YEAR-OLDS KNOW
THEIR SKIN COLOR.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
BUT WHAT DO THEY THINK WILL
HAPPEN WHEN THEY GROW UP?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
WHEN YOU'RE A BIG BOY
 WHICH OF THESE BIG BOYS

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:18.000
WILL YOU BE LIKE?

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
OVER HALF THINK THEIR SKIN
COLOR WILL CHANGE WITH AGE.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
THE UNIVERSITY
RESEARCHERS INTERVIEWED

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
OVER 200 CHILDREN
FROM ALL OVER THE UK...

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
DO THESE ONES LIKE TV?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000
'CUZ THEY LIVE IN A
DIFFERENT COUNTRY

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
AND THEY DON'T
HAVE A TELEVISION.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
...AND DISCOVERED WHICH
CHARACTERISTICS

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
THEY'D PUT WITH
EACH ETHNIC GROUP.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
DO YOU THINK ANY OF
 THEM WOULD BE KIND?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
ANYBODY ELSE
 OR IS THAT IT?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
THAT'S IT.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000
DO YOU THINK ANY OF
 THEM WOULD BE MEAN?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000
DO YOU THINK ANY OF THESE
 CHILDREN ARE REALLY NASTY?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU
 LIKE TO PLAY WITH?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
ALMOST ALL OF THE
WHITE CHILDREN CHOOSE

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
THE WHITE CHILD FOR THE
GOOD THINGS AND, MORE OFTEN,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
CHOOSE EVERYONE
ELSE FOR THE BAD.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
THE ASTONISHING THING
IS THAT HALF THE TIME

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
THE BLACK CHILDREN
DO THE SAME.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU
 LIKE TO PLAY WITH?

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
THIS ONE.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
WHY DO YOU THINK THESE
 ONES WLD BE REALLY SMART

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000
AND KNOW ALL THEIR
 NUMBERS AND THEIR LETTERS?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
BECAUSE THEY GOT
A WHITE FACE.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE
 TO HAVE OVER TO YOUR HOUSE

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
TO PLAY THE MOST?
 - THIS ONE.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
WHICH ONE WOULD
 YOU LIKE THE BEST?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
YOU'D LIKE THAT
 ONE THE BEST?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
DO YOU THINK THAT ANY OF
 THESE CHILDREN SNATCH THINGS?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:52.000
WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD
 GET INTO TROUBLE?

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
WHAT'S SHOCKING IS THAT
WHILE MOST WHITE CHILDREN

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
PREFER PEOPLE
LIKE THEMSELVES,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
THE SAME ISN'T THE CASE
WITH BLACK CHILDREN.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
NORMALLY 4-YEAR-OLDS
PREFER OTHERS LIKE THEM.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
THE FACT THAT BLACK
CHILDREN DON'T,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
SHOWS THAT THEY'RE PICKING
UP ON RACIAL STEREOTYPES

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
THAT FAVOR WHITES.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
AND THE WHITE CHILDREN ARE
PICKING UP ON THEM, TOO.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
THESE STEREOTYPES NEED TO
BE CONSTANTLY CHALLENGED

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
IF THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO BECOME ENTRENCHED.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
SO WHAT MESSAGES HAS
TYRESE BEEN PICKING UP?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
WHICH ONE DO YOU THINK
 WOULD BE CLEVER?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU
 SHARE YOUR TOYS WITH?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU
 LIKE TO PLAY WITH?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU LIKE TO
 SIT NEXT TO AT LUNCHTIME?

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
WHICH ONE WOULD
 YOU LIKE THE BEST?

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
WHICH ONE, TYRESE,
 WILL BE A POP STAR

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
WHEN THEY'RE BIG,
 DO YOU THINK?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
TYRESE HAD ONE OF THE
MOST POSITIVE ATTITUDES

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
OF ALL THE CHILDREN
TO BEING BLACK.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
MARIE'S EFFORTS APPEAR
TO BE PAYING OFF.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
SHE HOPES THIS AND HER
BRAND OF TOUGH LOVE

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000
WILL SEE HIM THROUGH.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
IF I CAN GIVE HIM
WHAT I'VE LEARNED,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
THEN THINGS WILL BE,
NOT NECESSARILY EASIER,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
BUT HE'LL UNDERSTAND WHY
THINGS ARE HAPPENING

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
AND NOT TAKE THE SORT
OF KNOCK BACKS SO HARD

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
AND THAT IT'S PART OF
LIFE AND LIFE IS CRAP.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
OKAY, SO WE'RE HAVING
 SHABBAT PARTY TODAY.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
WHAT DO WE DO
 FOR SHABBAT?

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
FOR REBECCA, ETHNICITY IS
ALSO PLAYING A BIG PART

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
IN HER DEVELOPING
SENSE OF HER IDENTITY.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
MOMMY CAN GET
 THE TABLE READY,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
THE SPECIAL
 TABLE FOR SHABBAT.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
REBECCA IS JEWISH.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
SHE'S GROWING UP IN A
STRONG JEWISH COMMUNITY,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
ATTENDS A JEWISH
SCHOOL AND, AT FOUR,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
IS STARTING
TO LEARN HEBREW.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
SAY SHABBAT SHALOM
 TO EVERYBODY.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
EVEN THIS YOUNG,
CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
ENGAGE WITH DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THEIR IDENTITY

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
SO IS THAT REFLECTED IN
HOW REBECCA EATS AT SCHOOL?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR
PICKY EATERS TO EAT BETTER

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
IN A MORE
REGIMENTED ENVIRONMENT.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
IT SEEMS FOOD BATTLES
MAY BE LIMITED TO HOME.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
TONIGHT THE SAUNDERS ARE
CELEBRATING ANOTHER PART

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
OF THEIR IDENTITY.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:30.000
THEY'RE GETTING READY
FOR A BIG ENGLAND MATCH.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
GILL'S IN THE KITCHEN
REINFORCING REBECCA'S

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
IDENTITY AS A GOOD GIRL.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
LET'S SEE WHAT
SOME OF THEM SAY.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
REBECCA WAS VERY BRAVE
WHEN SHE HURT HER FINGERS.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
YOU DIDN'T...

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
CRY.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
YOU DIDN'T CRY.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
ELSEWHERE THE REST OF THE
FAMILY ARE INDULGING

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
IN AN ORGY OF
NATIONAL PRIDE.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
I THINK EVERY PUBLIC
BUILDING IN THIS COUNTRY

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
SHOULD FLY THE UNION JACK
AND THE ENGLISH CROSS.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
WHAT ARE DADDY
 AND DAVID LIKE

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
WHEN THERE'S FOOTBALL
 ON, REBECCA?

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
MAD.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
 FLAG IS ON YOUR FACE?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
WHO'S THE FLAG FOR?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
ENGLAND.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
ENGLAND.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
LIKE ALL CHILDREN,
REBECCA'S IDENTITY

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
IS MADE UP OF LOTS
OF DIFFERENT PARTS,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
BUT IS ONE STRONGER
THAN ANOTHER?

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
A SENSE OF NATIONAL
IDENTITY IS ONE OF THE

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
LAST ELEMENTS TO
FALL INTO PLACE.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
HERE.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
IN THIS PLACE.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
(FALLS OFF CHAIR).

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000
WHAT COUNTRY
 DO YOU LIVE IN?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
UH, IT'S SOMETHING.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
HEY?

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
SOMETHING. SOMETHING...

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S CALLED.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
JAMAICA.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000
ASDA.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
ARE YOU BRITISH?
 - NO.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
ARE YOU SCOTTISH?
 - NO.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
ARE YOU WELSH?
- NO.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
ARE YOU ENGLISH?
- NO.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
MOST OF OUR CHILDREN
DON'T HAVE A CLUE

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
ABOUT NATIONALITY.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
SO HOW DOES REBECCA
SEE HERSELF?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
WELSH?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
ENGLISH?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
IRISH?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
OR SOMETHING ELSE?

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
JEWISH?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
IT SEEMS JEWISHNESS IS
ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
ASPECTS OF
REBECCA'S IDENTITY.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
EAGER TO EXPAND HER
CHILDREN'S HORIZONS,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
GILLIAN ROBERTS HAS TAKEN
THE FAMILY ABROAD TO FRANCE.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
THAT MAN'S GOT A PROPER
FRENCH BERET ON HIS HEAD,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
DOESN'T HE?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
WATCH WHAT IT DOES.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
IT TURNS ON BY ITSELF.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
I CAN'T STOP IT, IT
JUST DOES IT ITSELF.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.000
THAT'S FOR WASHING
FRENCH PEOPLES' BOTTOMS.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
IT IS!

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
UN, DEUX, TROIS, QUATRE,
CANQ - OR IT CAN BE 'CINQ'

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
- SIX, SEPT, HUIT, NEUF,
DIX, ONZE, DOUZE, TREIZE...

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:39.000
UN, QUATRE, SIX,
SEPT, UM, QUATRE.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
BUT IN SPITE OF HIS
SISTER ALICE'S EFFORTS

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
TO MAKE HIM A BIT
MORE INTERNATIONAL,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
WILLIAM'S MISSING
HIS HOME COMFORTS.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
FRANCE NOT NICE.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
WHY?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FISH AND CHIPS

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
AND BATTERED SAUSAGE.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
OTHER MEMORIES OF HOME
ARE INTRUDING ON HIS

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
PARENTS' PLEASURE.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
GILLIAN'S GOT HER WAY
AND SOLD THE HOUSE

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
ALTHOUGH THEY'VE
NOWHERE TO MOVE TO.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
YOU KNOW, ONE OF NEIL'S
MOTHER'S REASONS

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
THAT WE SHOULDN'T SELL
THE HOUSE IS BECAUSE

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
WHEN ONE OF THE CHILDREN
BECOMES A VET IN SETTLE

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.000
THEY'LL NEED A HOUSE
IN SETTLE TO LIVE IN.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000
WILLIAM'S PICKING UP ON THE
TENSION IN THE HOUSEHOLD

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
AND FIGHTING TO GET HIS
WAY IS BECOMING THE NORM.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
HIS CONSTANT ATTEMPTS
TO ASSERT HIMSELF

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
ARE PROVING DIFFICULT FOR
EVERYONE TO LIVE WITH.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HE LIKES RUGBY.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
WELL, HE THINKS RUGBY'S
SO ROUGH THAT HE WANTS

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
TO BE ROUGH WITH
HIS FAMILY.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
AT THIS AGE, BOYS WITH A
STRONG MASCULINE IDENTITY

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
OFTEN START TESTING OUT
THOSE CLOSEST TO THEM

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000
TO SEE WHO'S STRONGEST.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
AND NOW THE TWO MOST
FORCEFUL MEMBERS OF THE

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
ROBERTS' FAMILY ARE
FINDING THEMSELVES

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
ENGAGED IN A
BATTLE OF WILLS.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
ONE DAY SOMEBODY'S GOING
TO COME AND FIGHT WITH YOU

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000
AND YOU'LL WISH THAT
YOU HADN'T STARTED IT

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
BECAUSE THEY'LL
HURT YOU.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
NO, I WILL BE CAREFUL
AND I'LL BITE THEM.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
WELL, IT WILL SERVE
YOU RIGHT IF SOMEONE

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000
JUST HURTS YOU, WILLIAM.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
WILLIAM THINKS HS THE
BEST AT EVERYTHING

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
BUT HE WILL LEARN SOONER
OR LATER THAT HE'S NOT.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
HE'S NOT QUITE AS
CLEVER AS HE THINKS.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
HE'S NOT QUITE
AS CLEVER AS ME.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
WE'VE SPENT ALL THIS TIME
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
WILLIAM'S CONFIDENT
AND WHAT'S HAPPENED?

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
HE'S TOO CONFIDENT.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
AND NOW WE WANT HIM
TO BE LESS CONFIDENT.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
NO, THAT'S BABYLISH,
THAT'S BABYLISH.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.000
SOMEBODY WANTS THE CONFIDENCE
KNOCKED OUT OF HIM.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
OH, THAT'S JUST BABYLISH,
THAT'S BABYLISH.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
IT'S NOT JUST HIS
MOTHER HE'S TAKING ON.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
WILLIAM'S PURSUING A
SINGLE-MINDED CAMPAIGN

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
TO ASSERT HIMSELF OV
HIS OLDER SIBLINGS.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000
HE'S ALWAYS HITTING PEOPLE,
PULLING THEM AROUND.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
THROWING THINGS AT
THEM, BITING THEM,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000
AND SOMETIMES IT'S
HARD TO LIKE HIM.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENED TO HIM.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
BEING TOLD OFF HE OFTEN
LAUGHS IN YOUR FACE.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
HE LAUGHS AT YOU.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
HE DOESN'T CARE.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
YOU CAN BE THERE
SHOUTING AND RAVING.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
AND EVEN YOU
CAN SLAP HIM.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
"THAT DIDN'T HURT
ME - HA HA HA".

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
HE'S JUST, HE'S SO
FULL OF HIMSELF.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
NO, WILLIAM, NO!

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
NO!

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
HE'S ALWAYS THE AGGRESSOR.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
DON'T BE LIKE A CRYBABY!

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
LOOK, HE'S THROWING
STONES AT CHARLES.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
YOU'RE BEING A
BABY, WILLIAM.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
NO, YOU'RE BEING A BABY.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
HE JUST KNOWS HOW
TO GET TO PEOPLE.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
HE KNOWS HOW TO
UPSET PEOPLE.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
HE KNOWS HOW
TO UPSET ME.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
BACK IN PECKHAM, JAMES
CACHIA'S FAMILY HAVE

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
COME BACK TO THE FLAT
TO COLLECT A FEW THINGS.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
BUT WHILE THEY'VE BEEN
AWAY, CAROL'S EX-BOYFRIEND

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
HAS BEEN ROUND AGAIN
AND HELPED HIMSELF.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
LOOK, OUR SOFA'S GONE.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
LOOK, FOOTBALL!

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
HE TOOK THE SOFAS
AND OUR COOKER.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
I RECKON HE'S SOLD THEM.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
BUT CAROL'S FINALLY
HAD SOME GOOD NEWS.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
THEY'VE FOUND ME
SOMEWHERE TO STAY, SO...

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
WHAT KIND OF PLACE
 ARE YOU GOING TO?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
A WOMEN'S REFUGE.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING
 IT WILL BE LIKE?

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
WELL, I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO BRING FRIENDS THERE.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
I DUNNO.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
A CALL CAROL MADE TO A
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HELP LINE

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
HAS PAID OFF.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000
SHE'S BEEN TOLD SHS
GOT TO LEAVE THE FLAT

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000
STRAIGHT AWAY.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
BERNIE, COME AND
GET SOME BAGS.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
CLIMB OVER AND GET
JAMES'S TRAINERS, WILL YOU?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
SCARED HER EX-BOYFRIEND
WILL RETURN,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
CAROL'S GATHERED TOGETHER
WHAT SHE CAN CARRY.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
FOR JAMES IT MEANS LEAVING
MOST OF HIS TOYS BEHIND.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
BUT I'LL MISS
THAT CAR CAR.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000
ARE YOU TAKING THAT
ELMO OR NOT, JAMES?

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:30.000
PUT ELMO IN! PUT ELMO IN.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
ALRIGHT, JAMES.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.000
IT'S TOO HEAVY
TO CARRY, MAN.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
I'M FED UP OF IT.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
FED UP OF COMING
BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
OH, PISS OFF!

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
GOODBYE, SHITHOLE.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:56.000
OH, LOOK. HIS
SKATEBOARD'S THERE.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
JAMES!

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
GET DOWN.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
RIGHT, WE'LL
GO WITHOUT YOU.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:14.000
SEE YOU LATER.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
AS JAMES, CAROL, AND
BERNIE PREPARE TO LEAVE

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
PECKHAM FOR GOOD, THE
SHADOW THEY'VE BEEN

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
LIVING UNDER ALREADY
SEEMS TO BE LIFTING.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
AND WE'RE MOVING ON
THE RIGHT DAY AS WELL.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:27.000
NICE AND SUNNY.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
BRILLIANT.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
THE REFUGE IS ONLY A
TEMPORARY SOLUTION

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
UNTIL THEY CAN FIND
A PERMANENT NEW HOME.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:42.000
BUT IT'S A START.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
WE'RE JUST GOING TO MEET
THE LADIES AND GET INTO

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
THE HOSTEL AND THAT.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000
YOU KNOW, I AIN'T
EVEN GOT A BAG.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
CAROL'S ARRANGED TO MEET
TWO WOMEN FROM THE REFUGE

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
ON A STREET CORNER
WHO'LL TAKE THEM TO

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
A SECR LOCATION.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
I'LL JUST GO AND
GET MY LITTLE BOY.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
HE'S FAST OUT.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000
FOR THE FAMILY'S SAFETY
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
TO FOLLOW THEM.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
AT THE END OF THEIR FIFTH
YEAR, MOST CHILDREN ARE

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.000
BEGINNING TO DEVELOP A
PICTURE OF THEMSELVES

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000
TRAVELING THROUGH LIFE.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
AND FOR THE FIRST
TIME OUR CHILDREN ARE

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
BEGINNING TO REALIZE
THEY HAVA PAST.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
AND, MORE
IMPORTANTLY, A FUTURE.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000
WH YOU GROW UP, WHAT DO
 YOU THINK YOU WANT TO BE?

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000
A RABBIT.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
A CLIMBING GIRL.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
A FIREMAN.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
BALLERINA.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
WHAT ABOUT JAMES?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
JAMES IS STILL LOCKED
IN THE PRESENT.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
WILLIAM HAS NO
SUCH DOUBTS.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000
POLICEMAN.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000
IT'S MOVING DAY
FOR THE ROBERTS.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
GILLIAN'S FOUND
HER DREAM COTTAGE.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
BUT LIFE IN A BIG NEW
HOUSE ISN'T ALWAYS

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.000
A GAME OF HAPPY FAMILIES.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
WILLIAM'S GOT STRAIGHT
TO WORK ESTABLISHING

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
HIS DOMINANT POSITION
IN THE NEW HOUSE.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000
ARGHHHH.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
CAN YOU PLEASE TRY
AND PLAY NICELY?

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
WHY ARE YOU KILLING ME?

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
FOR HIS OLDER BROTHER
CHARLES THERE'S NO LET UP.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:55.000
AH, WILLIAM'S A BULLY BUT HE
SAYS ALL I DO IS ANNOY HIM.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
THEY'LL FIND OUT
ABOUT YOU, WILLIAM.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
THEY'LL ALL FIND
OUT ABOUT YOU.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
MY BROTHER, THAT'S
WHY I HATE HIM.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
WITH NEIL AT WORK,
GILLIAN'S LEFT WITH THE

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
MAMMOTH TASK OF SORTING OUT
THE HOUSE IN THE FACE OF

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
WILLIAM'S DETERMINATION
TO RULE THE ROOST.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
CAN YOU PLEASE!

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
COME IN HERE
PLEASE, WILLIAM.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000
YOU COME IN HERE.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO
SPOIL CHARLES'S GAME

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
ON PURPOSE, AREN'T YOU?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
WELL, SIT THERE IN THAT
CORNER AND THAT IS YOUR

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
NAUGHTY CORNER BECAUSE
YOU'VE BEEN A NAUGHTY BOY.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
NOW YOU SIT DOWN IN
THE NAUGHTY CORNER

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
AND YOU STAY THERE.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
NO, I WON'T.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
GET BACK.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:41.000
I'VE GOT OUT!

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
THERE'S NOTHING YOU
CAN DO WITH HIM.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000
STOP IT, CHARLES.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.000
I HATE BALLET!

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000
THE CHILDREN ARE SETTLING
IN BUT GILLIAN'S HAVING

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
A MOMENT OF SELF DOUBT
ABOUT WHETHER SHE'S DONE

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000
THE RIGHT THING.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
I'M JUST THINKING I'M
NOT VERY GOOD AT CHANGE.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
I JUST THINK, CHRIST, I
HAVE MADE THIS HAPPEN.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
WHY AM I DOING THIS?

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000
AH, WELL, I'LL
GET OVER IT.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
YOU SEE, THE THING
IS, IT'S DIFFERENT.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
CHOICE ABOUT MOVING

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
YOU DON'T HAVE ALL
THIS STRESS BECAUSE

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000
YOU DON'T HAVE A
CHOICE, DO YOU?

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000
IT DOESN TAKE GILLIAN
LONG TO BEGIN TO

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.000
APPRECIATE HER
NEW SURROUNDINGS.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
FANTASTIC GOOSEBERRIES!

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
EVEN NEIL'S COMING ROUND TO
THE IDEA OF THE NEW HOUSE.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
WHEN YOU COME
OUT HERE YOU THINK,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.000
"OH, IT'S DEFINITELY
THE RIGHT THING".

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000
IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT
HERE, ISN'T IT?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
WHAT MORE COULD
YOU WANT TO SEE?

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
WELL, A FEW SHEEP AS WELL.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000
AS LONG AS IT ISN'T
LAMBING TIME AND THEY'VE

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000
BEEN SEPARATED AND THEY'RE
BLEATING THEIR HEADS OFF.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
NO, IT'S BEEN VERY
NICE THIS, HASN'T IT?

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
AND WILLIAM AND GILLIAN ARE
FINDING SOME COMMON GROUND.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
DO YOU LIKE THE COWS?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
I LOVE COWS AND THINGS.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.000
KEEP STILL AND QUIET
KEEP STILL AND QUIET.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
KEEP STILL.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
IT MIGHT ONLY BE A FEW
MILES OUT OF SETTLE,

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
BUT FOR GILLIAN THE MOVE IS
THE FIRST VICTORY IN HER

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
CAMPAIGN TO PROPEL WILLIAM
INTO A WIDER WORLD.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.000
JAMES CACHIA HAS GOT
A NEW HOUSE, TOO.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
IS THIS OUR HOUSE, MOM?

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
NICE DOOR, THOUGH.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
IS THIS OUR HOUSE?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
NICE DOOR.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
HEY, OUR NEW HOUSE!

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
OH, YUCK!

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
OH, WELL, STAY OUT
THERE THEN, BERNIE.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:12.000
OH, AT LEAST WE GOT AN
UPSTAIRS AND A DOWNSTAIRS.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.000
I'VE GOT 10 CUPBOARDS
IN MY KITCHEN.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
IT'S A NEW LIFE,
A NEW START.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
THAT'S THE BEST
PRESENT I CAN EVER GET.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000
A ROUGH AREA COMPARED TO
PECKHAM BUT MY ROOM

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
IS BIGGER THAN
PECKHAM'S ONE.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE
A ROOM, ANYWAY.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
THIS IS BIGGER, BERNIE'S
ROOM IS BIGGER.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000
I JUST COULDN'T WANT MORE
THAN WHAT I'VE ALREADY GOT

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
WITH HER FURNITURE
GONE AND NO MONEY,

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.000
CAROL HAS TO WAIT SIX WEEKS
BEFORE SHE CAN MOVE IN.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000
UNTIL THEN THE FLAT
WILL RAIN EMPTY.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
MOMMY, LOOK.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
YES, BERNIE.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
IT CAME OFF.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
BUT IT ISN'T LONG BEFORE
THE CHILDREN START TO

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
FIND FAULT WITH
THEIR NEW HO.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
THIS IS A STUPID HOUSE.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT, JAMES.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.000
I DON'T LIKE IT.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
WELL, DON'T HAVE IT.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
WE'LL STAY IN
THE HOSTEL THEN.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
COULDN'T YOU CHOOSE A
BETTER HOUSE THAN THIS?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.000
I HAD NO CHOICE.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.000
I THINK EY'RE
QUITE CONFUSED ABOUT

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
WHAT'S GOING
ON AND THAT.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
THEY JUST THINK THE
REFUGE IS OUR HOME.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
THIS IS A STUPID
DUMBO HOUSE.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
SO, YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000
ALRIGHT, I'LL GIVE
IT BACK TO THE LADY.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
I AM A BIT
DISAPPOINTED, YEAH.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
A LOT.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000
DON'T!

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
THAT'S GAS.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
DON'T PULL THAT OR
THERE'LL BE GAS EVERYWHERE.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000
DO IT AND I WILLLAP YOU.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000
CAROL'S MANAGED TO BRING
HER CHILDREN TO SAFETY

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
BUT THERE'S STILL A LONG
WAY TO GO BEFORE THIS CAN

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
BECOME A HOME.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
I'M SHUTTING THE DOOR. LOUD.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
DON'T, JAMES, BECAUSE
OF OUR NEIGHBORS.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
SLAM THAT DOOR AGAIN!

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000
SLAM IT AGAIN!

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I DON'T LIKE
THIS WALLPAPER.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000
WHO'S IS THIS BALL?

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
IT'S YOURS.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
I KNOW IT IS, WHO
WAS PLAYING WITH IT?

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:35.000
JAMES AND HIS SISTER HAVE BEEN
ACCEPTED INTO A NEW SCHOOL.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
JAMES IS DOING WELL.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
HE'S STILL ABLE TO USE
SCHOOL AS A HAVEN

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
FROM THE CHAOS AT HOME.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.000
AT THE MOMENT, JAMES'S
LIFE IS DOMINATED BY

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000
THE CHANGES IN HIS
ENVIRONMENT BUT THERE ARE

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000
OTHER PROFOUND
INFLUENCES ON JAMES:

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
HIS FAMILY AND HIS SCHOOL.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000
THESE AREAS OF CERTAINTY
WILL HELP SHAPE HIS IDENTITY

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
AND SO HIS FUTURE.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000
*

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:18.000
*

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
NEXT ON CHILD
OF OUR TIME,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000
HOW CHILDREN SPEND THEIR
TIME AND WHAT TELEVISION

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:29.000
AND COUTER GAMES
ARE DOING TO THEM.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:40.000
