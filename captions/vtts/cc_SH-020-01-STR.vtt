00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:49.870


2
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.230
In Troy, there lies thescene. From isles of Greece

3
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.030
The princes orgulous,their high blood chafed,

4
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.700
Have to the port of Athenssent their ships,

5
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
Fraught with the ministersand instruments

6
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.900
Of cruel war: sixty andnine, that wore

7
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.230
Their crownets regal, fromthe Athenian bay

8
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.470
Put forth toward Phrygia;and their vow is made

9
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.130
To ransack Troy, withinwhose strong immures

10
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.370
The ravish'd Helen,Menelaus' queen,

11
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.000
With wanton Paris sleeps;and that's the quarrel.

12
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.870
To Tenedos they come;

13
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.030
And the deep-drawing barksdo there disgorge

14
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.400
Their warlike fraughtage:now on Dardan plains

15
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.630
The fresh and yetunbruised Greeks do pitch

16
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.500
Their brave pavilions:Priam's six-gated city,

17
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.100
Dardan, and Tymbria,Helias, Chetas, Troien,

18
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730
And Antenorides, withmassy staples

19
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.230
And corresponsive andfulfilling bolts,

20
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.570
Sperr up the sons of Troy.

21
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.600
Now expectation, ticklingskittish spirits,

22
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.370
On one and other side,Trojan and Greek,

23
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.430
Sets all on hazard: andhither am I come

24
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.300
A prologue arm'd, but notin confidence

25
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.370
Of author's pen or actor'svoice, but suited

26
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.670
In like conditions as ourargument,

27
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.830
To tell you, fairbeholders, that our play

28
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.330
Leaps o'er the vaunt andfirstlings of those broils,

29
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.830
Beginning in the middle,starting thence away

30
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.970
To what may be digested ina play.

31
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.970
Like or find fault; do asyour pleasures are:

32
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.230
Now good or bad, 'tis butthe chance of war.

33
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.830
Call here my varlet; I'llunarm again:

34
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.170
Why should I war withoutthe walls of Troy,

35
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.430
That find such cruelbattle here within?

36
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.400
Each Trojan that is masterof his heart,

37
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.130
Let him to field; Troilus,alas! hath none.

38
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.200
Will this gear ne'er bemended?

39
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.930
The Greeks are strong andskilful to their strength,

40
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.830
Fierce to their skill and totheir fierceness valiant;

41
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.800
But I am weaker than awoman's tear,

42
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.100
Tamer than sleep, fonderthan ignorance,

43
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.370
Less valiant than thevirgin in the night

44
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.300
And skilless asunpractised infancy.

45
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.530
Well, I have toldyou enough of this:

46
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.330
for my part, I'll not meddlenor make no further.

47
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.830
He that will have acake out of the wheat

48
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.470
must needs tarrythe grinding.

49
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.530
Have I not tarried?

50
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.000
Ay, the grinding; but youmust tarry the bolting.

51
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.130
Have I not tarried?

52
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.030
Ay, the bolting, but youmust tarry the leavening.

53
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.200
Still have I tarried.

54
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.470
Ay, to the leavening; buthere's yet in the word

55
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.470
'hereafter' the kneading,the making of the cake,

56
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.400
the heating of theoven and the baking;

57
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.800
nay, you must staythe cooling too,

58
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.400
or you may chanceto burn your lips.

59
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.800
Patience herself, whatgoddess e'er she be,

60
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.130
Doth lesser blench atsufferance than I do.

61
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.630
At Priam's royal table doI sit;

62
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.600
And when fair Cressidcomes into my thoughts,--

63
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.670
So, traitor! 'When shecomes!' When is she thence?

64
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.300
Well, she looked yesternightfairer than ever I saw

65
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.270
her look, or any womanelse.

66
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.700
I was about to tellthee:--when my heart,

67
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.370
As wedged with a sigh,would rive in twain,

68
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.870
Lest Hector or my fathershould perceive me,

69
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.930
I have, as when the sundoth light a storm,

70
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.630
Buried this sigh inwrinkle of a smile:

71
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.500
But sorrow, that is couch'din seeming gladness,

72
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.170
Is like that mirth fateturns to sudden sadness.

73
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.770
An her hair were not somewhatdarker than Helen's--

74
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.430
well, go to--there were no morecomparison between the women:

75
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.700
but, for my part, sheis my kinswoman;

76
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.600
I would not, as theyterm it, praise her:

77
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.830
but I would somebody had heardher talk yesterday, as I did.

78
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.230
I will not dispraise yoursister Cassandra's wit, but--

79
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.970
O Pandarus! I tell thee,Pandarus,--

80
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.530
When I do tell thee, theremy hopes lie drown'd,

81
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.170
Reply not in how manyfathoms deep

82
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.070
They lie indrench'd. Itell thee I am mad

83
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.870
In Cressid's love: thouanswer'st 'she is fair;'

84
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.270
Pour'st in the open ulcerof my heart

85
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.670
Her eyes, her hair, hercheek, her gait, her voice,

86
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.630
Handlest in thy discourse,O, that her hand,

87
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.430
In whose comparison allwhites are ink,

88
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.300
Writing their own reproach,to whose soft seizure

89
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.070
The cygnet's down is harshand spirit of sense

90
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.870
Hard as the palm of ploughman:this thou tell'st me,

91
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.230
As true thou tell'st me,when I say I love her;

92
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.000
But, saying thus, insteadof oil and balm,

93
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.870
Thou lay'st in every gashthat love hath given me

94
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.170
The knife that made it.

95
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.500
I speak no more thantruth.

96
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.530
Thou dost not speak somuch.

97
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.270
Faith, I'll not meddlein't. Let her be as she is:

98
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.900
if she be fair, 'tis the betterfor her; an she be not,

99
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.570
she has the mendsin her own hands.

100
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.370
Good Pandarus, how now,Pandarus!

101
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.300
I have had my labourfor my travail;

102
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.100
ill-thought on of her andill-thought on of you;

103
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:28.530
gone between and between, butsmall thanks for my labour.

104
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.500
What, art thou angry,Pandarus? what, with me?

105
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.330
Because she's kin to me,

106
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.470
therefore she's notso fair as Helen:

107
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.970
an she were not kin to me, shewould be as fair on Friday

108
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.630
as Helen is on Sunday.But what care I?

109
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.630
I care not an shewere a black-a-moor;

110
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.000
'tis all one to me.

111
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.300
Say I she is not fair?

112
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.400
I do not care whetheryou do or no.

113
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.570
She's a fool to stay behind herfather; let her to the Greeks;

114
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.130
and so I'll tell her the nexttime I see her: for my part,

115
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.970
I'll meddle nor make nomore i' the matter.

116
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.630
Pandarus,--

117
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.530
Not I.

118
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.800
Sweet Pandarus,--

119
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.630
Pray you, speak no more to me: Iwill leave all as I found it,

120
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.400
and there an end.

121
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.570
Peace, you ungraciousclamours! peace, rude sounds!

122
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:50.430
Fools on both sides! Helenmust needs be fair,

123
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.930
When with your blood youdaily paint her thus.

124
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.830
I cannot fight upon thisargument;

125
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.230
It is too starved asubject for my sword.

126
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:10.900
But Pandarus,--O gods, howdo you plague me!

127
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.900
I cannot come to Cressidbut by Pandar;

128
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.600
And he's as tetchy to bewoo'd to woo.

129
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.100
As she is stubborn-chasteagainst all suit.

130
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.270
Tell me, Apollo, for thyDaphne's love,

131
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:37.730
What Cressid is, whatPandar, and what we?

132
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:49.670
Her bed is India; thereshe lies, a pearl:

133
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.270
Between our Ilium andwhere she resides,

134
00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:00.430
Let it be call'd the wildand wandering flood,

135
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:07.470
Ourself the merchant, andthis sailing Pandar

136
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:15.470
Our doubtful hope, ourconvoy and our bark.

137
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:26.270
How now, Prince Troilus!wherefore not afield?

138
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:32.270
Because not there: thiswoman's answer sorts,

139
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.530
For womanish it is to befrom thence.

140
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.630
What news, AEneas, fromthe field to-day?

141
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.500
That Paris is returnedhome and hurt.

142
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.370
By whom, AEneas?

143
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.030
Troilus, by Menelaus.

144
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:55.500
Let Paris bleed; 'tis buta scar to scorn;

145
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:03.030
Paris is gored withMenelaus' horn.

146
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.400
Hark, what good sport isout of town to-day!

147
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.000
Better at home, if 'wouldI might' were 'may.'

148
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.730
But to the sport abroad:are you bound thither?

149
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.470
In all swift haste.

150
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.370
Come, go we then together.

151
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.870
Who were those went by?

152
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.000
Queen Hecuba and Helen.

153
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.930
And whither go they?

154
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.600
Up to the eastern tower,

155
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.430
Whose height commands assubject all the vale,

156
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.730
To see the battle.

157
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.070
Hector, whose patienceIs, as a virtue, fix'd,

158
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.870
to-day was moved:

159
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.970
He chid Andromache andstruck his armourer,

160
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.800
And, like as there werehusbandry in war,

161
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.900
Before the sun rose he washarness'd light,

162
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.970
And to the field goes he;where every flower

163
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.070
Did, as a prophet, weep whatit foresaw In Hector's wrath.

164
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.000
What was his cause ofanger?

165
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.400
The noise goes, this:there is among the Greeks

166
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.770
A lord of Trojan blood,nephew to Hector;

167
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.870
They call him Ajax.

168
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.130
Good; and what of him?

169
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.230
They say he is a very manper se,

170
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.530
And stands alone.

171
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.700
So do all men, unless they aredrunk, sick, or have no legs.

172
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.800
This man, lady, hathrobbed many beasts

173
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.300
of their particular additions;he is as valiant as the lion,

174
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.370
churlish as the bear,slow as the elephant:

175
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.700
a man into whom naturehath so crowded humours

176
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.370
that his valour iscrushed into folly,

177
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.900
his folly saucedwith discretion:

178
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.600
there is no man hath a virtuethat he hath not a glimpse of,

179
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.300
nor any man an attaint but hecarries some stain of it:

180
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.730
he is melancholy without cause,

181
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.630
and merry against the hair: hehath the joints of every thing,

182
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:05.130
but everything so out of jointthat he is a gouty Briareus,

183
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.330
many hands and no use,

184
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.570
or purblind Argus, alleyes and no sight.

185
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.100
But how should this man,that makes me smile,

186
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.000
make Hector angry?

187
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.170
They say he yesterday copedHector in the battle

188
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.900
and struck him down, thedisdain and shame whereof hath

189
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.570
ever since kept Hectorfasting and waking.

190
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.430
Who comes here?

191
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.230
Madam, your unclePandarus.

192
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.430
Hector's a gallant man.

193
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.930
As may be in the world,lady.

194
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.100
What's that? what's that?

195
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.300
Good morrow, unclePandarus.

196
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.900
Good morrow, cousin Cressid:what do you talk of?

197
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.670
Good morrow, Alexander.How do you, cousin?

198
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.300
When were you at Ilium?

199
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.600
This morning, uncle.

200
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.600
What were you talkingof when I came?

201
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.230
Was Hector armed and goneere ye came to Ilium?

202
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.400
Helen was not up, was she?

203
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.470
Hector was gone, but Helenwas not up.

204
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.330
Even so: Hector wasstirring early.

205
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.300
That were we talking of,and of his anger.

206
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.630
Was he angry?

207
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.870
So he says here.

208
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.770
True, he was so: Iknow the cause too:

209
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.870
he'll lay about him to-day,I can tell them that:

210
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.330
and there's Troilus willnot come far behind him:

211
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.300
let them take heed of Troilus,I can tell them that too.

212
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.530
What, is he angry too?

213
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.670
Who, Troilus? Troilus isthe better man of the two.

214
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.700
O Jupiter! there's nocomparison.

215
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.830
What, not betweenTroilus and Hector?

216
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.170
Do you know a manif you see him?

217
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.870
Ay, if I ever saw himbefore and knew him.

218
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.100
Well, I say Troilus isTroilus.

219
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.870
Then you say as I say; for,I am sure, he is not Hector.

220
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.770
No, nor Hector is notTroilus in some degrees.

221
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.870
'Tis just to each of them;he is himself.

222
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.130
Himself! Alas, poorTroilus! I would he were.

223
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.370
So he is.

224
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.100
Condition, I had gonebarefoot to India.

225
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.300
He is not Hector.

226
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:55.830
Himself! no, he's not himself:would a' were himself!

227
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.230
Well, the gods are above;time must friend or end:

228
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:09.530
well, Troilus, well: I wouldmy heart were in her body.

229
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.000
No, Hector is not abetter man than Troilus.

230
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.800
Excuse me.

231
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.770
He is elder.

232
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.130
Pardon me, pardon me.

233
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.370
Th' other's not come to't; youshall tell me another tale,

234
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.000
when th' other's come to't.

235
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.470
Hector shall not havehis wit this year.

236
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.900
He shall not need it, ifhe have his own.

237
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.600
Nor his qualities.

238
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.430
No matter.

239
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.570
Nor his beauty.

240
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.830
'Twould not become him;his own's better.

241
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.670
You have no judgment, niece:

242
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.100
Helen herself sworeth' other day,

243
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.700
that fora brown favour

244
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.230
--for so 'tis, I must confess,--not brown neither,--

245
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.230
No, but brown.

246
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.500
'Faith, to say truth,brown and not brown.

247
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.730
To say the truth, true andnot true.

248
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.770
She praised his complexionabove Paris.

249
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.130
Why, Paris hath colourenough.

250
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.370
So he has.

251
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.130
Then Troilus should have toomuch: if she praised him above,

252
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.700
his complexion ishigher than his;

253
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.300
he having colour enough,and the other higher,

254
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.970
is too flaming a praisefor a good complexion.

255
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.200
I had as lief Helen'sgolden tongue

256
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.700
had commended Troilusfor a copper nose.

257
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.170
I swear to you. I think Helenloves him better than Paris.

258
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.630
Then she's a merry Greekindeed.

259
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.700
Nay, I am sure she does. Shecame to him th' other day

260
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.300
and puts me her whitehand to his cloven chin--

261
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.700
Juno have mercy! how cameit cloven?

262
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.130
Why, you know 'tis dimpled:I think his smiling

263
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.730
becomes him better thanany man in all Phrygia.

264
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.300
O, he smiles valiantly.

265
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.170
Does he not?

266
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.470
O yes, an 'twere a cloudin autumn.

267
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.030
Why, go to, then:

268
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.030
I cannot choose but laugh, tothink how she tickled his chin:

269
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.170
she has a marvellouswhite hand,

270
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.200
I must needs confess,--

271
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.530
Without the rack.

272
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.030
And she takes upon her to spya white hair on his chin.

273
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.300
Alas, poor chin! many awart is richer.

274
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.400
But there was such laughing!Queen Hecuba laughed

275
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.700
that her eyes ran o'er.

276
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.970
With mill-stones.

277
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.530
And Cassandra laughed.

278
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.730
Did her eyes runo'er too?

279
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.400
And Hector laughed.

280
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.330
At what was all thislaughing?

281
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:21.130
Marry, at the white hair thatHelen spied on Troilus' chin.

282
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.370
An't had been a green hair,I should have laughed too.

283
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.000
They laughed not so much at thehair as at his pretty answer.

284
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.800
What was his answer?

285
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.570
Quoth she, 'Here's but two andfifty hairs on your chin,

286
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.830
and one of them is white.

287
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.270
This is her question.

288
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.830
'Two and fifty hairs'quoth he, 'and one white:

289
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:44.500
that white hair is my father,and all the rest are his sons.'

290
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:50.130
'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'whichof these hairs is Paris,

291
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.030
my husband? 'The forkedone,' quoth he,

292
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.400
'pluck't out, and give it him.'

293
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.700
But there was such laughing!

294
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.600
and Helen so blushed,an Paris so chafed,

295
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.070
and all the rest solaughed, that it passed.

296
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:11.500
So let it now; for it hasbeen a great while going by.

297
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:18.830
Well, cousin. I told you athing yesterday; think on't.

298
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.370
So I do.

299
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:24.800
I'll be sworn 'tistrue; he will weep you,

300
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.200
an 'twere a manborn in April.

301
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.070
And I'll spring up in his tears,an 'twere a nettle against May.

302
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.870
(♪A retreat sounded by horns)

303
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.400
Hark! they are comingfrom the field:

304
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.570
shall we stand up here, and seethem as they pass toward Ilium?

305
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:49.930
good niece, do, sweetniece Cressida.

306
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:55.300
At your pleasure.

307
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.230
Here, here, here'san excellent place;

308
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.470
here we may seemost bravely:

309
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.900
I'll tell you them all bytheir names as they pass by;

310
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.900
but mark Troilusabove the rest.

311
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.930
Speak not so loud.

312
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.870
That's AEneas: is notthat a brave man?

313
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.530
he's one of the flowersof Troy, I can tell you:

314
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.630
but mark Troilus;you shall see Troilus anon.

315
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.670
Who's that?

316
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:29.600
That's Antenor: he has ashrewd wit, I can tell you;

317
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.800
and he's a mangood enough,

318
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.100
he's one o' the soundestjudgments in Troy whosoever,

319
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.000
and a proper manof person.

320
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.570
When comes Troilus? I'llshow you Troilus anon:

321
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.770
if he see me, you shallsee him nod at me.

322
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:44.500
Will he give you the nod?

323
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.370
You shall see.

324
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.100
If he do, the rich shall havemore.

325
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.300
(♪trumpet sounds)

326
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:55.900
That's Hector, that, that, lookyou, that; there's a fellow!

327
00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.370
Go thy way, Hector! There'sa brave man, niece.

328
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.170
O brave Hector!Look how he looks!

329
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.470
there's a countenance!is't not a brave man?

330
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.700
O, a brave man!

331
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.970
Is a' not? it does aman's heart good.

332
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.230
Look you what hacksare on his helmet!

333
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.030
look you yonder, do yousee? look you there:

334
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.130

take't off who will, asthey say: there be hacks!

336
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.230
Be those with swords?

337
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.600
Swords! any thing, he caresnot; an the devil come to him,

338
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:37.170
it's all one: by God's lid,it does one's heart good.

339
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.430
Yonder comes Paris,yonder comes Paris.

340
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.470
Look ye yonder, niece; is'tnot a gallant man too,

341
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.800
is't not? Why, thisis brave now.

342
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.630
Who said he came hurt hometo-day? he's not hurt:

343
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.130
why, this will do Helen'sheart good now, ha!

344
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.900
Would I could see Troilus now!You shall see Troilus anon.

345
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.470
Who's that?

346
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.000
That's Helenus. I marvelwhere Troilus is.

347
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.230
That's Helenus. I think hewent not forth to-day.

348
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.330
That's Helenus. CanHelenus fight, uncle?

349
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.330
Helenus? no. Yes, he'llfight indifferent well.

350
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.230
I marvel where Troilus is.

351
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:27.830
Hark! do you not hear thepeople cry 'Troilus'?

352
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.430
Helenus is a priest.

353
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.330
What sneaking fellowcomes yonder?

354
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:40.970
Where? yonder? that'sDeiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!

355
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.870
there's a man, niece!Hem! Brave Troilus!

356
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.400
the prince of chivalry!

357
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.630
Peace, for shame, peace!

358
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.030
Mark him; note him.O brave Troilus!

359
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.630
Look well upon him, niece: lookyou how his sword is bloodied,

360
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.930
and his helm more hacked thanHector's, and how he looks,

361
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.130
and how he goes! Oadmirable youth!

362
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.500
he ne'er sawthree and twenty.

363
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.670
Go thy way, Troilus,go thy way!

364
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.730
Had I a sister were a grace,or a daughter a goddess,

365
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:18.370
he should take his choice.O admirable man! Paris?

366
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:23.200
Paris is dirt to him; and, Iwarrant, Helen, to change,

367
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.000
would give an eye to boot.

368
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.100
Here come more.

369
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.930
Asses, fools, dolts! chaffand bran, chaff and bran!

370
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.830
porridge after meat!

371
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:37.600
I could live and die i'the eyes of Troilus.

372
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.430
Ne'er look, ne'er look:

373
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.100
the eagles are gone:

374
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:54.070
crows and daws,crows and daws!

375
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.630
I had rather be sucha man as Troilus

376
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.130
than Agamemnonand all Greece.

377
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.770
There is among theGreeks Achilles,

378
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.330
a better manthan Troilus.

379
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:11.800
Achilles! a drayman, aporter, a very camel.

380
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.830
Well, well.

381
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.170
'Well, well!' why, haveyou any discretion?

382
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.500
have you any eyes? Doyou know what a man is?

383
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.600
Is not birth, beauty, goodshape, manhood, discourse,

384
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.230
learning, gentleness,virtue, youth, liberality,

385
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.870
and such like, the spiceand salt that season a man?

386
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.070
Ay, a minced man: and then to bebaked with no date in the pie,

387
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.130
for then the man's date's out.

388
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:38.300
You are such a woman! one knowsnot at what ward you lie.

389
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.970
Upon my back, to defendmy belly; upon my wit,

390
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.930
to defend my wiles;upon my secrecy,

391
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.770
to defend mine honesty; mymask, to defend my beauty;

392
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.600
and you, to defend all these:

393
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.730
and at all these wards Ilie, at a thousand watches.

394
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.930
Say one of your watches.

395
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.570
Nay, I'll watch you for that;

396
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.700
and that's one of thechiefest of them too:

397
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.670
if I cannot ward whatI would not have hit,

398
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.830
I can watch you for tellinghow I took the blow;

399
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.030
unless it swell past hiding,and then it's past watching.

400
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.270
(laughing)

401
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.770
You are such another!

402
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.800
Sir, my lord wouldinstantly speak with you.

403
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.700
Where?

404
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.270
At your own house; therehe unarms him.

405
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.670
Good boy, tell him I come.

406
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.970
I doubt he be hurt. Fareye well, good niece.

407
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.800
Adieu, uncle.

408
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.970
I'll be with you, niece,by and by.

409
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.000
To bring, uncle?

410
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.430
Ay, a token from Troilus.

411
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.600
By the same token, you area bawd.

412
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:48.730
Words, vows, gifts, tears,and love's full sacrifice,

413
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.330
He offers in another'senterprise;

414
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.030
But more in Troilusthousand fold I see

415
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.570
Than in the glass ofPandar's praise may be;

416
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:06.470
Yet hold I off. Women areangels, wooing:

417
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:12.570
Things won are done; joy'ssoul lies in the doing.

418
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.200
That she beloved knowsnought that knows not this:

419
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.300
Men prize the thingungain'd more than it is:

420
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.930
That she was never yetthat ever knew

421
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.270
Love got so sweet as whendesire did sue.

422
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.800
Therefore this maxim outof love I teach:

423
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.070
Achievement is command;ungain'd, beseech:

424
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:40.200
Then though my heart'scontent firm love doth bear,

425
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.900
Nothing of that shall frommine eyes appear.

426
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.330
Princes,

427
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.570
What grief hath set thejaundice on your cheeks?

428
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.700
The ample proposition thathope makes

429
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.400
In all designs begun onearth below

430
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.170
Fails in thepromised largeness:

431
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.500
cheques and disasters

432
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.970
Grow in the veins ofactions highest rear'd,

433
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.770
As knots, by the confluxof meeting sap,

434
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.630
Infect the sound pine anddivert his grain

435
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.100
Tortive and errant fromhis course of growth.

436
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.030
Nor, princes, is it matternew to us

437
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:23.670
That we come short of oursuppose so far

438
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:30.770
That after seven years'siege yet Troy walls stand;

439
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.170
Sith every action thathath gone before,

440
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.370
Whereof we have record,trial did draw

441
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.970
Bias and thwart, notanswering the aim,

442
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.800
And that unbodied figureof the thought

443
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.630
That gave't surmised shape.Why then, you princes,

444
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.870
Do you with cheeks abash'dbehold our works,

445
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.700
And call them shames? whichare indeed nought else

446
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.700
But the protractive trialsof great Jove

447
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.400
To find persistiveconstancy in men:

448
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.100
The fineness of whichmetal is not found

449
00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.270
In fortune's love; forthen the bold and coward,

450
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:06.630
The wise and fool, theartist and unread,

451
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:11.230
The hard and soft, allaffined and kin:

452
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.230
But, in the wind andtempest of her frown,

453
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.070
Distinction, with a broadand powerful fan,

454
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.030
Puffing at all, winnowsthe light away;

455
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.170
And what hath mass ormatter, by itself

456
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.230
Lies rich in virtue andunmingled.

457
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.500
With due observance of thygodlike seat,

458
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.070
Great Agamemnon, Nestorshall apply

459
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.130
Thy latest words. In thereproof of chance

460
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:41.030
Lies the true proof ofmen: the sea being smooth,

461
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.570
How many shallow baubleboats dare sail

462
00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.730
Upon her patient breast,making their way

463
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.430
With those of nobler bulk!

464
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.200
But let the ruffian Boreasonce enrage

465
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.700
The gentle Thetis, andanon behold

466
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.700
The strong-ribb'd barkthrough liquid mountains cut,

467
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.330
Bounding between the twomoist elements,

468
00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.300
Like Perseus' horse:where's then the saucy boat

469
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.070
Whose weak untimber'dsides but even now

470
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.830
Co-rivall'd greatness?Either to harbour fled,

471
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.200
Or made a toast for Neptune.

472
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.030
Even so Doth valour's showand valour's worth divide

473
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.230
In storms of fortune; forin her ray and brightness

474
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.130
The herd hath moreannoyance by the breeze

475
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.500
Than by the tiger; butwhen the splitting wind

476
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.300
Makes flexible the kneesof knotted oaks,

477
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.400
And flies fled under shade,why, then the thing of courage

478
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.000
As roused with rage withrage doth sympathize,

479
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.800
And with an accent tunedin selfsame key

480
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.430
Retorts to chidingfortune.

481
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.700
Agamemnon,

482
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.770
Thou great commander,nerve and bone of Greece,

483
00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.970
Heart of our numbers, souland only spirit.

484
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.670
In whom the tempers andthe minds of all

485
00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:54.100
Should be shut up, hearwhat Ulysses speaks.

486
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.270
Besides the applauseand approbation

487
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.330
To which, most mightyfor thy place and sway,

488
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.130
And thou most reverend forthy stretch'd-out life

489
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.130
I give to both yourspeeches, which were such

490
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.400
As Agamemnon and the handof Greece

491
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.330
Should hold up high inbrass, and such again

492
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.870
As venerable Nestor,hatch'd in silver,

493
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.430
Should with a bond of air,strong as the axle-tree

494
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.470
On which heaven rides,knit all the Greekish ears

495
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:25.470
To his experienced tongue,yet let it please both,

496
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.030
Thou great, and wise, tohear Ulysses speak.

497
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.100
Speak, prince of Ithaca;and be't of less expect

498
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.070
That matter needless, ofimportless burden,

499
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.130
Divide thy lips, than weare confident,

500
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.600
When rank Thersites opeshis mastic jaws,

501
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.100
We shall hear music, witand oracle.

502
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:52.330
Troy, yet upon his basis,had been down,

503
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.500
And the great Hector'ssword had lack'd a master,

504
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.230
But for these instances.

505
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:02.570
The specialty of rule hathbeen neglected:

506
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.700
And, look, how manyGrecian tents do stand

507
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.530
Hollow upon this plain, somany hollow factions.

508
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.870
When that the general isnot like the hive

509
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.170
To whom the foragers shallall repair,

510
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:21.070
What honey is expected?Degree being vizarded,

511
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.430
The unworthiest shows asfairly in the mask.

512
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.100
The heavens themselves, theplanets and this centre

513
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.900
Observe degree, priorityand shape,

514
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.570
Insisture, course,proportion, season, form,

515
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.730
Office and custom, in allline of order;

516
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.600
And therefore is theglorious planet Sol

517
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.530
In noble eminenceenthroned and sphered

518
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.630
Amidst the other; whosemedicinable eye

519
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.030
Corrects the ill aspectsof planets evil,

520
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.270
And posts, like thecommandment of a king,

521
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.730
Sans cheque to good andbad: but when the planets

522
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:56.400
In evil mixture todisorder wander,

523
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.230
What plagues and whatportents! what mutiny!

524
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.930
What raging of the sea!shaking of earth!

525
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.900
Commotion in the winds!frights, horrors, changes,

526
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.230
Divert and crack, rend andderacinate

527
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.300
The unity and married calmof states

528
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.300
Quite from their fixure!O, when degree is shaked,

529
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.670
Which is the ladder to allhigh designs,

530
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.900
Then enterprise is sick!How could communities,

531
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.430
Degrees in schools andbrotherhoods in cities,

532
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.900
Peaceful commerce fromdividable shores,

533
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.470
The primogenitive and dueof birth,

534
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.430
Prerogative of age,crowns, sceptres, laurels,

535
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.000
But by degree, stand inauthentic place?

536
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.030
Take but degree away,untune that string,

537
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.770
And, hark, what discordfollows! each thing meets

538
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.070
In mere oppugnancy: thebounded waters

539
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.770
Should lift their bosomshigher than the shores

540
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.570
And make a sop of all thissolid globe:

541
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.330
Strength should be lord ofimbecility,

542
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.200
And the rude son shouldstrike his father dead:

543
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.430
Force should be right; orrather, right and wrong,

544
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.770
Between whose endless jarjustice resides,

545
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.600
Should lose their names,and so should justice too.

546
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.070
Then every thing includesitself in power,

547
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.870
Power into will, will intoappetite;

548
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.430
And appetite, an universalwolf,

549
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.270
So doubly seconded withwill and power,

550
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.430
Must make perforce anuniversal prey,

551
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.400
And last eat up himself.Great Agamemnon,

552
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.730
This chaos, when degree issuffocate,

553
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.270
Follows the choking.

554
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.670
And this neglection ofdegree it is

555
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.470
That by a pace goesbackward, with a purpose

556
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.570
It hath to climb. Thegeneral's disdain'd

557
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.800
By him one step below, heby the next,

558
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.170
That next by him beneath;so every step,

559
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.830
Exampled by the first pacethat is sick

560
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:49.270
Of his superior, grows toan envious fever

561
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.730
Of pale and bloodlessemulation:

562
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.430
And 'tis this fever thatkeeps Troy on foot,

563
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:02.630
Not her own sinews. To enda tale of length,

564
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.400
Troy in our weakness stands,not in her strength.

565
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.570
Most wisely hath Ulysseshere discover'd

566
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:15.170
The fever whereof all ourpower is sick.

567
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.030
The nature of the sicknessfound, Ulysses,

568
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:28.000
What is the remedy?

569
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.530
The great Achilles, whomopinion crowns

570
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.900
The sinew and the forehandof our host,

571
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.000
Having his ear full of hisairy fame,

572
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.630
Grows dainty of his worth,and in his tent

573
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.970
Lies mocking our designs:with him Patroclus

574
00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.570
Upon a lazy bed thelivelong day

575
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.930
Breaks scurril jests;

576
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.100
And with ridiculous andawkward action,

577
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.900
Which, slanderer, heimitation calls,

578
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:04.030
He pageants us. Sometime,great Agamemnon,

579
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.330
Thy topless deputation heputs on,

580
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.630
And, like a strutting player,

581
00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.970
whose conceit Liesin his hamstring,

582
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.230
and doth think it rich

583
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.770
To hear the woodendialogue and sound

584
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.670
'Twixt his stretch'd footingand the scaffoldage,--

585
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.900
Such to-be-pitied ando'er-wrested seeming

586
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.430
He acts thy greatness in:and when he speaks,

587
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.330
'Tis like a chime a-mending;with terms unsquared,

588
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.130
Which, from the tongue ofroaring Typhon dropp'd

589
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.600
Would seem hyperboles. Atthis fusty stuff

590
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.600
The large Achilles, on hispress'd bed lolling,

591
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.330
From his deep chest laughsout a loud applause;

592
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.130
Cries 'Excellent! 'tisAgamemnon right.

593
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.370
Now play me Nestor; hem,and stroke thy beard,

594
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.700
As he being drest to someoration.'

595
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.070
That's done, as near asthe extremest ends

596
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.200
Of parallels, as like asVulcan and his wife:

597
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.200
Yet god Achilles stillcries 'Excellent!

598
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.200
'Tis Nestor right. Nowplay him me, Patroclus,

599
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.570
Arming to answer in anight alarm.'

600
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.400
And then, forsooth, thefaint defects of age

601
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.530
Must be the scene ofmirth; to cough and spit,

602
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.930
And, with a palsy-fumblingon his gorget,

603
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:17.200
Shake in and out therivet: and at this sport

604
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.530
Sir Valour dies; cries 'O,enough, Patroclus;

605
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.370
Or give me ribs of steel!I shall split all

606
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:27.530
In pleasure of my spleen.'And in this fashion,

607
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.600
All our abilities, gifts,natures, shapes,

608
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.370
Severals and generals ofgrace exact,

609
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.400
Achievements, plots,orders, preventions,

610
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.370
Excitements to the field,or speech for truce,

611
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.730
Success or loss,what is or is not,

612
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.670
serves As stuff for thesetwo to make paradoxes.

613
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.830
And in the imitation ofthese twain--

614
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.100
Who, as Ulysses says,opinion crowns

615
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.070
With an imperialvoice--many are infect.

616
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.400
Ajax is grown self-will'd,and bears his head

617
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.230
In such a rein, in full asproud a place

618
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.870
As broad Achilles; keepshis tent like him;

619
00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.200
Makes factious feasts;rails on our state of war,

620
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.770
Bold as an oracle, andsets Thersites,

621
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.600
A slave whose gall coinsslanders like a mint,

622
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.970
To match us in comparisonswith dirt,

623
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:13.130
To weaken and discreditour exposure,

624
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.200
How rank soever rounded inwith danger.

625
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.400
They tax our policy, andcall it cowardice,

626
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.530
Count wisdom as no memberof the war,

627
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.470
Forestall prescience, andesteem no act

628
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.670
But that of hand: thestill and mental parts,

629
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.430
That do contrive how manyhands shall strike,

630
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.500
When fitness calls themon, and know by measure

631
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.170
Of their observant toilthe enemies' weight,--

632
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.600
Why, this hath not afinger's dignity:

633
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.930
They call this bed-work,mappery, closet-war;

634
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.000
So that the ram thatbatters down the wall,

635
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.270
For the great swing andrudeness of his poise,

636
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.870
They place before his handthat made the engine,

637
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.000
Or those that with thefineness of their souls

638
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.370
By reason guide hisexecution.

639
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.730
Let this be granted, andAchilles' horse

640
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.400
Makes many Thetis' sons.

641
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.300
(♪trumpet)

642
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.000
What trumpet? look,Menelaus.

643
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.100
From Troy.

644
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.330
Is this great Agamemnon'stent, I pray you?

645
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.270
Even this.

646
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.430
May one, that is a heraldand a prince,

647
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.800
Do a fair message to hiskingly eye?

648
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.230
With surety stronger thanAchilles' arm

649
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.230
'Fore all the Greekishheads, which with one voice

650
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.070
Call Agamemnon head andgeneral.

651
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.530
Fair leave and large security.

652
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.370
How may A stranger tothose most imperial looks

653
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.470
Know them from eyes ofother mortals?

654
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.270
How!

655
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.270
Ay;

656
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.670
I ask, that I might wakenreverence,

657
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.900
And bid the cheek be readywith a blush

658
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.700
Modest as morning when shecoldly eyes

659
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.370
The youthful Phoebus:

660
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.170
Which is that god inoffice, guiding men?

661
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.570
Which is the high andmighty Agamemnon?

662
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.730
This Trojan scorns us; orthe men of Troy

663
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.100
Are ceremonious courtiers.

664
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.730
Courtiers as free, asdebonair, unarm'd,

665
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.470
As bending angels; that'stheir fame in peace:

666
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.330
But when they would seemsoldiers, they have galls,

667
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.130
Good arms, strongjoints, true swords;

668
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.600
and, great Jove's accord,

669
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.670
Nothing so full of heart.But peace, AEneas,

670
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.000
Peace, Trojan; lay thyfinger on thy lips!

671
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.130
The worthiness of praisedistains his worth,

672
00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.730
If that the praised himselfbring the praise forth:

673
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.130
But what the repiningenemy commends,

674
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:40.600
That breath fame blows; thatpraise, sole pure, transcends.

675
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.270
Sir, you of Troy, call youyourself AEneas?

676
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.430
Ay, Greek, that is myname.

677
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.330
What's your affair I prayyou?

678
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.100
Sir, pardon; 'tis forAgamemnon's ears.

679
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.970
He hears naught privatelythat comes from Troy.

680
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.100
Nor I from Troy come notto whisper him:

681
00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.530
I bring a trumpet to arousehis senses,

682
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.830
To set his sense on theattentive bent,

683
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.070
And then to speak.

684
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.000
Speak frankly as the wind;

685
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.030
It is not Agamemnon'ssleeping hour:

686
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.000
That thou shalt know.Trojan, he is awake,

687
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.400
He tells thee so himself.

688
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.330
Trumpet, blow loud,

689
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.500
Send thy brass voice throughall these lazy tents;

690
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.300
And every Greek of mettle,let him know,

691
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.370
What Troy means fairlyshall be spoke aloud.

692
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:32.470
(♪trumpet sounds)

693
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.870
We have, great Agamemnon,here in Troy

694
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:54.370
A prince call'd Hector,--Priamis his father,--

695
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.430
Who in this dull andlong-continued truce

696
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.630
Is rusty grown: he bade metake a trumpet,

697
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:06.470
And to this purpose speak.Kings, princes, lords!

698
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.600
If there be one among thefair'st of Greece

699
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.700
That holds his honourhigher than his ease,

700
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.100
That seeks his praise morethan he fears his peril,

701
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.330
That knows his valour, andknows not his fear,

702
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.230
That loves his mistressmore than in confession,

703
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.100
With truant vows to herown lips he loves,

704
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.930
And dare avow her beautyand her worth

705
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:31.470
In other arms than hers,--tohim this challenge.

706
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.330
Hector, in view of Trojansand of Greeks,

707
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.600
Shall make it good, or dohis best to do it,

708
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.900
He hath a lady, wiser,fairer, truer,

709
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.900
Than ever Greek didcompass in his arms,

710
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.130
And will to-morrow withhis trumpet call

711
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.300
Midway between your tentsand walls of Troy,

712
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.630
To rouse a Grecian that istrue in love:

713
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.070
If any come, Hector shallhonour him;

714
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:04.370
If none, he'll say in Troywhen he retires,

715
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.430
The Grecian dames aresunburnt and not worth

716
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:13.630
The splinter of a lance.Even so much.

717
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.330
This shall be told ourlovers, Lord AEneas;

718
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.830
If none of them have soulin such a kind,

719
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.530
We left them all at home:but we are soldiers;

720
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.070
And may that soldier amere recreant prove,

721
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.330
That means not, hath not,or is not in love!

722
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.900
If then one is, or hath,or means to be,

723
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.470
That one meets Hector; ifnone else, I am he.

724
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.170
Tell him of Nestor, onethat was a man

725
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.330
When Hector's grandsiresuck'd: he is old now;

726
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.100
But if there be not in ourGrecian host

727
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.270
One noble man that hathone spark of fire,

728
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.530
To answer for his love,tell him from me

729
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.600
I'll hide my silver beardin a gold beaver

730
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.970
And in my vantbrace putthis wither'd brawn,

731
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.700
And meeting him will tellhim that my lady

732
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.200
Was fairer than hisgrandam and as chaste

733
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.100
As may be in the world:his youth in flood,

734
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:10.070
I'll prove this truth withmy three drops of blood.

735
00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.000
Now heavens forbid suchscarcity of youth!

736
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.870
Amen.

737
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:18.200
Fair Lord AEneas, let metouch your hand;

738
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.670
To our pavilion shall Ilead you, sir.

739
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.430
Achilles shall have wordof this intent;

740
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.930
So shall each lord ofGreece, from tent to tent:

741
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.370
Yourself shall feast withus before you go

742
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:33.170
And find the welcome of anoble foe.

743
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:42.600
Nestor!

744
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.770
What says Ulysses?

745
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.530
I have a young conceptionin my brain;

746
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.430
Be you my time to bring itto some shape.

747
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.400
What is't?

748
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.400
This 'tis:

749
00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:03.770
Blunt wedges rive hardknots: the seeded pride

750
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.170
That hath to this maturityblown up

751
00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:09.400
In rank Achilles must ornow be cropp'd,

752
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.400
Or, shedding, breed anursery of like evil,

753
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.730
To overbulk us all.

754
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.130
Well, and how?

755
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:20.900
This challenge that thegallant Hector sends,

756
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.030
However it is spread ingeneral name,

757
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:28.070
Relates in purpose only toAchilles.

758
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.230
The purpose is perspicuouseven as substance,

759
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.070
Whose grossness littlecharacters sum up:

760
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.430
And, in the publication,make no strain,

761
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.130
But that Achilles, werehis brain as barren

762
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.230
As banks of Libya,--though,Apollo knows, 'Tis dry enough,

763
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.930
--will, with greatspeed of judgment,

764
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.570
Ay, with celerity, findHector's purpose

765
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.370
Pointing on him.

766
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.570
And wake him to theanswer, think you?

767
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.030
Yes, 'tis most meet: whommay you else oppose,

768
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.630
That can from Hector bringhis honour off,

769
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.270
If not Achilles? Though'tbe a sportful combat,

770
00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:00.100
Yet in the trial muchopinion dwells;

771
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.300
For here the Trojans tasteour dear'st repute

772
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.870
With their finest palate:and trust to me, Ulysses,

773
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.270
Our imputation shall beoddly poised

774
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.000
In this wild action; forthe success,

775
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.930
Although particular, shallgive a scantling

776
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.270
Of good or bad unto thegeneral;

777
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.100
And in such indexes,although small pricks

778
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.530
To their subsequentvolumes, there is seen

779
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.230
The baby figure of thegiant mass

780
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:27.500
Of things to come atlarge. It is supposed

781
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.670
He that meets Hectorissues from our choice

782
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:32.630
And choice, being mutualact of all our souls,

783
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.770
Makes merit her election,and doth boil,

784
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.400
As 'twere from us all, aman distill'd

785
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.670
Out of our virtues; whomiscarrying,

786
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.630
What heart receives fromhence the conquering part,

787
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.470
To steel a strong opinionto themselves?

788
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.230
Which entertain'd, limbsare his instruments,

789
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.370
In no less working thanare swords and bows

790
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:57.430
Directive by the limbs.

791
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.200
Give pardon to my speech:

792
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.170
Therefore 'tis meetAchilles meet not Hector.

793
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.500
Let us, like merchants,show our foulest wares,

794
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.000
And think, perchance,they'll sell; if not,

795
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.430
The lustre of the betteryet to show,

796
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:17.370
Shall show the better. Byshowing the worst first.

797
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:18.530
Do not consent

798
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.400
That ever Hector andAchilles meet;

799
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.830
For both our honour andour shame in this

800
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:27.670
Are dogg'd with twostrange followers.

801
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:30.000
I see them not with my oldeyes: what are they?

802
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.570
What glory our Achillesshares from Hector,

803
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.200
Were he not proud, we allshould share with him:

804
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.370
But he already is tooinsolent;

805
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.470
And we were better parchin Afric sun

806
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.100
Than in the pride and saltscorn of his eyes,

807
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.700
Should he 'scape Hectorfair:

808
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.530
No no, make a lottery;

809
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.470
And, by device, letblockish Ajax draw

810
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.630
The sort to fight withHector:

811
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.400
Give him allowance for thebetter man;

812
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.000
For that will physic thegreat Myrmidon

813
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.670
Who broils in loudapplause, and make him fall

814
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:04.300
His crest that prouderthan blue Iris bends.

815
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:08.130
If the dull brainless Ajaxcome safe off,

816
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.300
We'll dress him up invoices: if he fail,

817
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.830
Yet go we under ouropinion still

818
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:18.100
That we have better men.But, hit or miss,

819
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.200
Our project's life thisshape of sense assumes:

820
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.200
Ajax employ'd plucks downAchilles' plumes.

821
00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.930
Now Ulysses, I begin to relishthy advice;

822
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.630
And I will give a taste ofit forthwith To Agamemnon:

823
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.070
go we to him straight.

824
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.130
Two curs shall tame eachother: pride alone

825
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:47.570
Must tarre the mastiffson, as 'twere their bone.

826
00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:50.570
