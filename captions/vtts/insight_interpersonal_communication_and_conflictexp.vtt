00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.110

        Conflict is inevitable.


00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.970

        It is a fact of life and
        occurs in all kinds
      

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.680

        of relationships.


00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.510

        Effective communicators are
        distinguished not by a lack
      

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.550

        of conflict with
        others but rather
      

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.820

        by how they
        handle conflict.
      

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.250

        Avoiding conflict altogether
        would seem, at first glance,
      

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.620

        to be the optimal approach
        to successful and fulfilling
      

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.330

        human communication;
        however, it is often the
      

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.190

        case that through the
        process of negotiating
      

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.660

        conflict human relationships
        grow stronger.
      

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.430

        Some of the greatest
        achievements of humanity
      

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.700

        have been the result of the
        successful negotiation of
      

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.700

        inevitable human conflicts.


00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.510

        The United States
        Constitution, for one
      

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.180

        example, was the result
        of a lengthy process of
      

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.950

        negotiation and
        conflict resolution.
      

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.180

        Conflict management is a
        vital skill
      

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.250

        for all human interaction.


00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.790

        Unresolved destructive
        conflict can have a
      

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790

        decidedly negative impact
        on our wellbeing but mental
      

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.120

        health improves when we take
        a constructive approach
      

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.830

        to conflict.


00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.530

        The practice of constructive
        conflict is an essential
      

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.800

        component of our
        interpersonal communication
      

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.430

        skills.


00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.730

        Conflicts can also be
        opportunities for us to
      

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.070

        become more effective and
        proficient communicators and
      

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.170

        this can offer possibilities
        for personal growth.
      

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.410

        The ideal approach is to
        strike an effective balance.
      

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.980

        People should engage in
        logical argument to resolve
      

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.850

        conflicts over matters of
        greater import but avoid
      

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.890

        making an issue over matters
        of little consequence.
      

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.520

        Unfortunately, we rarely
        encounter this ideal
      

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.690

        attitude toward conflict
        in our day to day lives.
      

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.430

        People can change their
        conflict behavior.
      

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.700

        Your approach to conflict
        is not an inborn set of
      

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.500

        responses but rather a
        developed repertoire of
      

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.370

        communication skills that
        are learned, refined, and
      

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.470

        practiced in everyday life.


00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.170

        In this video, we will take
        a look at some of these
      

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.540

        behaviors and responses.


00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.580

        We'll cover common sources
        of conflict, patterns of
      

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.520

        conflict, and styles of
        conflict management with an
      

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.950

        emphasis on communication
        skills for constructive
      

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.120

        conflict management.


00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.890

        Definitions for
        conflict vary.
      

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.830

        One definition is: a state
        of being that arises when
      

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.470

        everyone's core beliefs,
        attitudes, values, habits,
      

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.370

        and/or goals differ from
        those of another person with
      

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.840

        whom one is interacting.


00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.010

        For many, the term conflict
        has a negative connotation
      

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.910

        but conflict is not
        necessarily a negative
      

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.180

        circumstance nor does it
        necessarily apply hostility
      

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.850

        or violence.


00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.020

        Conflict is one aspect of
        communication
      

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.790

        between human beings.


00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.020

        Some common misconceptions
        about conflict are that
      

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.760

        conflict if left alone
        will resolve itself.
      

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.160

        Confronting an issue or
        person is always unpleasant.
      

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.000

        Anger is always negative
        and destructive.
      

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.440

        How one communicates in a
        conflict situation will
      

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.340

        determine the outcome and
        lasting impact
      

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.710

        of that conflict.


00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.040

        It is our communicative
        behaviors that will either
      

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.780

        aggravate a conflict or
        resolve
      

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.880

        it in a productive
        manner.
      

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.510

        Understanding human
        communication is fundamental
      

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.280

        to understanding conflict
        because our communicative
      

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.390

        behaviors both create
        and manage conflict.
      

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.860

        Let's take a look at a real
        world conflict scenario and
      

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.690

        examine the role
        of these behaviors.
      

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.530

        Kelly and Christine, two
        18 year olds from the same
      

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.600

        hometown in Long Island,
        were thrilled when both were
      

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.040

        accepted into their dream
        college in the Big City.
      

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.470

        The girls were giddy with
        excitement when they found
      

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.710

        out they'd also be allowed
        to room together in the
      

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.240

        freshman dorm.


00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.210

        It was going to be an
        awesome year...or was it?
      

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.150

        Hey, Chris, look at this.


00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.320

        The girls see an
        advertisement from a big
      

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.820

        wireless phone company and
        reason that they can both
      

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.830

        save a good deal of money on
        their monthly expenses if
      

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.030

        they just pool their
        resources and get themselves
      

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.870

        a family calling plan for
        their cellular service;
      

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.270

        however...


00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.740

        Oh, well, you can only have
        one person's name
      

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.570

        on the account.


00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.110

        Well, we can put it in mine.


00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.940

        Chris,
        don't worry about it.
      

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.410

        We need
        a credit card.
      

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.280

        Mine got sent to my parent's
        house and they're going to
      

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.990

        bring it when they
        visit next weekend.
      

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.890

        Would it be cool
        if we used yours?
      

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.230

        Sure, we can use mine.


00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.770

        With that, the account is
        open and the girls are
      

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.200

        officially on the network.


00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.610

        They were starting a new
        life in the Big City at the
      

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.870

        college they had dreamed of
        since they were in middle
      

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.740

        school and, thanks to their
        new family calling plan,
      

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.180

        they could talk to one
        another on the phone as much
      

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.550

        as they wanted to for free.


00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.880

        There was no way they'd use
        up all 700 of their shared
      

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.620

        minutes in one month.


00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.190

        Things were going great
        until one day toward the end
      

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.730

        of September a surprise
        came in the mail.
      

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.090

        Their first bill for
        their family
      

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.530

        calling plan with current
        charges in excess of $400.
      

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.370

        Whoa!


00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.740

        I thought this was supposed
        to be $70 a month.
      

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.410

        The girls went over their
        allotted minutes which
      

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.110

        resulted in overage charges
        but it was the next line
      

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.140

        which really threw
        her for a loop.
      

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.780

        Where it read
        total amount due,
      

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.680

        the balance was
        zero dollars.
      

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.520

        The balance is zero.


00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.920

        How is the balance zero?


00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.520

        Because it's already been
        charged to my credit card
      

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.190

        and now I'm overdrawn.


00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.530

        Kelly!


00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.170

        As we analyze
        scenarios of human conflict,
      

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.870

        we must bear in mind one of
        the great overarching truths
      

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.970

        of human communication,
        that it is context which
      

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.010

        determines content.


00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.580

        For example, the characters
        in our skit, Kelly and
      

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.450

        Christine, have been friends
        since they were little girls
      

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.180

        back in Long Island where
        life was familiar
      

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.820

        and comfortable.


00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.020

        They knew their roles and
        what was expected of them in
      

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.550

        that context.


00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.460

        However, in this situation,
        our two young protagonists
      

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.920

        find themselves in an
        entirely new
      

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.060

        and unfamiliar context.


00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.860

        A pragmatic approach to
        the analysis of human
      

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.130

        communication looks at human
        communication in a manner
      

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.930

        similar to that of the
        behaviorist psychologists.
      

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.170

        In this approach, human
        communicative behavior can
      

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.810

        be thought of as a series
        of speech acts that become
      

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.540

        patterned over time.


00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.780

        For example, whenever I
        utter a phrase, that phrase
      

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.280

        is a speech act.


00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.050

        That act often as not
        elicits a speech act in
      

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.590

        return from another person;
        what many term feedback.
      

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.120

        The pragmatist terms
        both speech acts together
      

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.890

        in interact.


00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.490

        Our day to day interacts
        tend to fall into familiar
      

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.660

        patterns and we become
        accustomed to communicating
      

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.900

        in that way.


00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.870

        Any sudden change in those
        patterns of interaction,
      

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.040

        particularly coupled
        with a change in physical
      

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.140

        environment, can be
        very disruptive to our
      

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.680

        communicative behavior and
        can easily lead to conflict.
      

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.010

        The social constructionist's
        perspective is even more
      

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.680

        effective for analyzing
        human conflict.
      

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.980

        Social constructionists see
        human communication as a
      

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.150

        process of world building.


00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.020

        In other words, we construct
        our worlds linguistically in
      

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.820

        an ongoing process
        of negotiation.
      

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.790

        Kelly and Christine's
        conflict is really the
      

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.130

        opening salvo in the
        negotiation of their new
      

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.070

        roles and the rules
        they are to live by.
      

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.970

        They have vast differences
        in the way they approach time.
      

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.240

        Timely paying of bills for
        example and the way they
      

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.810

        conceptualize fiscal
        responsibility.
      

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.340

        These are common
        areas of conflict.
      

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.780

        Human conflict tends to
        arise due to differences in
      

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.080

        people's core beliefs,
        values, attitudes, habits,
      

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.450

        and goals.


00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.760

        These differences commonly
        flare up in the areas of
      

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.190

        personal time orientation.


00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.600

        Some people are habitually
        punctual while others are
      

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.400

        habitually late.


00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.300

        Some people are night owls
        burning the
      

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.600

        midnight oil while others
        are larks
      

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.910

        up at the crack of dawn.


00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.110

        The manner in which we
        conceptualize and negotiate
      

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.140

        our personal space.


00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.780

        This includes the most
        intimate of personal spaces;
      

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.280

        our own bodies as well as
        the physical space
      

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.990

        of our surroundings.


00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.060

        A contentious area that
        can easily be fraught with
      

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.560

        conflict is our
        money and finances.
      

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.960

        So, what happens once
        a conflict is
      

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.000

        actually underway?


00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.970

        When the two roommates
        finally caught up with one
      

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.500

        another later that day,
        Christine was in a decidedly
      

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.470

        unpleasant mood as she told
        Kelly about the problem.
      

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.940

        Kelly, our cell phone
        bill came today.
      

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.740

        It was $400, not $70!


00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:33.010

        The cell phone bill?


00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:34.880

        Well, don't
        worry about that.
      

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.320

        There's still a few
        weeks before it's due.
      

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.450

        Kelly, nothing is
        due in a few weeks.
      

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.660

        They just charged the
        balance to my credit card.
      

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.520

        So, what's the problem?


00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.090

        The problem is that now I'm
        officially over my limit and
      

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.760

        I have to pay a
        penalty right now.
      

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.200

        What are we going to do?


00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.970

        Well, do you have any money?


00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.830

        I don't have anything.


00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.100

        I told you my parents only
        give me an allowance once a
      

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.270

        month and my work study
        doesn't kick in until next week.
      

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.940

        You have to give
        me something.
      

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.340

        Just chill out would you!


00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.180

        Chill out!


00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.450

        What do you mean chill out?


00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.480

        This is $400 that you and I
        don't have, either of us.
      

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.320

        The conversation
        gets heated.
      

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.350

        The argument reaches its
        destructive peak when Kelly
      

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.320

        spouts a particularly nasty
        insult at her lifelong friend.
      

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.590

        Are you out of your...


00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:27.470

        That's why you don't have
        any friends other than me.
      

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.800

        And Christine
        storms out of the room.
      

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:33.040

        Christine calls her mom, not
        looking so much for advice,
      

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.140

        but looking for a
        sympathetic ear to whom she
      

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.410

        can vent.


00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.810

        Hey, Mom, okay,
        can you believe it?
      

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:41.980

        I mean...what,
        what did she think?
      

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.880

        Did she think that I have
        to be responsible
      

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.150

        for everything?


00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.280

        I mean that..that the money
        would magically drop from
      

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.550

        the sky when the
        bill appeared?
      

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.920

        I don't...


00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.930

        Well, honey, didn't you guys
        talk about this beforehand?
      

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.230

        It's a big responsibility
        to have a credit card and a
      

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.200

        cell phone.


00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.160

        Why didn't you get
        separate plans anyway?
      

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.200

        Please don't lecture.


00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.330

        I know.


00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.540

        We just...we thought
        we were saving money.
      

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:05.600

        I...


00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.670

        Well, I guess that didn't
        work out for you,
      

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:07.470

        did it sweetie?


00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.140

        Uh, Mom....


00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:12.240

        Christine's
        mom is absolutely right.
      

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.410

        Many communication scholars
        site incompatible goals as
      

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:17.880

        one source of
        human conflict.
      

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.720

        Oftentimes however these
        goals exist at an almost
      

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.860

        subconscious level and are
        almost never articulated
      

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.190

        until a problem arises.


00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.390

        Christine and Kelly thought
        they shared a reasonable and
      

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.900

        compatible goal when, almost
        on a whim, they decided to
      

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.630

        pool their resources and
        share a cell
      

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.830

        phone calling plan.


00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.740

        But, in their new lives
        at college, they are in
      

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.540

        uncharted waters and clearly
        they've made some mistakes.
      

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.840

        Mistakes that could have
        easily been avoided with
      

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.980

        some improvements in their
        communication styles.
      

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.280

        As we have underscored,
        conflict is a part of life,
      

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.350

        and so the question is not
        whether or not conflict
      

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:55.490

        happens at all, but
        how we manage it.
      

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.590

        Conflicts can be managed
        either constructively
      

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.060

        or destructively.


00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.460

        When conflict is managed
        constructively, it can
      

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.760

        actually be a
        valuable experience.
      

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.570

        In constructive conflict,
        the issue is kept focused on
      

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.170

        direct actions that can
        be taken and compromise.
      

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.210

        Perhaps even complete
        problem solving
      

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:14.940

        can be the outcome.


00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.710

        Constructive conflict can
        yield many positive effects
      

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:23.680

        such as an increase in
        motivation, improved ability
      

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.750

        to identify and solve
        problems, increased skills
      

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:32.090

        and knowledge, greater
        creatively, incentive for
      

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.790

        personal growth, a deepening
        of friendships
      

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.030

        and other relationships.


00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.730

        These can never be realized
        however if conflict is
      

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.300

        ignored or poorly handled.


00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.770

        In such instances, conflict
        becomes detrimental
      

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.040

        or even destructive.


00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.850

        Destructive conflict yields
        negative effects such as;
      

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.480

        a decrease in our
        productivity, an erosion of
      

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.790

        trust between friends,
        secrecy and reduced
      

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:08.060

        information flow, personal
        anxiety and depression,
      

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.730

        wasted time, a fracturing
        of our friendships
      

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.300

        or other relationships.


00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.800

        There are two main
        destructive patterns both
      

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.670

        described as spirals.


00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.680

        Escalatory spirals pervade
        destructive conflict and
      

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.580

        avoidance spirals reduce
        the chance
      

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.780

        for productive outcomes.


00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:32.020

        Several characteristics
        of spiraling destructive
      

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.550

        conflict can be identified.


00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.620

        The first moments of
        conflict set the tone for
      

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.690

        the ensuing situation.


00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:43.960

        If a conflict begins with a
        critical statement such as
      

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.900

        "you always" or "you never",
        the conflict will probably
      

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.770

        escalate quickly.


00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.040

        A constructive complaint
        can be more helpful.
      

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.240

        Defensiveness, contempt, and
        inflexibility characterize
      

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.250

        destructive conflict.


00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.180

        When one person withdraws
        from the interaction and
      

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.850

        refuses to cooperate, this
        is called stonewalling.
      

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.420

        A competitive cycle of
        dominance and subordination
      

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.360

        results in
        destructive conflict.
      

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.600

        When we analyze conflict, we
        often speak about styles
      

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.160

        and tactics.


00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:22.230

        Styles are patterns of
        response and behavior.
      

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.800

        Tactics are
        the specific moves
      

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.800

        within a
        general approach.
      

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:30.180

        The basic choice of style is
        whether to avoid or engage
      

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.510

        but neither one is always
        necessarily the right choice.
      

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.950

        They can both be viable
        options depending on the
      

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.080

        circumstance or context.


00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.220

        The key idea is that
        it is always a choice.
      

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.660

        One chooses when it's
        appropriate to avoid for the
      

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:46.960

        sake of protection or when
        it is appropriate to engage
      

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.600

        and extend oneself towards
        a constructive outcome.
      

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.870

        The hallmark of constructive
        conflict is flexibility.
      

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.140

        As we have emphasized,
        successful communicators are
      

00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.140

        distinguished by their
        ability to manage situations.
      

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.980

        People often get locked into
        their familiar patterns but
      

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.610

        having the flexibility to
        transition between styles
      

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:08.750

        will increase the chances
        for constructive resolution.
      

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.550

        So how do these ideas apply
        to the scenario
      

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:12.680

        we are witnessing?


00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.850

        Let's take a look.


00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.050

        Once Christine and Kelly
        realized there was a
      

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.590

        conflict between them, each
        of the girls was guilty of a
      

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.290

        negative response,
        specifically that of
      

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.360

        withdrawing also
        called avoidance.
      

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.130

        Kelly was the first to
        exhibit withdrawal but she
      

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.700

        did so in response to
        Christine who confronted her
      

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.470

        with the bill.


00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.140

        Understandably, Christine
        was upset and she was
      

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.640

        justified in confronting
        Kelly but it was the manner
      

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.750

        in which she confronted
        or engaged Kelly that
      

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.420

        precipitated the destructive
        spiral to follow.
      

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:47.890

        We have all heard the phrase
        "it's not what you said,
      

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.850

        it's the way you said it."


00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:53.760

        Sense of tone, attitude,
        volume, etceteras that
      

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.930

        confounds most communicators
        comes under the umbrella
      

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.000

        term of paralinguistics
        which is one of the
      

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.230

        categories of nonverbal
        communication.
      

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.940

        The manner in which we say
        things is important but
      

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.040

        Christine wasn't thinking
        along those lines on the day
      

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.770

        of the big argument.


00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.910

        Christine was visibly angry
        when she approached Kelly.
      

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.410

        Many scholars would term
        Christine's initial approach
      

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.520

        to the conflict as one of
        forcing or dominating.
      

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.420

        Whatever term one prefers,
        this conflict strategy is
      

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.520

        characterized by
        egocentrism; concern only
      

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.520

        for one's own wellbeing
        and a lack of empathy or
      

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.860

        understanding for
        the other party.
      

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.400

        When Kelly saw how heated
        her friend was, her initial
      

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.870

        instinct was to backpedal
        to, in a word, withdraw
      

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.140

        verbally
        from the conflict.
      

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.540

        In so doing, she perhaps
        unintentionally invalidated
      

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.240

        Christine's genuine concern
        over the bill situation.
      

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.250

        This is what we call a
        disconfirming response.
      

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.850

        It was an unfortunate
        tactic since it only fueled
      

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.450

        Christine's anger and led
        to their nasty argument.
      

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.990

        The argument was a result of
        Kelly switching gears and
      

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.420

        matching Christine's forcing
        tactic; what some scholars
      

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.430

        also term competing.


00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.500

        At the height of the
        argument, you will recall it
      

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.230

        was Christine who withdrew
        after Kelly had hurled her
      

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.070

        hurtful insults.


00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:11.070

        Christine's withdrawal led
        to a protracted silence or
      

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.270

        avoidance spiral between the
        two and delayed for a long
      

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.480

        time any hope of resolving
        their differences but
      

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.980

        eventually resolve
        them they do.
      

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:26.220

        Let's take a look.


00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:32.260

        Kelly, this
        is really stupid.
      

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.790

        We've been friends
        since the second grade.
      

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.760

        We can't let a cell phone
        bill get between us.
      

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.570

        We can find a way to
        work something out.
      

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:45.000

        Yeah.


00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:52.980

        As usual, I guess
        you're right.
      

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.210

        So, what was the
        agreement they reached?
      

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.950

        Christine came up with a
        compromise solution which
      

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.050

        would involve considerable
        fiscal sacrifice
      

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.390

        on her part.


00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.820

        Christine was willing to
        make these concessions since
      

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.060

        she genuinely loved her
        friend and didn't want to
      

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.130

        risk losing her.


00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.100

        Since Kelly was in poor
        financial shape, Christine
      

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.430

        would allow her to pay back
        the overage charges in $50
      

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.670

        monthly increments while she
        would have to take care of
      

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.540

        the credit card bill
        personally in the meantime.
      

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.940

        She did get some help from
        her mom in the form of a
      

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.580

        timely check.


00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:28.610

        Mom, being an understanding
        soul, realized that kids
      

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.580

        were going to make mistakes
        on the way
      

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.350

        to becoming adults.


00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.090

        Christine and Kelly then
        reworked
      

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:36.990

        their wireless contract.


00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.990

        Going forward, Christine
        would have the 700 minute
      

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.060

        monthly plan to herself but
        Kelly's phone number would
      

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.000

        no longer be on
        her calling plan.
      

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.230

        They converted Kelly's
        number to a pay as you go
      

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.140

        plan which would force her
        to pay closer attention to
      

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.700

        the number of minutes
        she was using.
      

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.870

        Though she resented being
        removed from the plan at
      

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.010

        first, Kelly conceded and
        accepted the
      

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.440

        compromise gracefully.


00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.810

        Though not a perfect
        solution, the girls were
      

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:04.680

        satisfied
        with the outcome
      

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.420

        and thus
        resolved their conflict.
      

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.290

        We should not always regard
        conflict as negative.
      

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.760

        It can offer great potential
        for creativity and growth.
      

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.530

        On the positive or
        constructive side of
      

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.600

        conflict management, most
        scholars site two categories
      

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.070

        of conflict strategy;
        compromise or problem
      

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.170

        solving collaborating.


00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.800

        The distinction between the
        two approaches is that with
      

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.570

        compromise each party must
        give a little ground and
      

00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:32.840

        forgo some of their personal
        goals while true problem
      

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.110

        solving results in a win-win
        situation
      

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.150

        for all parties concerned.


00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.680

        But the lines of distinction
        between these strategies can
      

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.850

        be quite blurry at times.


00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:43.990

        In the real world of day
        to day communications and
      

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.720

        experiences, the hard and
        fast categories of the
      

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.300

        academic don't
        always fully apply.
      

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.400

        Whether the outcome of a
        conflict is defined as a
      

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.730

        compromise or a problem
        fully solved depends largely
      

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.600

        on the perceptions of
        the parties involved.
      

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.710

        Communication practices that
        will encourage constructive
      

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.210

        approaches emphasize dialog.


00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.680

        Dialog demands skillful
        listening and working to
      

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.120

        respect the other person's
        perspective even though you
      

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.750

        may disagree with what the
        other person is saying.
      

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:19.790

        Because dialog is a process
        in which people speak and
      

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.660

        listen to one another to
        help clarify the situation,
      

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.130

        it leads to collaboration.


00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:29.800

        Other tools for constructive
        conflict management are a
      

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:34.110

        positive attitude,
        flexibility, continual
      

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.010

        evaluation and reframing.


00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.180

        Reframing means looking
        through a positive lens to
      

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:43.480

        describe a situation
        constructively.
      

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.950

        Mediation is a form of
        resolution that can help
      

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.690

        with disputes which
        individuals cannot resolve
      

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.090

        on their own in which an
        impartial, neutral, and
      

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:56.460

        mutually accepted third
        party is asked to assist
      

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.430

        with reaching an agreement.


00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.700

        The mediating third party
        helps to isolate the issues
      

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.370

        and to develop alternatives
        and options for a resolution
      

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:09.870

        that is acceptable to
        both disputing parties.
      

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:13.010

        The mediator does not
        make decisions but rather
      

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:16.410

        facilitates the conflict
        participant's own abilities
      

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.920

        to reach an agreeable
        settlement.
      

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.050

        Examples of mediators are
        a marriage counselor, an
      

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.560

        arbitrator, or a
        referee in sports.
      

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.930

        Many times a simple apology
        can end the conflict.
      

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.330

        Though often perceived as an
        admission of wrong doing, a
      

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:33.830

        sincere apology delivered
        at the right time can be a
      

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:37.370

        powerful way to improve the
        quality of a relationship.
      

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.740

        The act of offering an
        apology demands that we look
      

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.870

        at our own actions in a new
        light and empathize
      

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.440

        with others.


00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.840

        Even more fundamentally, you
        can learn to prevent many
      

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.940

        destructive conflicts.


00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.180

        Skills for prevention can
        help to keep a conflict from
      

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.150

        becoming destructive.


00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.050

        There is no
        recipe or formula.
      

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.990

        The prevention of conflict
        relies on our overall skills
      

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.060

        of excellent communication.


00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:02.490

        In conclusion, skills and
        strategies for preventing,
      

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.900

        managing, and resolving
        conflict can be developed
      

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.100

        and sharpened over time.


00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.130

        Conflict can be resolved.


00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.240

        It can turn out better than
        you imagine and it can be an
      

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.240

        opportunity to learn.
