WEBVTT

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:17.960
THE RHINE, THE GREAT ARTERY
FEEDING THE HEART OF EUROPE.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.700
THIS IS A RIVER WHICH HAS
CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.330
IT HAS BOTH UNITED AND
DIVIDED EUROPE'S PEOPLE.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.530
ON THE ONE HAND, THE RHINE
IS A VITAL TRADE ROUTE

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.660
CONNECTING COUNTRIES
AND CULTURES ON ITS

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.730
1,300 KILOMETER JOURNEY
FROM SOURCE TO SEA.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.760
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S A
BARRIER BETWEEN NATIONS,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.500
A BORDER TO
BE CROSSED.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.260
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THE RHINE
HAS KNOWN BLOODY BATTLES

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.200
AND HEARD THE
WAIL OF WAR.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
BUT TODAY, THIS RIVER AND
ITS PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.860
A NEW BATTLE AGAINST THE
EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.160
FOR AS THE WORLD WARMS
UP, THE ALPINE GLACIER

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:21.030
WHICH FEEDS THE
RIVER IS MELTING FAST.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.960
IN LESS THAN A CENTURY
THE SOURCE OF THE RHINE

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.660
COULD SHRINK
TO NOTHING.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.760
THE MIGHTY WATERS
MIGHT CEASE TO FLOW

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.400
AND THE LIVES OF THE
PEOPLE AND COUNTRIES

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.360
WHO SHARE THE RHINE
COULD BE CHANGED FOREVER.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.960
THE NETHERLANDS, GERMANY,
FRANCE, LIECHTENSTEIN,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.100
AUSTRIA AND SWITZERLAND.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.960
SIX COUNTRIES TOUCH
THE BANKS OF THE RHINE

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.660
BUT FOR MOST OF ITS LENGTH
THIS IS A GERMAN RIVER.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.300
THE RHINE HAS LONG BEEN
A KEY TO GERMAN IDENTITY.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.860
PATRIOTIC MONUMENTS
STAND ALL ALONG ITS BANKS.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.100
IN THE COURSE OF ITS JOURNEY,
THE RHINE PASSES THROUGH

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.760
CASTLE RICH GORGES ALIVE
WITH MYTH AND FANTASY

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.600
AND IMMORTALIZED IN THE
MUSIC OF RICHARD WAGNER.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.300
THOSE SAME LEGENDS, TWISTED IN
THE NAME OF NATIONALISM AND

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.960
RACISM, WERE A SINISTER THEME IN
THE DREADFUL VIOLENCE OF WWII.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.030
THOSE TERRIBLE DAYS
ARE LONG GONE.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.860
BUT NOW ANOTHER WAR IS
BEING WAGED ON THE RHINE

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.100
- A FIGHT AGAINST TIME.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.360
FOR AS THE GLACIERS WHICH FEED
THE RHINE CONTINUE TO SHRINK,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.560
THERE IS A REAL DANGER THAT
THE SOURCE OF THE RIVER

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.830
WILL DRY UP
COMPLETELY.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.860
THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND FARM IN
THE MOUNTAINS RIGHT NEXT TO THE

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.360
GLACIER'S SOURCE ARE ACUTELY
AWARE OF THIS IMPENDING THREAT.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.960
TRANSLATOR: MY FATHER ALWAYS
USED TO SAY THAT IT TOOK

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.730
10 MINUTES TO WALK FROM
THE VILLAGE TO THE GLACIER

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.600
AND NOW THESE DAYS YOU
CAN WALK FOR THREE HOURS

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.500
AND YOU'RE STILL
NOT AT THE GLACIER.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.200
>>AS GLOBAL WARMING TAKES ITS
TOLL, THE FUTURE OF EUROPE'S

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.960
BUSIEST AND MOST IMPORTANT RIVER
IS ENDANGERED LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.200
THE RHINE HAS TWO GLACIAL
SOURCES HIGH IN THE SWISS ALPS.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.100
AFTER THEIR TUMULTUOUS
DESCENT THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.600
THESE TWO
WATERWAYS JOIN TO FORM

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.500
EUROPE'S MOST
ICONIC RIVER.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.200
FLOWING THROUGH THE VINEYARDS OF
FRANCE ALONG THE SPECTACULAR

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.030
RHINE GORGE AND THROUGH
GERMANY'S INDUSTRIAL HEART,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.360
THE RHINE TRAVELS
THROUGH THE NETHERLANDS

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.360
BEFORE FINALLY REACHING
THE SEA AT ROTTERDAM.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.860
STRETCHING OVER 40
KILOMETERS OF WATERFRONT,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.800
ROTTERDAM IS ONE OF THE
BUSIEST PORTS ON EARTH.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:16.530
THE RHINE DELTA IS CRUCIAL TO
THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF EUROPE.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:26.100
OVER 400 MILLION TONS OF CARGO
PASS THROUGH HERE EVERY YEAR.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.600
THIS IS WHERE THE RHINE
FLOWS INTO THE NORTH SEA,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.800
WHERE GREAT VESSELS LOADED
WITH GOODS LEAVE EUROPE

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.030
AND HEAD FOR THE
REST OF THE WORLD.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.000
TO KEEP THE MASSIVE
VOLUME OF TRAFFIC FLOWING,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.400
300,000 PEOPLE ARE
EMPLOYED AT THE PORT.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.660
PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING HERE
IS COMPUTER CONTROLLED,

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:04.430
EVEN THE SHIPS
NAVIGATE BY RADAR.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.500
BUT IN THIS STRANGELY
SERENE PICTURE,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.860
DISASTER IS
NEVER FAR AWAY...

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.160
FOR ROTTERDAM IS MORE
THAN JUST A TRANSIT PORT.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.560
IT'S A MASSIVE INDUSTRIAL
COMPLEX AND THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.000
PETROCHEMICAL
SITE IN THE WORLD.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.860
THIS IS A VERY
VOLATILE PLACE.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.260
THOUSANDS OF TONS OF
RAW INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.500
ARE REFINED INTO
COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS HERE.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.430
WITH MASSIVE CONTAINERS
OF FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.230
AND EXPLOSIVE CHEMICALS
LINING THE RIVERBANK,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:53.400
FIRE IS ALWAYS
JUST A SPARK AWAY.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.400
WHEN DISASTER STRIKES,
SPECIALIST FIREMEN LIKE

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.460
ALEX TRUMAN ARE THE RHINE'S
FIRST AND ONLY LINE OF DEFENSE.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.560
TRANSLATOR: FOR ME, ANYWAY,
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE, ABSOLUTELY.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.660
IT'S IRRESISTIBLE.
IT'S IN THE BLOOD.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.260
MY FATHER IS IN THE FIRE
SERVICE. MY BROTHER TOO.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.460
WITH ME, IT'S DEFINITELY
IN THE BLOOD.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.500
>>IT'S A DANGEROUS
CAREER CHOICE.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.560
WITH EVERY FIRE THAT ALEX
ATTENDS, THE RISK OF

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.660
EXPLOSION IS HUGE AS MORE
THAN HALF OF ALL GOODS

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.960
WHICH PASS THROUGH THIS PORT
CONTAIN DANGEROUS CARGO.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.230
WHAT'S MORE, THE FEROCIOUS
HEAT OF THE FLAMES COULD

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.100
RELEASE TOXIC CHEMICALS
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.660
POISONING THE ENVIRONMENT
AND THE HALF A MILLION

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.400
RESIDENTS OF NEARBY
ROTTERDAM CITY.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.900
ALEX AND HIS FAMILY
ARE AMONG THEM.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.430
TRANSLATOR: IF YOU STOPPED TO
THINK ABOUT IT YOU'D BE WORRIED

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:01.900
ABOUT THE DANGEROUS
THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.400
THE MOMENT YOU FOCUS
ON WHAT COULD GO WRONG

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.600
YOU WOULD NOT
BE ABLE TO SLEEP.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.360
>>ALEX'S SKILLS ARE SO
SPECIALIZED THAT COMPANIES

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.200
FROM ALL OVER EUROPE SEND
THEIR STAFF TO BE TAUGHT

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:32.230
BY HIS TEAM AT THE PORT'S
DISASTER TRAINING AREA.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.560
THIS COMPLEX EVEN INCLUDES
A GROUNDED TANKER

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.230
THAT'S SET ON FIRE SEVERAL
TIMES A DAY SO TRAINEES CAN

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:45.630
PRACTICE HOW TO RESPOND
TO INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.830
YET THE DANGER ON THEIR
DOORSTEP SEEMS TO GO

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.600
UNNOTICED BY THE MAJORITY
OF PEOPLE IN ROTTERDAM.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.160
TRANSLATOR: I THINK A LOT OF
PEOPLE SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.100
AROUND THEM BUT THEY DON'T STOP
TO THINK THINGS COULD GO WRONG.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:07.300
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT COULD GO WRONG.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.330
>>PERHAPS THEY JUST DON'T
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.800
MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE
EMPLOYED AT THE PORT.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.960
WITHOUT THIS DANGEROUS INDUSTRY
THERE WOULD BE NO JOBS.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.860
BUT THE RHINE HAS
ALWAYS BEEN MORE THAN

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.600
JUST AN ECONOMIC
LIFELINE.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.300
IT'S A RIVER WHICH FEEDS
CULTURE AND TRADITION.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.560
BEFORE THEY LEARNED TO CONTROL
THE RIVER, FISHERMEN WOULD TELL

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.960
OF RHINE MAIDENS, GOBLINS, AND
OTHER MYSTERIOUS CREATURES

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:47.400
WHICH THEY BELIEVED LIVED
BENEATH THE TREACHEROUS WATERS.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.700
TODAY, THESE FISHERMEN'S TALES
HAVE BECOME FOLKLORE AND THE

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.200
DANGEROUS WATERS THAT INSPIRED
THE LEGENDS HAVE BEEN TAMED,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.530
TRANSFORMED INTO A PLACID
WATERWAY FOR INDUSTRY.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.960
BUT IT'S THIS INDUSTRY WHICH
HAS NEARLY KILLED OFF THE ONLY

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.500
WAY OF LIFE THE FISHERMEN OF
THE RHINE HAVE EVER KNOWN.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.700
ONE MAN WHO STILL TRAWLS THE
WATERS IS WILKEN DEN BOER.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.960
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A DEGREE
IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING,

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.030
WILKEN DECIDED TO FOLLOW
IN THE FAMILY TRADITION

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.730
OF FISHING FOR A LIVING.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.130
LIKE HIS UNCLE AND
GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM,

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.300
HE SPECIALIZES IN CATCHING
EELS, A POPULAR DELICACY

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.160
IN THIS AREA OF
THE NETHERLANDS.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.430
TRANSLATOR: THE EELS COME FROM
THE SARGASSO SEA, NEAR CUBA.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.300
THEY ARRIVE HERE IN
THE RIVER ESTUARY.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.130
THEY SWIM UP RIVER, GROW
AND MATURE, UNTIL THEY'RE

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.700
READY TO SPAWN AND THEN
THEY MAKE THEIR WAY BACK

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:52.530
TO THE SARGASSO SEA
WHERE THEY REPRODUCE.

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.960
>>BUT SOME THIRTY YEARS
AGO A GOOD CATCH LIKE THIS

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.030
WOULD HAVE BEEN
UNTHINKABLE BECAUSE OF

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.630
THE VAST AMOUNTS OF
POLLUTION IN THE RIVER.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.030
WILKEN REMEMBERS
THE DIFFICULT TIMES

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.200
HIS GRANDFATHER
EXPERIENCED.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.130
TRANSLATOR: POLLUTION DEFINITELY
AFFECTED FISH STOCKS.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:17.000
SUDDENLY IN THE 60'S THERE
WERE FEWER EELS IN THE RIVER.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.130
>>FOR WILKEN, 1986 WAS A
PARTICULARLY BAD YEAR.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.930
JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER HE
BECAME A PROFESSIONAL FISHERMAN

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.260
A CHEMICAL FACTORY UPSTREAM
OF ROTTERDAM PORT EXPLODED,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.400
SPEWING TOXIC FERTILIZER
INTO THE WATERS.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.400
THE RIVER TURNED RED AND
NEARLY ALL THE FISH PERISHED.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.030
WILKEN REALIZED THEN THAT HIS
LIVELIHOOD WAS IN DANGER.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.660
TODAY HE'S ONE OF
ONLY SIX FISHERMEN LEFT

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.160
TO PLY THEIR TRADE AMONG
THE MASSIVE TANKERS

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.600
AND CARGO SHIPS
IN ROTTERDAM PORT.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.230
BUT THE TIDE OF FORTUNE MAY BE
CHANGING AS THE AUTHORITIES

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.300
RECENTLY MADE A CONCERTED
EFFORT TO CLEAN UP THE WATERS.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.930
TRANSLATOR: IN THE LAST
FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.960
MUCH MORE SALMON.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.660
THEY VIRTUALLY DIED
OUT DUE TO POLLUTION.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.200
IN THE 50'S AND 60'S WE HARDLY
CAUGHT ANY BUT IN RECENT YEARS

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.460
WE'VE STARTED TO CATCH A
FEW HUNDRED A YEAR AGAIN.

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:30.460
>>AS THE FISH RETURN TO THE
RHINE, WILKEN HOPES THAT ONE DAY

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:38.360
HIS SONS WILL JOIN HIM AND
CARRY ON THE FAMILY TRADITION.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.260
FURTHER UP STREAM HOWEVER,
THE RHINE AND ITS PEOPLE

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.830
SHARE A MORE
PAINFUL LEGACY;

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:54.630
ONE OF SUFFERING,
TYRANNY AND WAR.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:59.630
AT THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE
NETHERLANDS, NEAR THE BORDER

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.160
WITH GERMANY, THE RHINE FORMS
A NATURAL BOUNDARY BETWEEN

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.130
THE TWO COUNTRIES - A
FRONTIER TO BE BREACHED.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:11.460
THIS IS A RIVER THAT HAS HEARD
THE FEET OF MARCHING ARMIES

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.060
AND THE THUNDER
OF BOMBS.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:23.200
NEVER WAS THE WAIL OF WAR LOUDER
FOR THE RHINE THAN DURING WWII.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.430
AS THE ALLIES ADVANCED,
ADOLF HITLER USED THE RIVER

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.900
AS THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE
TO PROTECT GERMANY

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.300
AND THE NAZI-OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.830
CAUGHT UP IN THE
HEAVY CROSSFIRE

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.630
WERE THE PEOPLE LIVING
ALONG THE RHINE'S BANKS.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.800
TANNO PIETESSEY WAS
ONLY 12 WHEN THE GERMANS

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.560
FIRST OCCUPIED THE
DUTCH TOWN OF ARNHEM.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.430
HE REMEMBERS GROWING UP
IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF FEAR

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.900
AND SUSPICION; WHERE YOU
LOOKED OVER YOUR SHOULDER

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.500
BEFORE TALKING
TO YOUR NEIGHBOR.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.400
TRANSLATOR: THE
OCCUPATION HAD ALL KINDS OF

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.200
UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCES
FOR OUR COUNTRY...

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.530
PERSECUTION, CONCENTRATION
CAMPS, MURDER AND DEATH.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:08.000
>>THEN IN SEPTEMBER 1944
THE BRITISH HATCHED A PLAN,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.600
CODE NAMED "OPERATION
MARKET GARDEN",

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.430
TO TRY AND BRING THE
WAR TO A RAPID END.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:21.330
THROUGH THE LARGE-SCALE USE OF
AIRBORNE FORCES THE ALLIES HOPED

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.060
TO CAPTURE SEVERAL VITAL BRIDGES
- INCLUDING THIS ONE AT ARNHEM -

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:29.260
ALLOWING THEM TO ADVANCE
INTO THE HEART OF GERMANY.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:36.430
BUT OPERATION MARKET GARDEN
WAS A TERRIBLE FAILURE.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.400
TRANSLATOR: ARNHEM TURNED
OUT TO BE A BRIDGE TOO FAR

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.000
BUT WE DID NOT
KNOW THAT THEN.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.130
>>BECAUSE IT TOOK THREE DAYS
TO DROP 30,000 PARATROOPERS,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.360
THE BRITISH LOST MORE THAN
JUST THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.830
THOUSANDS OF ALLIED
SOLDIERS WERE KILLED,

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:58.630
MOST NEVER EVEN
REACHING THE BRIDGE.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.560
OTHERS TOOK REFUGE
IN PEOPLE'S HOMES

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.830
ONLY TO BE TRACKED
DOWN AND SHOT.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:09.560
THE GERMANS STARTED BURNING
HOUSES THEY SUSPECTED

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.030
OF HARBORING
BRITISH SOLDIERS.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.360
A DEDICATED MEMBER
OF THE RED CROSS,

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.800
TANNO WAS UNDETERRED
BY THE THREATS.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.600
TRANSLATOR: WHEN WE ARRIVED
THEY SAID "YOU WERE LUCKY,

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.630
YOU'VE JUST DRIVEN
THROUGH THE FRONT LINE".

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:28.400
BUT, YES, SO WHAT?
NOTHING HAPPENED.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.830
THAT WAS MY PERFORMANCE
DURING THE BATTLE OF ARNHEM,

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.260
SIMPLY FETCHING
FOOD FOR THOSE PEOPLE

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.060
WHO HAD FLED THEIR
BURNING HOMES.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:42.130
>>IT WAS TO BE ANOTHER NINE
MONTHS BEFORE THE ALLIES WOULD

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:48.300
SUCCEED IN CROSSING THE RHINE
AND THE WAR WOULD FINALLY END.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.060
TODAY FOR VETERANS LIKE TANNO
PIETESSEY THE BRIDGE AT ARNHEM

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:55.030
STANDS AS A PROUD TRIBUTE
TO THEIR HERITAGE AND TO

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:59.060
THE FIGHT TO PROTECT THEIR
LIBERTY AND THEIR HOMES.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:04.360
FOR SOME, HOWEVER, HOME
AND A FAMILIAR WAY OF LIFE

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.660
ARE NOT DEFINED
BY A SINGLE PLACE.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.400
HOME IS THE
RIVER ITSELF.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.030
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS
THESE CARGO BARGES

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:17.860
HAVE MOVED IN PROCESSION
UP AND DOWN THE RHINE,

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:24.560
PILOTED BY THE FAMILIES WHO
OWN THEM AND WHO LIVE ON BOARD.

00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.660
HERR VELDTMAN AND HIS WIFE
BOTH COME FROM A FAMILY

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.560
OF RHINE BARGE OWNERS
WHO MAKE THEIR LIVING

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.500
TRANSPORTING GOODS
UP AND DOWN THE RIVER.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.930
THEY'VE GROWN
UP ON THE WATER.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:46.460
TRANSLATOR: WE'VE BEEN
SAILING TOGETHER SINCE 1984,

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.930
ME AND MY
WIFE, RHEA.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:53.360
WE STARTED ON A
SMALLER SHIP OF 700 TON.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.530
AFTER THAT WE HAD A
SHIP BUILT OF 1,500 TON

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:01.530
AND THIS ONE IS FIVE
YEARS OLD AND IS 3,000 TON.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:08.530
WE SAIL NEARLY CONTINUOUSLY
- 18 HOURS, 17 OR 16 -

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:15.260
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH TIME YOU
HAVE AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.200
>>THOUGH THEY DO HAVE A
HOME ON DRY LAND IN THE

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.060
NETHERLANDS WHERE THE
CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOL,

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.960
THEY SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF THEIR
LIFE AFLOAT IN SOME COMFORT.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.100
TRANSLATOR: OKAY,
THIS IS THE KITCHEN.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.400
HERE WE HAVE OUR MEALS AT
LUNCHTIME AND IN THE EVENING.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.160
THIS IS THE OVEN AND
THE ELECTRICAL THINGS

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:41.660
LIKE THE MICROWAVE, THE
FRIDGE AND THE FREEZER.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.860
THIS IS THE
LIVING ROOM.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:45.960
THIS IS THE TABLE
THAT WE EAT AT

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.430
WHEN WE HAVE FAMILY
AND FRIENDS OVER.

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:53.060
THE LOUNGE AND
OUR SON, STEPHAN.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.500
THIS IS WHERE WE
RELAX... THE TELEVISION,

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:02.200
AND THIS IS OUR ELDEST
SON'S BEDROOM.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.760
>>AS THEY JOURNEY ALONG THE
RIVER, BARGE FAMILIES WITNESS

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.700
FIRST HAND THE EVER-CHANGING
HISTORY OF THE RHINE

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.200
AND THE LAND THROUGH
WHICH IT TRAVELS.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.730
LEAVING THE NETHERLANDS, THE
VELDTMANS CROSS THE BORDER

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.400
INTO GERMANY AND
TOWARDS DUISBURG,

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.530
A TOWN STEEPED IN
ITS INDUSTRIAL PAST.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.830
STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED AT THE
CONFLUENCE WHERE THE RHINE

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:32.200
MEETS THE RIVER RUHR, IT
WAS HERE THAT THE FAT SEAMS

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.230
OF COAL AND IRON ORE MINED
FROM THE RIVER VALLEYS

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:40.460
CAME TOGETHER TO BE
PROCESSED INTO STEEL.

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:43.700
IN THE 19TH CENTURY
DUISBURG WAS A BOOMTOWN

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.100
AND THE LARGEST INLAND
PORT IN THE WORLD.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.730
OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE
WERE EMPLOYED HERE

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.030
IN THE DIRTY AND
DANGEROUS HEAVY INDUSTRIES.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:59.600
STEEL MADE IN DUISBURG
COULD BE SAILED DOWN RIVER

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.630
AND EXPORTED
DIRECTLY TO SEA.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:11.200
TODAY THE WORKINGS OF THE
OLD INDUSTRIAL POWERHOUSE

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.500
ARE RUSTING AWAY.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.000
COAL AND IRON ARE NO LONGER THE
BACKBONE OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.300
AND DUISBURG IS SHAKING
OFF THE SHACKLES

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.260
OF ITS POLLUTED
INDUSTRIAL PAST.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.500
INSTEAD OF BELCHING
OUT POISONOUS GASES,

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.000
THIS ENORMOUS OLD
STEEL PLANT HAS BEEN

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.530
CONVERTED INTO A
LEISURE FACILITY.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:38.560
THE OLD GASOMETER HAS
BECOME A SCUBA DIVING SCHOOL.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.700
NOTHING MUCH IS PRODUCED
IN DUISBURG ANYMORE

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:49.660
BUT IT'S STILL A THRIVING
CENTER OF TRADE.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.230
THIS MARKS THE LAST
POINT INLAND ALONG WHICH

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.930
THE RHINE CAN RECEIVE
OCEAN-GOING VESSELS.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.760
AT DUISBURG, LARGE SHIPS
MUST TRANSFER THEIR GOODS

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.760
ONTO SMALLER BOATS
AND VICE VERSA.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.160
IT'S IN THIS TRANSFER
AND TRADING OF CARGO

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.300
THAT THE CITY
MAKES ITS MONEY.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:13.700
THE VELDTMAN'S BARGE IS JUST
ONE OF 20,000 CARGO VESSELS

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.930
WHICH PASS THROUGH
DUISBURG EVERY YEAR.

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.330
WHEN THEY REACH PORT, THEY'LL
UNLOAD THE STEEL WHICH THEY'RE

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.030
CARRYING, FRAU VELDTMAN WILL
TAKE THEIR JAGUAR OFF THE DECK

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.760
AND DRIVE BACK TO THE
NETHERLANDS WHILE HER HUSBAND

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:33.000
RETRACES THEIR JOURNEY
WITH A DIFFERENT LOAD.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.430
IN TIMES GONE BY, HOWEVER,
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE DISMISSED

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:47.060
THE NOTION OF FREE TRADE
ALONG THE RHINE AS NONSENSE.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.760
UPSTREAM OF DUISBURG,
THE FRENCH AND GERMANS

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.260
IN PARTICULAR PUSHED
AND PULLED OVER THE RIGHT

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.700
TO CONTROL THIS
VALUABLE TRADE ROUTE.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.860
THE RIVER TOWN OF
KOBLENZ HAS A LONG HISTORY

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:04.530
OF DISPUTED
OWNERSHIP.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:08.700
THIS CONFLUENCE OF THE
FRENCH RIVER, MOSELLE,

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.730
AND THE MIGHTY RHINE
HAS CHANGED HANDS

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.460
BETWEEN FRANCE
AND GERMANY

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:18.430
SEVERAL TIMES OVER IN
THE LAST THOUSAND YEARS.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:22.060
NOW THE HEADLAND THAT
DEFINES THE RIVER JUNCTION

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.230
HAS BEEN DECLARED
PROUDLY GERMAN.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.900
KNOWN AS DEUTSCHES ECK,
THE GERMAN CORNER,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.400
THIS POPULAR TOURIST
ATTRACTION IS ACTUALLY A

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:37.760
CELEBRATION OF THE LEGACY
OF ONE MAN: EMPEROR WILHELM I.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.960
AT THE END OF
THE 19TH CENTURY,

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.330
WILHELM WAS HERALDED THE
FIRST EMPEROR OF GERMANY.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.460
HE UNIFIED ALL THE PREVIOUSLY
DISPARATE GERMAN STATES

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.800
INTO ONE POWERFUL FORCE -
A FORCE THAT WAS TO BE USED

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.830
AND MISUSED IN THE NAME
OF GERMAN NATIONALISM.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.760
TODAY THE POLITICS OF OLD EUROPE
ARE CONSIGNED TO THE PAST

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.960
AND IT'S LEFT TO THE TOURISTS,
GERMAN AND INTERNATIONAL ALIKE,

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.600
TO APPRECIATE THE STATUE
FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS:

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:16.230
A BEAUTIFUL MONUMENT.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:21.130
BUT DEUTSCHES ECK IS NOT
THE END OF WILHELM'S LEGACY

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:25.430
TO GERMANY
AND TO EUROPE.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:28.360
HE AND HIS GOVERNMENT
WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN THE

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.530
EARLY STRAIGHTENING OF
THE RHINE RIVER CHANNEL.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:36.530
IN THE EARLY 1800'S THE RIVER
WAS KNOWN AS THE "WILD RHINE"

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.700
WITH NUMEROUS CHANNELS
AND HUNDREDS OF ISLANDS.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.800
THE CONSTANT RISE
AND FALL OF THE WATER

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.360
WAS FLOODING VILLAGES
AND VALUABLE FERTILE LANDS.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.560
SO, AS PART OF A SCHEME
TO CONTROL THE RIVER,

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.960
WILHELM AND HIS
GOVERNMENT IMPLEMENTED

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:59.300
A RIGOROUS PROCESS OF
STRAIGHTENING THE RHINE.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:06.230
TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER, AND
TODAY THE BANKS OF THE RIVER

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.130
HAVE BEEN DRAMATICALLY
TRANSFORMED FROM A NETWORK

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.230
OF SMALLER WATERWAYS
INTO A SINGLE LARGE ONE

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:18.330
- EFFECTIVELY A CANAL
CUTTING THROUGH EUROPE.

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:22.460
THIS NEW, DEEPER, WIDER RIVER
HAS ENABLED BOATS FROM ACROSS

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.400
THE CONTINENT TO COME TOGETHER
AND SHARE GOODS AND CULTURES.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.300
BUT THIS FREE TRADE
FACILITATES THE PASSAGE

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.760
OF MORE THAN JUST
BARGES AND THEIR LOAD,

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:37.800
FOR AS SHIPS PASS MORE FREELY
THROUGH THE WATERWAYS

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:44.360
THEY CARRY AN UNWELCOME
AND POTENTIALLY LETHAL CARGO.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.760
TRANSLATOR: A LOT OF
SHIPS CARRY BALLASTS

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.330
TO KEEP THE
SHIPS BALANCED.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:51.930
AS THEY ARE TRAVELING
THROUGH FOREIGN COUNTRIES

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.930
THEY DRAW AND RELEASE WATER
TO REGULATE THAT BALANCE -

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.600
DEPENDING ON HOW HEAVILY
LADEN THEY ARE -

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.260
TRANSPORTING RIVER
CREATURES WITH THEM.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:09.760
>>FOR DOCTOR STEPHAN NEHRIG
CHECKING ON THE CREATURES

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.900
THAT LIVE IN AND AROUND THE
RHINE IS A FAVORITE HOBBY.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.530
WHAT BEGAN AS A CHILDHOOD
FASCINATION WITH THE RIVER

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.130
HAS LED TO A CAREER
AS A MARINE BIOLOGIST.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.260
AND THE THINGS HE'S
FINDING AMONG THE STONES

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.900
ARE WORRYING HIM.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.430
TRANSLATOR: IT IS VERY
INTERESTING WHAT CAN BE FOUND

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.730
UNDER THESE STONES IN
THE BANKS OF THE RHINE.

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.700
QUITE A FEW
CREATURES LIVE HERE.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.830
WE SEE A
LITTLE SHRIMP.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.530
THIS IS A CRUSTACEAN WHICH
COMES FROM THE BLACK SEA

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:41.930
AND CAME TO THE RHINE
OVER THE MAIN-DANUBE CANAL.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.500
IT'S A PREDATOR AND IT LOVES
EATING THE OTHER SHRIMPS

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.400
WHICH ARE INDIGENOUS TO
THIS REGION AND THAT'S WHY

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.930
IT'S CALLED, IN THE SCIENCE
WORLD, THE KILLER SHRIMP.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.560
>>THE NUMBERS OF THESE TINY
AND DEADLY KILLER SHRIMP

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.330
HAVE INCREASED STEADILY AS THE
MAP OF EUROPE HAS CHANGED.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:16.700
TRANSLATOR: ITS NATURAL HOME IS,
IN FACT, THE BLACK SEA REGION,

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.800
BUT IN THE 1980'S THIS CREATURE
TRAVELED ALONG THE DANUBE

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:24.430
AND WAS FOUND IN GERMANY
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 1991.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:27.830
WE THINK THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE
THE EASTERN BLOC COUNTRIES

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.730
OPENED THEMSELVES UP TO
THE WEST AND THAT LED TO

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:38.600
AN INCREASE IN THE MOVEMENT
OF SHIPPING ON THE DANUBE.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.100
>>BUT THE KILLER SHRIMP'S
VORACIOUS APPETITE

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.760
HAS CAUSED THE EXTINCTION
OF MANY NATIVE SPECIES

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:51.560
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
TURN BACK THE CLOCK.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.200
TRANSLATOR: EXOTIC
AND FOREIGN CREATURES

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.200
NEVER BECOME
INDIGENOUS.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.600
THEY'RE ALWAYS
CONSIDERED TO BE EXOTIC

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.860
AND ARE A THREAT TO THE
LOCAL PLANTS AND WILDLIFE.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:08.460
EITHER THEY EAT THEM OR THEY ALL
ADAPT AND THEN THEY BECOME

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.800
EXACTLY THE SAME AS EACH OTHER
AND THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:19.400
THE "MACDONALDIZATION"
OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:25.560
>>FURTHER UPSTREAM THE
RHINE HOSTS A DIFFERENT KIND

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.160
OF FOREIGN TRAVELER.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:35.530
A POPULAR TOURIST DESTINATION,
THIS GERMAN STRETCH OF RIVER

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.630
IS KNOWN AS THE
"ROMANTIC RHINE"

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:43.930
AND IS STEEPED IN
MYTH AND LEGEND.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:48.230
THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE TOURIST
TRAIL IS HERE AT LORELEI ROCK.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:52.200
MADE FAMOUS IN THE FOLKLORE, THE
STORY GOES THAT A YOUNG MAIDEN,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.060
BETRAYED BY HER PHILANDERING
FIANCE, FALLS TO HER DEATH.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.400
FROM HER WATERY GRAVE SHE LURES
UNSUSPECTING SAILORS WHO,

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.000
BEWITCHED BY HER BEAUTY, TAKE
THEIR EYES OFF THE TASK OF

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.400
NAVIGATING THE MOST TREACHEROUS
STRETCH OF THE RHINE AND PERISH.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:20.200
THE FOLK STORY OF THE RHINE
MAIDEN OF THE LORELEI

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.100
ECHOES A
HISTORICAL TRUTH.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.000
THE RHINE HERE HAS ALWAYS
BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.600
STRETCH OF RIVER
TO NAVIGATE.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.760
THE ROCKS ARE CLOSE TO THE
SURFACE AND SHIFTING CURRENTS

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.260
DRAW UNSOPHISTICATED CRAFT
INTO DANGEROUS WATERS.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.300
MANY SAILORS HAVE
LOST THEIR LIVES.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.760
THIS ISN'T THE ONLY FOLKLORE
WHICH CONNECTS THE WATERS

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.330
OF THE RHINE WITH
QUINTESSENTIAL GERMAN MYTHS.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.460
THE STORY OF A HOARD OF GOLD
SAID TO BE STOLEN FROM THREE

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.460
OTHER RHINE MAIDENS IS WHAT
INSPIRED RICHARD WAGNER TO

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:03.630
COMPOSE HIS FAMOUS OPERATIC
CYCLE, THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:10.400
THE RHINE MAIDENS' LEGENDARY
BEAUTY WAS TO BECOME A BLUEPRINT

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:16.330
FOR THE ARYAN IDEAL OF A
BLONDE AND BLUE EYED RACE.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:20.700
AN IDEAL USED AS A PROPAGANDA
TOOL FOR HITLER'S BRUTAL REGIME

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.860
AND THE TERRIBLE
PERSECUTIONS CARRIED OUT

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:29.500
IN THE NAME OF
RACIAL PURITY.

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:36.330
THIS IS THE OLDEST JEWISH
CEMETERY IN GERMANY.

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:44.260
ALL THE GRAVES HERE
DATE BACK TO BEFORE WWII

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:53.300
AND THEY TELL A TALE OF A LARGE
AND SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:29:00.200
THIS IS HEILIGE SANDS IN
THE RIVER CITY OF WORMS.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.860
THERE ARE SOME JEWS
LIVING IN WORMS TODAY

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:06.900
BUT THESE ARE RECENT
RUSSIAN IMMIGRANTS.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.730
THE GERMAN JEWS WHO'D
MADE WORMS THEIR HOME

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:18.400
SINCE MEDIEVAL TIMES WERE,
QUITE SIMPLY, WIPED OUT.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:23.460
ON NOVEMBER 9, 1938 THE NAZIS
UNLEASHED A WAVE OF VIOLENCE

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.730
AGAINST
GERMANY'S JEWS.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:28.960
IN THE SPACE OF A FEW HOURS
THOUSANDS OF SYNAGOGUES AND

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.230
JEWISH BUSINESSES AND HOMES
WERE DAMAGED OR DESTROYED.

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.130
THIS WAS CALLED,
CHILLINGLY, "KRISTALLNACHT".

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:47.800
KRISTALLNACHT MEANS "NIGHT
OF GLASS" AND REFERS TO

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.660
THE SHATTERED WINDOW PANES
THAT CARPETED THE STREETS.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.130
BUT IT ALSO COMMEMORATES
THE SHATTERED LIVES

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.260
OF THOSE JEWS LIVING IN
GERMANY DURING WWII.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.460
MORE THAN 70 YEARS LATER
AND PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.500
AND CULTURES ARE
LIVING AND WORKING

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.730
IN THE STREETS OF
WORMS ONCE MORE.

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:20.000
THESE OLD COBBLES ECHO
WITH THE SOUND OF NEW LIFE.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.830
IT'S A MULTICULTURALISM THAT
IS REFLECTED IN COMMUNITIES

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:28.830
UP AND DOWN THE RHINE AS PEOPLE
FROM MANY NATIONS WERE INVITED

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:34.730
TO WORK IN GERMANY DURING
THE POST-WAR RECONSTRUCTION.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.630
THE LARGEST GROUP OF FOREIGN
RESIDENTS CAME FROM TURKEY.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.400
HASAN OZDEMIR IS A TURKISH
AUTHOR AND POET WHO ARRIVED

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.700
IN GERMANY AS A 16-YEAR-OLD
AND NEVER WENT HOME.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:54.800
HASAN IS ONE OF AN ESTIMATED
1.7 MILLION TURKISH IMMIGRANTS

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.530
IN GERMANY.

00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:03.830
HE LIVES HERE IN LUDWIGSHAFEN, A
FEW MILES UPRIVER FROM WORMS.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:07.330
IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE 20TH
CENTURY THIS CITY GREW RAPIDLY

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.260
AS TURKISH IMMIGRANTS
FLOODED IN TO PLUG THE ACUTE

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:15.630
LABOR SHORTAGE
CAUSED BY WWII.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.500
AT FIRST THESE MIGRANTS
WERE TO BE GUEST WORKERS,

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.030
COMING TO WORK FOR A LIMITED
PERIOD OF TIME ONLY.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:26.130
MEN ARRIVED WITHOUT
THEIR FAMILIES AND TOOK

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.900
POORLY PAID FACTORY JOBS
CONSIDERED TOO DANGEROUS

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.560
OR TOO DIRTY FOR
GERMAN WORKERS.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.900
BUT INCREASINGLY THE IMMIGRANTS
SENT FOR THEIR WIVES AND

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:41.600
CHILDREN AND SETTLED IN SMALL
COMMUNITIES ACROSS GERMANY.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:45.900
IT WAS A DIFFICULT
PROCESS OF INTEGRATION.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:48.730
IN THE EARLY YEARS
TENSIONS FLARED BETWEEN

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.930
THE TURKS AND GERMANS.

00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:55.700
TODAY, THE IMMIGRANTS HAVE
CREATED A HOME FROM HOME

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.730
IN THE INNER
CITY AREAS.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.460
MANY OF TODAY'S TURKS
LIVING IN GERMANY

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:08.230
NOW CONSIDER THEMSELVES
FIRST GENERATION GERMANS.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:14.830
TRANSLATOR: THE TERM
"GASTARBEITER", THAT IS

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:19.300
"FOREIGNER", IS A TERM
I REJECT COMPLETELY.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.460
YOU JUST SHOULDN'T CALL
IMMIGRANTS THAT ANYMORE

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.100
BECAUSE NOW THEY ARE A BIG
PART OF THE SOCIETY HERE.

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.800
WE CAN'T IMAGINE GERMANY
WITHOUT IMMIGRANTS NOW.

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.630
GERMANY HAS
CHANGED COMPLETELY

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.900
AND THERE IS A NEW
GENERATION GROWING UP HERE

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.760
WHO HAVE TAKEN ON A
RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS COUNTRY

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:44.230
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, THEY
SHOULD BE CALLED GERMANS.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:49.160
AND WHEN YOU SPEAK
OF FOREIGNERS

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.800
THEN YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
GERMANS, TOO, AS FOREIGNERS

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.930
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
THE REAL GERMANY ANYMORE.

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:15.760
>>AS THE OLD PREJUDICES ARE
FADING, THE ATMOSPHERE IN THIS

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:21.730
RIVER TOWN NOW IS MORE ABOUT
ACCEPTANCE AND TOLERANCE.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:26.500
A NEW MOSQUE HAS BEEN
BUILT IN LUDWIGSHAFEN

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.000
AND PEOPLE OF ALL
FAITHS ARE WELCOME HERE.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.430
THEY EVEN ENCOURAGE
SCHOOL TRIPS

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:35.230
TO VISIT AND TO
LEARN ABOUT ISLAM.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.600
IT'S AN OPENNESS THAT'S
ENCOURAGED HASAN

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.030
TO EMBRACE HIS
NEW WAY OF LIFE.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.830
NOW THIS TURKISH POET,
INSPIRED BY A RIVER,

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.530
WRITES ALL HIS
WORK IN GERMAN.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.730
TRANSLATOR: THE RHINE IS A
VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO ME,

00:33:56.730 --> 00:34:00.630
FROM A LITERARY
STANDPOINT, TOO.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.830
TO ME, THE RHINE IS A
SYMBOL OF MOVEMENT.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.160
THE RIVER FLOWS AND I
CAN DESCRIBE THE RIVER

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.730
LIKE AN IMMIGRANT.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:12.460
THE RIVER SEPARATES
THE COUNTRIES,

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:15.860
COMING BETWEEN PEOPLE AS IT
FLOWS THROUGH TOWNS, ETC.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.460
THE RIVER IS ON A
CONTINUOUS JOURNEY,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.360
AND, AS IT CHANGES,
IT FLOWS.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.060
AND IN CHANGING IT
GATHERS STRENGTH

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:29.560
AND FLOWS FASTER
ALL THE TIME.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.900
>>UPSTREAM OF LUDWIGSHAFEN,
THE RIVER THAT IS HASAN'S

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.630
CREATIVE INSPIRATION
CONTINUES TO CHANGE.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:50.400
THIS TIME FROM A GERMAN
TO A FRENCH RIVER.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.930
HERE, THE WATERS
ALSO FORM A NATURAL

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:59.000
AND LONG-DISPUTED
BOUNDARY BETWEEN NATIONS.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.760
WITH FRENCH
ALSACE-LORRAINE ON ONE SIDE

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.200
AND THE GERMAN BLACK
FOREST ON THE OTHER,

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.900
THE RHINE NOW DIVIDES THE
TWO COUNTRIES THAT HAVE

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:13.130
PUSHED AND PULLED OVER ITS
BANKS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.360
IT'S THE COMMUNITIES
IN THIS REGION

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.700
THAT HAVE HAD TO
FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:26.500
ORIGINALLY FRENCH CITIZENS, THE
ALSATIAN PEOPLE BECAME PRUSSIANS

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.400
FOLLOWING THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN
WAR OF THE 19TH CENTURY.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.130
FIFTY YEARS LATER, FOLLOWING
THE FIRST WORLD WAR,

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:39.600
THEY BECAME
FRENCH AGAIN.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.730
JEAN HUGEL'S FAMILY HAVE BEEN
WINE GROWERS IN RIQUEWIHR IN THE

00:35:43.730 --> 00:35:47.430
REGION OF ALSACE FOR NEARLY 400
YEARS AND THEY'VE PERSONALLY

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:52.230
FELT THE TUG OF TWO NATIONS
FIGHTING FOR THEIR LOYALTY.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:57.860
TRANSLATOR: MY GRANDFATHER
WAS BORN A FRENCHMAN IN 1869

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.500
BUT BECAME A
PRUSSIAN IN 1871.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.330
1918, HE WAS FRENCH
AGAIN AND DURING THE WAR

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.330
THE NAZIS TOOK ALSACE WITH
AN IRON FIST AND ATTACKED US,

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:12.800
SO WE HAD TO BECOME
HITLER SUPPORTERS.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.000
NOT THE REAL US,
BUT IN APPEARANCE.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.800
MY GRANDFATHER DIED A
FRENCHMAN AGAIN IN 1950.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.230
SEEMS VERY STRANGE, ALL
THIS CHANGING OF NATIONALITY

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.860
BUT IT WAS ONE BIG
FAMILY DRAMA AT THE TIME.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.860
WE WERE ALWAYS IN THE WRONG
ARMY, ALWAYS ON THE LOSING SIDE.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:37.400
WHEN YOU PUT THE ALSATIANS INTO
AN ARMY IT'S THE ONE THAT LOSES,

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.200
AND AFTER THAT WE ARE BACK
WITH THE WINNERS AGAIN.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:48.030
IT'S A COMPLICATED STORY
BUT AT LEAST IT'S MADE US

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:54.760
INTO PROPER EUROPEANS.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:59.560
>>ALTHOUGH LIVING NEXT DOOR TO
THE RHINE BROUGHT A MAJOR

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.860
IDENTITY CRISIS IT'S ALSO
BROUGHT A LOT OF WEALTH

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.760
TO THE FAMILY
WINE BUSINESS.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.630
TRANSLATOR: FROM HERE
WE HAVE A GREAT VIEW

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.530
OF THE VINEYARDS
OF ALSACE.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:16.960
TO THE RIGHT, THE VOSGES,
THE RHINE PLAIN,

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.900
AND THE RHINE RIVER A LITTLE
FURTHER AWAY, NOT TOO CLOSE.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.200
IT WOULD BE
DANGEROUS.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.130
AND THEN THERE IS THE
BLACK FOREST AND FROM

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:30.300
THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE
RIVER IT IS THE MOST SOUTHERLY

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:33.300
POINT OF THE RIVER WHERE
THE WATER GOES NORTH

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:41.300
SO IT'S IDEALLY PLACED FOR THE
BUSINESS OF EXPORTING WINE.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:47.000
>>JEAN HUGEL AND THE OTHER
VINEYARD OWNERS IN ALSACE

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.060
EXPORT MOST OF THEIR WINE
DIRECTLY DOWN THE RHINE

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:54.600
TO OTHER PARTS OF
EUROPE AND THE WORLD.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.260
TRANSLATOR: TO MAKE MONEY IN THE
WINE BUSINESS YOU NEED TO SELL

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.260
THE PRODUCT TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE
MONEY BUT NO WINE THEMSELVES,

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:06.800
AND FOR US THOSE PEOPLE
ARE IN NOTHERN EUROPE.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.530
BECAUSE OF THE RHINE
WE CAN SHARE OUR WINE

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:11.600
WITH PEOPLE IN
THE LOWER LANDS.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.800
IF YOU DROP A CORK
IN THE RIVER HERE,

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.830
IT WILL REACH THE END OF
ITS JOURNEY IN ROTTERDAM.

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:24.100
>>DESPITE HAVING TO CHANGE THEIR
NATIONALITY SEVERAL TIMES,

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.600
JEAN HUGEL'S FAMILY HAVE
SURVIVED AS WINE MAKERS

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.100
AGAINST ALL ODDS.

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.060
BUT THEIR FUTURE DEPENDS
ON THE SURVIVAL OF THE RHINE

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.600
AND THE RIVER IS UNDER
THREAT - NOT ONLY FROM

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.860
THE MELTING OF ITS SOURCE
HIGH IN THE SWISS ALPS

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:50.930
BUT FROM
POLLUTION, TOO.

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:54.600
FURTHER UP RIVER, THE RHINE
CROSSES THE BORDER OF A FOURTH

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.900
COUNTRY, SWITZERLAND, WHICH IS
ALSO HOME TO THE TWIN SOURCES

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:03.100
OF THE RHINE, THE VORDERRHIEN
AND HINTERRHEIN RIVERS.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.430
AS A LANDLOCKED COUNTRY,
THE RIVER IS CENTRAL TO

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:10.700
SWITZERLAND'S
ECONOMIC SUCCESS.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.660
MARKING THIS JUNCTION WHERE
THE RHINE ENTERS SWITZERLAND

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.560
IS THE SWISS-GERMAN CITY
OF BIEL, A WEALTHY CENTER

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.200
OF COMMERCE ESTABLISHED
ON THE PROCEEDS

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.260
OF SPECIALTY CHEMICAL
AND DRUG INDUSTRIES.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:24.430
BUT FOR THE RIVER
AND THE PEOPLE OF BIEL

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:28.300
SUCCESS HAS
COME AT A PRICE.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.500
IRENE VIGGA HAS LIVED
IN BIEL ALL HER LIFE.

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:45.300
1986 IS A YEAR WHICH SHE
REMEMBERS ALL TOO VIVIDLY.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.930
IT WAS IN THIS YEAR THAT A FIRE
ENGULFED A RIVERSIDE FACTORY

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.560
CAUSING A DISASTROUS
CHEMICAL SPILL

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.900
WHICH TURNED
THE RHINE RED.

00:39:55.900 --> 00:40:00.000
DOWNSTREAM AS FAR AS ROTTERDAM,
THE POLLUTION KILLED WILDLIFE

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.130
AND DEVASTATED THE
RHINE FISHING INDUSTRY.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:08.760
IN BIEL, WHERE IT ALL BEGAN, THE
POISON ALSO HUNG IN THE AIR.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.200
TRANSLATOR: I
REMEMBER IT WELL,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.730
IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
WHEN WE HEARD THE SIRENS

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.760
AND WE WERE WARNED
TO CLOSE OUR WINDOWS.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.130
THERE WAS A SMELL
IN THE AIR...

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:24.960
IT WAS LIKE
ROTTEN EGGS.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.460
THAT WAS THE START OF POLLUTION
WHICH LASTED FOR YEARS

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:35.000
UNTIL THE WATER AND
THE AIR WAS CLEAN AGAIN.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.660
>>EXTRA SPECIAL CARE IS TAKEN
TO TEST THE PURITY OF THE WATER

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.460
IN THE RIVER
THESE DAYS.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.760
THAT'S THE WORK
OF THESE SCIENTISTS

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.030
IN THE RHINE WATER
QUALITY MONITORING STATION.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:56.060
THIS WATER CONTAINS THE
EFFLUENT OF 600,000 PEOPLE.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.200
IT'S NOW DRINKABLE
WHEN BOILED.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.800
THAT'S QUITE A BOAST.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.900
TRANSLATOR: THINGS ARE BETTER
NOW AND THERE ARE PROVISIONS

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:11.400
IN PLACE THAT SHOULD PREVENT
THE SAME THING HAPPENING AGAIN,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.700
BUT ONE SEES IT SOMEHOW LIKE
POWDER IN THE BARREL OF A GUN.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.860
>>TODAY IN BIEL THERE'S A REAL
DETERMINATION TO PROTECT THE

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.830
RHINE FROM THE ILL EFFECTS
OF DEVELOPMENT, BUT THERE'S

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.100
ALSO A REAL DESIRE TO PRESERVE
THE INDUSTRIAL HERITAGE

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:30.960
WHICH HAS BROUGHT
SUCH WEALTH TO THE CITY.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.630
IRENE IS ONE OF THE LEADERS
OF A COMMUNITY PROJECT

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.930
WHICH AIMS
TO DO BOTH.

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:42.130
TRANSLATOR: WE LIVE IN THE AREA
AND WE LOVE THE OLD FACTORIES

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:46.560
AND WE DECIDED TO TRY AND
CREATE A CULTURAL MEETING POINT

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.100
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:55.930
THIS OLD MACHINE FACTORY
BELONGED TO A WORLD FAMOUS

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.760
COMPANY BUT THEY MOVED OUT
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.000
ROOM TO EXPAND AND THEY
JUST LEFT THE BUILDING EMPTY.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.130
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A
GOOD IDEA TO BRING NEW LIFE

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:12.100
TO THE PLACE FOR THE
SAKE OF THE COMMUNITY.

00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:17.260
>>WITH A LIBRARY, A RESTAURANT
AND EVEN A CIRCUS SKILL SCHOOL,

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.130
THIS IS NOW A PLACE FOR
THE WHOLE COMMUNITY

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:24.930
AND THE RHINE
IS AT ITS HEART.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:28.460
TRANSLATOR: THIS CENTER IS SOME
DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE RHINE

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.960
AND AT THE BEGINNING
WE WERE CRITICIZED

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.000
BECAUSE IT WAS NOT IN
THE CENTER OF TOWN.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.660
BUT I THINK THAT EVEN HERE YOU
FEEL THE FLOW OF THE RHINE.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.030
>>FROM SOURCE TO SEA, THE
RHINE AND ITS MIGHTY WATERS

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.960
SHAPE THE LIVES OF ALL THOSE
WHO LIVE ON THE RIVERBANK.

00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.700
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THE FLOW
OF THE GREAT RHINE IS REDUCED

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.700
AS ITS SOURCE MELTS AND
EVENTUALLY DRIES UP COMPLETELY?

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:10.860
IT'S A SOBERING THOUGHT
THAT THESE MAGNIFICENT

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.930
RHINE WATERFALLS,
THE LARGEST IN EUROPE,

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:18.030
COULD BE REDUCED TO
SLOW MOVING WATERS.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.230
APPROXIMATELY 700 CUBIC METERS
OF WATER POUR OVER THESE ROCKS

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:39.760
EVERY SECOND DEPENDING
ON THE TIME OF YEAR.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.930
IN THE SUMMER THE RHINE'S
GLACIAL SOURCE MELTS

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:46.830
MORE QUICKLY AND SO THE WATER
FLOWS MORE POWERFULLY.

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.660
BUT AS OUR CLIMATE CHANGES,
THE SEASONS ARE MERGING INTO

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:56.230
EACH OTHER AND THE ICE IS
MELTING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.930
IF THE WORLD
CONTINUES TO GET WARMER,

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.100
THE GLACIER WILL EVENTUALLY
DISAPPEAR AND THE GREAT RHINE

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:08.630
COULD BECOME NOTHING
MORE THAN A STREAM.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:16.230
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE RIVER WILL
CHANGE - ITS PHYSICAL PRESENCE

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:22.760
AND ITS VITAL ROLE IN THE LIVES
OF INDIVIDUALS AND COUNTRIES.

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.630
THE JOURNEY TO THE TWIN
SOURCES OF THE RHINE

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:28.460
CLIMBS THROUGH SOME
OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.960
AND DRAMATIC LANDSCAPES
ON THE CONTINENT.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:35.330
STEEP ROCKS LINE BOTH SIDES
OF THIS NARROW VALLEY

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:39.200
WHERE THE RHINE IS NO
LONGER A NAVIGABLE WATERWAY.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:43.600
THIS IS THE RUINAULTA, ALSO
KNOWN AS THE RHINE GRAND CANYON,

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.960
AND IT LEADS TO THE SECONDARY
SOURCE OF THE GREAT RHINE.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:03.530
THIS SMALL FROZEN LAKE IS THE
SOURCE OF THE VORDERRHEIN.

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:09.560
BUT THE MAJOR BIRTHPLACE
OF THE RHINE IS THE

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.730
RHEINFELDEN GLACIER,
AFFECTIONATELY NAMED

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:17.600
"PARADISE", AFTER AN
ANCIENT FOLK TALE.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:25.660
IT'S HERE THAT THE THREAT TO THE
RIVER BECOMES ALL TOO CLEAR.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:35.330
PASSED DOWN FROM
GENERATION TO GENERATION,

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.230
THE FOLK TALE TELLS OF A
POOR FARMER WHO LIVED

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:41.100
IN THIS VALLEY, WHO'S ONLY
POSSESSION WAS A TINY FIELD

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:45.530
ON TOP OF THE ALPS
CALLED "PARADISE".

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:50.560
A GREEDY NEIGHBOR
STOLE THE LAND

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.760
BUT MOTHER NATURE
CAST HER SPELL

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.330
AND IN THE MORNING
THE FIELD WAS HIDDEN

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.460
UNDER A THICK
BLANKET OF ICE,

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.400
FORMING THE
RHEINFELDEN GLACIER

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.860
AND THE SOURCE
OF THE RHINE.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:11.460
TODAY THIS LITTLE PARADISE
IS UNDER THREAT ONCE MORE.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:17.560
THE GLACIER'S LOST A QUARTER
OF ITS VOLUME IN JUST 25 YEARS.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:23.230
HERR AND FRAU LOIREZ HAVE LIVED
AND FARMED IN HINTERRHEIN

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.400
BENEATH THE GLACIER
ALL THEIR LIVES.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:31.960
TRANSLATOR: IT'S COMMON LAND
ON TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.730
EVERYBODY
OWNS THE LAND.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.230
YES, THE WHOLE
VILLAGE OWNS IT

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.830
AND THEN THERE'S A
SHEPHERD UP THERE.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:44.700
WE SHARE HIM -
WE ALL SHARE HIM

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.630
AND SO WE DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY TOO MUCH AS LONG AS

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.830
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS EACH
OTHER AND WE DON'T QUARREL.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.700
WHEN THERE IS A
DISAGREEMENT IT'S DIFFICULT

00:46:53.700 --> 00:47:03.800
AND EVERYONE
HAS TO NEGOTIATE.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:09.160
>>YOU DON'T NEED TO BE AN
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT TO NOTICE

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.660
THE SHRINKING OF THE
GLACIER IN HINTERRHEIN.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:19.200
THE PEOPLE HERE KNOW THAT THEIR
ENVIRONMENT IS CHANGING FAST.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:22.530
TRANSLATOR: MY FATHER
ALWAYS USED TO SAY THAT IT TOOK

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.730
TEN MINUTES TO WALK FROM
THE VILLAGE TO THE GLACIER.

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:28.460
AND NOW THESE DAYS YOU
CAN WALK FOR THREE HOURS

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.660
AND YOU'RE STILL
NOT AT THE GLACIER.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:41.660
AND WHEN MY FATHER USED TO SAY
THAT IT WAS ONLY IN THE 1920'S.

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:53.260
BEFORE WHEN IT RAINED IT
ALL STAYED ON THE MOUNTAIN,

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.530
BUT NOW IT ALL
COMES SLIDING DOWN

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:58.260
AND THERE'S A
DANGER OF AVALANCHE.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:12.400
AND IT KEEPS ON COMING IN
A STRONG FLOW FOR A WEEK

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.400
AND THEN THE WHOLE
THING STOPS AGAIN.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:21.500
THAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE FOR SURE.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.660
>>AND IF THE GLACIER
THAWS TO NOTHING,

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:28.660
THE EFFECTS COULD
BE JUST AS TERRIBLE.

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:34.300
TRANSLATOR: THE DRINKING
WATER IN THE VILLAGE COMES FROM

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.930
A VERY GOOD SOURCE BUT IF
THERE'S NOTHING FLOWING DOWN

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.060
IT WOULD BE LIKE
A DESERT HERE.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.800
>>AS THE RELENTLESS MELTING
OF THE GLACIER CONTINUES,

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.130
THE RHINE AND THE LIVES OF
ALL THOSE WHO DEPEND ON IT

00:48:57.130 --> 00:49:00.130
ARE IN DANGER.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:04.730
IF THE SOURCE OF THE RIVER RUNS
DRY, WHAT THEN FOR THE FARMERS

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.460
AND THE FISHERMEN, THE
COUNTRIES AND THEIR BOUNDARIES,

00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:13.400
THE COMMUNITIES
AND THEIR CULTURE?

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:18.400
IF THE COURSE OF THE
RIVER IS CHANGED FOREVER,

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:28.200
LIFE IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD
WILL BE UNRECOGNIZABLE.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.330
THE RHINE IS A RIVER
OF STUNNING BEAUTY

00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:36.360
AND GREAT
HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:41.960
THESE WATERS POWER
THE ECONOMY OF EUROPE.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.360
SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL THE
RIVER HAS SERVED MANY LANDS

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:48.330
AND PEOPLES - FROM
THOSE WHO LIVE NEAR IT

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:53.160
TO THOSE WHO LIVE
THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:57.700
PEOPLE HAVE FOUGHT TO OWN THE
RHINE AND THE LAND ON ITS BANKS.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:01.300
PERHAPS THE TIME HAS COME
FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO UNITE

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:06.450
TO SAVE THE RIVER AND TO FIGHT
SIDE BY SIDE FOR ITS FUTURE.
