00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:43.100


2
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.270
Who's there?

3
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.830
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

4
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.400
Long live the king!

5
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.530
Bernardo?

6
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.500
He.

7
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.030
You come most carefully upon your hour.

8
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.200
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

9
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.930
For this relief much thanks.

10
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.530
'Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.

11
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.930
Have you had quiet guard?

12
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300
Not a mouse stirring.

13
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.930
Well, good night.

14
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.970
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

15
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.130
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

16
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.470
I think I hear them.

17
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.570
Stand, ho!

18
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.930
Who's there?

19
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.030
Friends to this ground.

20
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.100
And liegemen to the Dane.

21
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.400
Give you good night.

22
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.670
Farewell, honest soldier.

23
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.770
Who hath relieved you?

24
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.400
Bernardo hath my place.

25
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.570
Give you good night.

26
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.730
Who are! Bernardo!

27
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.470
Say.

28
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.100
What, is Horatio there?

29
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.330
A piece of him.

30
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.770
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

31
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.130
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

32
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.630
I have seen nothing.

33
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.370
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

34
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.730
And will not let belief take hold of him

35
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.030
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.

36
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.400
Therefore I have entreated him along with us

37
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.470
to watch the minutes of this night;

38
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.900
That if again this apparition come,

39
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

40
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.930
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

41
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.730
Sit down awhile;

42
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.370
And let us once again assail your ears

43
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.870
That are so fortified against our story

44
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.170
What we have two nights seen.

45
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.530
Well, sit we down,

46
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.600
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

47
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.770
Last night of all,

48
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.370
When yond same star that's westward from the pole

49
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.570
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven

50
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.270
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,

51
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.870
The bell then beating one--

52
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.400
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

53
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.070
In the same figure like the king that's dead.

54
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.970
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

55
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.500
Looks it not like the king?

56
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.700
Mark it, Horatio.

57
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.130
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

58
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.000
It would be spoke to.

59
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.730
Question it, Horatio.

60
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.170
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,

61
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.330
Together with that fair and warlike form

62
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.100
In which the majesty of buried Denmark did sometimes march?

63
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.630
By heaven I charge thee, speak!

64
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.230
It is offended.

65
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.600
See, it stalks away!

66
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.700
Stay!

67
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.600
Speak, speak!

68
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.130
I charge thee, speak!

69
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.400
'Tis gone and will not answer.

70
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.900
How now, Horatio!

71
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.770
You tremble and look pale.

72
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.630
Is not this something more than fantasy?

73
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.830
What think you on't?

74
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.770
Before my God, I might not this believe

75
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.300
Without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes.

76
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.500
Is it not like the king?

77
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.830
As thou art to thyself:

78
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.500
Such was the very armour he had on

79
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.700
When he the ambitious Norway combated;

80
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.130
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,

81
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.200
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.

82
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.470
'Tis strange.

83
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.330
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,

84
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.230
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

85
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.870
In what particular thought to work...

86
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.770
I know not;

87
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.630
But in the gross and scope of mine opinion,

88
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.630
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

89
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.270
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,

90
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.000
Why this same strict and most observant watch

91
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.130
So nightly toils the subject of the land,

92
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.800
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,

93
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.230
And foreign mart for implements of war;

94
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.370
Who is it that can inform me?

95
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.800
That can I; At least, the whisper goes so.

96
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.700
Our last king,

97
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.270
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,

98
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.570
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,

99
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.800
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,

100
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.100
Dared to the combat; in the which our valiant Hamlet--

101
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.300
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--

102
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.700
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,

103
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.670
Well ratified by law and heraldry,

104
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.030
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands

105
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.300
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.

106
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.600
Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

107
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.330
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,

108
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.800
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there

109
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.100
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,

110
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.300
For food and diet,

111
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.270
to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't;

112
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.830
which is none other--

113
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.600
As it doth well appear unto our state--

114
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.030
But to recover of us

115
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.930
by strong hand And terms compulsatory

116
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.130
those foresaid lands So by his father lost.

117
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.330
And this, I take it, Is the main motive

118
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.800
of our preparation.

119
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.030
I think it be no other but e'en so:

120
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.100
Well may it sort that this portentous figure

121
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.470
Comes armed through our watch;

122
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.430
so like the king That was and is

123
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.130
the question of these wars.

124
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.870
But soft, behold! where it comes again!

125
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.830
I'll cross it, though it blast me.

126
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.770
Stay, illusion!

127
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.370
If thou hast any sound or use of voice,

128
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.730
Speak to me:

129
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.000
If there be any good thing to be done

130
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.670
That may to thee do ease or grace to me, Speak to me.

131
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.770
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,

132
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.100
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!

133
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.430
Stop it, Marcellus.

134
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.100
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

135
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.230
I do, if it will not stand.

136
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.330
'Tis here!

137
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.400
'Tis here!

138
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.970
'Tis gone!

139
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.770
We do it wrong, being so majestical,

140
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.270
To offer it the show of violence;

141
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.830
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,

142
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.030
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

143
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.900
It was about to speak when the cock crew.

144
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.630
And then it started like a guilty thing

145
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.870
Upon a fearful summons.

146
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.870
I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,

147
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.100
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat

148
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.330
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,

149
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.970
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

150
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.930
The extravagant and erring spirit

151
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.470
hies To his confine: and of the truth herein

152
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.200
This present object made probation.

153
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.400
It faded on the crowing of the cock.

154
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.470
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes

155
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.800
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,

156
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.170
This bird of dawning singeth all night long:

157
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.970
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;

158
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.500
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,

159
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.370
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,

160
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.100
So hallow'd and so gracious is that time.

161
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.630
So have I heard and do in part believe it.

162
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.900
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,

163
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.200
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:

164
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.930
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,

165
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.900
Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet;

166
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.970
for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.

167
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.630
Let's do it, I pray; and I this morning know

168
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.870
Where we shall find him most convenient.

169
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.300
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

170
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.330
The memory be green and that it us befitted

171
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.630
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom

172
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.770
To be contracted in one brow of woe.

173
00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.170
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

174
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.800
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,

175
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.330
Together with remembrance of ourselves.

176
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:13.930
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,

177
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.500
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,

178
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.130
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy--

179
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.470
With one auspicious and one dropping eye,

180
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.470
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,

181
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.730
In equal scale weighing delight and dole--

182
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.800
Taken to wife:

183
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.070
nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms,

184
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.330
which have freely gone With this affair along.

185
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.770
For all, our thanks.

186
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.200
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,

187
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.470
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,

188
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.470
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death

189
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.630
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,

190
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.570
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,

191
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.430
Importing the surrender of those lands

192
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.170
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,

193
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.900
To our most valiant brother.

194
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.130
So much for him.

195
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.230
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:

196
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.770
Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway,

197
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.200
uncle of young Fortinbras-- Who, impotent and bed-rid,

198
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.470
scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose--

199
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.130
to suppress His further gait herein;

200
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.430
in that the levies, The lists and full proportions

201
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.830
are all made Out of his subject:

202
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.200
and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius,

203
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.400
and you, Voltemand,

204
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.000
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;

205
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.800
Giving to you no further personal power

206
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.100
To business with the king

207
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.000
more than the scope Of these delated articles allow.

208
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.070
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

209
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.470
In that and all things will we show our duty.

210
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.700
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

211
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.430
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?

212
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.600
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?

213
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.930
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane

214
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.870
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,

215
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.700
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?

216
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.500
The head is not more native to the heart,

217
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.170
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,

218
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.000
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.

219
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.670
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

220
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.170
My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France;

221
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.930
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark

222
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.700
To show my duty in your coronation,

223
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.870
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,

224
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.200
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France

225
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.030
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

226
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.370
Have you your father's leave?

227
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.630
What says Polonius?

228
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.900
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave

229
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.600
By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will

230
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.830
I seal'd my hard consent:

231
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.670
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

232
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.200
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,

233
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.670
And thy best graces spend it at thy will.

234
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.800
But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son--

235
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.700
A little more than kin and less than kind.

236
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.270
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

237
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.770
Not so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.

238
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.070
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,

239
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.170
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.

240
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.630
Do not forever with thy vailed lids

241
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.300
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:

242
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.370
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that live must die,

243
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.870
Passing through nature to eternity.

244
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.630
Ay, madam, it is common.

245
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.500
If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?

246
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.070
Seems, madam!

247
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.330
Nay, it is; I know not "seems."

248
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.100
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

249
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.970
Nor customary suits of solemn black,

250
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.600
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,

251
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.130
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,

252
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.100
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,

253
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.500
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief

254
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.900
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem

255
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.430
For they are actions that a man might play:

256
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.670
But I have that within which passes show;

257
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.830
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

258
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.130
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,

259
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.370
To give these mourning duties to your father:

260
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.070
But, you must know, your father lost a father;

261
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.000
That father lost, lost his,

262
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and the survivor bound In filial obligation

263
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.830
for some term To do obsequious sorrow:

264
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.700
but to persever In obstinate condolement

265
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.900
is a course Of impious stubbornness;

266
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.400
'tis unmanly grief;

267
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.230
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,

268
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.030
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,

269
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.930
An understanding simple and unschool'd:

270
00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.230
For what we know must be

271
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.630
and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense,

272
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.400
Why should we in our peevish opposition

273
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.500
Take it to heart?

274
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.000
Fie!

275
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.530
'Tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead,

276
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.700
a fault to nature, To reason most absurd

277
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.200
whose common theme Is death of fathers.

278
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.970
We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe,

279
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.200
and think of us As of a father:

280
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.200
for let the world take note,

281
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.770
You are the most immediate to our throne;

282
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.700
And with no less nobility of love

283
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.730
Than that which dearest father bears his son

284
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.770
Do I impart toward you.

285
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.830
For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg,

286
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.870
It is most retrograde to our desires:

287
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.000
And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here,

288
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.470
in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

289
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.930
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

290
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.870
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:

291
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.970
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

292
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.430
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

293
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.570
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:

294
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.630
Be as ourself in Denmark.

295
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.930
Madam, come; This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet

296
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.470
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,

297
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.170
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,

298
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.570
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,

299
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.100
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,

300
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.500
Re-speaking earthly thunder.

301
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500
Come away.

302
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.870
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt

303
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:56.000
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!

304
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.230
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His cannon

305
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.330
'gainst self-slaughter!

306
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.430
O God!

307
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.800
God!

308
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.270
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable

309
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.170
Seem to me all the uses of this world!

310
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.100
Fie on't! O, fie!

311
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.100
'Tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed.

312
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.470
Things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely.

313
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.970
That it should come to this!

314
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.830
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:

315
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.970
So excellent a king;

316
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.970
that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr;

317
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.970
so loving to my mother

318
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.530
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven

319
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.430
Visit her face too roughly.

320
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.230
Heaven and earth! Must I remember?

321
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.770
Why, she would hang on him,

322
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.630
As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on:

323
00:17:53.630 --> 00:18:01.400
and yet, within a month-- Let me not think on't.

324
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.200
Frailty, thy name is woman!

325
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.130
A little month, or ere those shoes were old

326
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.670
With which she follow'd my poor father's body

327
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.700
Like Niobe, all tears.

328
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.130
Why she, even she-- O, God!

329
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.970
A beast, that wants discourse of reason

330
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.570
Would have mourn'd longer--

331
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:27.570
married with my uncle, My father's brother,

332
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.400
but no more like my father Than I to Hercules.

333
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.770
Within a month.

334
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.130
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

335
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.100
Hath left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married.

336
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.170
O, most wicked speed,

337
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.800
to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

338
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.870
It is not nor it cannot come to good:

339
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:07.800
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

340
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.670
Hail to your lordship!

341
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.300
I'm glad to see thee well.

342
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.430
Horatio.

343
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.170
I do forget myself.

344
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.170
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

345
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.900
Sir, my good friend;

346
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.700
I'll change that name with you:

347
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.170
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?

348
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.270
Marcellus?

349
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.370
My good lord.

350
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.570
I am very glad to see you.

351
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.230
Good even, sir.

352
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.630
What, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

353
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.830
A truant disposition, good my lord.

354
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.430
I would not hear your enemy say so.

355
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.870
I know you are no truant.

356
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.670
But what is your affair in Elsinore?

357
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.170
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

358
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.830
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

359
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.230
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;

360
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.630
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

361
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.530
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

362
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.400
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!

363
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.670
The funeral baked meats

364
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.400
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

365
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.030
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

366
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.400
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

367
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.200
My father!

368
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.370
Methinks I see my father.

369
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.470
Where, my lord?

370
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.300
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

371
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:27.200
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

372
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.730
He was a man, take him for all in all,

373
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.570
I shall not look upon his like again.

374
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.900
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

375
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.400
Saw who?

376
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.870
My lord, the king your father.

377
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.230
The king my father!

378
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.730
Season your admiration for awhile With an attent ear

379
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.000
till I may deliver,

380
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.700
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,

381
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.270
This marvel to you.

382
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.830
For God's love, let me hear.

383
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.770
Two nights together had these gentlemen,

384
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.630
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch

385
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.470
In the dead waste and middle of the night

386
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.400
Been thus encounter'd.

387
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.170
A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly,

388
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.270
cap-a-pe, Appears before them,

389
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.130
and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them.

390
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.670
Thrice he walk'd

391
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.730
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes

392
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.070
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they,

393
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.170
distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear,

394
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.800
Stand dumb and speak not to him.

395
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.170
This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did;

396
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.230
And I with them the third night kept the watch;

397
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.130
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing,

398
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:34.470
each word made true and good, The apparition comes:

399
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.330
I knew your father; These hands are not more like.

400
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.800
But where was this?

401
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.530
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

402
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.830
Did you not speak to it?

403
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.600
My lord, I did; But answer made it none.

404
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.270
Yet once methought It lifted up its head

405
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.870
and did address Itself to motion,

406
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.730
like it would speak;

407
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.870
But even then the morning cock crew loud,

408
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.570
And at its sound it shrunk in haste away,

409
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.870
And vanish'd from our sight.

410
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.230
'Tis very strange.

411
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.030
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;

412
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.830
And we did think it writ down in our duty

413
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.070
To let you know of it.

414
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.770
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

415
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.330
Hold you the watch to-night?

416
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.500
We do, my lord.

417
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.600
Arm'd, you say?

418
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.700
Arm'd, my lord.

419
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.900
From top to toe?

420
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.130
My lord, from head to foot.

421
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.230
Then saw you not his face?

422
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.770
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

423
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.970
What look'd he? Frowningly?

424
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.400
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

425
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.500
Pale or red?

426
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.600
Nay, very pale.

427
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.770
And fix'd his eyes upon you?

428
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.870
Most constantly.

429
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.170
I would had I been there.

430
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.470
It would have much amazed you.

431
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.030
Very like, very like.

432
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.400
Stay'd it long?

433
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.100
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

434
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.200
Longer.

435
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.300
Not when I saw't.

436
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.370
His beard was grizzled--no?

437
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:44.600
It was as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd.

438
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.100
I will watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again.

439
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.200
I warrant it will.

440
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.400
If it assume my noble father's person,

441
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.830
I'll speak to it,

442
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.500
though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.

443
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.000
I pray you all,

444
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.900
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,

445
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.170
Let it be tenable in your silence still;

446
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.430
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,

447
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.230
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:

448
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.530
I will requite your loves.

449
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.230
So, fare you well:

450
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.270
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,

451
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.730
I'll visit you.

452
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.870
Our duty to your honour.

453
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:16.600
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

454
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.070
My father's spirit in arms!

455
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:31.030
All is not well; I doubt some foul play:

456
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.100
O, would the night were come!

457
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.770
Till then sit still, my soul:

458
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.230
foul deeds will rise,

459
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.770
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

460
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.930
My necessaries are embark'd.

461
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.630
Farewell.

462
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.970
And, sister, as the winds give benefit

463
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.300
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,

464
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.800
But let me hear from you.

465
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.700
Do you doubt that?

466
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.200
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,

467
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.930
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,

468
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.570
A violet in the youth of primy nature,

469
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.870
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,

470
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.900
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.

471
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.200
No more but so?

472
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.570
Think it no more.

473
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.600
Perhaps he loves you now, but you must fear,

474
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.230
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;

475
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.570
For he himself is subject to his birth:

476
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.800
He may not, as unvalued persons do,

477
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.600
Carve for himself;

478
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.030
for on his choice depends The sanity and health

479
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.830
of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be

480
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.070
circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body

481
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.030
Whereof he is the head.

482
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.500
Then if he says he loves you,

483
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.530
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it

484
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.400
As he in his particular act and place

485
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.770
May give his saying deed; which is no further

486
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.230
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

487
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.000
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,

488
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.530
If with too credent ear you list his songs,

489
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.700
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure

490
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.700
open To his unmaster'd importunity.

491
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:24.630
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,

492
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.030
And keep you in the rear of your affection,

493
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.130
Out of the shot and danger of desire.

494
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.430
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,

495
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.200
As watchman to my heart.

496
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.730
But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,

497
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.170
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;

498
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.270
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,

499
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.300
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,

500
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.230
And recks not his own rede.

501
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.030
O, fear me not.

502
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.830
Yet here, Laertes!

503
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.770
Aboard, aboard, for shame!

504
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.730
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,

505
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.300
And you are stay'd for.

506
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:11.070
There; my blessing with thee!

507
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.400
And these few precepts in thy memory look thou character.

508
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.500
Give thy thoughts no tongue,

509
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.130
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.

510
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.930
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

511
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.200
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,

512
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.100
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;

513
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.330
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment

514
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.130
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged courage.

515
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.230
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,

516
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.230
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.

517
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.570
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;

518
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.230
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

519
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.300
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

520
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.700
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;

521
00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.400
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,

522
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.970
And they in France of the best rank and station

523
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.230
Are of a most select and generous choice in that.

524
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:12.470
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;

525
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.170
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,

526
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.470
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

527
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.470
This above all: to thine ownself be true,

528
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.270
And it must follow, as the night the day,

529
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.170
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

530
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:34.200
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

531
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.130
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

532
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.670
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.

533
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.700
Farewell, Ophelia;

534
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.370
and remember well What I have said to you.

535
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.070
'Tis in my memory lock'd,

536
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.270
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

537
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.770
Farewell.

538
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.970
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

539
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.270
So please you,

540
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.070
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

541
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.570
Marry, well bethought:

542
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.200
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late

543
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.930
Given private time to you;

544
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.730
and you yourself Have of your audience

545
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.930
been most free and bounteous.

546
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.870
What is between you? Hmm?

547
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.670
Give me up the truth.

548
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.970
He hath, my lord,

549
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.700
of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.

550
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.370
Affection!

551
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.630
Pooh!

552
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.230
You speak like a green girl,

553
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.330
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.

554
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.970
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

555
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.470
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

556
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.400
Marry, I shall teach you: think yourself a baby;

557
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.530
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,

558
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.570
Which are not sterling.

559
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.930
Tender yourself more dearly;

560
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.000
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,

561
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.870
Running it thus-- you'll tender me a fool.

562
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.570
My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion.

563
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.200
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

564
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.430
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,

565
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.570
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

566
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:19.170
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.

567
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.070
I do know, When the blood burns,

568
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.530
how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows:

569
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.200
these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat,

570
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.000
extinct in both, Even in their promise,

571
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.270
as they are a-making, You must not take for fire.

572
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:40.770
In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows;

573
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.130
Now, this is for all: I would not, in plain terms,

574
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.300
from this time forth,

575
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.200
Have you so slander any moment's leisure,

576
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.230
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

577
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.230
Look to't, I charge you.

578
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.600
Come your ways.

579
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.800
I shall obey, my lord.

580
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.230
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

581
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.800
It is a nipping and an eager air.

582
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.900
What hour now?

583
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.170
I think it lacks of twelve.

584
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.270
No, it is struck.

585
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.130
Indeed? I heard it not:

586
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.130
Then draws near the season

587
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.200
Wherein the spirit held its wont to walk.

588
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.500
What does this mean, my lord?

589
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.700
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,

590
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.930
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;

591
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.870
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,

592
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.830
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out

593
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.170
The triumph of his pledge.

594
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:48.370
Is it a custom?

595
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.870
Ay, marry, is't: But to my mind,

596
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.200
though I am native here And to the manner born,

597
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.600
it is a custom More honour'd

598
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.030
in the breach than the observance.

599
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.800
This heavy-headed revel east and west

600
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.830
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:

601
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.500
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase

602
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.370
Soil our addition;

603
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.430
and indeed it takes From our achievements,

604
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.730
though perform'd at height,

605
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.330
The pith and marrow of our attribute.

606
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.170
So, oft it chances in particular men,

607
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.170
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,

608
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.370
As in their birth-- wherein they are not guilty,

609
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.570
Since nature cannot choose his origin--

610
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.700
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,

611
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.030
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,

612
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.030
Or by some habit

613
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.670
that too much o'er-leavens the form of plausive manners.

614
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.770
That these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,

615
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.600
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star--

616
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.100
his virtues else-- be they as pure as grace,

617
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.030
As infinite as man may undergo-- Shall in the general censure

618
00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.400
take corruption From that particular fault.

619
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.700
Look, my lord, it comes!

620
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.030
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!

621
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.370
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,

622
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.070
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,

623
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.500
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,

624
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.500
Thou comest in such a questionable shape

625
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.430
That I will speak with thee:

626
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:38.570
I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane:

627
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:39.770
O, answer me!

628
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.530
Let me not burst in ignorance

629
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.030
but tell Why thy canonized bones,

630
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.130
hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements;

631
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.970
why the sepulchre

632
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.930
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd

633
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.870
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws

634
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.330
To cast thee up again.

635
00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:59.070
What may this mean, That thou, dead corse,

636
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.600
again in complete steel Revisit'st thus

637
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.600
the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous;

638
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.930
and we fools of nature

639
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.700
So horridly to shake our dispositions

640
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.630
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

641
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.700
Say, why is this?

642
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.370
Wherefore?

643
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.200
What should we do?

644
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.970
It beckons you to go away with it,

645
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.200
As if it some impartment did desire with you alone.

646
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.170
Look, with what courteous action It waved you

647
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.830
to a more removed ground: But do not go with it.

648
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.970
By no means, my lord.

649
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.370
It will not speak; then I will follow it.

650
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.470
Do not, my lord.

651
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.770
Why, what should be the fear?

652
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.670
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;

653
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.400
And for my soul, what can it do to that,

654
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.930
Being a thing immortal as itself?

655
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.030
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.

656
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.800
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,

657
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.300
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff

658
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.870
That beetles o'er his base into the sea

659
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.100
And there assume some other horrible form

660
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.400
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason

661
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.900
And draw you into madness?

662
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.070
Think of it.

663
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.100
It waves me still.

664
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.330
Go on; I'll follow thee.

665
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:55.430
You shall not go, my lord.

666
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.530
Hold off your hands.

667
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:57.870
Be ruled; you shall not.

668
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.570
My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body

669
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.570
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve!

670
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.730
Still am I call'd.

671
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.270
Unhand me, gentlemen.

672
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.570
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!

673
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:14.100
I say, away!

674
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.430
Go on; I'll follow thee.

675
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.430
He waxes desperate with imagination.

676
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.200
Let's follow him; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

677
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.500
I have after.

678
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.000
To what issue will this come?

679
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.800
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

680
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.300
Heaven will direct it.

681
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.430
Nay, let's follow him.

682
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.570
Where wilt thou lead me?

683
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.400
Speak;

684
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.100
I'll go no further.

685
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.930
Mark me.

686
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.100
I will.

687
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.270
My hour is almost come,

688
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.230
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames

689
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.330
Must render up myself.

690
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.530
Alas, poor ghost!

691
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.830
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing

692
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.070
To what I shall unfold.

693
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.000
Speak; I am bound to hear.

694
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.730
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.

695
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:41.770
What?

696
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.670
I am thy father's spirit,

697
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.070
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,

698
00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.370
And for the day confined to fast in fires,

699
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.330
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature

700
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.930
Are burnt and purged away.

701
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.830
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house,

702
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.070
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

703
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.670
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,

704
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:10.570
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,

705
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.570
Thy knotted and combined locks to part

706
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.200
And each particular hair to stand on end,

707
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.600
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.

708
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.530
But this eternal blazon must not be

709
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.270
To ears of flesh and blood.

710
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.700
List, list, O, list!

711
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.670
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--

712
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.800
O God!

713
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.330
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

714
00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.530
Murder!

715
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.330
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;

716
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.970
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

717
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.370
Haste me to know't, that I,

718
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.370
with wings as swift As meditation

719
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.530
or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.

720
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.330
I find thee apt;

721
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.300
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed

722
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.130
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,

723
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.200
Wouldst thou not stir in this.

724
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.330
Now, Hamlet, hear:

725
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.570
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,

726
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.530
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark

727
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:12.670
Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused.

728
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.030
But know, thou noble youth,

729
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.170
The serpent that did sting thy father's life

730
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.070
Now wears his crown.

731
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.200
O my prophetic soul!

732
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.530
My uncle!

733
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.130
Nay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,

734
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.630
With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts--

735
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.830
O wicked wit and gifts,

736
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.900
that have the power So to seduce!

737
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.100
Won to his shameful lust

738
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.930
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:

739
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:49.570
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!

740
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.230
From me, whose love was of that dignity

741
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.400
That it went hand in hand

742
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.430
even with the vow I made to her in marriage,

743
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.970
and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor

744
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.670
To those of mine!

745
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.400
But virtue, as it never will be moved,

746
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.430
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,

747
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.070
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,

748
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.070
Will sate itself in a celestial bed

749
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.370
And prey on garbage.

750
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.570
But, soft!

751
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.100
Methinks I scent the morning air;

752
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.400
Brief let me be.

753
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.470
Sleeping within my orchard,

754
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.300
My custom always of the afternoon,

755
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.600
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole

756
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.330
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,

757
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.000
And in the porches of my ears

758
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.800
did pour The leperous distilment;

759
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.600
whose effect Holds such an enmity

760
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.530
with blood of man That swift as quicksilver

761
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.130
it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body,

762
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.330
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd,

763
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.670
like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood:

764
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.900
so did it mine;

765
00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.670
And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like,

766
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:06.270
with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body.

767
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.270
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life,

768
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.970
of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd.

769
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:18.670
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,

770
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.470
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made,

771
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.600
but sent to my account

772
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.770
With all my imperfections on my head.

773
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.470
O, horrible!

774
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.970
Most horrible!

775
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:42.630
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;

776
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.030
Let not the royal bed of Denmark

777
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.630
be a couch for luxury and damned incest.

778
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:53.000
But, howsomever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind,

779
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.300
nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught:

780
00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:02.470
leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,

781
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.470
To prick and sting her.

782
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.500
Fare thee well at once!

783
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.370
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,

784
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:17.300
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:

785
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.900
Adieu.

786
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:22.630
Adieu, adieu.

787
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.570
Remember me.

788
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.470
O you host of heaven!

789
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.130
O earth!

790
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.230
What else?

791
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.770
And shall I couple hell?

792
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.500
Fie! Fie!

793
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.900
Hold, hold, my heart;

794
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.170
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,

795
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.900
But bear me stiffly up.

796
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.030
Remember thee!

797
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.400
Ay, thou poor ghost,

798
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.500
whilst memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.

799
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.000
Remember thee!

800
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.830
Yea, from the table of my memory

801
00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.970
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books,

802
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.870
all forms, all pressures past,

803
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:25.270
That youth and observation copied there;

804
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.170
And thy commandment all alone shall live

805
00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.770
Within the book and volume of my brain,

806
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:33.630
Unmix'd with baser matter.

807
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:39.500
Yes, yes, by heaven!

808
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.400
O most pernicious woman!

809
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.470
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!

810
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.130
My tables, my tables.

811
00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.600
Meet it as I set it down,

812
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.630
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;

813
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.330
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:

814
00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:59.500
So, uncle, there you are.

815
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.300
Now to my word; It is Adieu, adieu!

816
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.930
Remember me.

817
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.770
I have sworn it.

818
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.770
My lord.

819
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:11.970
My lord?

820
00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.300
Lord Hamlet?

821
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.400
Heaven secure him!

822
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.700
So be it!

823
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.830
Hello, ho, ho, my lord!

824
00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:19.770
Hello, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

825
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.930
Come, bird, come.

826
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.470
How is't, my noble lord?

827
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.570
What news, my lord?

828
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.670
O, wonderful!

829
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:25.770
Good my lord, tell it.

830
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.870
No.

831
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:27.970
You will reveal it.

832
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.070
My lord, by heaven.

833
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.200
Nor I, my lord.

834
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.000
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?

835
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.100
But you'll be secret?

836
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.270
Ay, by heaven, my lord.

837
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.730
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark

838
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.700
But he's an arrant knave.

839
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.130
There needs no ghost, my lord,

840
00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.770
come from the grave To tell us this.

841
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.730
Why, right; you are in the right;

842
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.570
And so, without more circumstance at all,

843
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.400
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:

844
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.600
You, as your business and desire shall point you;

845
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.670
For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is;

846
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.330
and for mine own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray.

847
00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.970
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

848
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:04.300
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, faith heartily.

849
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.670
There's no offence, my lord.

850
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:08.500
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,

851
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.130
And much offence too.

852
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.300
Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost,

853
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.470
that let me tell you:

854
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.370
For your desire to know what is between us,

855
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.130
O'ermaster it as you may.

856
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.570
And now, good friends,

857
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.970
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,

858
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.570
Give me one poor request.

859
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.370
What is't, my lord? We will.

860
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.400
Never make known what you have seen to-night.

861
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.570
My lord, we will not.

862
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.100
Nay, but swear't.

863
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.370
In faith, My lord, not I.

864
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.630
Nor I, my lord, in faith.

865
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:33.730
Upon my sword.

866
00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.730
We have sworn, my lord, already.

867
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:39.370
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

868
00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:40.930
Swear.

869
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.930
Ah, ha, boy!

870
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.400
Say'st thou so?

871
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.770
Art thou there, truepenny?

872
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.630
Come on.

873
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.400
You hear this fellow in the cellarage.

874
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.970
Consent to swear.

875
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.800
Propose the oath, my lord.

876
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.670
Never to speak of this that you have seen,

877
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.800
Swear by my sword.

878
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.600
Swear.

879
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.200
Hic et ubique?

880
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.630
Then we'll shift our ground.

881
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:05.700
Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword.

882
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.370
Swear by my sword never to speak of this

883
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.870
that you have heard.

884
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.200
Swear by his sword.

885
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.230
Well said, old mole!

886
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.170
Canst work in the earth so fast?

887
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:18.500
A worthy pioner!

888
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.530
Once more remove, good friends.

889
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.800
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

890
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.970
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.

891
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.330
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

892
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.130
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

893
00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:39.330
But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,

894
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.600
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,

895
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.130
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet

896
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.800
To put an antic disposition on, That you,

897
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.870
at such times seeing me, ne'er shall,

898
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:51.900
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake

899
00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.300
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,

900
00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.130
As "Well, well, we know," or "We would, an' if we could,"

901
00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:01.070
Or "If we list to speak," or "There be, an' if they might,"

902
00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.400
Or such ambiguous giving out,

903
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.670
to note That you know aught of me: this do swear,

904
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:10.470
So grace and mercy at your most need help you.

905
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.970
Swear.

906
00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:17.030
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!

907
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:27.570
So, gentlemen, with all my love I do commend me to you.

908
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:31.030
Let us go in together;

909
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:35.370
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.

910
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:49.370
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,

911
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:53.770
That ever I was born to set it right.

912
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.500
Nay, come, let's go together.

913
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:11.800
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

914
00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.170
I will, my lord.

915
00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:15.330
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,

916
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.670
Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behavior.

917
00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:20.530
My lord, I did intend it.

918
00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:23.400
Marry, well said; very well said.

919
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.130
Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;

920
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:29.470
And how, and who, what means, where they keep,

921
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.070
What company, at what expense;

922
00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:32.930
and finding By this encompassment

923
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.530
and drift of question That they do know my son,

924
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:36.730
come you more nearer

925
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:39.570
Than your particular demands will touch it:

926
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:43.430
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;

927
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:46.400
As thus, "I know his father and his friends

928
00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.130
And in part him."

929
00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.730
Do you mark this, Reynaldo?

930
00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.830
Ay, very well, my lord.

931
00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.870
"And in part him;" but you may say, "not well.

932
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.270
"And if't be he I mean, he's very wild;

933
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:02.530
Addicted, so and so."

934
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.630
And there put on him What forgeries you please;

935
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.900
marry, none so rank As may dishonour him;

936
00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.100
take heed of that;

937
00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:11.230
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips

938
00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.230
As are companions noted and most known

939
00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:14.700
To youth and liberty.

940
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.600
As gaming, my lord.

941
00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:24.330
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,

942
00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:26.570
Drabbing: you may go so far.

943
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.900
My lord, that would dishonour him.

944
00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:32.500
Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.

945
00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.000
But, my good lord--

946
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.330
Wherefore should you do this?

947
00:47:35.330 --> 00:47:36.800
Ay, my lord, I would know that.

948
00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.030
Marry, sir, here's my drift;

949
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:42.530
You laying these slight sullies on my son,

950
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:45.900
Your party in converse, him you would sound,

951
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.970
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes

952
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:50.800
The youth you breathe of guilty,

953
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.800
be assured He closes with you in this consequence;

954
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.700
"Good sir," or so, or "friend," or "gentleman,"

955
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.300
According to the phrase and the addition Of man and country.

956
00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.570
Very good, my lord.

957
00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:07.030
And then, sir, does he this--he does--

958
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.270
what was I about to say?

959
00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:13.330
By the mass, I was about to say something: where did I leave?

960
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:16.200
At "closes in the consequence," at "friend or so"

961
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.500
and "gentleman."

962
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.630
At "closes in the consequence"?

963
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:24.700
Ay, marry; He closes thus:

964
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.230
"I know the gentleman; I saw him yesterday,"

965
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.730
or t' other day, Or then, or then; with such,

966
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.730
or such; and, as you say,

967
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.730
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;

968
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:38.300
There falling out at tennis: or perchance,

969
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:41.830
"I saw him enter such a house of sale,"

970
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:44.070
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.

971
00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:45.530
See you now;

972
00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:49.770
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:

973
00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:52.230
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,

974
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:55.270
With windlasses and with assays of bias,

975
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:59.600
By indirections find directions out:

976
00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.830
So by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son.

977
00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.570
You have me, have you not?

978
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.370
My lord, I have.

979
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.730
God be wi' you; fare you well.

980
00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:09.130
Good my lord!

981
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:11.700
Observe his inclination in yourself.

982
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:12.800
I shall, my lord.

983
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.130
And...

984
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.830
Let him ply his music.

985
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.330
Well, my lord.

986
00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:21.600
Farewell!

987
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.930
How now, Ophelia!

988
00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.730
What's the matter?

989
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.600
My lord, my lord, I've have been so affrighted!

990
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.870
With what, i' the name of God?

991
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:36.100
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,

992
00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.600
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;

993
00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.370
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,

994
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:48.470
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle; Pale as his shirt;

995
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:52.200
his knees knocking each other;

996
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.530
And with a look so piteous in purport

997
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:58.500
As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors,

998
00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.400
he comes before me.

999
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:03.230
Mad for thy love?

1000
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:07.130
My lord, I do not know; But truly, I do fear it.

1001
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:08.500
What said he?

1002
00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:12.330
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;

1003
00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:15.100
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;

1004
00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:18.800
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,

1005
00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:24.100
He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it.

1006
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.000
Long stay'd he so;

1007
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.330
At last, a little shaking of mine arm

1008
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:36.770
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,

1009
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:42.230
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound

1010
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:46.330
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being.

1011
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.030
That done, he lets me go:

1012
00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.900
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,

1013
00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:57.670
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;

1014
00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.500
For out o' doors he went without their helps,

1015
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.900
And, to the last, bended their light on me.

1016
00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:06.330
Oh, come.

1017
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:13.130
Go with me: I will go seek the king.

1018
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:16.700
This is the very ecstasy of love.

1019
00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.930
What, have you given him any hard words of late?

1020
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.770
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,

1021
00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:26.200
I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.

1022
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:29.770
That hath made him mad.

1023
00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.130
Oh, I'm sorry that with better heed and judgment

1024
00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:34.100
I had not quoted him:

1025
00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:37.900
I fear'd he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee;

1026
00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.800
Oh, I'm sorry.

1027
00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.070
Go we to the king:

1028
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.430
This must be known; which, being kept close,

1029
00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:51.530
might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

1030
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.370
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!

1031
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.270
Moreover that we much did long to see you,

1032
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:04.970
The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending.

1033
00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.000
Something have you heard Of Hamlet's transformation;

1034
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.170
so I call it,

1035
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.430
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man

1036
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.800
Resembles that it was.

1037
00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:17.130
What it should be, More than his father's death,

1038
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:18.330
that thus hath put him

1039
00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:20.370
So much from the understanding of himself,

1040
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.300
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,

1041
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.430
That, being of so young days brought up with him,

1042
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:27.600
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,

1043
00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.730
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court

1044
00:52:29.730 --> 00:52:31.000
Some little time:

1045
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.900
so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures,

1046
00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.400
and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean,

1047
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.630
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,

1048
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:42.400
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

1049
00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.400
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;

1050
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.570
And sure I am two men there is not living

1051
00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.100
To whom he more adheres.

1052
00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.300
Both your majesties Might,

1053
00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:50.970
by the sovereign power you have of us,

1054
00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:55.200
Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.

1055
00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.730
But we both obey, And here give up ourselves,

1056
00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:01.230
in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet,

1057
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:02.400
To be commanded.

1058
00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.370
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

1059
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:08.930
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:

1060
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.930
And I beseech you instantly

1061
00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:13.300
to visit My too much changed son.

1062
00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.130
Heaven make our presence and our practises Pleasant

1063
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:17.730
and helpful to him!

1064
00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:19.630
Ay.

1065
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:21.070
Amen.

1066
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:25.130
The ambassadors from Norway, My good lord,

1067
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:26.800
Are joyfully return'd.

1068
00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.000
Thou still hast been the father of good news.

1069
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.530
Have I, my lord?

1070
00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:34.630
I assure you, my good liege,

1071
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:37.130
I hold my duty as I hold my soul

1072
00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:39.700
Both to my God and to my gracious king:

1073
00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:43.130
And I do think, or else this brain of mine

1074
00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:46.370
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do,

1075
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:49.230
that I have found The very cause

1076
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.930
of Hamlet's lunacy.

1077
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:54.030
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.

1078
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:56.600
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;

1079
00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.270
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

1080
00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:02.000
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

1081
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.870
He tells me, my dear Gertrude,

1082
00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:07.670
he hath found The head and source

1083
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:09.530
of all your son's distemper.

1084
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:12.430
I doubt it is no other but the main;

1085
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:18.670
His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.

1086
00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:21.870
Well, we shall sift him.

1087
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:27.030
Welcome, my good friends!

1088
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.670
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?

1089
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:32.970
Most fair return of greetings and desires.

1090
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:37.430
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies;

1091
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:39.270
which to him appear'd To be a preparation

1092
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.800
'gainst the Polack; But, better look'd into,

1093
00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.900
he truly found It was against your highness:

1094
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.070
whereat grieved,

1095
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:47.870
That so his sickness, age and impotence

1096
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:51.270
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras;

1097
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:52.970
which he, in brief, obeys;

1098
00:54:52.970 --> 00:54:54.270
Receives rebuke from Norway,

1099
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.200
and in fine Makes vow before his uncle

1100
00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.570
never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty.

1101
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.670
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,

1102
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.830
Gives him three score thousand crowns in annual fee,

1103
00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:11.630
And his commission to employ those soldiers,

1104
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:14.270
So levied as before, against the Polack:

1105
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:16.700
With an entreaty, herein further shown,

1106
00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:18.800
That it might please you to give quiet pass

1107
00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.930
Through your dominions for this enterprise,

1108
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:24.200
On such regards of safety and allowance

1109
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.600
As therein are set down.

1110
00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.100
It likes us well;

1111
00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:31.700
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:

1112
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.300
Most welcome home!

1113
00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:40.030
This business is well ended.

1114
00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:50.670
My liege, and madam,

1115
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.730
to expostulate What majesty should be,

1116
00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.600
what duty is, Why day is day,

1117
00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.300
night night, and time is time,

1118
00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.430
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.

1119
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.470
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit

1120
00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:09.070
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,

1121
00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:14.300
I will be brief: your noble son is mad.

1122
00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:18.400
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,

1123
00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.300
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?

1124
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.770
But let that go.

1125
00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:27.100
More matter, with less art.

1126
00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:30.100
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

1127
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.330
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;

1128
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:37.530
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;

1129
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:39.500
But farewell it, for I will use no art.

1130
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.470
Mad let us grant him, then:

1131
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:45.800
and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect,

1132
00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.300
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,

1133
00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:51.470
For this effect defective comes by cause:

1134
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:56.870
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.

1135
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.030
Perpend.

1136
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:01.600
I have a daughter-- have while she is mine--

1137
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.600
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,

1138
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:10.030
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.

1139
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:13.730
"To the celestial and my soul's idol,

1140
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.930
the most beautified Ophelia."

1141
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:19.770
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase;

1142
00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:23.700
"beautified" is a vile phrase: but you shall hear.

1143
00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:29.170
Thus: "In her excellent white bosom, these"--et cetera.

1144
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:32.170
Came this from Hamlet to her?

1145
00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:36.100
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.

1146
00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:41.300
"Doubt thou the stars are fire; Doubt that the sun doth move;

1147
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:45.000
"Doubt truth to be a liar; But never doubt I love.

1148
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.270
"O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;

1149
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.470
"I have not art to reckon my groans:

1150
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:53.830
"but that I love thee best, O more best, believe it.

1151
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:55.330
"Adieu.

1152
00:57:55.330 --> 00:58:01.800
"Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him.

1153
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.070
--Hamlet."

1154
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:06.300
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me.

1155
00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:09.100
But how hath she Received his love?

1156
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:12.630
What do you think of me?

1157
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:14.900
As of a man faithful and honourable.

1158
00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.000
I would fain prove so.

1159
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.000
But what might you think,

1160
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.270
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--

1161
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.030
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,

1162
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:25.600
Before my daughter told me-- what might you,

1163
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.770
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,

1164
00:58:27.770 --> 00:58:30.400
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,

1165
00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:34.070
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,

1166
00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:36.200
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;

1167
00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.670
What might you think?

1168
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:40.000
No, I went round to work,

1169
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.400
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:

1170
00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.970
"Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;

1171
00:58:44.970 --> 00:58:46.500
This must not be."

1172
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.370
And then I prescripts gave her,

1173
00:58:48.370 --> 00:58:50.570
That she should lock herself from his resort,

1174
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:53.430
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.

1175
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:55.400
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;

1176
00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:58.330
And he, repelled-- a short tale to make--

1177
00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.730
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,

1178
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:03.630
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,

1179
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:06.030
Thence into a lightness, and, by this declension,

1180
00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.770
Into the madness wherein now he raves,

1181
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:11.270
And all we mourn for.

1182
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:13.330
Do you think 'tis this?

1183
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.870
It may be, very likely.

1184
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:18.630
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:

1185
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:21.070
How may we try it further?

1186
00:59:21.070 --> 00:59:25.470
Ah, You know, sometimes he walks four hours together

1187
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.030
Here in the lobby.

1188
00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:30.430
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:

1189
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:32.870
Be you and I behind an arras then;

1190
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:34.630
Mark the encounter:

1191
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:38.200
if he love her not And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,

1192
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.400
Let me be no assistant for a state,

1193
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.400
But keep a farm and carters.

1194
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:43.670
We will try it.

1195
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:49.570
But look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

1196
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.700
Away, I do beseech you, both away:

1197
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.300
I'll board him presently.

1198
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:14.200
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

1199
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.800
Well.

1200
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.630
God have mercy.

1201
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:38.400
Do you know me, my lord?

1202
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.500
Excellent well.

1203
01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:40.600
Ah.

1204
01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.870
You are a fishmonger.

1205
01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:43.970
Not I, my lord.

1206
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:45.600
Then I would you were so honest a man.

1207
01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.900
Honest, my lord!

1208
01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:49.100
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes,

1209
01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.770
is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.

1210
01:00:52.770 --> 01:00:53.970
That's very true, my lord.

1211
01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:56.470
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog,

1212
01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:00.130
being a god kissing carrion--

1213
01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:01.970
Have you a daughter?

1214
01:01:01.970 --> 01:01:03.970
I have, my lord.

1215
01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:07.370
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing:

1216
01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.300
but not as your daughter may conceive.

1217
01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.100
Friend, look to it.

1218
01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.870
How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter.

1219
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:19.000
Yet he knew me not at first; said I was a fishmonger.

1220
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.030
He is far gone, far gone: and yet truly in my youth

1221
01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:25.670
I suffered much extremity for love;

1222
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:27.370
very near this.

1223
01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:29.530
I'll speak to him again.

1224
01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:31.170
What do you read, my lord?

1225
01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:36.230
Words, words, words.

1226
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:39.100
What is the matter, my lord?

1227
01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.770
Between who?

1228
01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:44.630
I mean, what is the matter that you read, my lord.

1229
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:47.530
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says

1230
01:01:47.530 --> 01:01:51.130
here that old men have grey beards,

1231
01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:52.530
that their faces are wrinkled,

1232
01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:56.230
their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum.

1233
01:01:57.930 --> 01:01:59.800
That they have a plentiful lack of wit,

1234
01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.770
together with most weak hams:

1235
01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:04.770
all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe,

1236
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:07.970
yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down,

1237
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:11.900
for you yourself, sir, should grow old as I am,

1238
01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:15.530
if like a crab you could go backward.

1239
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:20.270
Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.

1240
01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.670
I'll speak to him again.

1241
01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.270
My Lord, will you walk out o' the air?

1242
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:28.400
Into my grave?

1243
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.030
Indeed, that's out o' the air.

1244
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:34.600
How pregnant sometimes his replies are!

1245
01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.730
My lord, I will take my leave of you.

1246
01:02:36.730 --> 01:02:38.770
You cannot, sir, take from me

1247
01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:43.670
any thing that I will more willingly part withal:

1248
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:50.970
except my life, except my life, except my life.

1249
01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.270
Fare you well, my lord.

1250
01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.130
These tedious old fools!

1251
01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:01.000
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.

1252
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.400
God save you, sir!

1253
01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.070
My honoured lord!

1254
01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:12.670
My most dear lord!

1255
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:15.070
My excellent good friends!

1256
01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:20.900
How dost thou, Guildenstern?

1257
01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.470
Ah, Rosencrantz!

1258
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:25.800
Good lads, how do ye both?

1259
01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.770
As the indifferent children of the earth.

1260
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:30.100
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;

1261
01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.030
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

1262
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:33.200
Nor the soles of her shoe?

1263
01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:34.700
Neither, my lord.

1264
01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.500
Then you live about her waist, in the middle of her favours?

1265
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.670
'Faith, her privates we.

1266
01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:44.930
In the secret parts of fortune?

1267
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:48.500
O, 'tis too true.

1268
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.100
She is a strumpet.

1269
01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:54.300
What news?

1270
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:57.830
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

1271
01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:07.230
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.

1272
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:09.800
Let me question more in particular:

1273
01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:11.430
what have you, my good friends,

1274
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:13.000
deserved at the hands of fortune,

1275
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.200
that she sends you to prison hither?

1276
01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.470
Prison, my lord!

1277
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:17.870
Denmark's a prison.

1278
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:18.970
Then is the world one.

1279
01:04:18.970 --> 01:04:20.370
A goodly one;

1280
01:04:20.370 --> 01:04:22.930
in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons,

1281
01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:24.770
Denmark being one o' the worst.

1282
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:26.030
We think not so, my lord.

1283
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:27.670
Why, then, 'tis none to you;

1284
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:31.630
for there is nothing either good or bad,

1285
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:37.170
but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.

1286
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.600
Why then, your ambition makes it one;

1287
01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.100
'tis too narrow for your mind.

1288
01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:44.100
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell

1289
01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:47.000
and count myself a king of infinite space,

1290
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.800
were it not that I have bad dreams.

1291
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.030
Which dreams indeed are ambition,

1292
01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.100
for the very substance of the ambitious

1293
01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:00.200
is merely the shadow of a dream.

1294
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.400
A dream itself is but a shadow.

1295
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.500
Shall we to the court?

1296
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:04.000
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.

1297
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.370
We'll wait upon you.

1298
01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:06.900
No such matter:

1299
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.300
I will not sort you with the rest of my servants,

1300
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:11.730
for, to speak to you like an honest man,

1301
01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:13.600
I am most dreadfully attended.

1302
01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:15.270
But, in the beaten way of friendship,

1303
01:05:15.270 --> 01:05:17.530
what make you at Elsinore?

1304
01:05:17.530 --> 01:05:22.070
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

1305
01:05:22.070 --> 01:05:26.800
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks;

1306
01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.330
but I thank you: and sure, dear friends,

1307
01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.130
my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.

1308
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:33.370
Were you not sent for?

1309
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:35.470
Is it your own inclining?

1310
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:37.530
Is it a free visitation?

1311
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:40.530
Come, come; deal justly with me.

1312
01:05:40.530 --> 01:05:43.100
Come; nay, speak.

1313
01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:45.130
What should we say, my lord?

1314
01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:48.170
Why, any thing, but to the purpose.

1315
01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:49.430
You were sent for;

1316
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:51.730
and there is a kind of confession in your looks

1317
01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:55.270
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:

1318
01:05:55.270 --> 01:06:00.230
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.

1319
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:01.530
To what end, my lord?

1320
01:06:01.530 --> 01:06:04.130
That you must teach me.

1321
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:07.570
But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship

1322
01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:11.000
and by the obligation of our ever-preserved love,

1323
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.330
be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no.

1324
01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:15.570
What say you?

1325
01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:19.500
Nay, then I have an eye of you.

1326
01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.500
If you love me, hold nothing.

1327
01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.470
My lord, we were sent for.

1328
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:26.630
I will tell you why.

1329
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:30.330
So shall my anticipation prevent your discovery,

1330
01:06:30.330 --> 01:06:34.870
and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather.

1331
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:40.730
I have of late-- but wherefore I know not--

1332
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:45.270
lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises;

1333
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:48.030
and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition

1334
01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.230
that this goodly frame, the earth,

1335
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:54.800
seems to me a sterile promontory,

1336
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.300
this most excellent canopy, the air, look you,

1337
01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.830
this brave o'erhanging firmament,

1338
01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:06.870
this majestical roof fretted with golden fire,

1339
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:08.930
why, it appears no other thing to me

1340
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:14.230
than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.

1341
01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.870
What a piece of work is a man.

1342
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:23.770
How noble in reason,

1343
01:07:23.770 --> 01:07:26.330
How infinite in faculties.

1344
01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:30.130
In form and moving how express and admirable.

1345
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:33.530
In action how like an angel.

1346
01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:37.770
In apprehension how like a god.

1347
01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:43.870
The beauty of the world, the paragon of animals!

1348
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:53.000
And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?

1349
01:07:55.330 --> 01:07:57.900
Man delights not me.

1350
01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:02.500
No, nor woman neither,

1351
01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.530
though by your smiling you seem to say so.

1352
01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:06.630
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

1353
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:08.430
Why did you laugh then,

1354
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:10.300
when I said, "man delights not me"?

1355
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.600
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man,

1356
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.370
what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you:

1357
01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:17.170
we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming,

1358
01:08:17.170 --> 01:08:18.330
to offer you service.

1359
01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:23.430
He that plays the king shall be welcome;

1360
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:25.770
his majesty shall have tribute of me;

1361
01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:27.200
What players are they?

1362
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.530
Even those that you were wont to take such delight in,

1363
01:08:29.530 --> 01:08:31.170
the tragedians of the city.

1364
01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:32.670
How chances it they travel?

1365
01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:35.470
Their residence, both in reputation and profit,

1366
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:36.670
was better both ways.

1367
01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:37.770
I think their inhibition

1368
01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:39.500
comes by means of the late innovation.

1369
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.170
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?

1370
01:08:42.170 --> 01:08:43.270
Are they so followed?

1371
01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:44.370
No, indeed, are they not.

1372
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.830
How comes it? Do they grow rusty?

1373
01:08:45.830 --> 01:08:48.130
No, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace:

1374
01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:50.500
but there is, sir, an aery of children,

1375
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.200
little eyases, that cry out on the top of question,

1376
01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.170
and are most tyrannically clapped for't.

1377
01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.500
These are now the fashion,

1378
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.370
and so berattle the common stages--

1379
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:00.800
so they call them--

1380
01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.530
that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills

1381
01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:04.830
and dare scarce come thither.

1382
01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:05.930
What, are they children?

1383
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.400
Who maintains 'em?

1384
01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:09.570
Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?

1385
01:09:09.570 --> 01:09:10.870
Will they not say,

1386
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:14.470
when they shall grow themselves to common players--

1387
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:15.830
their writers do them wrong,

1388
01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:18.530
to make them exclaim against their own succession?

1389
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:20.970
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides;

1390
01:09:20.970 --> 01:09:24.200
and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy:

1391
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:30.100
It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark,

1392
01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.070
and those that would make mows at him while my father lived

1393
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:35.930
now give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece

1394
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:38.170
for his picture in little.

1395
01:09:38.170 --> 01:09:41.400
'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural,

1396
01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.930
if philosophy could find it out.

1397
01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:46.270
There are the players.

1398
01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:48.770
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.

1399
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.030
Your hands, come then:

1400
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:52.230
the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony:

1401
01:09:52.230 --> 01:09:53.800
let me comply with you in this garb.

1402
01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:55.100
You are welcome.

1403
01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:00.270
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.

1404
01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:03.430
In what, my dear lord?

1405
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:06.330
I am but mad north-north-west:

1406
01:10:06.330 --> 01:10:12.300
when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.

1407
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:15.700
Well be with you, gentlemen!

1408
01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.270
Hark you, Guildenstern;

1409
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.800
and you too: at each ear a hearer.

1410
01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.100
That great baby you see there

1411
01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.270
is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.

1412
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:27.100
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.

1413
01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.970
You say right, sir.

1414
01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:32.530
O' Monday morning; 'twas then indeed.

1415
01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:34.330
My lord, I have news to tell you.

1416
01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:37.330
My lord, I have news to tell you.

1417
01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:40.400
When Roscius was an actor in Rome--

1418
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.000
The actors are come hither, my lord.

1419
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.100
Buzz, buzz!

1420
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.270
Upon mine honour,

1421
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:46.670
Then came each actor on his ass.

1422
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.400
The best actors in the world,

1423
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.070
either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral,

1424
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:53.000
pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,

1425
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:54.100
tragical-historical,

1426
01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.330
tragical-comical- historical-pastoral,

1427
01:10:57.330 --> 01:10:59.400
scene individable or poem unlimited.

1428
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.730
Seneca cannot be too heavy or Plautus too light.

1429
01:11:01.730 --> 01:11:03.300
For the law of writ and the liberty,

1430
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.730
these are the only men.

1431
01:11:04.730 --> 01:11:09.700
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

1432
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:11.100
What a treasure had he, my lord?

1433
01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:15.470
Why, "One fair daughter and no more,

1434
01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:18.900
The which he loved passing well."

1435
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.800
Still on my daughter.

1436
01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.200
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

1437
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.300
If you call me Jephthah, my lord,

1438
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.170
I have a daughter that I love passing well.

1439
01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:28.470
Nay, that follows not.

1440
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.700
What follows, then, my lord?

1441
01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:35.970
Why, "As by lot"--

1442
01:11:35.970 --> 01:11:39.000
God wot.

1443
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.600
But look!

1444
01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.100
Where my abridgement comes.

1445
01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.170
Welcome, all.

1446
01:11:53.170 --> 01:11:57.070
I am glad to see thee well.

1447
01:11:57.070 --> 01:12:00.830
Welcome, good friends.

1448
01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:03.400
O, my old friend!

1449
01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:08.770
Why, thy face is valenced since I saw thee last.

1450
01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:11.900
Comest thou to beard me in Denmark?

1451
01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.770
What, my young lady and mistress!

1452
01:12:14.770 --> 01:12:17.400
By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven

1453
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.870
than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine.

1454
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:24.130
Pray God, your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold,

1455
01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:26.900
be not cracked within the ring.

1456
01:12:30.270 --> 01:12:33.070
Masters, you are all welcome.

1457
01:12:33.070 --> 01:12:34.870
We'll e'en to't like French falconers,

1458
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:37.230
fly at any thing we see: we'll have a speech straight.

1459
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:39.870
Come, give us a taste of your quality;

1460
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:42.070
come, a passionate speech.

1461
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:44.770
What speech, my good lord?

1462
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:48.470
I heard thee speak me a speech once,

1463
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:52.170
but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once;

1464
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:54.600
for the play, I remember, pleased not the million;

1465
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:57.200
'twas caviare to the general.

1466
01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.100
One speech in it I chiefly loved:

1467
01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.830
'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it

1468
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:07.730
especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter:

1469
01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:12.300
if it live within your memory, I pray you begin at this line.

1470
01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.430
Let me see, let me see--

1471
01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:18.230
"The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast"--

1472
01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:19.930
No, 'tis not so.

1473
01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:22.400
It begins with Pyrrhus:

1474
01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:30.130
"The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,

1475
01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:33.100
"Black as his purpose, did the night resemble

1476
01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:35.800
"When he lay couched in the ominous horse,

1477
01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.830
"Hath now this dread and black complexion

1478
01:13:38.830 --> 01:13:41.770
"smear'd With heraldry more dismal;

1479
01:13:41.770 --> 01:13:45.830
"head to foot Now is he total gules;

1480
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:48.100
"roasted in wrath and fire,

1481
01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.100
"And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,

1482
01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:54.430
"With eyes like carbuncles,

1483
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:59.370
the hellish Pyrrhus Old grandsire Priam seeks."

1484
01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.330
So proceed you.

1485
01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:06.070
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken,

1486
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:08.070
with good accent, good discretion.

1487
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:18.800
Anon he finds him Striking too short at Greeks;

1488
01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:21.800
his antique sword, Rebellious to his arm,

1489
01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.800
lies where it falls, Repugnant to command:

1490
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.700
unequal match'd, Pyrrhus at Priam drives;

1491
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.530
in rage strikes wide;

1492
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:34.700
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword

1493
01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.700
The unnerved father falls.

1494
01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:42.730
Then senseless Ilium, Seeming to feel this blow,

1495
01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:46.070
with flaming top Stoops to his base,

1496
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:50.130
and with a hideous crash Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

1497
01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:51.770
This is too long.

1498
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:56.030
It shall to the barber's with your beard.

1499
01:14:56.030 --> 01:15:00.070
Prithee, say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry,

1500
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:07.100
or he sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.

1501
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:14.130
But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--

1502
01:15:14.130 --> 01:15:16.070
The mobled queen?

1503
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:17.830
That's good; "mobled queen" is good.

1504
01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:18.970
Shh.

1505
01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:22.100
Run barefoot up and down,

1506
01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:25.170
threatening the flames With bisson rheum;

1507
01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:30.130
a clout upon that head Where late the diadem stood,

1508
01:15:30.130 --> 01:15:34.630
and for a robe, About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,

1509
01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:38.500
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up; Who this had seen,

1510
01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:41.070
with tongue in venom steep'd,

1511
01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:44.600
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounced.

1512
01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.670
But if the gods themselves did see her then

1513
01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:50.730
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport

1514
01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:54.430
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,

1515
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:58.130
The instant burst of clamour that she made,

1516
01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:01.600
Unless things mortal move them not at all,

1517
01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.830
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,

1518
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:11.870
And passion in the gods.

1519
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:13.170
Look, whether he has not turned his colour

1520
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:14.270
and has tears in his eyes.

1521
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.430
Prithee no more.

1522
01:16:20.530 --> 01:16:22.130
'Tis well.

1523
01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:29.370
I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.

1524
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:36.270
Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed?

1525
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:38.270
Do you hear, let them be well used;

1526
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:42.800
for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time:

1527
01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:47.100
after your death you were better have a bad epitaph

1528
01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:50.370
than their ill report while you live.

1529
01:16:50.370 --> 01:16:53.200
My lord, I shall use them according to their deserts.

1530
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:56.300
God's bodykins, man, much better.

1531
01:16:56.300 --> 01:17:04.270
Use every man after his desert, and who shall 'scape whipping?

1532
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:07.400
Use them after your own honour and dignity:

1533
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.400
the less they deserve,

1534
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.200
the more merit is in your bounty.

1535
01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:17.030
Take them in.

1536
01:17:18.170 --> 01:17:21.270
Come, sirs.

1537
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:25.830
Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.

1538
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:27.500
Dost thou hear me, old friend;

1539
01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:29.500
can you play "The Murder of Gonzago?"

1540
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.600
Ay, my lord.

1541
01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.870
We'll ha't to-morrow night.

1542
01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:33.170
You could, for a need,

1543
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:36.000
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines,

1544
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.830
which I would set down and insert in't, could you not?

1545
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:41.030
Ay, my lord.

1546
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:42.230
Very well.

1547
01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:46.170
Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.

1548
01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:53.030
My good friends...

1549
01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:57.370
I'll leave you till night.

1550
01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:59.600
You are welcome to Elsinore.

1551
01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.870
Good my lord!

1552
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:02.570
Ay, so.

1553
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:10.500
God buy you.

1554
01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:28.430
Now I am alone.

1555
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:42.800
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

1556
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:47.270
Is it not monstrous that this player here,

1557
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:52.130
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,

1558
01:18:52.130 --> 01:18:56.170
Could force his soul so to his own conceit

1559
01:18:56.170 --> 01:19:01.600
That from her working all his visage wann'd,

1560
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:05.900
Tears in his eyes, distractions in his aspect,

1561
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:10.200
A broken voice, and his whole function

1562
01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.970
suiting With forms to his conceit?

1563
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:16.430
And all for nothing!

1564
01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.170
For Hecuba!

1565
01:19:22.170 --> 01:19:25.300
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,

1566
01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:27.230
That he should weep for her?

1567
01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.770
What would he do

1568
01:19:30.770 --> 01:19:35.870
Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have?

1569
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:40.530
He would drown the stage with tears

1570
01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:44.530
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,

1571
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:47.500
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,

1572
01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.700
Confound the ignorant,

1573
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.330
and amaze indeed The very faculties

1574
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:53.230
of eyes and ears.

1575
01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:57.370
Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal,

1576
01:19:57.370 --> 01:20:01.770
peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,

1577
01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:12.300
And can say nothing; no, not for a king

1578
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.170
Upon whose property and most dear life

1579
01:20:14.170 --> 01:20:18.870
A damn'd defeat was made.

1580
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:21.730
Am I a coward?

1581
01:20:21.730 --> 01:20:24.630
Who calls me villain?

1582
01:20:24.630 --> 01:20:26.870
Breaks my pate across?

1583
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:29.200
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?

1584
01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.930
Tweaks me by the nose?

1585
01:20:30.930 --> 01:20:33.570
Gives me the lie i' the throat As deep as to the lungs?

1586
01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:34.770
Who does me this?

1587
01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:36.930
Ha!

1588
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:39.600
Ah, 'swounds, I should take it:

1589
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.400
for it cannot be But I am pigeon-liver'd

1590
01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.430
and lack gall To make oppression bitter,

1591
01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:46.370
or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites

1592
01:20:46.370 --> 01:20:47.670
With this slave's offal.

1593
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:57.770
Bloody, bawdy villain!

1594
01:20:57.770 --> 01:21:03.670
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!

1595
01:21:03.670 --> 01:21:07.270
O, vengeance!

1596
01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:18.500
Why, what an ass am I!

1597
01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:25.600
This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,

1598
01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.630
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,

1599
01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:30.400
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,

1600
01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:32.870
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A scullion!

1601
01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:34.070
Fie upon't!

1602
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:35.400
Foh!

1603
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:38.670
About my brain!

1604
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:52.770
I have heard That guilty creatures

1605
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:55.600
sitting at a play Have by the very cunning

1606
01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.900
of the scene Been struck so to the soul

1607
01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.430
that presently They have proclaim'd their malefactions;

1608
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:05.970
For murder, though it have no tongue,

1609
01:22:05.970 --> 01:22:09.670
will speak With most miraculous organ.

1610
01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:12.830
I'll have these players Play something like the murder

1611
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:14.430
of my father Before mine uncle.

1612
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.170
I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick.

1613
01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:22.870
If he but blench, I know my course.

1614
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:26.830
The spirit that I have seen May be a devil:

1615
01:22:26.830 --> 01:22:31.700
and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape;

1616
01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:39.930
yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy,

1617
01:22:39.930 --> 01:22:42.800
As he is very potent with such spirits,

1618
01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:51.600
Abuses me to damn me:

1619
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.300
I'll have grounds More relative than this.

1620
01:22:57.770 --> 01:23:00.330
The play's the thing

1621
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:08.400
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

1622
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:56.070
And can you, by no drift of conference

1623
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:59.400
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,

1624
01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.700
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet

1625
01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.770
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

1626
01:24:05.770 --> 01:24:08.000
He does confess he feels himself distracted;

1627
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.300
But from what cause will by no means speak.

1628
01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:13.430
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,

1629
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:16.570
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,

1630
01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:18.670
When we would bring him on to some confession

1631
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:20.070
Of his true state.

1632
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:21.630
Did he receive you well?

1633
01:24:21.630 --> 01:24:22.800
Most like a gentleman.

1634
01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.670
But with much forcing of his disposition.

1635
01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:26.530
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,

1636
01:24:26.530 --> 01:24:28.000
Most free in his reply.

1637
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.530
Did you assay him to any pastime?

1638
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:30.770
Madam, it so fell out

1639
01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:32.900
that certain players We o'er-raught on the way:

1640
01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.870
of these we told him; And there did seem in him

1641
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:36.300
a kind of joy To hear of it.

1642
01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:38.330
They are here about the court, And, as I think,

1643
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:40.770
they have already order This night to play before him.

1644
01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:42.070
This is most true.

1645
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:44.100
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties

1646
01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.600
To hear and see the matter.

1647
01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.800
With all my heart;

1648
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.770
and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined.

1649
01:24:50.770 --> 01:24:52.900
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,

1650
01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:55.100
And drive his purpose into these delights.

1651
01:24:55.100 --> 01:24:56.470
We shall, my lord.

1652
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:58.270
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;

1653
01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.230
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither

1654
01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:06.300
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here affront Ophelia.

1655
01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.470
Her father and myself, lawful espials,

1656
01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:11.330
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,

1657
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:13.200
We may of their encounter frankly judge,

1658
01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.200
And gather by him, as he is behaved,

1659
01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.370
If be the affliction of his love or no

1660
01:25:18.370 --> 01:25:20.970
That thus he suffers for.

1661
01:25:20.970 --> 01:25:22.170
I shall obey you.

1662
01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:28.130
And for your part, Ophelia,

1663
01:25:28.130 --> 01:25:29.730
I do wish That your good beauties

1664
01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:32.100
be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness.

1665
01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.230
So shall I hope your virtues

1666
01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:36.670
Will bring him to his wonted ways again,

1667
01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:38.630
To both your honours.

1668
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:41.400
Madam, I wish it may.

1669
01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:46.430
Ophelia, walk you here.

1670
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:49.330
Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.

1671
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:50.800
Read on this book

1672
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:54.170
That show of such an exercise may colour your loneliness.

1673
01:25:54.170 --> 01:25:56.530
We are oft to blame in this-- 'Tis too much proved--

1674
01:25:56.530 --> 01:25:58.600
that with devotion's visage And pious action

1675
01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.770
we do sugar o'er The devil himself.

1676
01:26:00.770 --> 01:26:02.500
O, 'tis too true!

1677
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:08.500
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!

1678
01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.900
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,

1679
01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:13.970
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

1680
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:18.270
Than is my deed to my most painted word.

1681
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:20.500
O heavy burden!

1682
01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:23.030
I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.

1683
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:06.200
To be, or not to be...

1684
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:11.330
That is the question:

1685
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.030
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

1686
01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:17.700
to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,

1687
01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:22.670
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

1688
01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:26.930
And by opposing end them?

1689
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:27.970
To die...

1690
01:27:32.170 --> 01:27:35.270
To sleep.

1691
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:40.930
No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache

1692
01:27:40.930 --> 01:27:45.900
and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to,

1693
01:27:45.900 --> 01:27:49.600
'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd.

1694
01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:53.700
To die, to sleep...

1695
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:03.130
To sleep: perchance to dream.

1696
01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:10.470
Ay, there's the rub;

1697
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:15.100
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come

1698
01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.530
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,

1699
01:28:17.530 --> 01:28:21.700
Must give us pause.

1700
01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:27.300
There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life;

1701
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:32.230
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,

1702
01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:37.930
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,

1703
01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:42.070
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,

1704
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:43.470
The insolence of office

1705
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:46.500
and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes,

1706
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:52.400
When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin?

1707
01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.270
Who would these fardels bear,

1708
01:28:56.270 --> 01:29:01.000
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,

1709
01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:07.630
But that the dread of something after death,

1710
01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:13.600
The undiscover'd country

1711
01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.670
from whose bourn No traveler returns,

1712
01:29:18.670 --> 01:29:21.800
puzzles the will

1713
01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:25.000
And makes us rather bear those ills we have

1714
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.230
Than fly to others that we know not of?

1715
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:35.800
Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all;

1716
01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:38.630
And thus the native hue of resolution

1717
01:29:38.630 --> 01:29:43.770
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,

1718
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:47.770
And enterprises of great pitch and moment

1719
01:29:47.770 --> 01:29:53.630
With this regard their currents turn awry,

1720
01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:56.170
And lose the name of action.

1721
01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:02.030
Soft you now!

1722
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:04.000
The fair Ophelia!

1723
01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:20.530
Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remember'd.

1724
01:30:20.530 --> 01:30:22.900
Good my lord,

1725
01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:25.030
How does your honour for this many a day?

1726
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:32.800
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

1727
01:30:34.030 --> 01:30:36.170
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,

1728
01:30:36.170 --> 01:30:39.230
That I have longed long to re-deliver;

1729
01:30:39.230 --> 01:30:40.600
I pray you, now receive them.

1730
01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:45.530
No, not I; I never gave you aught.

1731
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:49.330
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;

1732
01:30:49.330 --> 01:30:53.000
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed

1733
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:56.330
As made the things more rich.

1734
01:30:56.330 --> 01:31:00.730
Their perfume lost, Take these again;

1735
01:31:00.730 --> 01:31:05.500
for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor

1736
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:08.100
when givers prove unkind.

1737
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:09.200
There, my lord.

1738
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:11.100
Oh.

1739
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:13.400
Oh.

1740
01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.630
Are you honest?

1741
01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:15.730
My lord?

1742
01:31:15.730 --> 01:31:16.830
Are you fair?

1743
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:18.030
What means your lordship?

1744
01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:19.430
That if you be honest and fair,

1745
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:22.170
your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.

1746
01:31:22.170 --> 01:31:23.270
Could beauty, my lord,

1747
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:25.130
have better commerce than with honesty?

1748
01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:27.500
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty

1749
01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:31.500
will sooner transform honesty from what it is into a bawd

1750
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:33.830
than the force of honesty can translate beauty

1751
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:35.470
into his likeness.

1752
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:39.900
This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof.

1753
01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:47.230
I did love you once.

1754
01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:52.130
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

1755
01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:57.830
You should not have believed me;

1756
01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:01.370
for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock

1757
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:07.970
but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.

1758
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:10.000
I was the more deceived.

1759
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:16.170
Get thee to a nunnery.

1760
01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:18.330
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?

1761
01:32:21.930 --> 01:32:23.330
I am myself indifferent honest;

1762
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:25.070
but yet I could accuse me of such things

1763
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:27.930
that it were better my mother had not borne me:

1764
01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:32.970
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious,

1765
01:32:32.970 --> 01:32:34.230
with more offences at my beck

1766
01:32:34.230 --> 01:32:35.800
than I have thoughts to put them in,

1767
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:38.170
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in.

1768
01:32:38.170 --> 01:32:39.530
What should such fellows as I do

1769
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:41.630
crawling between earth and heaven?

1770
01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:44.630
We are arrant knaves, all; believe none of us.

1771
01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.030
Go thy ways to a nunnery.

1772
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:59.230
Where's your father?

1773
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.730
At home, my lord.

1774
01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:14.070
Let the doors be shut upon him

1775
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:19.600
that he may play the fool no where but in his own house.

1776
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.100
Farewell.

1777
01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.670
Help him, you sweet heavens!

1778
01:33:22.670 --> 01:33:25.600
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry:

1779
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:28.700
be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow,

1780
01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.100
thou shalt not escape calumny.

1781
01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.130
Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell.

1782
01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:36.330
Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool;

1783
01:33:36.330 --> 01:33:41.300
for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them.

1784
01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.230
To a nunnery, go, and quickly too.

1785
01:33:43.230 --> 01:33:44.330
Farewell.

1786
01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:46.470
Heavenly powers, restore him!

1787
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:48.700
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough;

1788
01:33:48.700 --> 01:33:52.000
God has given you one face; you make yourselves another.

1789
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.130
You jig, you amble, you lisp,

1790
01:33:54.130 --> 01:33:55.600
you nick-name God's creatures,

1791
01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.470
you make your wantonness your ignorance.

1792
01:33:57.470 --> 01:34:00.470
Go to, I'll no more on't.

1793
01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:11.300
It hath made me mad.

1794
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:22.000
I say, we will have no more marriages:

1795
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:26.970
those that are married already, all but one, shall live;

1796
01:34:26.970 --> 01:34:29.470
the rest shall keep as they are.

1797
01:34:32.370 --> 01:34:34.230
To a nunnery, go.

1798
01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:43.530
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!

1799
01:34:43.530 --> 01:34:49.900
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;

1800
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.670
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,

1801
01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:57.070
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,

1802
01:34:57.070 --> 01:35:03.930
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!

1803
01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:13.870
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched

1804
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:17.470
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,

1805
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:22.100
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,

1806
01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:28.700
Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh;

1807
01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:32.170
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth

1808
01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:36.930
Blasted with ecstasy:

1809
01:35:36.930 --> 01:35:40.800
O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen.

1810
01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:47.170
See what I see!

1811
01:35:53.730 --> 01:35:55.930
Love!

1812
01:35:55.930 --> 01:35:59.030
His affections do not that way tend;

1813
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:01.430
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,

1814
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:04.630
Was not like madness.

1815
01:36:04.630 --> 01:36:07.200
There's something in his soul

1816
01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.930
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;

1817
01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:11.700
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose

1818
01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:14.200
Will be some danger: which to prevent,

1819
01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.070
I have in quick determination set it down.

1820
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.500
He shall with speed to England

1821
01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:19.330
For the demand of our neglected tribute.

1822
01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:23.700
Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects

1823
01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:27.230
shall expel This something-settled matter

1824
01:36:27.230 --> 01:36:29.870
in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating

1825
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:31.400
puts him From fashion of himself.

1826
01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:32.500
What think you on't?

1827
01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.600
It shall do well:

1828
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:37.530
but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief

1829
01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:39.500
Sprung from neglected love.

1830
01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:41.230
How now, Ophelia!

1831
01:36:41.230 --> 01:36:43.100
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;

1832
01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.870
We heard it all.

1833
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:48.100
My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit,

1834
01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:51.130
after the play Let his queen mother

1835
01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:53.530
all alone entreat him To show his grief.

1836
01:36:53.530 --> 01:36:55.030
Let her be round with him;

1837
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:56.430
I'll be placed, so please you,

1838
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:58.670
in the ear Of all their conference.

1839
01:36:58.670 --> 01:37:01.530
If she find him not, To England send him,

1840
01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:06.200
or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.

1841
01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:07.430
It shall be so.

1842
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:14.230
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

1843
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:47.900
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,

1844
01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.230
trippingly on the tongue.

1845
01:37:50.230 --> 01:37:52.670
but if you mouth it, as many of your players do,

1846
01:37:52.670 --> 01:37:55.270
I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.

1847
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:58.930
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hands, thus,

1848
01:37:58.930 --> 01:38:01.270
but use all gently;

1849
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:04.030
for in the very torrent, tempest, and,

1850
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:07.600
as I may say, whirlwind of your passion,

1851
01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:09.400
you must acquire and beget a temperance

1852
01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.030
that may give it smoothness.

1853
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:12.830
I warrant your honour.

1854
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:15.130
Be not too tame neither,

1855
01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:17.900
but let your own discretion be your tutor.

1856
01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:21.470
Suit the action to the word, the word to the action;

1857
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:24.900
with this special observance do o'erstep not

1858
01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.200
the modesty of nature:

1859
01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:30.370
for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing,

1860
01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:33.270
whose end, both at the first and now

1861
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:37.300
was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature;

1862
01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:41.770
to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image,

1863
01:38:41.770 --> 01:38:47.330
and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.

1864
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:51.700
Now this overdone, or come tardy off,

1865
01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.500
though it make the unskillful laugh,

1866
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:56.400
cannot but make the judicious grieve;

1867
01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:58.630
the censure of the which one must in your allowance

1868
01:38:58.630 --> 01:39:00.900
outweigh a whole theatre of others.

1869
01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.100
Go, make you ready.

1870
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:09.230
How now, my lord!

1871
01:39:09.230 --> 01:39:11.600
Will the king hear this piece of work?

1872
01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.630
And the queen too, and that presently.

1873
01:39:13.630 --> 01:39:14.870
Bid the players make haste.

1874
01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.000
Will you two help to hasten them?

1875
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.070
We will, my lord.

1876
01:39:21.070 --> 01:39:23.370
What ho, Horatio!

1877
01:39:23.370 --> 01:39:25.770
Here, sweet lord, at your service.

1878
01:39:25.770 --> 01:39:27.400
Horatio...

1879
01:39:30.230 --> 01:39:31.730
Thou art e'en as just a man

1880
01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:34.170
As e'er my conversation coped withal.

1881
01:39:34.170 --> 01:39:35.300
O, my dear lord.

1882
01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.300
Nay, do not think I flatter;

1883
01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:39.170
For what advancement may I hope from thee

1884
01:39:39.170 --> 01:39:41.300
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits

1885
01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.270
To feed and clothe thee?

1886
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:46.830
Why should the poor be flatter'd?

1887
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:48.930
Dost thou hear?

1888
01:39:48.930 --> 01:39:51.270
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice

1889
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:53.370
And could of men distinguish,

1890
01:39:53.370 --> 01:39:56.700
her election Hath seal'd thee for herself;

1891
01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:59.470
for thou hast been As one, in suffering all,

1892
01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:01.300
that suffers nothing,

1893
01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:03.870
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards

1894
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:09.270
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those

1895
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:12.730
Whose blood and judgment are so well comeddled

1896
01:40:12.730 --> 01:40:14.930
That they are not a pipe for fortune's fingers

1897
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:18.930
To sound what stop she please.

1898
01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:23.400
Give me that man That is not passion's slave,

1899
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:26.670
and I will wear him In my heart's core,

1900
01:40:26.670 --> 01:40:32.070
ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee.

1901
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.470
Something too much of this.

1902
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:40.130
There is a play to-night before the king;

1903
01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:42.400
One scene of it comes near the circumstance

1904
01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.770
Which I have told thee of my father's death:

1905
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:47.730
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,

1906
01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:49.400
Even with the very comment of thy soul

1907
01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:52.600
Observe my uncle: if his occulted guilt

1908
01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:55.200
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,

1909
01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:57.500
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,

1910
01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:01.830
And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy.

1911
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:03.600
Well, my lord:

1912
01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.770
If he steal aught whilst this play is playing

1913
01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:08.730
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

1914
01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:12.170
They are coming to the play;

1915
01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:16.270
I must be idle. Get you a place.

1916
01:41:26.930 --> 01:41:27.970
Ah.

1917
01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.330
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

1918
01:41:33.330 --> 01:41:37.000
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish:

1919
01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.100
I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

1920
01:41:43.970 --> 01:41:46.870
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet;

1921
01:41:46.870 --> 01:41:48.170
these words are not mine.

1922
01:41:48.170 --> 01:41:50.370
No, nor mine now.

1923
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:58.430
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

1924
01:41:58.430 --> 01:42:01.570
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

1925
01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:04.330
What did you enact?

1926
01:42:04.330 --> 01:42:09.270
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed in the Capitol.

1927
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:11.170
Brutus killed me.

1928
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:15.800
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.

1929
01:42:19.130 --> 01:42:20.300
Be the players ready?

1930
01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.170
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

1931
01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:25.670
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

1932
01:42:25.670 --> 01:42:30.970
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

1933
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:32.530
O, ho! Do you mark that?

1934
01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:34.300
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

1935
01:42:34.300 --> 01:42:35.930
No, my lord.

1936
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:39.270
I mean, my head upon your lap?

1937
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:40.870
Ay, my lord.

1938
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:43.530
Do you think I meant country matters?

1939
01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:45.430
I think nothing, my lord.

1940
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:48.000
That's a fair thought to lie between maid's legs.

1941
01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.100
What is't, my lord?

1942
01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:50.200
Nothing.

1943
01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:51.300
You are merry, my lord.

1944
01:42:51.300 --> 01:42:52.400
Who, I?

1945
01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.500
Ay, my lord.

1946
01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:55.200
O God, your only jig-maker.

1947
01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:57.030
What should a man do but be merry?

1948
01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:59.770
For, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks,

1949
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:04.230
and my father died within these two hours.

1950
01:43:04.230 --> 01:43:06.200
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

1951
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.900
So long?

1952
01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:09.970
Nay then, let the devil wear black,

1953
01:43:09.970 --> 01:43:11.700
for I'll have a suit of sables.

1954
01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:14.000
O heavens!

1955
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.230
Died two months and not forgotten yet?

1956
01:43:17.230 --> 01:43:19.530
Then there's hope a great man's memory

1957
01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:22.830
may outlive his life half a year.

1958
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:17.000
What means this, my lord?

1959
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:21.170
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

1960
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:25.100
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

1961
01:46:25.100 --> 01:46:26.970
We shall know by this fellow:

1962
01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:29.470
the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.

1963
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:35.000
For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency,

1964
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.500
We beg your hearing patiently.

1965
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:40.600
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

1966
01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.700
'Tis brief, my lord.

1967
01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:44.170
As woman's love.

1968
01:46:45.370 --> 01:46:47.500
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart

1969
01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:51.830
gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,

1970
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:54.630
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen

1971
01:46:54.630 --> 01:46:58.100
About the world have times twelve thirties been,

1972
01:46:58.100 --> 01:47:02.200
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual

1973
01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.530
in most sacred bands.

1974
01:47:04.530 --> 01:47:07.100
So many journeys may the sun and moon

1975
01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:11.230
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!

1976
01:47:11.230 --> 01:47:16.200
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,

1977
01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:19.070
So far from cheer and from your former state,

1978
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:21.130
That I distrust you.

1979
01:47:21.130 --> 01:47:22.870
Yet, though I distrust,

1980
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:25.270
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:

1981
01:47:25.270 --> 01:47:27.470
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;

1982
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:30.930
My operant powers their functions leave to do:

1983
01:47:30.930 --> 01:47:34.500
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,

1984
01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.970
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind

1985
01:47:37.970 --> 01:47:39.470
For husband shalt thou--

1986
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:41.700
O, confound the rest!

1987
01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:45.470
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:

1988
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:47.970
In second husband let me be accurst!

1989
01:47:47.970 --> 01:47:50.400
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

1990
01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.300
Wormwood, wormwood.

1991
01:47:52.300 --> 01:47:54.500
The instances that second marriage move

1992
01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:58.870
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.

1993
01:47:58.870 --> 01:48:01.300
A second time I kill my husband dead,

1994
01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:03.770
When second husband kisses me in bed.

1995
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:05.770
I do believe you think what now you speak;

1996
01:48:05.770 --> 01:48:09.030
But what we do determine oft we break.

1997
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:11.100
Purpose is but the slave to memory,

1998
01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:15.200
Of violent birth but poor validity;

1999
01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:18.670
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;

2000
01:48:18.670 --> 01:48:22.270
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

2001
01:48:22.270 --> 01:48:26.830
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!

2002
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:29.600
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!

2003
01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.470
To desperation turn my trust and hope!

2004
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:35.270
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!

2005
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:37.700
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy

2006
01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:40.430
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!

2007
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:43.670
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,

2008
01:48:43.670 --> 01:48:46.100
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

2009
01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:48.200
If she should break it now!

2010
01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.530
'Tis deeply sworn.

2011
01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:01.070
Sweet, leave me here awhile; My spirits grow dull,

2012
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:04.630
and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep.

2013
01:49:05.630 --> 01:49:08.570
Sleep rock thy brain,

2014
01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:12.400
And never come mischance between us twain!

2015
01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:25.000
Madam, how like you this play?

2016
01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:29.130
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

2017
01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:32.400
O, but she'll keep her word.

2018
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.530
Have you heard the argument?

2019
01:49:34.530 --> 01:49:35.870
Is there no offence in 't?

2020
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:37.500
No, no, they do but jest,

2021
01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.800
poison in jest; no offence i' the world.

2022
01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.900
What do you call the play?

2023
01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:44.270
"The Mouse-trap."

2024
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:45.370
Marry, how?

2025
01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:46.700
Tropically.

2026
01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:49.300
This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna:

2027
01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:51.930
Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista:

2028
01:49:51.930 --> 01:49:54.900
you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work.

2029
01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:56.200
But what o' that?

2030
01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:59.030
Your majesty and we that have free souls,

2031
01:49:59.030 --> 01:50:00.300
it touches us not.

2032
01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:05.300
Let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung.

2033
01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:09.330
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

2034
01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:10.900
Begin, murderer.

2035
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:16.900
Pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin.

2036
01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:21.930
Come: "the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge."

2037
01:50:21.930 --> 01:50:27.530
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;

2038
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:30.900
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;

2039
01:50:30.900 --> 01:50:34.430
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,

2040
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:38.830
With Hecat's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,

2041
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:41.500
Thy natural magic and dire property

2042
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:45.700
On wholesome life usurps immediately.

2043
01:50:45.700 --> 01:50:47.300
Ah!

2044
01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:50.730
He poisons him i' the garden for his estate.

2045
01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:52.030
His name's Gonzago.

2046
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:54.300
The story is extant and writ in choice Italian.

2047
01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:55.470
You shall see anon

2048
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:59.430
how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

2049
01:50:59.430 --> 01:51:00.700
The king rises.

2050
01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.870
What, frighted with false fire!

2051
01:51:02.870 --> 01:51:04.170
How fares my lord?

2052
01:51:04.170 --> 01:51:05.330
Give o'er the play.

2053
01:51:07.170 --> 01:51:09.330
Give me some light.

2054
01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:30.230
Away!

2055
01:51:30.230 --> 01:51:32.730
Lights, lights, lights!

2056
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:40.930
Why,

2057
01:51:40.930 --> 01:51:43.800
Let the stricken deer go weep,

2058
01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:46.730
The hart ungalled play;

2059
01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:50.370
For some must watch while some must sleep:

2060
01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:54.070
Thus runs the world away.

2061
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:55.330
O good Horatio,

2062
01:51:55.330 --> 01:51:58.370
I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound.

2063
01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:59.500
Didst perceive?

2064
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:00.670
Very well, my lord.

2065
01:52:00.670 --> 01:52:02.900
Upon the talk of the poisoning?

2066
01:52:02.900 --> 01:52:05.070
I did very well note him.

2067
01:52:05.070 --> 01:52:07.570
Ah, ha!

2068
01:52:07.570 --> 01:52:08.670
Come, some music!

2069
01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:10.130
Come, the recorders!

2070
01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:12.130
For if the king like not the comedy,

2071
01:52:12.130 --> 01:52:15.430
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.

2072
01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:16.670
Come, some music!

2073
01:52:16.670 --> 01:52:18.670
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

2074
01:52:18.670 --> 01:52:19.770
Sir, the whole history.

2075
01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:20.870
The king, sir.

2076
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:22.630
Ay, sir, what of him?

2077
01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:24.600
Is in his retirement marvelous distempered.

2078
01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.700
With drink, sir?

2079
01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:27.170
No, my lord, rather with choler.

2080
01:52:27.170 --> 01:52:28.570
Your wisdom should show itself

2081
01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:30.430
more richer to signify this to his doctor;

2082
01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:32.100
for, for me to put him to his purgation

2083
01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:34.570
would perhaps plunge him into far more choler.

2084
01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:37.470
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame

2085
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:42.030
and start not so wildly from my affair.

2086
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:45.600
I am tame, sir. Pronounce.

2087
01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.400
The queen, your mother,

2088
01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:50.830
in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.

2089
01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.970
You are welcome.

2090
01:52:54.970 --> 01:52:56.100
Nay, good my lord,

2091
01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:58.230
this courtesy is not of the right breed.

2092
01:52:58.230 --> 01:53:00.300
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer,

2093
01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:02.130
I will do your mother's commandment:

2094
01:53:02.130 --> 01:53:03.500
if not, your pardon and my return

2095
01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:04.700
shall be the end of my business.

2096
01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.330
Sir, I cannot.

2097
01:53:08.530 --> 01:53:10.270
What, my lord?

2098
01:53:10.270 --> 01:53:14.630
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased:

2099
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:16.700
but, sir, such answer as I can make,

2100
01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:17.870
you shall command;

2101
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:19.430
or, rather, as you say, my mother.

2102
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:20.530
Therefore no more, but to the matter:

2103
01:53:20.530 --> 01:53:22.730
my mother, you say--

2104
01:53:22.730 --> 01:53:24.230
Then thus she says;

2105
01:53:24.230 --> 01:53:27.830
your behavior hath struck her into amazement and admiration.

2106
01:53:27.830 --> 01:53:31.430
O wonderful son that can so astonish a mother!

2107
01:53:31.430 --> 01:53:32.770
Is there no sequel

2108
01:53:32.770 --> 01:53:34.970
at the heels of this mother's admiration?

2109
01:53:34.970 --> 01:53:36.300
Impart.

2110
01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:38.230
She desires to speak with you in her closet,

2111
01:53:38.230 --> 01:53:40.670
ere you go to bed.

2112
01:53:40.670 --> 01:53:44.470
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother.

2113
01:53:44.470 --> 01:53:46.970
Have you any further trade with us?

2114
01:53:46.970 --> 01:53:49.900
My lord, you once did love me.

2115
01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:53.970
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.

2116
01:53:53.970 --> 01:53:59.330
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper?

2117
01:53:59.330 --> 01:54:01.630
You do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty

2118
01:54:01.630 --> 01:54:03.770
if you deny your griefs to your friend.

2119
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:08.230
Sir, I lack advancement.

2120
01:54:08.230 --> 01:54:11.800
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself

2121
01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:13.770
for your succession in Denmark?

2122
01:54:13.770 --> 01:54:17.570
Ay, truly but "While the grass grows"--

2123
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:19.430
The proverb is something musty.

2124
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:21.370
Ah, the recorders!

2125
01:54:21.370 --> 01:54:22.630
Let me see one.

2126
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:27.030
To withdraw with you.

2127
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:29.570
Why do you go about to recover the wind of me

2128
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:31.600
as if you would drive me into a toil?

2129
01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:35.030
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold,

2130
01:54:35.030 --> 01:54:37.000
my love is too unmannerly.

2131
01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.630
I do not well understand that.

2132
01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:40.330
Will you play upon this pipe?

2133
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:42.930
My lord, I cannot.

2134
01:54:42.930 --> 01:54:44.030
I pray you.

2135
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:45.130
Believe me, I cannot.

2136
01:54:45.130 --> 01:54:46.230
I do beseech you.

2137
01:54:46.230 --> 01:54:47.500
I know no touch of it, my lord.

2138
01:54:47.500 --> 01:54:48.870
It is as easy as lying.

2139
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:51.170
Govern these ventages with your lingers and thumb,

2140
01:54:51.170 --> 01:54:52.570
give it breath with your mouth,

2141
01:54:52.570 --> 01:54:54.670
and it will discourse most eloquent music.

2142
01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:56.770
Look you, these are the stops.

2143
01:54:56.770 --> 01:54:59.230
But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony;

2144
01:54:59.230 --> 01:55:00.700
I have not the skill.

2145
01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:03.730
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me!

2146
01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:06.730
You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops.

2147
01:55:06.730 --> 01:55:08.800
You would pluck out the heart of my mystery.

2148
01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:11.000
You would sound me from my lowest note

2149
01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.130
to the top of my compass.

2150
01:55:12.130 --> 01:55:13.970
And there is much music, excellent voice,

2151
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:19.200
in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak.

2152
01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:22.570
'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on

2153
01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:24.530
than a pipe?

2154
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:26.230
Call me what instrument you will,

2155
01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:29.900
though you can fret me, yet you cannot play upon me.

2156
01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:31.600
God bless you, sir!

2157
01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:34.030
My lord, the queen would speak with you and presently.

2158
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:35.770
Do you see yonder cloud

2159
01:55:35.770 --> 01:55:38.530
that's almost in shape of a camel?

2160
01:55:38.530 --> 01:55:41.430
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.

2161
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:44.430
Methinks it's like a weasel.

2162
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:45.730
It is backed like a weasel.

2163
01:55:45.730 --> 01:55:47.430
Or a whale?

2164
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:48.570
Very like a whale.

2165
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:50.230
Then I will come to my mother by and by.

2166
01:55:50.230 --> 01:55:51.900
They fool me to the top of my bent.

2167
01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:54.230
I will come by and by.

2168
01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:55.370
I will say so.

2169
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:58.500
By and by is easily said.

2170
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.100
Leave me, friends.

2171
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:32.400
'Tis now the very witching time of night When churchyards yawn

2172
01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:39.030
and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world.

2173
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:52.430
Now could I drink hot blood And do such bitter business

2174
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:58.030
as the day Would quake to look upon.

2175
01:56:58.030 --> 01:57:00.270
Soft!

2176
01:57:00.270 --> 01:57:02.970
Now to my mother.

2177
01:57:02.970 --> 01:57:06.500
O heart, lose not thy nature;

2178
01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:09.630
let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.

2179
01:57:09.630 --> 01:57:11.830
Let me be cruel, not unnatural.

2180
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:16.500
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;

2181
01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.830
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;

2182
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:23.530
How in my words soever she be shent,

2183
01:57:23.530 --> 01:57:30.770
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

2184
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:38.730
I like him not.

2185
01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:46.230
Nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range.

2186
01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:50.630
Therefore prepare you;

2187
01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:52.200
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,

2188
01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:53.830
And he to England shall along with you:

2189
01:57:56.970 --> 01:58:00.400
The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near

2190
01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:05.700
as doth hourly grow Out of his brows.

2191
01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:08.630
We will ourselves provide.

2192
01:58:08.630 --> 01:58:12.370
Most holy and religious fear it is

2193
01:58:12.370 --> 01:58:14.370
To keep those many, many bodies safe

2194
01:58:14.370 --> 01:58:16.670
That live and feed upon your majesty.

2195
01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:20.000
The cease of majesty Dies not alone;

2196
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.900
but, like a gulf, doth draw What's near it with it.

2197
01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:24.500
It is a massy wheel,

2198
01:58:24.500 --> 01:58:26.330
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,

2199
01:58:26.330 --> 01:58:29.330
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things

2200
01:58:29.330 --> 01:58:31.430
Are mortised and adjoin'd;

2201
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:34.330
which, when it falls, Each small annexment,

2202
01:58:34.330 --> 01:58:37.930
petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin.

2203
01:58:37.930 --> 01:58:42.370
Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

2204
01:58:45.670 --> 01:58:48.770
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;

2205
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:51.500
For we will fetters put about this fear,

2206
01:58:51.500 --> 01:58:54.100
Which now goes too free-footed.

2207
01:58:54.100 --> 01:58:55.200
We will haste us.

2208
01:59:01.770 --> 01:59:06.370
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.

2209
01:59:06.370 --> 01:59:08.100
Behind the arras I'll convey myself

2210
01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:09.500
To hear the process.

2211
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:12.170
Fare you well, my liege:

2212
01:59:12.170 --> 01:59:13.700
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed

2213
01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:14.970
And tell you what I know.

2214
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:19.730
Thanks, good my lord.

2215
01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:34.930
My offence is rank; it smells to heaven;

2216
01:59:34.930 --> 01:59:42.330
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, A brother's murder.

2217
01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:46.670
Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will:

2218
01:59:46.670 --> 01:59:48.700
My strongest guilt defeats my strong intent;

2219
01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:50.170
And, like a man to double business bound,

2220
01:59:50.170 --> 01:59:51.770
I stand in pause where I shall first begin

2221
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:54.870
And both neglect.

2222
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:56.030
What if this cursed hand

2223
01:59:56.030 --> 01:59:57.930
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,

2224
01:59:57.930 --> 01:59:59.500
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens

2225
01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:02.130
To wash it white as snow?

2226
02:00:02.130 --> 02:00:03.270
Whereto serves mercy

2227
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:05.570
But to confront the visage of offence?

2228
02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:06.970
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,

2229
02:00:06.970 --> 02:00:08.470
To be forestalled ere we come to fall

2230
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:10.400
Or pardon'd being down?

2231
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.300
Then I'll look up; My fault is past.

2232
02:00:15.300 --> 02:00:20.470
But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn?

2233
02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:22.900
"Forgive me my foul murder"?

2234
02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:24.430
That cannot be;

2235
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:25.730
since I am still possess'd Of those effects

2236
02:00:25.730 --> 02:00:26.930
for which I did the murder,

2237
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:33.600
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.

2238
02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:37.300
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?

2239
02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:39.100
In the corrupted currents of this world

2240
02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:41.930
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice

2241
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:44.000
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself

2242
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:49.530
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;

2243
02:00:49.530 --> 02:00:51.770
There is no shuffling,

2244
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:53.730
there the action lies In his true nature;

2245
02:00:53.730 --> 02:00:55.000
and we ourselves compell'd,

2246
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.970
Even in the teeth and forehead of our faults,

2247
02:00:56.970 --> 02:00:59.270
To give in evidence.

2248
02:00:59.270 --> 02:01:02.030
What then?

2249
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:04.570
What rests?

2250
02:01:04.570 --> 02:01:08.970
Try what repentance can: what can it not?

2251
02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:12.330
What can it when one cannot repent?

2252
02:01:14.770 --> 02:01:18.700
O wretched state!

2253
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:21.730
O bosom black as death!

2254
02:01:21.730 --> 02:01:25.800
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,

2255
02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:27.630
Art more engaged!

2256
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:36.770
Help, angels!

2257
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:40.270
Make assay!

2258
02:01:40.270 --> 02:01:42.200
Bow, stubborn knees.

2259
02:01:46.730 --> 02:01:52.870
And heart with strings of steel,

2260
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:56.400
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!

2261
02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:06.770
All may be well.

2262
02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:22.770
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;

2263
02:02:22.770 --> 02:02:24.270
And now I'll do't.

2264
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:37.530
And so he goes to heaven; And so am I revenged.

2265
02:02:37.530 --> 02:02:40.770
That would be scann'd: A villain kills my father;

2266
02:02:40.770 --> 02:02:42.870
and for that, I, his sole son,

2267
02:02:42.870 --> 02:02:47.000
do this same villain send To heaven.

2268
02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.030
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

2269
02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:56.270
He took my father grossly, full of bread;

2270
02:02:56.270 --> 02:03:01.030
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;

2271
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:02.830
And am I then avenged

2272
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:05.030
To take him in the purging of his soul,

2273
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:08.970
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?

2274
02:03:08.970 --> 02:03:11.730
No!

2275
02:03:11.730 --> 02:03:13.730
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:

2276
02:03:13.730 --> 02:03:17.700
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,

2277
02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:19.770
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;

2278
02:03:19.770 --> 02:03:22.170
At game, at swearing, or about some act

2279
02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:25.270
That has no relish of salvation in't;

2280
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:30.300
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven

2281
02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:34.430
And his soul may be as damn'd and black As hell,

2282
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:37.330
whereto it goes.

2283
02:03:37.330 --> 02:03:39.070
My mother stays:

2284
02:03:41.770 --> 02:03:46.070
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

2285
02:03:56.170 --> 02:04:01.870
My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.

2286
02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:09.670
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

2287
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:24.600
He comes straight.

2288
02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:26.800
Look you lay home to him.

2289
02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:28.600
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with

2290
02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:29.800
And that your grace hath screen'd

2291
02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:32.200
and stood between Much heat and him.

2292
02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:34.270
I'll silence me even here.

2293
02:04:34.270 --> 02:04:35.500
Pray you, be round with him.

2294
02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:36.630
I'll warrant you.

2295
02:04:36.630 --> 02:04:37.770
Mother!

2296
02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:39.630
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

2297
02:04:39.630 --> 02:04:41.100
Mother?

2298
02:04:44.530 --> 02:04:51.370
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

2299
02:04:51.370 --> 02:04:53.970
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

2300
02:04:53.970 --> 02:04:57.800
Mother, you have my father much offended.

2301
02:04:57.800 --> 02:04:59.730
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

2302
02:04:59.730 --> 02:05:02.330
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

2303
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:03.470
Why, how now, Hamlet!

2304
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:04.700
What's the matter now?

2305
02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:06.030
Have thou forgot me?

2306
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:07.330
No, by the rood, not so:

2307
02:05:07.330 --> 02:05:10.770
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;

2308
02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:19.100
And--would it were not so!-- you are my mother.

2309
02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:21.600
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

2310
02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:22.930
Come, come, and sit you down;

2311
02:05:22.930 --> 02:05:24.370
you shall not budge;

2312
02:05:24.370 --> 02:05:25.870
You go not till I set you up a glass

2313
02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:28.370
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

2314
02:05:28.370 --> 02:05:29.630
What wilt thou do?

2315
02:05:29.630 --> 02:05:30.870
Thou wilt not murder me?

2316
02:05:30.870 --> 02:05:32.470
Help, help, ho!

2317
02:05:32.470 --> 02:05:33.830
Help, help, help!

2318
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:35.370
Now? A rat?

2319
02:05:35.370 --> 02:05:38.870
Dead, for a ducat, dead!

2320
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:40.500
O, I am slain!

2321
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:42.530
O me, what hast thou done?

2322
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:44.530
Nay, I know not: Is it the king?

2323
02:05:44.530 --> 02:05:46.870
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

2324
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:47.970
A bloody deed!

2325
02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:49.270
Almost as bad, good mother,

2326
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:51.470
As kill a king and marry with his brother.

2327
02:05:51.470 --> 02:05:53.000
As kill a king!

2328
02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.430
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

2329
02:05:59.330 --> 02:06:03.200
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool!

2330
02:06:06.970 --> 02:06:08.600
Farewell.

2331
02:06:11.770 --> 02:06:16.730
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;

2332
02:06:16.730 --> 02:06:21.130
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.

2333
02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.530
Leave wringing of your hands: peace!

2334
02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:30.630
Sit you down, And let me wring your heart;

2335
02:06:30.630 --> 02:06:33.600
for so I shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff,

2336
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:35.830
If damned custom have not brass'd it

2337
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:37.830
so That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

2338
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:39.270
What have I done

2339
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:42.500
that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me?

2340
02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:45.400
Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,

2341
02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:48.400
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose

2342
02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.300
From the fair forehead of an innocent love

2343
02:06:50.300 --> 02:06:51.600
And sets a blister there,

2344
02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:55.200
makes marriage-vows As false as dicers' oaths.

2345
02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:57.530
Ay me, what act That roars so loud

2346
02:06:57.530 --> 02:06:59.730
and thunders in the index?

2347
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:04.000
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,

2348
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.870
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.

2349
02:07:07.870 --> 02:07:12.170
See, what a grace was seated on this brow; Hyperion's curls;

2350
02:07:12.170 --> 02:07:16.100
the front of Jove himself; An eye like Mars,

2351
02:07:16.100 --> 02:07:18.170
to threaten and command;

2352
02:07:18.170 --> 02:07:20.170
A station like the herald Mercury

2353
02:07:20.170 --> 02:07:22.830
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;

2354
02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:26.170
A combination and a form indeed,

2355
02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:29.800
Where every god did seem to set his seal,

2356
02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:33.670
To give the world assurance of a man:

2357
02:07:33.670 --> 02:07:38.870
This was your husband.

2358
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:41.430
Look you now, what follows:

2359
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:44.270
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,

2360
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:45.730
Blasting his wholesome brother.

2361
02:07:45.730 --> 02:07:46.970
Have you eyes?

2362
02:07:46.970 --> 02:07:49.000
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,

2363
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.470
And batten on this moor?

2364
02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:51.730
Ha!

2365
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:53.830
Have you eyes?

2366
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:55.670
You cannot call it love;

2367
02:07:55.670 --> 02:07:58.900
for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame.

2368
02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.370
It's humble And waits upon the judgment:

2369
02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:04.030
and what judgment Would step from this to this?

2370
02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:06.400
Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion;

2371
02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:08.570
but sure, that sense Is apoplex'd;

2372
02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:10.400
for madness would not err,

2373
02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:12.530
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd

2374
02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:15.130
But it reserved some quantity of choice

2375
02:08:15.130 --> 02:08:17.330
To serve in such a difference.

2376
02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:20.500
What devil was't That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?

2377
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:21.600
O shame!

2378
02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:23.200
Where is thy blush?

2379
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:26.870
Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,

2380
02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:29.270
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax

2381
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:31.370
And melt in its own fire.

2382
02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:32.970
Proclaim no shame

2383
02:08:32.970 --> 02:08:35.400
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,

2384
02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:38.130
Since frost itself as actively doth burn

2385
02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:40.800
And reason panders will.

2386
02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:42.570
O Hamlet, speak no more:

2387
02:08:42.570 --> 02:08:46.100
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;

2388
02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:49.070
And there I see such black and grained spots

2389
02:08:49.070 --> 02:08:51.600
As will not leave their tinct.

2390
02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:54.600
Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,

2391
02:08:54.600 --> 02:08:59.500
Stew'd in corruption, honeying, making love

2392
02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:01.100
Over the nasty sty--

2393
02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:03.400
O, Hamlet speak no more;

2394
02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.770
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ear;

2395
02:09:05.770 --> 02:09:08.000
No more, sweet Hamlet!

2396
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:09.800
A murderer and a villain;

2397
02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:11.730
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe

2398
02:09:11.730 --> 02:09:14.400
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;

2399
02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:17.330
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,

2400
02:09:17.330 --> 02:09:20.100
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,

2401
02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:21.670
And put it in his pocket!

2402
02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:22.770
No more!

2403
02:09:22.770 --> 02:09:25.370
A king of shreds and patches--

2404
02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:35.470
Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,

2405
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:37.570
You heavenly guards!

2406
02:09:37.570 --> 02:09:39.870
What would your gracious figure?

2407
02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:42.900
Alas, he's mad!

2408
02:09:42.900 --> 02:09:45.770
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,

2409
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:48.470
That, lapsed in time and passion,

2410
02:09:48.470 --> 02:09:54.000
lets go by The important acting of your dread command?

2411
02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:55.930
O, say!

2412
02:09:55.930 --> 02:09:57.730
Do not forget:

2413
02:09:57.730 --> 02:10:01.870
this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.

2414
02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:06.300
But look.

2415
02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.730
Amazement on thy mother sits.

2416
02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:16.430
O, step between her and her fighting soul:

2417
02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:17.730
Speak to her, Hamlet.

2418
02:10:19.670 --> 02:10:23.100
How is it with you, lady?

2419
02:10:23.100 --> 02:10:27.200
Alas, how is't with you,

2420
02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:30.030
That you do bend your eye on vacancy

2421
02:10:30.030 --> 02:10:34.470
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?

2422
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:35.700
Whereon do you look?

2423
02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:38.100
On him, on him!

2424
02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:40.930
Look you, how pale he glares!

2425
02:10:40.930 --> 02:10:45.100
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,

2426
02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:46.970
Would make them capable.

2427
02:10:46.970 --> 02:10:49.270
Do not look upon me;

2428
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:52.270
Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects:

2429
02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:56.000
then what I have to do Will want true colour;

2430
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.870
tears perchance for blood.

2431
02:10:58.930 --> 02:11:01.930
To whom do you speak this?

2432
02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:06.370
Do you see nothing there?

2433
02:11:06.370 --> 02:11:10.430
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

2434
02:11:10.430 --> 02:11:13.200
Nor did you nothing hear?

2435
02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.970
No, nothing but ourselves.

2436
02:11:15.970 --> 02:11:19.330
Why, look you there!

2437
02:11:19.330 --> 02:11:22.430
Look, how it steals away!

2438
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:27.200
My father, in his habit as he lived!

2439
02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:30.530
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

2440
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:33.430
This is the very coinage of your brain:

2441
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:37.930
This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.

2442
02:11:43.230 --> 02:11:46.170
Ecstasy!

2443
02:11:46.170 --> 02:11:50.570
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,

2444
02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:53.930
And makes as healthful music:

2445
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:57.970
it is not madness That I have utter'd:

2446
02:11:57.970 --> 02:11:59.670
bring me to the test,

2447
02:11:59.670 --> 02:12:04.430
And I the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from.

2448
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:07.430
Mother, for love of grace,

2449
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:11.670
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul,

2450
02:12:11.670 --> 02:12:15.600
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:

2451
02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:19.500
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,

2452
02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:22.030
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,

2453
02:12:22.030 --> 02:12:24.900
Infects unseen.

2454
02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:28.130
Confess yourself to heaven;

2455
02:12:28.130 --> 02:12:32.570
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;

2456
02:12:32.570 --> 02:12:35.430
And do not spread the compost on the weeds

2457
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:37.870
To make them ranker.

2458
02:12:37.870 --> 02:12:42.730
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

2459
02:12:44.530 --> 02:12:48.970
O, throw away the worser part of it

2460
02:12:48.970 --> 02:12:53.070
And live the purer with the other half.

2461
02:12:53.070 --> 02:12:58.200
Good night: but go not to my uncle's bed;

2462
02:13:03.870 --> 02:13:08.670
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.

2463
02:13:08.670 --> 02:13:11.730
Refrain to-night.

2464
02:13:11.730 --> 02:13:13.430
That shall lend a kind of easiness

2465
02:13:13.430 --> 02:13:16.430
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;

2466
02:13:19.930 --> 02:13:23.330
Once more, good night:

2467
02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:26.300
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,

2468
02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:28.570
I'll blessing beg of you.

2469
02:13:33.230 --> 02:13:38.930
For this same lord, I do repent:

2470
02:13:38.930 --> 02:13:40.100
but heaven hath pleased it so

2471
02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:41.700
To punish me with this and this with me,

2472
02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:47.230
That I must be their scourge and minister.

2473
02:13:47.230 --> 02:13:49.670
I will bestow him,

2474
02:13:49.670 --> 02:13:52.430
and will answer well The death I gave him.

2475
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:53.930
So, again, good night.

2476
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:59.400
I must be cruel, only to be kind.

2477
02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:03.100
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.

2478
02:14:12.700 --> 02:14:16.000
One word more, good lady.

2479
02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.870
What shall I do?

2480
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:21.800
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:

2481
02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:24.430
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;

2482
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:28.430
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;

2483
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:31.970
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,

2484
02:14:31.970 --> 02:14:35.370
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,

2485
02:14:35.370 --> 02:14:38.970
Make you to ravel all this matter out,

2486
02:14:38.970 --> 02:14:51.530
That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft.

2487
02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:53.700
'Twere good you let him know.

2488
02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:57.970
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath

2489
02:14:57.970 --> 02:15:00.300
And breath of life,

2490
02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:05.670
I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.

2491
02:15:05.670 --> 02:15:09.430
I must to England; you know that?

2492
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:13.600
Alack, I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

2493
02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:16.600
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,

2494
02:15:16.600 --> 02:15:20.200
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,

2495
02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:22.370
They bear the mandate;

2496
02:15:22.370 --> 02:15:25.800
They must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery.

2497
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:32.370
Let it work; For 'tis the sport

2498
02:15:32.370 --> 02:15:36.430
to have the engineer Hoist with his own petard:

2499
02:15:36.430 --> 02:15:38.170
and it shall go hard,

2500
02:15:38.170 --> 02:15:41.870
But I will delve one yard below their mines,

2501
02:15:41.870 --> 02:15:47.100
And blow them at the moon.

2502
02:15:47.100 --> 02:15:50.670
O, 'tis most sweet,

2503
02:15:50.670 --> 02:15:56.770
When in one line two crafts directly meet.

2504
02:15:56.770 --> 02:15:58.070
This man shall set me packing:

2505
02:15:58.070 --> 02:15:59.930
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.

2506
02:16:02.270 --> 02:16:08.200
Mother, good night.

2507
02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:11.970
Indeed this counselor Is now most still,

2508
02:16:11.970 --> 02:16:15.630
most secret and most grave,

2509
02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:26.970
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.

2510
02:16:26.970 --> 02:16:33.230
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.

2511
02:16:33.230 --> 02:16:34.970
Good night, mother.

2512
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:43.330
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:

2513
02:16:43.330 --> 02:16:47.530
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.

2514
02:16:47.530 --> 02:16:48.600
Where is your son?

2515
02:16:55.470 --> 02:16:58.730
Bestow this place on us a little while.

2516
02:17:03.370 --> 02:17:07.500
O, my own lord, what have I seen to-night!

2517
02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:08.700
What, Gertrude?

2518
02:17:08.700 --> 02:17:10.530
How does Hamlet?

2519
02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:17.670
Mad as the sea and wind,

2520
02:17:17.670 --> 02:17:20.800
when both contend Which is the mightier:

2521
02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:22.770
in his lawless fit,

2522
02:17:22.770 --> 02:17:27.900
Behind the arras hearing something stir,

2523
02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:32.600
Whips out his rapier, cries, "A rat, a rat!"

2524
02:17:32.600 --> 02:17:36.570
And, in this brainish apprehension,

2525
02:17:36.570 --> 02:17:40.030
kills The unseen good old man.

2526
02:17:53.530 --> 02:17:54.870
O heavy deed!

2527
02:18:02.430 --> 02:18:05.400
It had been so with us, had we been there:

2528
02:18:06.700 --> 02:18:10.070
His liberty is full of threats to all;

2529
02:18:10.070 --> 02:18:15.130
To you yourself, to us, to every one.

2530
02:18:15.130 --> 02:18:18.030
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?

2531
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:20.430
It will be laid to us,

2532
02:18:20.430 --> 02:18:22.300
whose providence Should have kept short,

2533
02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:23.730
restrain'd and out of haunt,

2534
02:18:23.730 --> 02:18:27.170
This mad young man: but so much was our love,

2535
02:18:27.170 --> 02:18:29.330
We would not understand what was most fit;

2536
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:31.000
But, like the owner of a foul disease

2537
02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.500
To keep it from divulging,

2538
02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:35.300
let it feed Even on the pith of Life.

2539
02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:38.130
Where is he gone?

2540
02:18:38.130 --> 02:18:41.300
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:

2541
02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:43.370
O'er whom his very madness,

2542
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:46.270
like some ore Among a mineral of metals base,

2543
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:49.630
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

2544
02:18:49.630 --> 02:18:53.330
O Gertrude, come away!

2545
02:18:53.330 --> 02:18:55.470
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,

2546
02:18:55.470 --> 02:19:01.730
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed We must,

2547
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:06.730
with all our majesty and skill, Both countenance and excuse.

2548
02:19:06.730 --> 02:19:08.700
Ho, Guildenstern!

2549
02:19:12.030 --> 02:19:14.930
Friends both, go join you with some further aid:

2550
02:19:14.930 --> 02:19:17.530
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,

2551
02:19:17.530 --> 02:19:19.700
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:

2552
02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:20.970
Go seek him out; speak fair,

2553
02:19:20.970 --> 02:19:22.870
and bring the body Into the chapel.

2554
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:32.030
Gertrude, come away.

2555
02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.030
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

2556
02:19:38.030 --> 02:19:41.800
Safely stowed.

2557
02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:43.470
Hamlet!

2558
02:19:43.470 --> 02:19:44.570
Lord Hamlet!

2559
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:45.670
What noise?

2560
02:19:45.670 --> 02:19:46.700
Who calls on Hamlet?

2561
02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:53.530
O, here they come.

2562
02:19:59.730 --> 02:20:02.070
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

2563
02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:04.400
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

2564
02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:05.730
Tell us where 'tis,

2565
02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.830
that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.

2566
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:09.300
Do not believe it.

2567
02:20:09.300 --> 02:20:11.300
Believe what?

2568
02:20:11.300 --> 02:20:13.900
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.

2569
02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:16.670
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!

2570
02:20:16.670 --> 02:20:19.330
What replication should be made by the son of a king?

2571
02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.400
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

2572
02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:25.500
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance,

2573
02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:27.070
his rewards, his authorities.

2574
02:20:27.070 --> 02:20:30.570
But such officers do the king best service in the end:

2575
02:20:30.570 --> 02:20:32.300
he keeps them, like an ape an apple,

2576
02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:33.530
in the corner of his jaw;

2577
02:20:33.530 --> 02:20:36.000
first mouthed, to be last swallowed.

2578
02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.630
When he needs what you have gleaned,

2579
02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:43.670
it is but squeezing you, and, sponge,

2580
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:45.400
you shall be dry again.

2581
02:20:46.630 --> 02:20:49.000
I understand you not, my lord.

2582
02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:50.130
I am glad of it.

2583
02:20:50.130 --> 02:20:52.300
A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.

2584
02:20:52.300 --> 02:20:54.900
My lord, you must tell us where the body is

2585
02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:56.730
and go with us to the king.

2586
02:20:56.730 --> 02:20:58.370
The body is with the king,

2587
02:20:58.370 --> 02:21:01.470
but the king is not with the body.

2588
02:21:01.470 --> 02:21:03.200
The king is a thing--

2589
02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:05.800
A thing, my lord!

2590
02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:07.630
Of nothing.

2591
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:11.900
Bring me to him.

2592
02:21:14.170 --> 02:21:15.830
Hide fox, and all after.

2593
02:21:20.370 --> 02:21:22.230
I have sent to seek him and to find the body.

2594
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:27.100
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!

2595
02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:28.870
Yet must we not put the strong law on him.

2596
02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:30.930
He's loved of the distracted multitude,

2597
02:21:30.930 --> 02:21:33.230
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;

2598
02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:35.930
And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,

2599
02:21:35.930 --> 02:21:37.300
But never the offence.

2600
02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:39.170
To bear all smooth and even,

2601
02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:43.700
This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause:

2602
02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:47.100
diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance

2603
02:21:47.100 --> 02:21:48.370
are relieved, Or not at all.

2604
02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:49.470
How now!

2605
02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:50.600
What hath befall'n?

2606
02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:51.700
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,

2607
02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:52.800
We cannot get from him.

2608
02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:53.970
But where is he?

2609
02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:55.630
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

2610
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:57.830
Bring him before us.

2611
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:59.100
Ho, Guildenstern!

2612
02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:00.700
Bring in the lord.

2613
02:22:07.530 --> 02:22:11.570
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

2614
02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:12.730
At supper.

2615
02:22:12.730 --> 02:22:14.170
At supper! Where?

2616
02:22:14.170 --> 02:22:18.300
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

2617
02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:22.670
A certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him.

2618
02:22:22.670 --> 02:22:24.400
Your worm is your only emperor for diet.

2619
02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:25.970
We fat all creatures else to fat us,

2620
02:22:25.970 --> 02:22:28.470
and we fat ourselves for maggots.

2621
02:22:28.470 --> 02:22:31.030
Your fat king and your lean beggar

2622
02:22:31.030 --> 02:22:32.800
is but variable service,

2623
02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:35.930
two dishes, but to one table: that's the end.

2624
02:22:35.930 --> 02:22:37.230
Alas, alas!

2625
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:40.570
Man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king

2626
02:22:40.570 --> 02:22:44.330
and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

2627
02:22:44.330 --> 02:22:46.400
What dost thou mean by this?

2628
02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:50.630
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress

2629
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:53.730
through the guts of a beggar.

2630
02:22:53.730 --> 02:22:55.770
Where's Polonius?

2631
02:22:55.770 --> 02:22:59.900
In heaven; send thither to see:

2632
02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:01.800
if your messenger find him not there,

2633
02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:06.130
seek him in the other place yourself.

2634
02:23:06.130 --> 02:23:08.400
But indeed, if you find him not within this month,

2635
02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:12.070
You shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.

2636
02:23:12.070 --> 02:23:14.800
Go seek him there.

2637
02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:16.800
He will stay till you come.

2638
02:23:19.170 --> 02:23:23.930
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety--

2639
02:23:23.930 --> 02:23:25.200
Which we do tender,

2640
02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:27.200
as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done--

2641
02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:28.930
must send thee hence With fiery quickness:

2642
02:23:28.930 --> 02:23:31.570
therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready,

2643
02:23:31.570 --> 02:23:33.430
the wind at help, The associates tend,

2644
02:23:33.430 --> 02:23:34.870
and every thing is bent For England.

2645
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:35.970
For England!

2646
02:23:35.970 --> 02:23:37.070
Ay, Hamlet.

2647
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:38.230
Good.

2648
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:41.000
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

2649
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:44.230
I see a cherub that sees them.

2650
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:46.130
But, come; for England!

2651
02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:49.670
Farewell, dear mother.

2652
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:50.900
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

2653
02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:52.570
My mother:

2654
02:23:52.570 --> 02:23:54.870
father and mother is man and wife;

2655
02:23:54.870 --> 02:24:00.200
man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother.

2656
02:24:01.970 --> 02:24:05.870
Come, for England!

2657
02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:08.470
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;

2658
02:24:08.470 --> 02:24:10.970
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.

2659
02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:27.300
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,

2660
02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:30.630
thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process;

2661
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:32.270
which imports at full,

2662
02:24:32.270 --> 02:24:35.070
By letters congruing to that effect,

2663
02:24:35.070 --> 02:24:37.330
The present death of Hamlet.

2664
02:24:37.330 --> 02:24:41.770
Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages,

2665
02:24:41.770 --> 02:24:46.130
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,

2666
02:24:46.130 --> 02:24:50.930
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

2667
02:24:54.770 --> 02:24:58.170
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;

2668
02:24:58.170 --> 02:24:59.700
Tell him that, by his license,

2669
02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:01.500
Fortinbras Craves the conveyance

2670
02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:04.670
of a promised march Over his kingdom.

2671
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:06.270
You know the rendezvous.

2672
02:25:06.270 --> 02:25:09.270
If that his majesty would aught with us,

2673
02:25:09.270 --> 02:25:13.430
We shall express our duty in his eye; And let him know so.

2674
02:25:13.430 --> 02:25:14.630
I will do't, my lord.

2675
02:25:18.930 --> 02:25:20.630
Go softly on.

2676
02:25:30.330 --> 02:25:34.170
Good sir, whose powers are these?

2677
02:25:34.170 --> 02:25:35.570
They are of Norway, sir.

2678
02:25:35.570 --> 02:25:37.000
How purposed, sir, I pray you?

2679
02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:38.500
Against some part of Poland.

2680
02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:39.770
Who commands them, sir?

2681
02:25:39.770 --> 02:25:41.530
The nephew of old Norway, Fortinbras.

2682
02:25:41.530 --> 02:25:43.730
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,

2683
02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:45.000
Or for some frontier?

2684
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.800
Truly to speak, and with no addition,

2685
02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:48.470
We go to gain a little patch of ground

2686
02:25:48.470 --> 02:25:51.230
That hath in it no profit but the name.

2687
02:25:51.230 --> 02:25:53.600
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it.

2688
02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:55.670
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

2689
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:58.330
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

2690
02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:02.370
I humbly thank you, sir.

2691
02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:09.200
Wilt please you go, my lord?

2692
02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:13.100
I'll be with you straight go a little before.

2693
02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:23.970
How all occasions do inform against me

2694
02:26:23.970 --> 02:26:29.700
And spur my dull revenge!

2695
02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:31.430
What is a man,

2696
02:26:31.430 --> 02:26:34.100
If his chief good and market of his time

2697
02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:37.200
Be but to sleep and feed?

2698
02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:40.000
A beast, no more.

2699
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,

2700
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.600
Looking before and after,

2701
02:26:44.600 --> 02:26:48.700
gave us not That capability and god-like reason

2702
02:26:48.700 --> 02:26:51.700
To fust in us unused.

2703
02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:56.170
Now, whether it be Bestial oblivion

2704
02:26:56.170 --> 02:26:58.200
or some craven scruple

2705
02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:01.670
Of thinking too precisely on the event,

2706
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:06.630
I do not know Why yet I live to say,

2707
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:10.470
"This thing's to do."

2708
02:27:10.470 --> 02:27:17.930
I have cause and will and strength and means To do't.

2709
02:27:17.930 --> 02:27:21.000
Examples gross as earth exhort me:

2710
02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.470
Witness this army of such mass and charge

2711
02:27:24.470 --> 02:27:27.130
Led by a delicate and tender prince,

2712
02:27:27.130 --> 02:27:30.530
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd

2713
02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:34.170
Makes mouths at the invisible event,

2714
02:27:34.170 --> 02:27:38.030
Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune,

2715
02:27:38.030 --> 02:27:46.530
death and danger dare, Even for an egg-shell.

2716
02:27:46.530 --> 02:27:53.400
Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument,

2717
02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:57.170
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw

2718
02:27:57.170 --> 02:28:00.900
When honour's at the stake.

2719
02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:05.130
How stand I then, That have a father kill'd,

2720
02:28:05.130 --> 02:28:09.330
a mother stain'd, Excitements of my reason and my blood,

2721
02:28:09.330 --> 02:28:10.470
And let all sleep?

2722
02:28:10.470 --> 02:28:13.800
While, to my shame, I see The imminent death

2723
02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:17.600
of twenty thousand men, That,

2724
02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:22.430
for a fantasy and trick of fame, Go to their graves like beds,

2725
02:28:22.430 --> 02:28:27.100
fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,

2726
02:28:27.100 --> 02:28:31.430
Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain?

2727
02:28:34.270 --> 02:28:40.900
O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody,

2728
02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:43.900
or be nothing worth!

2729
02:29:05.970 --> 02:29:08.030
I will not speak with her.

2730
02:29:08.030 --> 02:29:12.130
She is importunate, indeed distract.

2731
02:29:12.130 --> 02:29:14.100
Her mood will needs be pitied.

2732
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:17.170
What would she have?

2733
02:29:17.170 --> 02:29:19.700
She speaks much of her father;

2734
02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:21.670
says she hears There's tricks i' the world;

2735
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:24.630
and hems, and beats her heart;

2736
02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:28.000
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,

2737
02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.130
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,

2738
02:29:32.130 --> 02:29:33.830
Yet the unshaped use of it

2739
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:36.170
doth move her hearers to collection.

2740
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:38.130
They yawn at it,

2741
02:29:38.130 --> 02:29:40.330
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;

2742
02:29:40.330 --> 02:29:42.670
Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,

2743
02:29:42.670 --> 02:29:45.030
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,

2744
02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:47.530
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

2745
02:29:47.530 --> 02:29:49.200
It were good she were spoken with;

2746
02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:51.830
for she may strew Dangerous conjectures

2747
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:55.000
in ill-breeding minds.

2748
02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:56.870
Let her come in.

2749
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:06.330
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,

2750
02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:11.700
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:

2751
02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:14.800
So full of artless jealousy is guilt;

2752
02:30:14.800 --> 02:30:18.930
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

2753
02:30:27.430 --> 02:30:32.170
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

2754
02:30:32.170 --> 02:30:34.700
How now, Ophelia!

2755
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:46.100
How should I your true love know From another one?

2756
02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:51.770
By his cockle hat and staff, And his sandal shoon.

2757
02:30:51.770 --> 02:30:53.870
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

2758
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:54.970
Say you?

2759
02:30:54.970 --> 02:30:56.400
Nay, pray you, mark.

2760
02:30:56.400 --> 02:31:00.900
He is dead and gone, lady, He is dead and gone;

2761
02:31:00.900 --> 02:31:03.700
At his head a grass-green turf,

2762
02:31:03.700 --> 02:31:05.370
At his heels a stone.

2763
02:31:05.370 --> 02:31:06.470
Nay, but, Ophelia.

2764
02:31:06.470 --> 02:31:08.200
Pray you, mark.

2765
02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:10.370
White his shroud as the mountain snow.

2766
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:14.230
Larded with sweet flowers Which bewept to the grave--

2767
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:15.430
Alas, look here.

2768
02:31:15.430 --> 02:31:17.570
Did not go With true-love showers.

2769
02:31:17.570 --> 02:31:19.130
How do you, pretty lady?

2770
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:21.670
Well.

2771
02:31:21.670 --> 02:31:25.070
God dild you!

2772
02:31:25.070 --> 02:31:28.170
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.

2773
02:31:28.170 --> 02:31:33.800
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be.

2774
02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:35.330
God be at your table!

2775
02:31:35.330 --> 02:31:36.530
Conceit upon her father.

2776
02:31:36.530 --> 02:31:39.200
Pray let's have no words of this;

2777
02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:44.230
but when they ask you what it means, say you this:

2778
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:47.230
To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,

2779
02:31:47.230 --> 02:31:51.330
All in the morning betime, And I a maid at your window,

2780
02:31:51.330 --> 02:31:53.970
To be your Valentine.

2781
02:31:53.970 --> 02:31:56.600
Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes

2782
02:31:56.600 --> 02:31:58.800
And dupp'd the chamber-door;

2783
02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:03.130
Let in a maid, let out a maid,

2784
02:32:03.130 --> 02:32:04.400
Never departed more.

2785
02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:05.730
Pretty Ophelia!

2786
02:32:05.730 --> 02:32:07.970
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:

2787
02:32:07.970 --> 02:32:09.670
By Gis and by Saint Charity,

2788
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:11.870
Alack, and fie for shame!

2789
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:14.330
Young men will do't, if they come to't;

2790
02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:16.470
By cock, they are to blame.

2791
02:32:16.470 --> 02:32:18.770
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,

2792
02:32:18.770 --> 02:32:22.000
You promised me to wed.

2793
02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:25.330
He answers:

2794
02:32:25.330 --> 02:32:27.930
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,

2795
02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:30.170
An thou hadst not come to my bed.

2796
02:32:30.170 --> 02:32:31.870
How long hath she been thus?

2797
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:34.530
I hope all will be well.

2798
02:32:34.530 --> 02:32:39.130
We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep,

2799
02:32:39.130 --> 02:32:43.130
to think they would lay him in the cold ground.

2800
02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:45.470
My brother shall know of it!

2801
02:32:48.700 --> 02:32:52.770
And so I thank you for your good counsel.

2802
02:32:52.770 --> 02:32:54.930
Come, my coach!

2803
02:32:54.930 --> 02:33:00.900
Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;

2804
02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:05.230
good night, good night.

2805
02:33:07.130 --> 02:33:11.070
Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.

2806
02:33:14.230 --> 02:33:18.130
O, this is the poison of deep grief;

2807
02:33:18.130 --> 02:33:20.400
it springs All from her father's death.

2808
02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:23.130
And now behold.

2809
02:33:23.130 --> 02:33:28.100
O Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come,

2810
02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:33.430
they come not single spies But in battalions.

2811
02:33:33.430 --> 02:33:39.170
First, her father slain: Next, your son gone;

2812
02:33:39.170 --> 02:33:41.400
and he most violent author Of his own just remove:

2813
02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:43.230
the people muddied,

2814
02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:45.800
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,

2815
02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:47.370
For good Polonius' death;

2816
02:33:47.370 --> 02:33:51.770
and we have done but greenly, In hugger-mugger to inter him.

2817
02:33:51.770 --> 02:33:56.500
Poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgment,

2818
02:33:56.500 --> 02:33:59.730
Without the which we are pictures,

2819
02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:04.330
or mere beasts:

2820
02:34:04.330 --> 02:34:08.170
Last, and as much containing as all these,

2821
02:34:08.170 --> 02:34:11.070
Her brother is in secret come from France

2822
02:34:11.070 --> 02:34:13.300
and wants not buzzers to infect his ear

2823
02:34:13.300 --> 02:34:16.330
With pestilent speeches of his father's death.

2824
02:34:16.330 --> 02:34:20.100
O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering-piece,

2825
02:34:20.100 --> 02:34:22.700
in many places Gives me superfluous death.

2826
02:34:24.700 --> 02:34:28.100
Alack, what noise is this?

2827
02:34:28.100 --> 02:34:29.570
Attend! Where are my Swissers?

2828
02:34:29.570 --> 02:34:30.670
Let them guard the door.

2829
02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:31.770
What's the matter?

2830
02:34:31.770 --> 02:34:32.870
Save yourself, my lord:

2831
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:34.500
The ocean, overpeering of his list,

2832
02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:36.500
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste

2833
02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:38.230
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,

2834
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:39.630
O'erbears your officers.

2835
02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:41.170
The rabble call him lord;

2836
02:34:41.170 --> 02:34:43.330
And, as the world were now but to begin,

2837
02:34:43.330 --> 02:34:45.370
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,

2838
02:34:45.370 --> 02:34:48.170
They cry, "Choose we; Laertes shall be king."

2839
02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:51.170
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:

2840
02:34:51.170 --> 02:34:53.130
"Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!"

2841
02:34:53.130 --> 02:34:57.030
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!

2842
02:34:57.030 --> 02:35:01.500
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!

2843
02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:03.170
The doors are broke.

2844
02:35:03.170 --> 02:35:04.170
Where is this king?

2845
02:35:05.370 --> 02:35:09.370
O thou vile king, Give me my father!

2846
02:35:09.370 --> 02:35:12.130
Calmly, good Laertes.

2847
02:35:12.130 --> 02:35:15.370
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,

2848
02:35:15.370 --> 02:35:19.730
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here,

2849
02:35:19.730 --> 02:35:22.900
between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother.

2850
02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:24.500
What is the cause, Laertes,

2851
02:35:24.500 --> 02:35:27.500
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?

2852
02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:30.270
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:

2853
02:35:30.270 --> 02:35:33.200
There's such divinity doth hedge a king

2854
02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:35.500
That treason can but peep to what it would,

2855
02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:38.030
Acts little of his will.

2856
02:35:38.030 --> 02:35:41.230
Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed.

2857
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:44.670
Let him go, Gertrude.

2858
02:35:44.670 --> 02:35:45.900
Speak, man.

2859
02:35:45.900 --> 02:35:47.000
Where is my father?

2860
02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:48.100
Dead.

2861
02:35:48.100 --> 02:35:49.330
But not by him.

2862
02:35:49.330 --> 02:35:50.630
Let him demand his fill.

2863
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:51.900
How came he dead?

2864
02:35:51.900 --> 02:35:56.230
I'll not be juggled with: To hell, allegiance!

2865
02:35:56.230 --> 02:35:58.530
Vows, to the blackest devil!

2866
02:35:58.530 --> 02:36:01.300
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!

2867
02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:04.230
I dare damnation.

2868
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:06.430
To this point I stand,

2869
02:36:06.430 --> 02:36:09.230
That both the worlds I give to negligence,

2870
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:11.070
Let come what comes;

2871
02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:14.770
only I'll be revenged Most throughly for my father.

2872
02:36:14.770 --> 02:36:15.900
Who shall stay you?

2873
02:36:15.900 --> 02:36:18.700
My will, not all the worlds.

2874
02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:21.070
Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty

2875
02:36:21.070 --> 02:36:23.270
Of your dear father, is't writ in your revenge,

2876
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:24.630
That, swoopstake,

2877
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:26.930
you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?

2878
02:36:26.930 --> 02:36:28.470
None but his enemies.

2879
02:36:28.470 --> 02:36:30.300
Will you know them then?

2880
02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:33.530
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;

2881
02:36:33.530 --> 02:36:36.230
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,

2882
02:36:36.230 --> 02:36:37.770
Repast them with my blood.

2883
02:36:37.770 --> 02:36:40.270
Why, now you speak Like a good child

2884
02:36:40.270 --> 02:36:43.600
and a true gentleman.

2885
02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:45.570
That I am guiltless of your father's death

2886
02:36:45.570 --> 02:36:47.730
And am most sensibly in grief for it,

2887
02:36:47.730 --> 02:36:49.500
It shall as level to your judgment pierce

2888
02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:50.730
As day does to your eye.

2889
02:36:50.730 --> 02:36:51.830
How now!

2890
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:53.200
What noise is that?

2891
02:37:09.730 --> 02:37:12.600
O heat, dry up my brains!

2892
02:37:12.600 --> 02:37:14.100
Tears seven times salt,

2893
02:37:14.100 --> 02:37:18.400
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!

2894
02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:23.100
By heavens, thy madness shall be paid with weight

2895
02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:25.970
Till our scale turn the beam.

2896
02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:27.430
O rose of May!

2897
02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:35.270
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!

2898
02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:39.700
O heavens!

2899
02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:42.200
Is't possible a young maid's wits

2900
02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:45.830
Should be as mortal as an old man's life?

2901
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:47.870
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,

2902
02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:52.800
It sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves.

2903
02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:56.600
They bore him barefaced on the bier;

2904
02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:00.230
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;

2905
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:03.900
And in his grave rain'd many a tear.

2906
02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:08.270
Fare you well, my dove!

2907
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:12.330
Hadst thou thy wits and didst persuade revenge,

2908
02:38:12.330 --> 02:38:15.200
It could not move thus.

2909
02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:21.170
You must sing a-down a-down, An' you call him a-down-a.

2910
02:38:21.170 --> 02:38:23.130
O, how the wheel becomes it!

2911
02:38:23.130 --> 02:38:27.570
It is the false steward that stole his master's daughter.

2912
02:38:27.570 --> 02:38:30.570
This nothing's more than matter.

2913
02:38:30.570 --> 02:38:34.500
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance;

2914
02:38:34.500 --> 02:38:39.230
pray you, love, remember.

2915
02:38:39.230 --> 02:38:40.530
There's pansies.

2916
02:38:40.530 --> 02:38:43.070
That's for thoughts.

2917
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:49.670
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.

2918
02:38:49.670 --> 02:38:55.300
There's fennel for you, and columbines.

2919
02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:57.930
There's rue for you; and there's some for me.

2920
02:38:57.930 --> 02:39:00.730
We may call it herb-grace o' Sundays:

2921
02:39:00.730 --> 02:39:03.930
O you must wear your rue with a difference.

2922
02:39:03.930 --> 02:39:05.070
There's a daisy.

2923
02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:11.800
I would give you some violets,

2924
02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.500
but they withered all when my father died.

2925
02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:19.870
They say he made a good end.

2926
02:39:19.870 --> 02:39:22.170
For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

2927
02:39:24.030 --> 02:39:29.530
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,

2928
02:39:29.530 --> 02:39:33.930
She turns to favour and to prettiness.

2929
02:39:33.930 --> 02:39:37.470
Will he not come again?

2930
02:39:37.470 --> 02:39:40.570
And will he not come again?

2931
02:39:43.500 --> 02:39:50.570
No, no, he is dead: Go to thy death-bed:

2932
02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:52.970
He never will come again.

2933
02:39:55.300 --> 02:39:59.100
His beard was as white as snow,

2934
02:39:59.100 --> 02:40:03.530
All flaxen was his poll:

2935
02:40:03.530 --> 02:40:09.300
He is gone, he is gone, And we cast away moan:

2936
02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:11.470
God ha' mercy on his soul!

2937
02:40:14.530 --> 02:40:19.500
And of all Christian souls, I pray God.

2938
02:40:23.730 --> 02:40:24.930
God buy you.

2939
02:40:26.970 --> 02:40:31.730
Do you see this, O God?

2940
02:40:31.730 --> 02:40:33.370
Laertes.

2941
02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:36.970
I must commune with your grief,

2942
02:40:36.970 --> 02:40:38.770
Or you deny me right.

2943
02:40:41.900 --> 02:40:43.230
Go but apart,

2944
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:45.430
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.

2945
02:40:45.430 --> 02:40:46.900
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:

2946
02:40:46.900 --> 02:40:48.400
If by direct or by collateral hand

2947
02:40:48.400 --> 02:40:50.630
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,

2948
02:40:50.630 --> 02:40:52.570
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours

2949
02:40:52.570 --> 02:40:55.930
To you in satisfaction; but if not,

2950
02:40:55.930 --> 02:40:59.270
Be you content to lend your patience to us,

2951
02:40:59.270 --> 02:41:01.530
And we shall jointly labour with your soul

2952
02:41:01.530 --> 02:41:03.470
To give it due content.

2953
02:41:07.070 --> 02:41:09.730
Let this be so;

2954
02:41:09.730 --> 02:41:14.230
His means of death, his obscure funeral--

2955
02:41:14.230 --> 02:41:17.230
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,

2956
02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:19.870
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--

2957
02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:24.170
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,

2958
02:41:24.170 --> 02:41:26.630
That I must call't in question.

2959
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:29.500
And so you shall;

2960
02:41:29.500 --> 02:41:35.000
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.

2961
02:41:50.830 --> 02:41:53.470
God bless you, sir.

2962
02:41:53.470 --> 02:41:54.870
Let him bless thee too.

2963
02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:59.400
That shall, sir, and please him.

2964
02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:00.770
There's a letter for you, sir.

2965
02:42:02.330 --> 02:42:04.930
It came from the ambassador that was bound for England;

2966
02:42:06.800 --> 02:42:10.130
if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.

2967
02:42:27.530 --> 02:42:30.200
"Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this,

2968
02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:32.870
"give these fellows some means to the king:

2969
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:34.600
"they have letters for him.

2970
02:42:34.600 --> 02:42:36.570
"Ere we were two days old at sea,

2971
02:42:36.570 --> 02:42:39.700
"a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase.

2972
02:42:39.700 --> 02:42:41.470
"Finding ourselves too slow of sail,

2973
02:42:41.470 --> 02:42:43.100
"we put on a compelled valour,

2974
02:42:43.100 --> 02:42:45.500
"and in the grapple I boarded them:

2975
02:42:45.500 --> 02:42:47.400
"on the instant they got clear of our ship;

2976
02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:50.170
"so I alone became their prisoner.

2977
02:42:50.170 --> 02:42:52.270
"They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy:

2978
02:42:52.270 --> 02:42:53.930
"but they knew what they did;

2979
02:42:53.930 --> 02:42:56.330
"I am to do a good turn for them.

2980
02:42:59.870 --> 02:43:03.070
"Let the king have the letters I have sent;

2981
02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:05.200
"and repair thou to me with as much speed

2982
02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:07.530
"as thou wouldst fly death.

2983
02:43:07.530 --> 02:43:10.870
"I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb;

2984
02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:13.600
"yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter.

2985
02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:15.970
"These good fellows will bring thee where I am.

2986
02:43:15.970 --> 02:43:19.270
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England:

2987
02:43:19.270 --> 02:43:21.530
"of them I have much to tell thee.

2988
02:43:21.530 --> 02:43:22.730
"Farewell.

2989
02:43:22.730 --> 02:43:26.470
He that thou knowest thine, --Hamlet."

2990
02:43:29.900 --> 02:43:32.700
Come, I will give you way for these your letters;

2991
02:43:32.700 --> 02:43:35.400
And do it the speedier that you may direct me To him

2992
02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:37.230
from whom you brought them.

2993
02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:52.670
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,

2994
02:43:52.670 --> 02:43:54.670
And you must put me in your heart for friend,

2995
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:57.300
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,

2996
02:43:57.300 --> 02:44:00.900
That he which hath your noble father slain

2997
02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:02.000
Pursued my life.

2998
02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.300
It well appears.

2999
02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:06.070
But tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats,

3000
02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:08.870
So crimeful and so capital in nature,

3001
02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:11.700
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,

3002
02:44:11.700 --> 02:44:13.030
You mainly were stirr'd up.

3003
02:44:13.030 --> 02:44:14.370
O, for two special reasons;

3004
02:44:14.370 --> 02:44:16.500
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,

3005
02:44:16.500 --> 02:44:17.930
But yet to me they are strong.

3006
02:44:17.930 --> 02:44:21.900
The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks;

3007
02:44:21.900 --> 02:44:23.770
and for myself--

3008
02:44:23.770 --> 02:44:27.730
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--

3009
02:44:27.730 --> 02:44:29.870
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,

3010
02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:32.330
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,

3011
02:44:32.330 --> 02:44:35.530
I could not but by her.

3012
02:44:35.530 --> 02:44:39.630
The other motive, Why to a public count I might not go,

3013
02:44:39.630 --> 02:44:42.330
Is the great love the general gender bear him;

3014
02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:44.470
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,

3015
02:44:44.470 --> 02:44:46.870
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,

3016
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:48.600
Convert his gyves to graces.

3017
02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:51.730
And so have I a noble father lost;

3018
02:44:51.730 --> 02:44:54.030
A sister driven into desperate terms,

3019
02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:56.670
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,

3020
02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:58.430
Stood challenger on mount of all the age

3021
02:44:58.430 --> 02:45:02.930
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

3022
02:45:02.930 --> 02:45:06.330
Break not your sleeps for that:

3023
02:45:06.330 --> 02:45:09.070
you must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull

3024
02:45:09.070 --> 02:45:11.030
That we can let our beard be shook with danger

3025
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:13.500
And think it pastime.

3026
02:45:13.500 --> 02:45:15.070
You shortly shall hear more:

3027
02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:22.830
I loved your father, and we love ourself;

3028
02:45:22.830 --> 02:45:24.830
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--

3029
02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:26.400
How now! What news?

3030
02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.130
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:

3031
02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:30.270
These to your majesty; this to the queen.

3032
02:45:30.270 --> 02:45:31.330
From Hamlet!

3033
02:45:34.470 --> 02:45:35.630
Who brought them?

3034
02:45:35.630 --> 02:45:38.230
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:

3035
02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:39.970
They were given me by Claudio;

3036
02:45:39.970 --> 02:45:41.830
he received them Of him that brought them.

3037
02:45:44.930 --> 02:45:46.570
Laertes, you shall hear them.

3038
02:45:46.570 --> 02:45:47.670
Leave us.

3039
02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:52.300
"High and mighty,

3040
02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.930
"You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom.

3041
02:45:55.930 --> 02:45:59.130
"To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes:

3042
02:45:59.130 --> 02:46:01.800
"when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto,

3043
02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:04.530
"recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return.

3044
02:46:04.530 --> 02:46:05.630
--Hamlet."

3045
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:08.000
What should this mean?

3046
02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:09.170
Are all the rest come back?

3047
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:11.970
Or is this some abuse, and no such thing?

3048
02:46:11.970 --> 02:46:13.530
Know you the hand?

3049
02:46:13.530 --> 02:46:14.670
'Tis Hamlet's character.

3050
02:46:14.670 --> 02:46:17.000
"Naked!"

3051
02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:20.030
And in a postscript here, he says "alone."

3052
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:21.570
Can you advise me?

3053
02:46:23.100 --> 02:46:25.370
I'm lost in it, my lord.

3054
02:46:25.370 --> 02:46:27.100
But let him come;

3055
02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:28.930
It warms the very sickness in my heart

3056
02:46:28.930 --> 02:46:31.030
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,

3057
02:46:31.030 --> 02:46:32.570
"Thus didest thou."

3058
02:46:32.570 --> 02:46:37.530
If it be so, Laertes-- thus how should it be so?

3059
02:46:37.530 --> 02:46:38.930
How otherwise?

3060
02:46:38.930 --> 02:46:40.270
Will you be ruled by me?

3061
02:46:40.270 --> 02:46:44.500
Ay, my lord; So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

3062
02:46:44.500 --> 02:46:47.830
To thine own peace.

3063
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:49.970
If he be now return'd, As checking at his voyage,

3064
02:46:49.970 --> 02:46:51.800
and that he means No more to undertake it,

3065
02:46:51.800 --> 02:46:54.030
I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device,

3066
02:46:54.030 --> 02:46:56.570
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:

3067
02:46:56.570 --> 02:46:58.700
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,

3068
02:46:58.700 --> 02:47:00.900
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice

3069
02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:02.730
And call it accident.

3070
02:47:02.730 --> 02:47:05.700
My lord, I will be ruled; The rather,

3071
02:47:05.700 --> 02:47:08.300
if you could devise it so That I might be the organ.

3072
02:47:14.430 --> 02:47:16.230
It falls right.

3073
02:47:17.530 --> 02:47:20.330
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,

3074
02:47:20.330 --> 02:47:22.700
And that in Hamlet's hearing,

3075
02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:25.500
for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine.

3076
02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:28.000
Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy.

3077
02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.470
He made confession of you

3078
02:47:29.470 --> 02:47:32.530
And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise

3079
02:47:32.530 --> 02:47:35.630
in your defence And for your rapier most especial

3080
02:47:35.630 --> 02:47:37.070
That he cried out,

3081
02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:40.130
'twould be a sight indeed If one could match you.

3082
02:47:40.130 --> 02:47:43.400
This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom

3083
02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:45.100
with his envy That he could nothing do

3084
02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:46.930
but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er

3085
02:47:46.930 --> 02:47:48.400
to play with you.

3086
02:47:49.900 --> 02:47:53.200
Now, out of this.

3087
02:47:56.500 --> 02:47:59.730
What out of this, my lord?

3088
02:47:59.730 --> 02:48:02.230
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

3089
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:04.000
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,

3090
02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:05.270
A face without a heart?

3091
02:48:05.270 --> 02:48:06.800
Why ask you this?

3092
02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:08.970
Not that I think you did not love your father;

3093
02:48:08.970 --> 02:48:11.600
But that I know love is begun by time;

3094
02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:13.400
And that I see, in passages of proof,

3095
02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:16.800
Time qualifies the fire and spark of it.

3096
02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:18.870
There lives within the very flame of love

3097
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:22.200
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;

3098
02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:25.570
And nothing is at a like goodness still;

3099
02:48:25.570 --> 02:48:28.870
But goodness, growing to a pleurisy,

3100
02:48:28.870 --> 02:48:33.370
Dies in his own too much.

3101
02:48:33.370 --> 02:48:35.600
But, to the quick o' the ulcer.

3102
02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:38.430
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake

3103
02:48:38.430 --> 02:48:39.530
To show yourself in deed

3104
02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:43.000
your father's son More than in words?

3105
02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.700
To cut his throat i' the church.

3106
02:48:45.700 --> 02:48:48.830
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;

3107
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:51.530
Revenge should know no bounds.

3108
02:48:51.530 --> 02:48:54.570
But, good Laertes, Will you do this,

3109
02:48:54.570 --> 02:48:56.230
keep close within your chamber.

3110
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:58.300
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come back.

3111
02:48:58.300 --> 02:49:00.900
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence

3112
02:49:00.900 --> 02:49:03.630
And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you,

3113
02:49:03.630 --> 02:49:05.870
bring you in fine together And wager on your heads:

3114
02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:09.570
he, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contrivings,

3115
02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:12.770
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,

3116
02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:17.270
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated,

3117
02:49:17.270 --> 02:49:21.230
and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father.

3118
02:49:23.770 --> 02:49:25.530
I will do't:

3119
02:49:25.530 --> 02:49:29.400
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.

3120
02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:30.970
I bought an unction of a mountebank

3121
02:49:30.970 --> 02:49:34.030
So mortal that but dip a knife in it,

3122
02:49:34.030 --> 02:49:37.000
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,

3123
02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.800
Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon

3124
02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:44.800
can save the thing from death That is but scratch'd withal:

3125
02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:46.930
I'll touch my point With this contagion,

3126
02:49:46.930 --> 02:49:50.830
that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death.

3127
02:49:50.830 --> 02:49:54.530
Let's further think of this;

3128
02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:56.670
Weigh what convenience both of time and means

3129
02:49:56.670 --> 02:49:57.930
May fit us to our shape.

3130
02:49:57.930 --> 02:49:59.200
If this should fail,

3131
02:49:59.200 --> 02:50:02.230
And that our drift look through our bad performance,

3132
02:50:02.230 --> 02:50:03.700
'Twere better not assay'd:

3133
02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:06.130
therefore this project Should have a back or second,

3134
02:50:06.130 --> 02:50:09.230
that might hold, If this did blast in proof.

3135
02:50:09.230 --> 02:50:10.330
Soft!

3136
02:50:10.330 --> 02:50:12.070
Let me see.

3137
02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:16.670
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings.

3138
02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:20.330
O, I ha't.

3139
02:50:20.330 --> 02:50:22.270
When in your motions you are hot and dry--

3140
02:50:22.270 --> 02:50:24.470
As make your bout more violent to that end--

3141
02:50:24.470 --> 02:50:25.670
And that he calls for drink,

3142
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:28.970
I'll have preffer'd him A chalice for the nonce,

3143
02:50:28.970 --> 02:50:30.200
whereon but sipping,

3144
02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:33.200
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,

3145
02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:35.370
Our purpose may hold there.

3146
02:50:35.370 --> 02:50:37.000
Stay. What noise?

3147
02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:49.500
One woe doth tread upon another's heels.

3148
02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:50.530
So fast they follow.

3149
02:50:56.030 --> 02:51:01.730
Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

3150
02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:06.830
Drown'd!

3151
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:15.400
O, where?

3152
02:51:15.400 --> 02:51:18.930
There is a willow grows aslant the brook

3153
02:51:18.930 --> 02:51:22.130
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;

3154
02:51:22.130 --> 02:51:24.000
There with fantastic garlands

3155
02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:28.730
she would make of daisies, crow-flowers, nettles,

3156
02:51:28.730 --> 02:51:35.200
and long purples which liberal shepherds give a grosser name,

3157
02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:41.930
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:

3158
02:51:41.930 --> 02:51:46.030
There, on the pendent boughs

3159
02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:49.600
her coronet weeds Clambering to hang,

3160
02:51:49.600 --> 02:51:53.230
an envious sliver broke;

3161
02:51:53.230 --> 02:51:55.430
When down her weedy trophies and herself

3162
02:51:55.430 --> 02:51:58.730
Fell in the weeping brook.

3163
02:51:58.730 --> 02:52:01.470
Her clothes spread wide;

3164
02:52:01.470 --> 02:52:05.800
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:

3165
02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:09.700
Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds;

3166
02:52:09.700 --> 02:52:12.230
As one incapable of her own distress

3167
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:16.630
Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element:

3168
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:21.330
but long it could not be Till that her garments,

3169
02:52:21.330 --> 02:52:24.670
heavy with their drink,

3170
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:29.270
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay

3171
02:52:29.270 --> 02:52:30.530
To muddy death.

3172
02:52:33.600 --> 02:52:38.730
Alas, then, she is drown'd?

3173
02:52:38.730 --> 02:52:43.530
Drown'd, drown'd.

3174
02:52:48.070 --> 02:52:53.670
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia.

3175
02:52:57.370 --> 02:53:01.700
And therefore I forbid my tears.

3176
02:53:06.670 --> 02:53:13.830
But yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds,

3177
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:16.070
Let shame say what it will.

3178
02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:24.230
When these are gone, the woman will be out!

3179
02:53:26.330 --> 02:53:29.500
Adieu, my lord:

3180
02:53:29.500 --> 02:53:34.900
I have a speech of fire that fain would blaze,

3181
02:53:34.900 --> 02:53:39.700
But that this folly douts it.

3182
02:53:42.430 --> 02:53:43.870
Let's follow, Gertrude:

3183
02:53:48.470 --> 02:53:52.770
How much I had to do to calm his rage.

3184
02:53:52.770 --> 02:53:56.100
Now fear I this will give it start again.

3185
02:53:56.100 --> 02:53:57.600
Therefore let's follow.

3186
02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:03.130
Is she to be buried in Christian burial

3187
02:54:03.130 --> 02:54:06.330
when she willfully seeks her own salvation?

3188
02:54:06.330 --> 02:54:07.970
I tell thee she is:

3189
02:54:07.970 --> 02:54:10.070
and therefore make her grave straight:

3190
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:13.030
the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.

3191
02:54:13.030 --> 02:54:14.570
How can that be,

3192
02:54:14.570 --> 02:54:17.630
unless she drowned herself in her own defense?

3193
02:54:17.630 --> 02:54:20.230
Why, 'tis found so.

3194
02:54:20.230 --> 02:54:22.500
It must be "se offendendo;" it cannot be else.

3195
02:54:22.500 --> 02:54:23.830
For here lies the point:

3196
02:54:23.830 --> 02:54:25.870
if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act:

3197
02:54:25.870 --> 02:54:27.800
and an act hath three branches.

3198
02:54:27.800 --> 02:54:30.470
It is to act, to do, to perform.

3199
02:54:30.470 --> 02:54:32.800
Argal, she drowned herself wittingly.

3200
02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:34.370
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver.

3201
02:54:34.370 --> 02:54:35.630
Give me leave.

3202
02:54:35.630 --> 02:54:39.400
Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good;

3203
02:54:39.400 --> 02:54:42.570
if the man go to this water and drown himself,

3204
02:54:42.570 --> 02:54:46.500
it is, will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that;

3205
02:54:46.500 --> 02:54:49.430
but if the water come to him and drown him,

3206
02:54:49.430 --> 02:54:51.170
he drowns not himself.

3207
02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:53.100
Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death

3208
02:54:53.100 --> 02:54:55.430
shortens not his own life.

3209
02:54:55.430 --> 02:54:56.670
But is this law?

3210
02:54:56.670 --> 02:54:59.070
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.

3211
02:54:59.070 --> 02:55:00.670
Will you ha' the truth on't?

3212
02:55:00.670 --> 02:55:02.370
If this had not been a gentlewoman,

3213
02:55:02.370 --> 02:55:04.700
she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.

3214
02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:06.870
Why, there thou say'st:

3215
02:55:06.870 --> 02:55:10.470
and the more pity that great folk

3216
02:55:10.470 --> 02:55:12.200
should have countenance in this world

3217
02:55:12.200 --> 02:55:16.730
to drown or hang themselves, more than their even Christian.

3218
02:55:16.730 --> 02:55:18.800
Come, my spade.

3219
02:55:18.800 --> 02:55:21.430
There is no ancient gentleman but gardeners,

3220
02:55:21.430 --> 02:55:26.500
ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession.

3221
02:55:26.500 --> 02:55:27.900
Was he a gentleman?

3222
02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:30.030
He was the first ever bore arms.

3223
02:55:30.030 --> 02:55:31.500
Why, he had none.

3224
02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:32.730
What, art a heathen?

3225
02:55:32.730 --> 02:55:34.970
How dost thou understand the Scripture?

3226
02:55:34.970 --> 02:55:38.170
The Scripture says, "Adam digged."

3227
02:55:41.200 --> 02:55:43.800
Could he dig without arms?

3228
02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:45.400
I'll put another question to thee:

3229
02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:47.070
if thou answerest me not to the purpose,

3230
02:55:47.070 --> 02:55:48.170
confess thyself.

3231
02:55:48.170 --> 02:55:49.700
Go to.

3232
02:55:49.700 --> 02:55:51.900
What is he that builds stronger

3233
02:55:51.900 --> 02:55:55.200
than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

3234
02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:57.300
The gallows-maker;

3235
02:55:57.300 --> 02:56:00.070
for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.

3236
02:56:00.070 --> 02:56:02.300
I like thy wit well, in good faith:

3237
02:56:02.300 --> 02:56:06.100
the gallows does well; but how does it do well?

3238
02:56:06.100 --> 02:56:08.070
It does well to those that do ill.

3239
02:56:08.070 --> 02:56:10.500
Now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger

3240
02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:13.670
than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee.

3241
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:15.830
To't again, come.

3242
02:56:15.830 --> 02:56:17.970
"Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright,

3243
02:56:17.970 --> 02:56:19.070
or a carpenter?"

3244
02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:21.170
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

3245
02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:22.270
Marry, now I can tell.

3246
02:56:22.270 --> 02:56:24.570
To't.

3247
02:56:24.570 --> 02:56:26.070
Mass, I cannot tell.

3248
02:56:26.070 --> 02:56:28.070
Cudgel thy brains no more about it,

3249
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:29.800
for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating;

3250
02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:33.270
and, when you are asked this question next, say,

3251
02:56:33.270 --> 02:56:36.900
"a grave-maker: the houses that he makes last"--

3252
02:56:36.900 --> 02:56:40.600
Until doomsday."

3253
02:56:40.600 --> 02:56:44.100
Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a stoup of liquor.

3254
02:56:44.100 --> 02:56:48.100
In youth, when I did love, did love,

3255
02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:51.270
Methought it were very sweet, To contract,

3256
02:56:51.270 --> 02:56:53.400
O, the time, for, ah, my behove,

3257
02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:57.670
methought there was nothing meet.

3258
02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:59.970
Has this fellow no feeling of his business

3259
02:56:59.970 --> 02:57:03.300
that he sings at grave-making?

3260
02:57:03.300 --> 02:57:07.900
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

3261
02:57:07.900 --> 02:57:10.270
'Tis e'en so:

3262
02:57:10.270 --> 02:57:13.300
the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.

3263
02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:16.270
But age, with his stealing step,

3264
02:57:16.270 --> 02:57:19.700
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,

3265
02:57:19.700 --> 02:57:22.430
And shipped me into the land,

3266
02:57:22.430 --> 02:57:26.630
As if I had never been such.

3267
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:30.100
That skull had a tongue in it and could sing once.

3268
02:57:30.100 --> 02:57:31.770
How the knave jowls it to the ground

3269
02:57:31.770 --> 02:57:35.130
as if it were Cain's jaw-bone that did the first murder!

3270
02:57:35.130 --> 02:57:38.130
This might be the pate of a politician,

3271
02:57:38.130 --> 02:57:40.630
which this ass now o'er-reaches;

3272
02:57:40.630 --> 02:57:43.600
one that would circumvent God, might it not?

3273
02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:45.070
It might, my lord.

3274
02:57:45.070 --> 02:57:46.630
Or of a courtier;

3275
02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:49.200
which could say, "Good morrow, sweet lord!

3276
02:57:49.200 --> 02:57:51.130
How dost thou, sweet lord?"

3277
02:57:51.130 --> 02:57:54.200
This might be my lord such-a-one,

3278
02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:56.070
that praised my lord such-a-one's horse,

3279
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:57.700
when he meant to beg it; might it not?

3280
02:57:57.700 --> 02:57:59.630
Ay, my lord.

3281
02:57:59.630 --> 02:58:03.470
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's;

3282
02:58:03.470 --> 02:58:08.570
chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade.

3283
02:58:08.570 --> 02:58:10.970
Here's fine revolution, an' we had the trick to see't.

3284
02:58:10.970 --> 02:58:14.430
A spade, For and a shrouding sheet:

3285
02:58:14.430 --> 02:58:21.530
O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.

3286
02:58:23.370 --> 02:58:28.630
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?

3287
02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:30.470
Why does he suffer this rude knave now

3288
02:58:30.470 --> 02:58:33.330
to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel,

3289
02:58:33.330 --> 02:58:36.370
and will not tell him of his action of battery?

3290
02:58:36.370 --> 02:58:37.900
Hmm?

3291
02:58:39.600 --> 02:58:41.530
I will speak to this fellow.

3292
02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:46.570
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

3293
02:58:46.570 --> 02:58:48.470
Mine, sir.

3294
02:58:48.470 --> 02:58:54.000
O, a pit of clay for to be made For such a guest is meet.

3295
02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.600
Indeed I think it be thine; thou liest in't.

3296
02:58:56.600 --> 02:58:58.900
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it's not yours:

3297
02:58:58.900 --> 02:59:01.200
for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.

3298
02:59:01.200 --> 02:59:03.400
Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:

3299
02:59:03.400 --> 02:59:05.000
'tis for the dead, not for the quick;

3300
02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:06.100
therefore thou liest.

3301
02:59:06.100 --> 02:59:07.200
'Tis a quick lie, sir;

3302
02:59:07.200 --> 02:59:08.570
'twill away gain, from me to you.

3303
02:59:10.100 --> 02:59:11.530
What man dost thou dig it for?

3304
02:59:11.530 --> 02:59:12.700
For no man, sir.

3305
02:59:12.700 --> 02:59:13.800
What woman, then?

3306
02:59:13.800 --> 02:59:15.070
None, neither.

3307
02:59:15.070 --> 02:59:16.470
Who is to be buried in't?

3308
02:59:16.470 --> 02:59:21.000
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.

3309
02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.970
Absolute the knave is!

3310
02:59:23.970 --> 02:59:26.370
We must speak by the card or equivocation will undo us.

3311
02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.570
How long hast thou been a grave-maker?

3312
02:59:31.570 --> 02:59:33.070
Of all the days i' the year,

3313
02:59:33.070 --> 02:59:36.130
I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet

3314
02:59:36.130 --> 02:59:37.800
overcame Fortinbras.

3315
02:59:37.800 --> 02:59:39.470
How long is that since?

3316
02:59:39.470 --> 02:59:40.970
Cannot you tell that?

3317
02:59:40.970 --> 02:59:42.930
Every fool can tell that:

3318
02:59:42.930 --> 02:59:45.500
it was the very day that young Hamlet was born;

3319
02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:50.200
he that is mad and sent into England.

3320
02:59:50.200 --> 02:59:53.130
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

3321
02:59:53.130 --> 02:59:56.370
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;

3322
02:59:56.370 --> 02:59:59.070
or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.

3323
02:59:59.070 --> 03:00:00.330
Why?

3324
03:00:00.330 --> 03:00:01.800
'Twill a not be seen in him there;

3325
03:00:01.800 --> 03:00:05.230
there the men are as mad as he.

3326
03:00:05.230 --> 03:00:06.970
How came he mad?

3327
03:00:06.970 --> 03:00:09.230
Very strangely, they say.

3328
03:00:09.230 --> 03:00:10.700
How strangely?

3329
03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:12.330
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

3330
03:00:12.330 --> 03:00:13.600
Upon what ground?

3331
03:00:13.600 --> 03:00:15.470
Why, here in Denmark:

3332
03:00:15.470 --> 03:00:22.930
I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.

3333
03:00:22.930 --> 03:00:25.830
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?

3334
03:00:25.830 --> 03:00:30.030
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--

3335
03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:33.230
as we have many pocky corses now-a-days,

3336
03:00:33.230 --> 03:00:35.370
will scarce hold the laying in.

3337
03:00:35.370 --> 03:00:37.830
He'll last you some eight year or nine year.

3338
03:00:37.830 --> 03:00:40.100
A tanner will last you nine year.

3339
03:00:40.100 --> 03:00:41.800
Why he more than another?

3340
03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:45.100
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade

3341
03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:47.700
that it will keep out water a great while;

3342
03:00:47.700 --> 03:00:56.430
and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.

3343
03:00:56.430 --> 03:00:58.670
Here's a skull now;

3344
03:00:58.670 --> 03:01:01.500
lain in the earth three and twenty years.

3345
03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:02.800
Whose was it?

3346
03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:04.730
A whoreson mad fellow's it was:

3347
03:01:04.730 --> 03:01:06.600
whose do you think it was?

3348
03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:08.600
Nay, I know not.

3349
03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:12.600
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue!

3350
03:01:12.600 --> 03:01:15.230
Poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once.

3351
03:01:15.230 --> 03:01:20.600
This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick's skull,

3352
03:01:20.600 --> 03:01:21.830
the king's jester.

3353
03:01:21.830 --> 03:01:22.930
This?

3354
03:01:22.930 --> 03:01:24.530
E'en that.

3355
03:01:24.530 --> 03:01:26.400
Let me see.

3356
03:01:31.230 --> 03:01:35.670
Alas, poor Yorick!

3357
03:01:38.030 --> 03:01:41.600
I knew him, Horatio:

3358
03:01:41.600 --> 03:01:46.570
a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy:

3359
03:01:46.570 --> 03:01:53.400
he hath borne me on his back a thousand times;

3360
03:01:53.400 --> 03:01:57.330
and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!

3361
03:01:59.270 --> 03:02:01.170
My gorge rises at it.

3362
03:02:01.170 --> 03:02:06.000
Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft.

3363
03:02:06.000 --> 03:02:08.630
Where be your gibes now?

3364
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:09.770
Your gambols?

3365
03:02:09.770 --> 03:02:10.870
Your songs?

3366
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:13.400
Your flashes of merriment,

3367
03:02:13.400 --> 03:02:16.700
that were wont to set the table on a roar?

3368
03:02:16.700 --> 03:02:20.930
Not one now, to mock your own grinning?

3369
03:02:20.930 --> 03:02:24.670
Quite chap-fallen?

3370
03:02:24.670 --> 03:02:27.930
Now get you to my lady's chamber,

3371
03:02:27.930 --> 03:02:32.270
and tell her, let her paint an inch thick,

3372
03:02:32.270 --> 03:02:40.170
to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that.

3373
03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:48.170
Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.

3374
03:02:48.170 --> 03:02:50.370
What's that, my lord?

3375
03:02:50.370 --> 03:02:55.600
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?

3376
03:02:55.600 --> 03:02:57.630
E'en so, my lord.

3377
03:02:57.630 --> 03:02:59.430
And smelt so?

3378
03:02:59.430 --> 03:03:00.870
Pah!

3379
03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:02.900
E'en so.

3380
03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:06.870
To what base uses we may return, Horatio!

3381
03:03:06.870 --> 03:03:09.830
Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,

3382
03:03:09.830 --> 03:03:12.800
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?

3383
03:03:12.800 --> 03:03:15.970
'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.

3384
03:03:15.970 --> 03:03:18.000
No, faith, not a jot as thus:

3385
03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:20.970
Alexander died, Alexander was buried,

3386
03:03:20.970 --> 03:03:23.430
Alexander returneth into dust;

3387
03:03:23.430 --> 03:03:28.300
the dust is earth; of earth we make loam;

3388
03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:31.370
and why of that loam, whereto he was converted,

3389
03:03:31.370 --> 03:03:35.800
might they not stop a beer-barrel?

3390
03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:41.530
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,

3391
03:03:41.530 --> 03:03:46.300
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:

3392
03:03:46.300 --> 03:03:51.100
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,

3393
03:03:51.100 --> 03:03:56.570
Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!

3394
03:03:58.730 --> 03:04:00.270
Soft!

3395
03:04:00.270 --> 03:04:02.500
Soft awhile!

3396
03:04:02.500 --> 03:04:04.700
Here comes the king, the queen, the courtiers.

3397
03:04:04.700 --> 03:04:05.800
Who is this they follow?

3398
03:04:05.800 --> 03:04:07.230
And with such maimed rites?

3399
03:04:07.230 --> 03:04:09.000
This doth betoken The corse they follow

3400
03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
did with desperate hand Fordo it own life:

3401
03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:12.870
'twas of some estate.

3402
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:14.600
Couch we awhile, and mark.

3403
03:04:55.400 --> 03:04:56.530
What ceremony else?

3404
03:04:56.530 --> 03:05:00.630
That is Laertes, A very noble youth: mark.

3405
03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:02.770
What ceremony else?

3406
03:05:02.770 --> 03:05:06.300
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warrantise:

3407
03:05:06.300 --> 03:05:08.430
her death was doubtful;

3408
03:05:08.430 --> 03:05:11.270
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,

3409
03:05:11.270 --> 03:05:13.830
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged

3410
03:05:13.830 --> 03:05:15.830
Till the last trumpet:

3411
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:18.330
for charitable prayers, Shards, flints and pebbles

3412
03:05:18.330 --> 03:05:20.000
should be thrown on her;

3413
03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.530
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,

3414
03:05:22.530 --> 03:05:24.000
Her maiden strewments

3415
03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.770
and the bringing home Of bell and burial.

3416
03:05:26.770 --> 03:05:28.730
Must there no more be done?

3417
03:05:28.730 --> 03:05:30.600
No more be done:

3418
03:05:30.600 --> 03:05:35.730
We should profane the service of the dead To sing such requiem

3419
03:05:35.730 --> 03:05:39.730
and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.

3420
03:05:42.870 --> 03:05:44.370
Lay her i' the earth.

3421
03:05:47.170 --> 03:05:49.800
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

3422
03:05:49.800 --> 03:05:52.070
May violets spring!

3423
03:05:52.070 --> 03:05:55.370
I tell thee, churlish priest,

3424
03:05:55.370 --> 03:05:57.600
A ministering angel shall my sister be,

3425
03:05:57.600 --> 03:05:58.870
When thou liest howling.

3426
03:05:58.870 --> 03:06:00.630
What, the fair Ophelia!

3427
03:06:03.100 --> 03:06:10.070
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!

3428
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:14.200
I hoped thou wouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;

3429
03:06:14.200 --> 03:06:19.270
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,

3430
03:06:19.270 --> 03:06:21.630
And not have strew'd thy grave.

3431
03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:28.830
O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,

3432
03:06:28.830 --> 03:06:29.970
Whose wicked deed

3433
03:06:29.970 --> 03:06:32.730
thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of!

3434
03:06:32.730 --> 03:06:35.270
Hold off the earth awhile,

3435
03:06:35.270 --> 03:06:38.800
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:

3436
03:06:56.170 --> 03:07:00.700
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,

3437
03:07:00.700 --> 03:07:03.600
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,

3438
03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:05.330
To o'ertop old Pelion,

3439
03:07:05.330 --> 03:07:07.100
or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.

3440
03:07:07.100 --> 03:07:11.630
What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis?

3441
03:07:11.630 --> 03:07:14.200
Whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars

3442
03:07:14.200 --> 03:07:17.870
and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers?

3443
03:07:17.870 --> 03:07:21.170
This is I, Hamlet the Dane.

3444
03:07:21.170 --> 03:07:24.170
The devil take thy soul!

3445
03:07:24.170 --> 03:07:26.500
Thou pray'st not well.

3446
03:07:26.500 --> 03:07:28.330
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;

3447
03:07:28.330 --> 03:07:29.430
Pluck them asunder.

3448
03:07:29.430 --> 03:07:31.130
Hamlet, Hamlet!

3449
03:07:31.130 --> 03:07:32.430
Be quiet!

3450
03:07:32.430 --> 03:07:34.200
I will fight with him upon this theme

3451
03:07:34.200 --> 03:07:36.830
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

3452
03:07:36.830 --> 03:07:38.630
O my son, what theme?

3453
03:07:38.630 --> 03:07:41.330
I loved Ophelia!

3454
03:07:41.330 --> 03:07:43.370
Forty thousand brothers Could not,

3455
03:07:43.370 --> 03:07:46.830
with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum.

3456
03:07:46.830 --> 03:07:48.230
What wilt thou do for her?

3457
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:50.000
O, he's mad, Laertes.

3458
03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:51.270
For love of God, forbear him.

3459
03:07:51.270 --> 03:07:53.370
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do: Woo't weep?

3460
03:07:53.370 --> 03:07:54.630
Woo't fight?

3461
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:55.730
Woo't fast?

3462
03:07:55.730 --> 03:07:56.870
Woo't tear thyself?

3463
03:07:56.870 --> 03:07:58.970
Woo't drink up eisel?

3464
03:07:58.970 --> 03:08:00.570
Eat a crocodile?

3465
03:08:00.570 --> 03:08:01.970
I'll do't.

3466
03:08:01.970 --> 03:08:04.000
Dost thou come here to whine?

3467
03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:07.370
To outface me with leaping in her grave?

3468
03:08:07.370 --> 03:08:10.970
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:

3469
03:08:10.970 --> 03:08:13.070
And, if thou prate of mountains,

3470
03:08:13.070 --> 03:08:16.530
let them throw Millions of acres on us,

3471
03:08:16.530 --> 03:08:19.630
till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone,

3472
03:08:19.630 --> 03:08:21.800
Make Ossa like a wart!

3473
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:29.600
Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou.

3474
03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:31.170
This is mere madness:

3475
03:08:31.170 --> 03:08:33.500
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;

3476
03:08:33.500 --> 03:08:35.230
Anon, as patient as the female dove,

3477
03:08:35.230 --> 03:08:37.300
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,

3478
03:08:37.300 --> 03:08:41.370
His silence will sit drooping.

3479
03:08:41.370 --> 03:08:43.800
Hear you, sir;

3480
03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:47.030
What is the reason that you use me thus?

3481
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:52.330
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;

3482
03:08:52.330 --> 03:08:56.970
Let Hercules himself do what he may,

3483
03:08:56.970 --> 03:09:03.700
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.

3484
03:09:03.700 --> 03:09:05.700
I pray you, good Horatio, wait on him.

3485
03:09:08.800 --> 03:09:12.400
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;

3486
03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:14.470
We'll put the matter to the present push.

3487
03:09:17.530 --> 03:09:20.330
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.

3488
03:09:26.330 --> 03:09:30.600
This grave shall have a living monument:

3489
03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:32.870
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;

3490
03:09:32.870 --> 03:09:36.300
Till then, in patience our proceedings be.

3491
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:42.130
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;

3492
03:09:42.130 --> 03:09:43.900
You do remember all the circumstance?

3493
03:09:43.900 --> 03:09:45.400
Remember it, my lord?

3494
03:09:45.400 --> 03:09:47.430
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting

3495
03:09:47.430 --> 03:09:49.670
That would not let me sleep:

3496
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:53.270
methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes.

3497
03:09:53.270 --> 03:09:57.630
Rashly, And praised be rashness for it, let us know,

3498
03:09:57.630 --> 03:09:59.870
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well

3499
03:09:59.870 --> 03:10:04.970
When our deep plots do pall: and that should learn us

3500
03:10:04.970 --> 03:10:07.270
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,

3501
03:10:07.270 --> 03:10:08.700
Rough-hew them how we will.

3502
03:10:08.700 --> 03:10:10.600
That is most certain.

3503
03:10:10.600 --> 03:10:13.470
Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarf'd about me,

3504
03:10:13.470 --> 03:10:15.900
in the dark Groped I to find out them; had my desire.

3505
03:10:15.900 --> 03:10:17.100
Finger'd their packet,

3506
03:10:17.100 --> 03:10:19.430
and in fine withdrew To mine own room again;

3507
03:10:19.430 --> 03:10:22.730
making so bold, My fears forgetting manners,

3508
03:10:22.730 --> 03:10:25.200
to unseal Their grand commission;

3509
03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:28.770
where I found, Horatio,-- O royal knavery!--

3510
03:10:28.770 --> 03:10:30.170
an exact command,

3511
03:10:30.170 --> 03:10:32.130
Larded with many several sorts of reasons

3512
03:10:32.130 --> 03:10:36.030
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,

3513
03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:37.430
With, ho!

3514
03:10:37.430 --> 03:10:39.870
Such bugs and goblins in my life,

3515
03:10:39.870 --> 03:10:42.770
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,

3516
03:10:42.770 --> 03:10:45.500
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,

3517
03:10:45.500 --> 03:10:47.670
My head should be struck off.

3518
03:10:47.670 --> 03:10:49.130
Is't possible?

3519
03:10:49.130 --> 03:10:51.670
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.

3520
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:53.430
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?

3521
03:10:53.430 --> 03:10:54.700
I do beseech you.

3522
03:10:54.700 --> 03:10:56.870
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--

3523
03:10:56.870 --> 03:11:01.230
I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:

3524
03:11:01.230 --> 03:11:03.570
I once did hold it, as our statists do,

3525
03:11:03.570 --> 03:11:05.470
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much

3526
03:11:05.470 --> 03:11:06.730
How to forget that learning,

3527
03:11:06.730 --> 03:11:10.030
but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service:

3528
03:11:10.030 --> 03:11:11.870
wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?

3529
03:11:11.870 --> 03:11:13.000
Ay, good my lord.

3530
03:11:13.000 --> 03:11:15.270
An earnest conjuration from the king,

3531
03:11:15.270 --> 03:11:18.500
As England was his faithful tributary,

3532
03:11:18.500 --> 03:11:23.000
As love between them like the palm might flourish,

3533
03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:26.130
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear

3534
03:11:26.130 --> 03:11:28.430
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,

3535
03:11:28.430 --> 03:11:31.100
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,

3536
03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:34.330
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,

3537
03:11:34.330 --> 03:11:36.500
Without debatement further, more or less,

3538
03:11:36.500 --> 03:11:40.200
He should those bearers put to sudden death,

3539
03:11:40.200 --> 03:11:45.600
Not shriving-time allow'd.

3540
03:11:45.600 --> 03:11:47.430
How was this seal'd?

3541
03:11:47.430 --> 03:11:49.670
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.

3542
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:51.930
I had my father's signet in my purse,

3543
03:11:51.930 --> 03:11:55.370
Which was the model of that Danish seal.

3544
03:11:55.370 --> 03:12:00.900
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

3545
03:12:00.900 --> 03:12:05.470
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;

3546
03:12:05.470 --> 03:12:08.330
They are not near my conscience;

3547
03:12:08.330 --> 03:12:12.130
their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow:

3548
03:12:12.130 --> 03:12:14.130
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature

3549
03:12:14.130 --> 03:12:16.970
comes Between the pass and fell incensed points

3550
03:12:16.970 --> 03:12:20.570
Of mighty opposites.

3551
03:12:20.570 --> 03:12:22.030
Why, what a king is this!

3552
03:12:22.030 --> 03:12:24.500
Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon--

3553
03:12:24.500 --> 03:12:28.700
He that hath kill'd my king, whored my mother,

3554
03:12:28.700 --> 03:12:30.630
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,

3555
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:32.400
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,

3556
03:12:32.400 --> 03:12:33.770
And with such cozenage--

3557
03:12:33.770 --> 03:12:36.800
is't not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm?

3558
03:12:36.800 --> 03:12:39.600
and is't not to be damn'd,

3559
03:12:39.600 --> 03:12:41.330
To let this canker of our nature

3560
03:12:41.330 --> 03:12:42.870
come In further evil?

3561
03:12:50.770 --> 03:12:52.700
It must be shortly known to him from England

3562
03:12:52.700 --> 03:12:54.530
What is the issue of the business there.

3563
03:12:57.700 --> 03:13:03.770
It will be short: the interim is mine;

3564
03:13:03.770 --> 03:13:05.730
And a man's life's no more than to say, "One."

3565
03:13:07.970 --> 03:13:09.500
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,

3566
03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:11.430
That to Laertes I forgot myself;

3567
03:13:11.430 --> 03:13:17.100
For, by the image of my cause, I see The portraiture of his:

3568
03:13:17.100 --> 03:13:18.300
I'll court his favours.

3569
03:13:18.300 --> 03:13:20.130
But, sure, the bravery of his grief

3570
03:13:20.130 --> 03:13:22.200
did put me Into a towering passion.

3571
03:13:22.200 --> 03:13:23.300
Peace!

3572
03:13:23.300 --> 03:13:24.970
Who comes here?

3573
03:13:24.970 --> 03:13:27.170
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

3574
03:13:27.170 --> 03:13:30.030
I humbly thank you, sir.

3575
03:13:30.030 --> 03:13:32.230
Dost know this water-fly?

3576
03:13:32.230 --> 03:13:33.630
No, good my lord.

3577
03:13:33.630 --> 03:13:36.130
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him.

3578
03:13:36.130 --> 03:13:39.170
He hath much land, and fertile.

3579
03:13:39.170 --> 03:13:40.670
'Tis a chough; but, as I say,

3580
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:42.300
spacious in the possession of dirt.

3581
03:13:42.300 --> 03:13:45.500
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure,

3582
03:13:45.500 --> 03:13:48.430
I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

3583
03:13:48.430 --> 03:13:50.930
I shall receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit.

3584
03:13:50.930 --> 03:13:53.000
Put your bonnet to his right use;

3585
03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:55.000
'tis for the head.

3586
03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:56.970
I thank your lordship. It is very hot.

3587
03:13:56.970 --> 03:14:02.800
No, believe me, it's very cold; the wind is northerly.

3588
03:14:02.800 --> 03:14:05.700
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

3589
03:14:05.700 --> 03:14:08.170
And yet methinks it is very sultry and hot

3590
03:14:08.170 --> 03:14:10.500
for my complexion.

3591
03:14:10.500 --> 03:14:13.270
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--

3592
03:14:13.270 --> 03:14:19.170
as 'twere,-- I cannot tell how.

3593
03:14:19.170 --> 03:14:22.900
But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you

3594
03:14:22.900 --> 03:14:26.700
that he has laid a great wager on your head:

3595
03:14:26.700 --> 03:14:27.930
sir, this is the matter,--

3596
03:14:27.930 --> 03:14:29.700
I beseech you, sir, remember--

3597
03:14:29.700 --> 03:14:35.570
Nay, good my lord; for my ease, in good faith.

3598
03:14:35.570 --> 03:14:42.030
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes;

3599
03:14:42.030 --> 03:14:44.800
believe me, an absolute gentleman,

3600
03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:46.600
full of most excellent differences,

3601
03:14:46.600 --> 03:14:49.370
of very soft society and great showing:

3602
03:14:49.370 --> 03:14:51.800
indeed, to speak feelingly of him,

3603
03:14:51.800 --> 03:14:54.670
he is the card or calendar of gentry,

3604
03:14:54.670 --> 03:14:56.400
for you shall find in him the continent

3605
03:14:56.400 --> 03:14:58.330
of what part a gentleman would see.

3606
03:14:58.330 --> 03:15:02.930
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;

3607
03:15:02.930 --> 03:15:05.070
though, I know, to divide him inventorially

3608
03:15:05.070 --> 03:15:06.800
would dizzy the arithmetic of memory,

3609
03:15:06.800 --> 03:15:09.730
and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.

3610
03:15:09.730 --> 03:15:11.730
But, in the verity of extolment,

3611
03:15:11.730 --> 03:15:14.030
I take him to be a soul of great article;

3612
03:15:14.030 --> 03:15:17.170
and his infusion of such dearth and rareness,

3613
03:15:17.170 --> 03:15:22.970
as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror;

3614
03:15:22.970 --> 03:15:26.870
and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.

3615
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:30.230
O, Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

3616
03:15:30.230 --> 03:15:31.900
The concernancy, sir?

3617
03:15:31.900 --> 03:15:35.200
Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?

3618
03:15:36.470 --> 03:15:38.070
Sir?

3619
03:15:38.070 --> 03:15:42.000
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?

3620
03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:43.270
You will do't, sir, really.

3621
03:15:43.270 --> 03:15:45.930
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

3622
03:15:45.930 --> 03:15:49.330
Of Laertes?

3623
03:15:49.330 --> 03:15:53.400
His purse is empty already; all his golden words are spent.

3624
03:15:53.400 --> 03:15:54.870
Of him, sir.

3625
03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:56.070
I know you are not ignorant.

3626
03:15:56.070 --> 03:15:57.570
I would you did;

3627
03:15:57.570 --> 03:16:00.230
and yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me.

3628
03:16:00.230 --> 03:16:01.570
Well, sir?

3629
03:16:01.570 --> 03:16:05.130
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is.

3630
03:16:05.130 --> 03:16:07.400
I dare not confess that,

3631
03:16:07.400 --> 03:16:10.530
lest I should compare with him in excellence;

3632
03:16:10.530 --> 03:16:13.670
but, to know a man well were to know himself.

3633
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:15.700
I mean, sir, for his weapon;

3634
03:16:15.700 --> 03:16:17.700
but in the imputation laid on him by them,

3635
03:16:17.700 --> 03:16:19.030
in his meed he's unfellowed.

3636
03:16:20.700 --> 03:16:22.300
What's his weapon?

3637
03:16:22.300 --> 03:16:25.900
Rapier and dagger.

3638
03:16:25.900 --> 03:16:30.130
That's two of his weapons: but, well.

3639
03:16:30.130 --> 03:16:32.330
The king, sir, hath laid, sir,

3640
03:16:32.330 --> 03:16:34.470
that in a dozen passes between yourself and him,

3641
03:16:34.470 --> 03:16:36.830
he shall not exceed you three hits:

3642
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:38.330
he hath laid on twelve for nine;

3643
03:16:38.330 --> 03:16:40.000
and it would come to immediate trial,

3644
03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:42.230
if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

3645
03:16:44.700 --> 03:16:47.900
How if I answer "no"?

3646
03:16:50.730 --> 03:16:55.570
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

3647
03:16:57.200 --> 03:16:59.700
Sir, I will walk here in the hall:

3648
03:16:59.700 --> 03:17:01.430
if it please his majesty,

3649
03:17:01.430 --> 03:17:03.770
'tis the breathing time of day with me;

3650
03:17:03.770 --> 03:17:06.530
let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing,

3651
03:17:06.530 --> 03:17:11.270
and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an' I can;

3652
03:17:11.270 --> 03:17:17.100
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

3653
03:17:17.100 --> 03:17:18.470
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

3654
03:17:18.470 --> 03:17:21.270
To this effect.

3655
03:17:21.270 --> 03:17:25.370
After what flourish your nature will.

3656
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:27.900
I commend my duty to your lordship.

3657
03:17:27.900 --> 03:17:29.430
Yours, yours.

3658
03:17:43.470 --> 03:17:45.800
He does well to commend it himself;

3659
03:17:45.800 --> 03:17:50.430
there are no tongues else for's turn.

3660
03:17:50.430 --> 03:17:54.500
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

3661
03:17:54.500 --> 03:17:57.930
He did comply so with his dug before he sucked it.

3662
03:17:57.930 --> 03:17:59.500
You will lose this wager, my lord.

3663
03:17:59.500 --> 03:18:03.930
I do not think so: since he went into France,

3664
03:18:03.930 --> 03:18:06.200
I have been in continual practice:

3665
03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:09.230
I shall win at the odds.

3666
03:18:09.230 --> 03:18:13.000
But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart:

3667
03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:14.200
but it is no matter.

3668
03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:15.530
Nay, good my lord.

3669
03:18:15.530 --> 03:18:16.570
It is but foolery.

3670
03:18:18.700 --> 03:18:20.430
But yet it is such a kind of gain-giving

3671
03:18:20.430 --> 03:18:23.070
as would perhaps trouble a woman.

3672
03:18:23.070 --> 03:18:28.170
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it:

3673
03:18:28.170 --> 03:18:29.670
I will forestall their repair hither

3674
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:30.830
and say you are not fit.

3675
03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:33.500
Not a whit, we defy augury.

3676
03:18:35.230 --> 03:18:37.970
There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.

3677
03:18:40.170 --> 03:18:43.630
If it be now, 'tis not to come;

3678
03:18:43.630 --> 03:18:47.570
if it be not to come, it will be now;

3679
03:18:47.570 --> 03:18:54.400
if it be not now, yet it will come:

3680
03:18:54.400 --> 03:18:57.830
the readiness is all.

3681
03:18:57.830 --> 03:19:00.770
Let be.

3682
03:19:00.770 --> 03:19:04.830
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

3683
03:19:04.830 --> 03:19:08.300
Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong;

3684
03:19:08.300 --> 03:19:10.930
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.

3685
03:19:10.930 --> 03:19:14.200
This presence knows, And you must needs have heard,

3686
03:19:14.200 --> 03:19:16.770
how I am punish'd With a sore distraction.

3687
03:19:16.770 --> 03:19:18.170
What I have done,

3688
03:19:18.170 --> 03:19:21.130
That might your nature, honour, and exception Roughly awake,

3689
03:19:21.130 --> 03:19:26.230
I here proclaim was madness.

3690
03:19:26.230 --> 03:19:27.970
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes?

3691
03:19:27.970 --> 03:19:31.070
Never Hamlet: If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,

3692
03:19:31.070 --> 03:19:34.370
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,

3693
03:19:34.370 --> 03:19:36.970
Hamlet does it not; Hamlet denies it.

3694
03:19:36.970 --> 03:19:38.700
Who does it, then?

3695
03:19:38.700 --> 03:19:41.170
His madness: if't be so,

3696
03:19:41.170 --> 03:19:43.500
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;

3697
03:19:43.500 --> 03:19:46.030
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.

3698
03:19:46.030 --> 03:19:47.400
Sir, in this audience,

3699
03:19:47.400 --> 03:19:49.970
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil

3700
03:19:49.970 --> 03:19:52.400
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,

3701
03:19:52.400 --> 03:19:56.730
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,

3702
03:19:56.730 --> 03:19:58.970
And hurt my brother.

3703
03:19:58.970 --> 03:20:01.400
I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case,

3704
03:20:01.400 --> 03:20:03.430
should stir me most To my revenge:

3705
03:20:03.430 --> 03:20:06.500
but in my terms of honour I stand aloof;

3706
03:20:06.500 --> 03:20:09.430
and will no reconcilement,

3707
03:20:09.430 --> 03:20:11.700
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,

3708
03:20:11.700 --> 03:20:13.530
I have a voice and precedent of peace,

3709
03:20:13.530 --> 03:20:15.500
To keep my name ungored.

3710
03:20:15.500 --> 03:20:19.830
But till that time, I do receive your offer'd love like love,

3711
03:20:19.830 --> 03:20:21.100
And will not wrong it.

3712
03:20:21.100 --> 03:20:23.470
I embrace it freely;

3713
03:20:23.470 --> 03:20:26.070
And will this brother's wager frankly play.

3714
03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:27.170
Give us the foils.

3715
03:20:27.170 --> 03:20:28.270
Come on.

3716
03:20:28.270 --> 03:20:29.770
Come, one for me.

3717
03:20:29.770 --> 03:20:31.530
I'll be your foil, Laertes:

3718
03:20:31.530 --> 03:20:33.200
in mine ignorance Your skill shall,

3719
03:20:33.200 --> 03:20:34.870
like a star i' the darkest night,

3720
03:20:34.870 --> 03:20:36.470
Stick fiery off indeed.

3721
03:20:36.470 --> 03:20:37.630
You mock me, sir.

3722
03:20:37.630 --> 03:20:40.230
No, by this hand.

3723
03:20:40.230 --> 03:20:42.530
Give them the foils, young Osric.

3724
03:20:42.530 --> 03:20:44.200
Hamlet, You know the wager?

3725
03:20:44.200 --> 03:20:45.530
Very well, my lord.

3726
03:20:45.530 --> 03:20:48.200
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

3727
03:20:48.200 --> 03:20:50.730
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:

3728
03:20:50.730 --> 03:20:53.300
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

3729
03:20:53.300 --> 03:20:54.970
This is too heavy. Let me see another.

3730
03:20:54.970 --> 03:20:57.170
This likes me well.

3731
03:20:57.170 --> 03:20:59.730
These foils have all a length?

3732
03:20:59.730 --> 03:21:00.800
Ay, my good lord.

3733
03:21:03.670 --> 03:21:06.500
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.

3734
03:21:06.500 --> 03:21:09.000
If Hamlet make the first or second hit

3735
03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:10.830
Or quit in answer of the third exchanges,

3736
03:21:10.830 --> 03:21:13.870
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:

3737
03:21:13.870 --> 03:21:17.570
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;

3738
03:21:17.570 --> 03:21:21.570
And in the cup an union shall he throw,

3739
03:21:21.570 --> 03:21:23.700
Richer than that which four successive kings

3740
03:21:23.700 --> 03:21:27.170
In Denmark's crown have worn.

3741
03:21:27.170 --> 03:21:28.530
Give me the cup;

3742
03:21:32.470 --> 03:21:34.600
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,

3743
03:21:34.600 --> 03:21:37.130
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,

3744
03:21:37.130 --> 03:21:40.800
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,

3745
03:21:40.800 --> 03:21:43.730
"Now the king drinks to Hamlet."

3746
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:54.400
Come, begin: And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

3747
03:22:01.870 --> 03:22:03.130
Come on, sir.

3748
03:22:03.130 --> 03:22:05.470
Come, my lord.

3749
03:22:11.600 --> 03:22:12.700
One.

3750
03:22:12.700 --> 03:22:13.800
No.

3751
03:22:13.800 --> 03:22:15.100
Judgment.

3752
03:22:15.100 --> 03:22:16.630
A hit, a very palpable hit.

3753
03:22:17.400 --> 03:22:18.600
Well; again.

3754
03:22:18.600 --> 03:22:21.170
Stay; give me drink.

3755
03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:28.570
Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health.

3756
03:22:35.700 --> 03:22:37.670
Give him the cup.

3757
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:40.430
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.

3758
03:22:40.430 --> 03:22:41.870
Come.

3759
03:23:21.830 --> 03:23:23.370
Another hit. What say you?

3760
03:23:23.370 --> 03:23:26.500
A touch, a touch, I do confess.

3761
03:23:27.370 --> 03:23:29.100
Our son shall win.

3762
03:23:29.100 --> 03:23:30.400
He's fat, and scant of breath.

3763
03:23:30.400 --> 03:23:35.870
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;

3764
03:23:35.870 --> 03:23:37.930
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

3765
03:23:37.930 --> 03:23:39.100
Good madam!

3766
03:23:39.100 --> 03:23:42.130
Gertrude, do not drink.

3767
03:23:42.130 --> 03:23:45.300
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

3768
03:23:47.800 --> 03:23:51.830
It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.

3769
03:23:51.830 --> 03:23:54.000
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

3770
03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:57.930
Come, let me wipe thy face.

3771
03:23:57.930 --> 03:23:59.970
My lord, I'll hit him now.

3772
03:23:59.970 --> 03:24:02.170
I do not think't.

3773
03:24:04.100 --> 03:24:06.670
And yet it is almost against my conscience.

3774
03:24:08.070 --> 03:24:10.230
Come, for the third, Laertes.

3775
03:24:10.230 --> 03:24:14.070
You but dally; I pray you, pass with your best violence;

3776
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:17.430
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

3777
03:24:17.430 --> 03:24:19.170
Say you so?

3778
03:24:19.170 --> 03:24:21.530
Come on.

3779
03:24:37.270 --> 03:24:39.630
Nothing, neither way.

3780
03:24:47.900 --> 03:24:49.330
Have at you now!

3781
03:25:04.230 --> 03:25:05.530
Part them; they're incensed.

3782
03:25:05.530 --> 03:25:07.000
Nay, come, again.

3783
03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:27.270
Look to the queen there, ho!

3784
03:25:27.270 --> 03:25:28.370
They bleed on both sides.

3785
03:25:28.370 --> 03:25:29.470
How is it, my lord?

3786
03:25:29.470 --> 03:25:30.870
How is't, Laertes?

3787
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:34.000
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;

3788
03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:37.430
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

3789
03:25:37.430 --> 03:25:38.530
How does the queen?

3790
03:25:38.530 --> 03:25:41.100
She swounds to see them bleed.

3791
03:25:41.100 --> 03:25:47.400
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--

3792
03:25:47.400 --> 03:25:50.300
The drink, the drink!

3793
03:25:50.300 --> 03:25:54.670
I am poison'd.

3794
03:25:54.670 --> 03:25:56.330
O villany!

3795
03:25:56.330 --> 03:25:57.430
Ho!

3796
03:25:57.430 --> 03:25:59.330
Let the doors be lock'd: Treachery!

3797
03:25:59.330 --> 03:26:00.500
Seek it out.

3798
03:26:00.500 --> 03:26:02.800
It is here, Hamlet:

3799
03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:06.630
Hamlet, thou art slain;

3800
03:26:06.630 --> 03:26:09.400
No medicine in the world can do thee good;

3801
03:26:09.400 --> 03:26:12.670
In thee there is not half an hour's life;

3802
03:26:12.670 --> 03:26:15.570
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,

3803
03:26:15.570 --> 03:26:18.500
Unbated and envenom'd.

3804
03:26:21.130 --> 03:26:27.170
The foul practice Hath turn'd itself on me.

3805
03:26:27.170 --> 03:26:32.000
Lo, here I lie, Never to rise again:

3806
03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:38.700
thy mother's poison'd: I can no more.

3807
03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:43.670
The king, the king's to blame.

3808
03:26:43.670 --> 03:26:47.000
The point!--envenom'd too!

3809
03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:52.630
Then, venom, to thy work.

3810
03:26:52.630 --> 03:26:54.900
Treason!

3811
03:26:54.900 --> 03:26:57.370
Treason!

3812
03:26:57.370 --> 03:27:01.300
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

3813
03:27:01.300 --> 03:27:04.800
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,

3814
03:27:04.800 --> 03:27:06.400
Drink off this potion.

3815
03:27:06.400 --> 03:27:08.270
Is thy union here?

3816
03:27:08.270 --> 03:27:10.830
Follow my mother.

3817
03:27:13.530 --> 03:27:15.900
He is justly served;

3818
03:27:15.900 --> 03:27:18.470
It is a poison temper'd by him--

3819
03:27:20.530 --> 03:27:25.030
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:

3820
03:27:25.030 --> 03:27:28.070
Mine and my father's death come not on thee,

3821
03:27:28.070 --> 03:27:30.500
Nor thine on me.

3822
03:27:33.470 --> 03:27:36.100
Heaven make thee free of it!

3823
03:27:36.100 --> 03:27:38.900
I follow thee.

3824
03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:41.830
I am dead, Horatio.

3825
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:45.600
Wretched queen, adieu!

3826
03:27:47.530 --> 03:27:53.070
You that look pale and tremble at this chance

3827
03:27:53.070 --> 03:27:56.930
That are but mutes or audience to this act,

3828
03:27:56.930 --> 03:28:00.730
Had I but time-- as this fell sergeant, death,

3829
03:28:00.730 --> 03:28:04.900
Is strict in his arrest-- I could tell you--

3830
03:28:04.900 --> 03:28:07.730
But let it be.

3831
03:28:07.730 --> 03:28:14.800
Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest;

3832
03:28:14.800 --> 03:28:18.570
report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.

3833
03:28:18.570 --> 03:28:22.670
Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:

3834
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:23.930
Here's yet some liquor left.

3835
03:28:23.930 --> 03:28:25.770
As thou'rt a man, Give me the cup.

3836
03:28:25.770 --> 03:28:27.030
Let go; by heaven.

3837
03:28:27.030 --> 03:28:28.800
O God Horatio,

3838
03:28:28.800 --> 03:28:30.530
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart

3839
03:28:30.530 --> 03:28:33.100
Absent thee from felicity awhile,

3840
03:28:33.100 --> 03:28:37.370
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,

3841
03:28:37.370 --> 03:28:40.170
To tell my story.

3842
03:28:43.270 --> 03:28:45.100
What warlike noise is this?

3843
03:28:45.100 --> 03:28:47.400
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,

3844
03:28:47.400 --> 03:28:50.000
To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.

3845
03:28:50.000 --> 03:28:54.100
O, I die, Horatio;

3846
03:28:54.100 --> 03:28:57.630
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:

3847
03:28:57.630 --> 03:29:01.700
I cannot live to hear the news from England;

3848
03:29:01.700 --> 03:29:07.370
But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras:

3849
03:29:07.370 --> 03:29:11.670
he has my dying voice;

3850
03:29:11.670 --> 03:29:16.030
So tell him, with the occurrents,

3851
03:29:16.030 --> 03:29:21.400
more and less, Which have solicited.

3852
03:29:26.470 --> 03:29:28.930
The rest is silence.

3853
03:29:41.900 --> 03:29:44.270
Now cracks a noble heart.

3854
03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:55.000
Good night, sweet prince.

3855
03:29:55.000 --> 03:29:57.400
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!

3856
03:30:00.370 --> 03:30:02.630
Why does the drum come hither?

3857
03:30:06.730 --> 03:30:08.000
Where is this sight?

3858
03:30:13.230 --> 03:30:16.530
What is it ye would see?

3859
03:30:16.530 --> 03:30:20.170
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

3860
03:30:20.170 --> 03:30:25.400
This quarry cries on havoc.

3861
03:30:25.400 --> 03:30:29.330
O proud death,

3862
03:30:29.330 --> 03:30:31.500
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,

3863
03:30:31.500 --> 03:30:34.070
That thou so many princes at a shot

3864
03:30:34.070 --> 03:30:36.730
So bloodily hast struck?

3865
03:30:36.730 --> 03:30:39.430
The sight is dismal;

3866
03:30:39.430 --> 03:30:43.300
And our affairs from England come too late:

3867
03:30:43.300 --> 03:30:46.670
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,

3868
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:49.500
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,

3869
03:30:49.500 --> 03:30:54.270
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:

3870
03:30:54.270 --> 03:30:57.370
Where should we have our thanks?

3871
03:30:57.370 --> 03:30:58.930
Not from his mouth,

3872
03:30:58.930 --> 03:31:01.670
Had it the ability of life to thank you:

3873
03:31:01.670 --> 03:31:06.070
He never gave commandment for their deaths.

3874
03:31:06.070 --> 03:31:09.870
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,

3875
03:31:09.870 --> 03:31:12.200
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,

3876
03:31:12.200 --> 03:31:15.600
Are here arrived give orders that these bodies

3877
03:31:15.600 --> 03:31:18.800
High on a stage be placed to the view;

3878
03:31:18.800 --> 03:31:21.530
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world

3879
03:31:21.530 --> 03:31:24.370
How these things came about:

3880
03:31:24.370 --> 03:31:29.030
so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,

3881
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:32.100
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,

3882
03:31:32.100 --> 03:31:37.330
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,

3883
03:31:37.330 --> 03:31:39.830
And, in this upshot,

3884
03:31:39.830 --> 03:31:45.700
purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' heads:

3885
03:31:45.700 --> 03:31:47.200
all this can I Truly deliver.

3886
03:31:47.200 --> 03:31:50.100
Let us haste to hear it.

3887
03:31:50.100 --> 03:31:51.600
Call the noblest to the audience.

3888
03:31:53.000 --> 03:31:59.000
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:

3889
03:31:59.000 --> 03:32:02.330
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,

3890
03:32:02.330 --> 03:32:05.370
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

3891
03:32:05.370 --> 03:32:09.430
That I shall have also cause to speak,

3892
03:32:09.430 --> 03:32:15.030
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.

3893
03:32:15.030 --> 03:32:16.970
Let this same be presently perform'd,

3894
03:32:16.970 --> 03:32:19.870
Even while men's minds are wild;

3895
03:32:19.870 --> 03:32:22.170
lest more mischance On plots and errors, happen.

3896
03:32:25.130 --> 03:32:29.770
Let four captains Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;

3897
03:32:29.770 --> 03:32:31.500
For he was likely, had he been put on,

3898
03:32:31.500 --> 03:32:33.000
To have proved most royal.

3899
03:32:38.170 --> 03:32:39.700
And for his passage,

3900
03:32:39.700 --> 03:32:44.300
The soldiers' music and the rites of war

3901
03:32:44.300 --> 03:32:46.200
Speak loudly for him.

3902
03:32:53.070 --> 03:32:54.800
Take up the bodies.

3903
03:32:56.970 --> 03:33:01.130
Such a sight as this Becomes the field,

3904
03:33:01.130 --> 03:33:03.930
but here shows much amiss.

3905
03:33:06.830 --> 03:33:09.800
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

3906
03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:39.600
