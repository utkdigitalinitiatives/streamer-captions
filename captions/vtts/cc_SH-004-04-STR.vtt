00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.870


2
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.670
Great duke of Lancaster,

3
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.870
I come to thee from plume plucked Richard,

4
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.800
who with willing soul adopts thee heir,

5
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.430
and his high scepter yields

6
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.570
to the possession of thy royal hand.

7
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.970
Ascend his throne, descending now from him,

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.330
and long live Henry, fourth of that name.

9
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.370
Long live Henry, fourth of that name.

10
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.830
In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.

11
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.900
Marry.

12
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.530
God forbid.

13
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.700
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,

14
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.900
yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.

15
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.170
Would God that any in this noble presence

16
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.400
were enough noble to be upright judge of noble Richard,

17
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.600
then true noblesse would

18
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.730
learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.

19
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.070
What subject can give sentence on his king?

20
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.600
And who stands here that is not Richard's subject?

21
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.230
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,

22
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.970
although apparent guilt be seen in them.

23
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
And shall the figure of God's majesty,

24
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.700
his captain, steward, deputy elect,

25
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.830
anointed, crowned, planted many years,

26
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.100
be judged by subject and inferior breath,

27
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130
and he himself not present?

28
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.370
Oh, forfend it, God,

29
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.130
that in a Christian climate

30
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.100
souls refined should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed.

31
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.100
Traitor!

32
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.600
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,

33
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.030
stirred up by God, thus boldly for his king.

34
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.530
My lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,

35
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.730
is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king.

36
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.770
And if you crown him, let me prophesy.

37
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.430
The blood of English shall manure the ground

38
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.730
and future ages groan for this foul act.

39
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.670
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels.

40
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.030
And in this seat of peace,

41
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.230
tumultuous wars shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound.

42
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.700
Disorder, horror, fear, and mutiny shall here inhabit,

43
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.100
and this land be called

44
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.570
the field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.

45
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.430
Oh, if you raise this house against this house,

46
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.430
it will the woefullest division prove

47
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.800
that ever fell upon this cursed earth.

48
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.930
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,

49
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.030
lest child, child's children, cry against you woe.

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.070
Well have you argued, sir,

51
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.430
and, for your pains, of capital treason we arrest you here.

52
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.700
My lord of Westminster,

53
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.430
be it your charge to keep him safely till his day of trial.

54
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.170
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.

55
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.370
Aye!

56
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.570
Fetch hither Richard, that in common view he may surrender,

57
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.930
so we shall proceed without suspicion.

58
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.470
I will be his conduct.

59
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.470
Alack, why am I sent for to a king

60
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.070
before I have shook off the regal thoughts

61
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.830
wherewith I reigned?

62
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.730
I hardly yet have learned

63
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.200
to insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.

64
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.100
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission.

65
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.200
Yet I well remember the favors of these men.

66
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.800
Were they not mine?

67
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.570
Did they not sometime cry, "all hail" to me?

68
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.230
So Judas did to Christ.

69
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.600
But he, in 12, found truth in all but 1.

70
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.370
I, in 12,000, none.

71
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.330
God save the king!

72
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.670
Will no man say amen?

73
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.770
Am I both priest and clerk?

74
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.500
Well, then, amen.

75
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.500
God save the king.

76
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.230
Although I be not he,

77
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.570
and yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.

78
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.870
To do what service am I sent for hither?

79
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.270
To do that office of thine own goodwill

80
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.800
which tired majesty did make thee offer:

81
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.270
the resignation of thy state and crown to Henry Bolingbroke.

82
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.730
Give me the crown.

83
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.970
Here, cousin, seize the crown.

84
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.770
Here, cousin.

85
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.330
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.

86
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.900
Now is this golden crown like a deep well

87
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.570
that owes two buckets, filling one another,

88
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.630
the emptier ever dancing in the air,

89
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.870
the other down, unseen, and full of water.

90
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.470
That bucket down and full of tears am I,

91
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.830
drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high.

92
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.700
I thought you had been willing to resign.

93
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:27.870
My crown I am, but still my griefs are mine.

94
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.430
You may my glories and my state depose,

95
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.070
but not my griefs.

96
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.600
Still am I king of those.

97
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.100
Part of your cares you give me with your crown.

98
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.300
Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.

99
00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.770
My care is loss of care, by old care done.

100
00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:54.600
Your care is gain of care, by new care won.

101
00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.300
The cares I give I have, though given away.

102
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.770
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.

103
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.730
Are you contented to resign the crown?

104
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.970
Aye.

105
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.270
No!

106
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.270
No.

107
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:36.030
Aye, for I must nothing be.

108
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:42.400
Therefore no, no, for I resign to thee.

109
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:49.200
Now, mark me, how I will undo myself.

110
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.530
I give this heavy weight from off my head

111
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.400
and this unwieldy scepter from my hand,

112
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.900
the pride of kingly sway from out my heart.

113
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.300
With mine own tears I wash away my balm.

114
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:24.570
With mine own hands I give away my crown.

115
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.930
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state.

116
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.270
With mine own breath release all duty's oaths.

117
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.570
All pomp and majesty I do forswear.

118
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.430
My manors, rents, revenues I forego.

119
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.400
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny.

120
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.970
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me.

121
00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:00.430
God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee.

122
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:08.230
Make me that nothing have with nothing grieved,

123
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:14.630
and thou with all pleased that hast all achieved.

124
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.200
Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,

125
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.000
and soon lie Richard in an earthly pit.

126
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:34.930
God save King Henry, unkinged Richard says,

127
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:40.070
and send him many years of sunshine days.

128
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.970
What more remains?

129
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.330
No more, but that you read

130
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.700
these accusations and these grievous crimes

131
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.400
committed by your person and your followers

132
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.570
against the state and profit of this land,

133
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.500
that, by confessing them,

134
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.170
the souls of men may deem that you are worthily deposed.

135
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.270
Must I do so?

136
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.970
And must I ravel out my weaved-up follies?

137
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.770
Gentle Northumberland, if thy offences were upon record,

138
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.100
would it not shame thee in so fair a troop

139
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.000
to read a lecture of them?

140
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.170
If thou wouldst,

141
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.370
there shouldst thou find one heinous article,

142
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.130
containing the deposing of a king

143
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.730
and cracking the strong warrant of an oath,

144
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.570
marked with a blot, damned in the book of heaven.

145
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:29.670
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me

146
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.830
whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,

147
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.370
though some of you with Pilate wash your hands,

148
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.530
showing an outward pity.

149
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:45.670
Yet you Pilates have here delivered me to my sour cross,

150
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.170
and water cannot wash away your sin.

151
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.170
My lord, dispatch.

152
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.330
Read o'er these articles.

153
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.930
Mine eyes are full of tears.

154
00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.270
I cannot see.

155
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.900
And yet salt water blinds them not so much

156
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.800
but they can see a sort of traitors here.

157
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.700
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,

158
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.430
I find myself a traitor with the rest,

159
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.130
for I have given here my soul's consent

160
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.770
to undeck the pompous body of a king,

161
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:19.730
made glory base and sovereignty a slave,

162
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.600
proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.

163
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600
My lord--

164
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:32.800
No lord of thine, thou haught, insulting man,

165
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.970
nor no man's lord.

166
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.630
I have no name, no title.

167
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.300
No, not that name was given me at the font,

168
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.030
but 'tis usurped.

169
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.170
Alack the heavy day

170
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.370
that I have worn so many winters out

171
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.100
and know not now what name to call myself.

172
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:58.800
Oh, that I were a mockery king of snow,

173
00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:04.030
standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,

174
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.430
to melt myself away in waterdrops.

175
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:23.530
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,

176
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.170
and if my word be sterling yet in England,

177
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.730
let it command a mirror hither straight,

178
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.570
that it may show me what a face I have

179
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.530
since it is bankrupt of His Majesty.

180
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.670
Go some of you and fetch a looking glass.

181
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.630
Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.

182
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.370
Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell.

183
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.230
Urge it no more, my lord Northumberland.

184
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.630
The commons then will not be satisfied.

185
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.000
They shall be satisfied.

186
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.830
I'll read enough when I do see the very book indeed

187
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.170
where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.

188
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:02.770
Give me the glass,

189
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.230
and therein will I read.

190
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.700
No deeper wrinkles yet?

191
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.070
Hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine,

192
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:28.030
and made no deeper wounds?

193
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.770
Oh, flattering glass,

194
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.100
like to my followers in prosperity,

195
00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.930
thou dost beguile me.

196
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:43.370
Was this face the face

197
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:46.530
that every day under his household roof

198
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.030
did keep 10,000 men?

199
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:59.200
Was this the face that, like the sun, did make beholders wink?

200
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.800
Is this the face which faced so many follies

201
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.200
that was at last outfaced by Bolingbroke?

202
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.270
A brittle glory shineth in this face,

203
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.000
as brittle as the glory is the face.

204
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:33.170
For there it lies, cracked in a hundred shivers.

205
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:42.230
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport.

206
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.800
How soon my sorrow hath destroyed my face.

207
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.600
The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed

208
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.870
the shadow of your face.

209
00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.200
Say that again.

210
00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.270
The shadow of my sorrow.

211
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:01.830
Ha!

212
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.130
Let's see.

213
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.600
'Tis very true.

214
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.100
My grief lies all within.

215
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.270
And these external manners of lament

216
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.730
are merely shadows to the unseen grief

217
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:26.500
that swells with silence in the tortured soul.

218
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.570
There lies the substance,

219
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.300
and I thank thee, king, for thy great bounty

220
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.730
that not only givest me cause to wail

221
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.770
but teachest me the way how to lament the cause.

222
00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:52.730
I'll beg one boon, and then be gone and trouble you no more.

223
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.730
Shall I obtain it?

224
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.830
Name it, fair cousin.

225
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.630
Fair cousin?

226
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.400
I am greater than a king,

227
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.270
for when I was a king,

228
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.030
my flatterers were then but subjects.

229
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.770
Being now a subject, I have a king here to my flatterer.

230
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.970
Being so great, I have no need to beg.

231
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.500
Yet ask.

232
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.100
And shall I have?

233
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.470
You shall.

234
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.430
Then give me leave to go.

235
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:26.830
Whither?

236
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:34.970
Whither you will, so I were from your sights.

237
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.300
Go, some of you convey him to the tower.

238
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:43.430
Oh, good.

239
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.700
Convey?

240
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.670
Conveyers are you all

241
00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:57.200
that rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.

242
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:08.730
On Wednesday next, we solemnly set down our coronation.

243
00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.470
Lords, prepare yourselves.

244
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.730
God save the king!

245
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.230
God save the king!

246
00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.530
A woeful pageant have we here beheld.

247
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:26.070
The woe's to come.

248
00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.630
The children yet unborn

249
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.570
shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.

250
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.030
You holy clergymen, is there no plot

251
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:45.330
to rid the realm of this pernicious blot?

252
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.070
This way the king will come.

253
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.370
This is the way to Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,

254
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:04.070
to whose flint bosom my condemned lord

255
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.030
is doomed a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke.

256
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.000
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth

257
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.830
have any resting for her true king's queen.

258
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:24.270
But soft, but see, or rather do not see,

259
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.830
my fair rose wither.

260
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:30.670
Yet look up, behold,

261
00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.270
that you in pity may dissolve to dew

262
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.930
and wash him fresh again with true love tears.

263
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.070
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,

264
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.900
thou map of honor, thou King Richard's tomb,

265
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.000
and not King Richard.

266
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.170
Thou most beauteous inn,

267
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.300
why should hard-favored grief be lodged in thee,

268
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.700
when triumph is become an alehouse guest?

269
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.270
Join not with grief, fair woman.

270
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.800
Do not so, to make my end too sudden.

271
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.970
Learn, good soul,

272
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.070
to think our former state a happy dream,

273
00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.330
from which awaked,

274
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.430
the truth of what we are shows us but this.

275
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:19.100
I am sworn brother, sweet, to grim necessity,

276
00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.900
and he and I will keep a league till death.

277
00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:27.500
Hie thee to France and cloister thee in some religious house.

278
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.470
Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,

279
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:37.800
which our profane hours here have stricken down.

280
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.400
What, is my Richard both in shape and mind

281
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.230
transformed and weakened?

282
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.630
Hath Bolingbroke deposed thine intellect?

283
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.100
Hath he been in thy heart?

284
00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.000
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw

285
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.030
and wounds the earth, if nothing else,

286
00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.700
with rage to be o'erpower'd.

287
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.200
And wilt thou, pupil-like,

288
00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.770
take the correction mildly, kiss the rod,

289
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.670
and fawn on rage with base humility,

290
00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:10.400
which art a lion and the king of beasts?

291
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.130
King of beasts indeed.

292
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.700
If aught but beasts, I had still been a happy king of men.

293
00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:25.470
Good sometimes queen, prepare thee hence for France.

294
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.070
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,

295
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.870
as from my deathbed, thy last living leave.

296
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.200
In winter's tedious nights,

297
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.630
sit by the fire with good old folks

298
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.770
and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid.

299
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.800
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,

300
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.570
tell thou the lamentable tale of me

301
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.270
and send the hearers weeping to their beds.

302
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.830
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize

303
00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.500
the heavy accent of thy moving tongue

304
00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.830
and in compassion weep the fire out.

305
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:10.370
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal black,

306
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.500
for the deposing of a rightful king.

307
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.700
My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed.

308
00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.130
You must to Pomfret, not unto the tower.

309
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.600
And, madam, there is order ta'en for you.

310
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.800
With all swift speed you must away to France.

311
00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.170
Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal

312
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.570
the mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,

313
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.200
the time shall not be many hours of age

314
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.170
more than it is ere foul sin gathering head

315
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.530
shall break into corruption.

316
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.730
Thou shalt think,

317
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:43.870
though he divide the realm and give thee half,

318
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:47.600
it is too little, helping him to all.

319
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.500
And he shall think that thou

320
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.870
which know'st the way to plant unrightful kings

321
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.170
wilt know again, being ne'er so little urged,

322
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.930
another way to pluck him headlong

323
00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.370
from the usurped throne.

324
00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.070
The love of wicked men converts to fear,

325
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.830
that fear to hate,

326
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.530
and hate turns one or both

327
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.070
to worthy danger and deserved death.

328
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:16.800
My guilt be on my head, and there an end.

329
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.370
Take leave and part, for you must part forthwith.

330
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.600
Doubly divorced.

331
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.970
Bad men, you violate a twofold marriage,

332
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:25.730
'twixt my crown and me,

333
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.200
and then betwixt me and my married wife.

334
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.370
Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me.

335
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.830
And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.

336
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.400
Part us, Northumberland--

337
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.730
I toward the north,

338
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.270
where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime.

339
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.570
My wife to France,

340
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:54.100
from whence, set forth in pomp,

341
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.100
she came adorned hither like sweet May,

342
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.430
sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.

343
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:02.430
And must we be divided?

344
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.530
Must we part?

345
00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:11.530
Aye, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.

346
00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.200
Banish us both and send the king with me.

347
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.670
That were some love but little policy.

348
00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:18.930
Then whither he goes, thither let me go.

349
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.770
So two, together weeping, make one woe.

350
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:26.330
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here.

351
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:30.130
Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.

352
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.070
Go, count thy way with sighs.

353
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:35.200
I mine with groans.

354
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:40.970
So longest way shall have the longest moans.

355
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.370
Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,

356
00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.370
and piece the way out with a heavy heart.

357
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.400
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,

358
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.930
since, wedding it, there is such length in grief.

359
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:58.070
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part.

360
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.500
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.

361
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.370
Give me mine own again.

362
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.730
'Twere no good part to take on me to keep and kill thy heart.

363
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.200
Now I have mine own again.

364
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:27.000
Be gone that I may strive to kill it with a groan.

365
00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:36.000
We make woe wanton with this fond delay.

366
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.730
Once more, adieu.

367
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.670
The rest let sorrow say.

368
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:51.630
