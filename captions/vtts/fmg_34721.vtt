00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:23.000

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
THE BLUE PLANET.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
THE EARTH IS MADE OF A
LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
THERE'S IRON, SOME
NICKEL, AND THERE'S

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
ALL SORTS OF
OTHER ELEMENTS.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
THERE'S CANYONS
AND VOLCANOES.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
A REALLY DYNAMIC PLACE
THAT WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
THE PAST AND WILL BE VERY
DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
THE EARTH HAS A HISTORY.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
THE EXPANSIVE EARTH,
EXPLOSIVE VOLCANOES,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
EXTRAORDINARY WEATHER,
MAJESTIC MOUNTAINS,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
RUSHING RIVERS, AND MANY,
MANY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPES

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
WE CALL HOME.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR
PLANET WE LOOK TO GEOLOGY.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
GEOLOGY IS THE STUDY OF
THE EARTH, OF EVERYTHING

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
THAT'S UNDERNEATH US,
THE ROCKS AND THE RIVERS

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
AND THE DIRT AND SOIL
AND VOLCANOES AND ALL OF

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
THE PROCESSES THAT MAKE
THE EARTH WHAT IT IS.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
TO THINK OF THE EARTH
IN A SIMPLISTIC WAY,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
AS BEING THE THIRD
PLANET FROM THE SUN

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
OUT OF NINE OR
PERHAPS TEN PLANETS...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
WE LIVE ON IT AND LIFE
IS PERHAPS THE MOST

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
IMPORTANT THING ON IT,
BUT WE HAVE A TENDENCY

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
TO STUDY, AS GEOLOGISTS,
THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
OF THE EARTH AND
ITS ANCIENT HISTORY.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
EVERYTHING YOU LOOK AT
TELLS AN AMAZING AND

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
FANTASTIC STORY ABOUT THE
EARTH AND THERE'S SO MANY

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
DIFFERENT STORIES THAT
THE EARTH REVEALS.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
OUR EARTH HAS A VERY LONG
AND VERY DYNAMIC HISTORY

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
STARTING WITH A BANG AND
THE FORMATION OF THE EARTH

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
AND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
WE THINK THAT VERY EARLY
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
SOLAR SYSTEM THERE WAS
A LARGE CIRCULATING MASS

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
OF GASES AND DUSTS AND
THAT THE DUST PARTICLES

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
STARTED TO COLLIDE AND
COALESCE WITH ONE ANOTHER

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
AND THAT OUR EARLY
PLANET FORMED IN RESPONSE

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
TO COLLISIONS OF ALL
OF THOSE DUST PARTICLES

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
HELD TOGETHER BY A
GRAVITATIONAL ATTRACTION.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
THIS HYPOTHESIS OF HOW THE
EARTH FORMED IS CALLED

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
THE "SOLAR NEBULAR
HYPOTHESIS".

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
A NEBULA IS A CLOUD
OF INTERSTELLAR GAS,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
AND THE THEORY IS THE
BASIC IDEA THAT THE SUN

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
AND THE PLANETS FORMED IN
THE SAME NEBULAR MATERIAL.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
IF THE NEBULAR
MATERIAL'S DENSE ENOUGH,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
IF THERE'S ENOUGH DUST
AND GAS, IT'LL BEGIN TO

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
KIND OF COLLAPSE IN ON ITSELF
AND BEGIN TO SWIRL ABOUT.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
AS IT COLLAPSES IT
GENERATES AN ENORMOUS

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
AMOUNT OF HEAT, EVENTUALLY
CAUSING NUCLEAR FUSION

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
WHICH WILL PRODUCE
SOMETHING CALLED

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
AN EMBRYONIC SUN
IN THE MIDDLE.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
ONCE YOU FORM THAT SUN,
I'D SAY ABOUT 99% OR SO

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
OF ALL THE MASS IN
THAT NEBULAR CLOUD

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
IS CONTAINED IN THE SUN.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
WHAT LITTLE ITSY
BITSY PARTICLES

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
WERE SWIMMING
AROUND OUT THERE

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
THAT WERE LEFT OVER
AFTER THE SUN WAS MADE

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
GLOMMED ON TOGETHER
TO FORM THE PLANETS.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THERE WERE OTHER

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
PLANETARY MASSES
FLOATING AROUND.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
THINGS COMING IN TO HIT
THE EARTH, BOUNCING OFF

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
TO FORM THE MOON, BOUNCING
OFF TO FORM THESE OTHER

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
LITTLE BITS OF ASTEROIDS AND
COMETS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
THE EARTH AND THE SOLAR
SYSTEM ARE COMPOSED OF

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
MANY CHEMICAL ELEMENTS.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
SOME ARE VERY HEAVY OR
DENSE LIKE IRON AND NICKEL,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
AND OTHERS ARE LIGHT
LIKE HYDROGEN AND HELIUM.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
WE DO SEE THE SAME
CHEMICAL ELEMENTS

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT
OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
BUT THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED
IN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT WAYS

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
SO THAT THE PLANETS THAT, AS
YOU GET FURTHER AND FURTHER

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
OUT IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM,
YOU SEE A GREATER ABUNDANCE

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
OF THE VERY LIGHT
GASEOUS ELEMENTS AND,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE
SUN THERE ARE MORE OF THE

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
HEAVY ELEMENTS THAT FELL
IN THROUGH GRAVITATIONAL

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
ATTRACTION TOWARDS THE
CENTER OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
OUR EARTH IS
LARGELY COMPOSED OF:

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
THERE'S AN IDEA, A THEORY,
A HYPOTHESIS THAT EARLY

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
IN EARTH'S FORMATION THAT
IT WAS A HOMOGENEOUS BALL,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
THAT BASICALLY
ALL THE MATERIAL

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
THAT MAKES UP THE EARTH
WAS EVENLY DISTRIBUTED

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
THROUGHOUT THAT BALL.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
AT SOME POINT THE EARTH
WAS HEATED AND WE THINK

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
THAT THROUGH THE PROCESS
OF METEORIC IMPACT,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
RADIOACTIVE DECAY,
AND WHAT'S CALLED

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
GRAVITATIONAL COMPRESSION,
THE EARTH HEATED

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
SUFFICIENTLY TO ALLOW
ALL THIS MATERIAL

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
TO SEPARATE OUT AND
DIFFERENTIATE BY DENSITY.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
MEANING THAT THE HEAVY
STUFF SUNK TO THE MIDDLE

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
AND THE LIGHT STUFF
FLOATED OUT TO THE SURFACE.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
FUNDAMENTALLY IT'S A VERY
SIMPLE CONCEPT THAT THE

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
DENSER ROCKS, THE ROCKS
WITH A HIGHER PERCENTAGE

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
OF IRON AND NICKEL AND
OTHER RELATED ELEMENTS

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
MOVED TO THE DEEP
PARTS OF THE EARTH

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
AND THE LIGHTER ROCKS
WITH QUARTZ AND FELDSPAR

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
MOVED TO THE UPPER
PARTS OF THE EARTH.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
AND THE RESULT IS A
RATHER SIMPLE, ELEGANT,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
THREE-LAYERED EARTH.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
OUR PLANET IS MADE UP
OF THREE MAIN LAYERS:

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
THE CRUST, THE MANTLE,
AND THE CORE.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
THIS BALL THAT WE CALL THE
EARTH, YOU COULD THINK

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
OF IT AS BEING A MORE
SPHERICAL HARDBOILED EGG

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
WHERE IT HAS A YOLK IN THE
INTERIOR THAT IS WHAT WE

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
CALL THE CORE AND THAT
CORE IS ACTUALLY MADE UP

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
OF TWO DIFFERENT PARTS.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
PART OF IT IS SOLID AND
PART OF IT IS LIQUID.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
AND THE CORE OF THE EARTH
IS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
COMPOSED OF IRON.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
THE OUTER CORE OF
THE EARTH IS LIQUID

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
AND THE INNER CORE OF
THE EARTH IS BASICALLY

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
LIKE A LARGE IRON
SPHERE OR BALL

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
FLOATING IN THIS
LIQUID OUTER CORE.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
THE MANTLE CAN BE COMPARED
TO THE WHITE PART

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
OF THE HARDBOILED EGG.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
IT CONTAINS 67% OF THE
OVERALL MASS OF THE EARTH.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
AND THERE'S THE MANTLE
WHICH IS SORT OF LIKE

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
PLIABLE, MOVABLE ROCK,
AND THEN THERE'S THE CRUST

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
WHICH IS THE LIGHTEST STUFF
THAT SORT OF STAYS ON THE

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
EDGE OF THE EARTH, KIND OF
LIKE THE SHELL ON AN EGG.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
THE CRUST OF THE EARTH
REALLY IS JUST LIKE THE

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
EGGSHELL GETTING BROKEN
UP, BUT ABLE TO THEN

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
SLIDE AROUND ON THAT
HARDBOILED WHITE OF AN EGG.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
THE CRUST IS BROKEN UP
INTO MOVING TECTONIC PLATES.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
THESE PLATES RECYCLE THE
CRUST FROM MATERIALS DEEP

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
INSIDE THE EARTH, AND AS
THEY MOVE ABOUT THE SURFACE

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT
ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
BUT THE DEADLY EARTHQUAKES
AND VIOLENT ERUPTIONS.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
HAVE WE TAKEN A FANCY,
FUTURISTIC DRILL SHIP

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
DOWN TO THE GUTS
OF THE EARTH

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
TO SEE WHERE THESE LAYERS
ARE AND WHAT'S DOWN THERE?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
NO. WE'VE ACTUALLY NEVER
SEEN, OR EVEN SAMPLED

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
FOR THAT MATTER, THE DEEP
INTERIOR OF THE EARTH.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE
KNOW THE EARTH IS LAYERED?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
EARTHQUAKES ARE HANDY
IN THAT THEY PRODUCE

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
SHOCKWAVES THAT PENETRATE
THROUGH THE ENTIRE EARTH

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
AND THOSE SHOCKWAVES CAN
BE USED LIKE AN X-RAY

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
IN AN X-RAY MACHINE TO
IMAGE THE VARIOUS LAYERS

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
WE SEE WITHIN THE EARTH.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
SEISMIC STATIONS THAT
ARE BASICALLY SPREAD

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
OVER THE GLOBE RECEIVE
THESE EARTHQUAKE WAVES.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE HAPPENS,
YOU KNOW, SEISMIC WAVES

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
PROPAGATE IN ALL THESE
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
AND THEY PROPAGATE
THROUGH THE EARTH AS WELL

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
AND THEY BOUNCE OFF
DIFFERENT LAYERS

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
- THE HARD LAYERS, THE
SOFT LAYERS OF THE EARTH -

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
AND WE CAN TELL BASED
ON ARRIVAL TIMES

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
THEIR SPEEDS, YOU KNOW, WHAT
THEY WENT THROUGH BASICALLY.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
IF THE EARTH WAS A
HOMOGENEOUS BALL

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
MADE OF THE SAME
STUFF, THOSE WAVES

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
WOULDN'T CHANGE OR BEND
OR DO ANYTHING FUNNY

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
AS THEY PASSED
THROUGH THE EARTH.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
BUT WHAT WE FIND IS THAT
THOSE EARTHQUAKE WAVES

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
BEHAVE IN A VARIETY
OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
AS WE LOOK AT OUR
EARTH FROM SPACE,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
WE SEE MORE THAN THE
ROCKS AND THE LAND.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
WE SEE THE BLUE
WATER AND CLOUDS AND,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
AS WE GET CLOSER, WE SEE
PLANTS AND EVEN ANIMALS.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
SO OUR PLANET IS MORE THAN
THE ROCKS AND MINERALS

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
THAT MAKE UP THE EARTH.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
MODERN EARTH SCIENCE
LOOKS AT THE EARTH AS

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
AN ENTIRE SYSTEM - A GROUP
OF INTERACTIVE PARTS

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
THAT FORM THE
COMPLEX WHOLE.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
THIS SYSTEM INCLUDES THE
SOLID EARTH AS WELL AS

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
THE HYDROSPHERE -
THAT IS ALL THE WATER,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
THE BIOSPHERE - WHICH
IS ALL OF THE LIFE,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
AND THE ATMOSPHERE -

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
THE PROTECTIVE
GASEOUS OUTER LAYER.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
OUR EARTH HAS CHANGED
AND CONTINUES TO CHANGE

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
AND EARTH SCIENTISTS
ARE SEARCHING FOR CLUES

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
TO UNRAVEL THE COMPLEX
EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
OVER THE VAST HISTORY
OF OUR PLANET.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
WHEN AN EARTH SCIENTIST
IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
WHY DID THE DINOSAURS
BECOME EXTINCT,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
WELL, THAT HAPPENED
65 MILLION YEARS AGO

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
AND NO HUMAN BEINGS WERE
AROUND THEN TO LOOK AT

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
WHAT THE EARTH'S SURFACE
LOOKED LIKE AT THAT TIME,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
TO LOOK AT THE
ATMOSPHERE,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
TO LOOK AT THE
EARTH'S VEGETATION,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
TO TRY TO LOOK AT
WHAT WAS GOING ON THEN

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
TO GAIN A SENSE OR TO
APPRECIATE WHY, YOU KNOW,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
ENTIRE MAJOR
GROUPS OF ORGANISMS

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
LIVING AT THAT TIME
WOULD HAVE GONE EXTINCT.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
SO OUR CHALLENGE IS TO
DEVELOP WAYS OR TECHNIQUES

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
- SOME OF WHICH ARE
VERY CLEVER - TO TRY TO

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
TEASE THAT STORY OUT OF
THE RECORD THAT'S LEFT.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE
OF BEING AN EARTH SCIENTIST.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
BEING A DETECTIVE

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
AT THE SCENE
OF A CRIME.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
THROUGHOUT TIME GEOLOGISTS
HAVE USED OBSERVATIONS

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
TO INTERPRET THE
EARTH'S HISTORY.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
IN THE 1600'S AND
1700'S, PEOPLE THOUGHT

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
THE AGE OF THE EARTH
WAS RELATIVELY YOUNG.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
BACK THEN THE THEORY
THAT WAS ACCEPTED FOR

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
THE FORMATION
OF THE EARTH,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
FOR THE FORMATION OF LAYERS
OF ROCK AND FOSSILS

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
WAS THIS THEORY CALLED
"CATASTROPHISM".

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
BASICALLY THAT THINGS
HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
ALL AT ONCE.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
THE GREAT FLOOD,
FOR INSTANCE,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
THAT'S TALKED
ABOUT IN THE BIBLE,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
THAT WAS THOUGHT AS A WAY
THAT COULD HAVE TRANSFERRED

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
ALL THIS MATERIAL, THAT
HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
AND FOSSILS WERE DEPOSITED
AND THAT'S HOW THAT FORMED.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
SO THE AGE OF THE EARTH WAS
THOUGHT TO BE VERY YOUNG

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
- THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
ONE OF THE VERY EARLY
MILESTONES IN THE STUDY OF

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
GEOLOGY CAME ABOUT IN THE
1700'S THROUGH A SCOTTISH

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
GEOLOGIST NAMED JAMES
HUTTON WHO DEVELOPED

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
A THEORY OR PROPOSED
A THEORY CALLED

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
"UNIFORMITARIANISM" WHICH
BASICALLY STATES THAT

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
"THE PRESENT IS THE
KEY TO THE PAST".

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
AND THIS WAS A COMPLETELY
REVOLUTIONARY IDEA

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
THAT IS STILL VERY,
VERY POWERFUL TODAY.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THAT WE CAN GO OUT TO A
RIVER LIKE THE RIO GRANDE

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
AND WE CAN SEE THAT RIVER
CARRYING SAND AND SILT AND

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
CLAY PARTICLES DOWNSTREAM
AND WHEN THE WATER'S

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
FLOWING QUICKLY IT'S
CARRYING MORE MATERIAL,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
WHEN IT SLOWS DOWN IT
DROPS THAT SEDIMENT OUT

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
AND WE CAN SEE HOW THIS
SEDIMENT ACCUMULATES OVER

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
TIME AND IT MAKES IT MUCH
EASIER TO GO BACK IN TIME

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
AND TO LOOK, FOR EXAMPLE,
AT AN ANCIENT SANDSTONE

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
AND SAY "I KNOW
HOW THIS FORMED.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD
HAVE TAKEN THAT SEDIMENT

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
TO ACCUMULATE
BECAUSE I CAN MAKE

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
DIRECT OBSERVATIONS TODAY
ON SIMILAR PROCESSES.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
COMPLETELY CHANGED THE
WAY WE THOUGHT ABOUT

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
HOW OLD THE EARTH WAS,
HOW ROCKS FORMED,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
AND IT MADE
PEOPLE THINK ON A

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
DIFFERENT TIME
SCALE, BASICALLY.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
AND, YOU KNOW, GEOLOGY'S
ALL ABOUT TIME SCALE.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
SO, THINGS DON'T HAPPEN
IN THOUSANDS OF YEARS,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
WE'RE THINKING OF MILLIONS
OF YEARS, BILLIONS OF YEARS.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
SO THAT'S THE TIME
FRAME WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT
PROCESSES THAT HAPPENED

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
VERY SLOWLY, YOU
KNOW, PLATE MOVEMENTS

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
THAT HAPPENED A
CENTIMETER A YEAR.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
DEPOSITION OF SEDIMENTS
THAT HAPPENED MILLIMETERS

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
PER YEAR, SO THAT'S AN
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WAY

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
OF LOOKING THAN
WAY BACK WHEN

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
WHEN PEOPLE WERE CONSIDERING
HOW THE EARTH FORMED.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
THIS DISCOVERY LED
GEOLOGISTS TO TRY

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
AND LEARN MORE ABOUT
THE AGE OF THE EARTH

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
AS WELL AS ITS HISTORY
BY DATING ROCKS.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THERE ARE TWO WAYS
WE CAN DATE ROCKS.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
ONE IS RELATIVE DATING AND
ONE IS ABSOLUTE DATING.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
AND RELATIVE DATING IS WE
DON'T HAVE THE EXACT AGE

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
OF THE ROCK BUT WE CAN MAKE
OBSERVATIONS OF SOME ROCKS

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
AND SEE THAT THE
LAYERS ON THE BOTTOM

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
ARE GOING TO BE OLDER THAN
THE LAYERS ON THE TOP.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
WE CAN LOOK AT THE SEQUENCE
OF EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
AND WORK OUT
WHICH ONE'S OLDEST

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
AND WHICH
ONE'S YOUNGEST.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
RELATIVE AGE DATING
MEANS THAT BY LOOKING

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
AT THESE LAYERS OF
ROCKS KNOWN AS "STRATA"

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
WE CAN DETERMINE IF
SOMETHING IS YOUNGER THAN

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
OR OLDER THAN
SOMETHING ELSE.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
RELATIVE AGE DATING IS BASED
ON A FEW BASIC PRINCIPLES.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
ONE OF THE MOST
FUNDAMENTAL IS:

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
BUT SOMETIMES GEOLOGIC
PROCESSES CAN INTERRUPT

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
THESE HORIZONTAL LAYERS.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
LAYERS CAN BE
BENT AND TWISTED

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
OR EVEN TURNED
UPSIDE-DOWN.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
AND SOMETIMES CRACKS OR
FAULTS IN AN EXISTING ROCK

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
ARE FILLED WITH
MAGMA THAT COOLS

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
AND RESULTS IN
AN IGNEOUS ROCK.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
THIS IS KNOWN AS
THE PRINCIPLE OF

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
CROSS-CUTTING
RELATIONSHIPS

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
WHICH STATES THAT THE
IGNEOUS INTRUSION IS

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
ALWAYS YOUNGER THAN THE
ROCK IT CUTS ACROSS.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
THESE AS WELL AS OTHER
PRINCIPLES HELPED GEOLOGISTS

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
DISCOVER RELATIVE
TIME RELATIONSHIPS

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
AND CREATE A LOGICAL
ORDER OF EVENTS ON EARTH.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
ANOTHER WAY TO TELL THE
TIME RELATIONSHIP IN

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
AN OUTCROP OR A GROUP
OF ROCKS IS TO LOOK AT

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
THE FOSSILS THAT HAVE
BEEN DEPOSITED IN THEM.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
WE HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF WHEN
A CERTAIN SPECIES EXISTED

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
OR DURING WHAT
TIME PERIOD.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
AND BY CORRELATING
THAT TO THE ROCK,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
THE ROCK SEDIMENTS
AND WHAT'S AROUND IT,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
BELOW IT, BESIDE IT,
YOU CAN GET A GOOD SENSE

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN,
WHEN IT WAS DEPOSITED,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
WHEN DID THIS
INTRUSION COME IN,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
WHEN DID THIS
LAVA FLOW HAPPEN,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
UM, BASED ON THE
OTHER ROCKS AROUND IT.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
BY LOOKING AT
THINGS LIKE THE WAY

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
A ROAD'S CUT THROUGH THE
ROCK, YOU'RE ACTUALLY

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
LOOKING AT PART OF
THE STORY OF TIME.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
YOU'RE LOOKING AT INDIVIDUAL
PAGES OF WHAT PROCESSES

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
WERE GOING ON BECAUSE
EACH OF THOSE LAYERS

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
IS TELLING YOU
A DIFFERENT STORY.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
IT TELLS YOU WHETHER YOU
HAD A STREAM THAT HAD

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
MOVED THROUGH HERE AND
THEN LATER THAT STREAM WAS

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
BURIED BY A SWAMP WHEN
WATER LEVELS HAD COME UP.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
AND THEN MAYBE LATER ANOTHER
STREAM CUT THROUGH IT.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
AND JUST BY LOOKING
AT THE TYPES OF ROCKS

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
AND THE TYPES OF
FOSSILS IN THE ROCKS

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
TELLS YOU THAT
INDIVIDUAL STORY.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
WHILE ROCKS AND FOSSILS HELP
TELL THE EARTH'S HISTORY,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
GEOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND OTHER
WAYS TO GET INFORMATION.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
WE CAN LOOK IN ICE CORES.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
THESE ARE UP IN THE
GLACIAL REGIONS,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
IN THE POLAR REGIONS.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
ICE CORES THAT CAN BE
MILES THICK AND THERE'S

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
BANDING THAT EXISTS
IN THESE ICE CORES

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
- THE SUMMER, WINTER BANDS -
OR WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
COUNT BACKWARDS
AND DETERMINE THAT

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
THIS IS THE YEAR - 1352,
AND IN THAT YEAR,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
BECAUSE IN ICE RECORD
WE SEE AN ASH LAYER,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
THERE WAS A LARGE VOLCANO
THAT TOOK PLACE AT THAT TIME.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
SO WE CAN MAKE RELATIVE
COMPARISONS OF AGES THAT WAY.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
IN ADDITION TO
ESTABLISHING RELATIVE AGES,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
WE NOW HAVE A WAY TO GIVE
RELIABLE NUMERICAL DATES

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
TO THE EARTH'S
EVENTS AND MATERIALS

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
THROUGH ABSOLUTE
AGE DATING.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
ABSOLUTE AGE DATING IS
BASED ON THE NATURAL

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
RADIOACTIVE DECAY
OF CERTAIN ELEMENTS

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
WHICH OCCURS AT A CONSTANT
RATE THROUGHOUT TIME.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
SO BY MEASURING HOW MUCH
WE HAVE TODAY AND HOW MUCH

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
OF THE DECAYED PRODUCT
IS THERE TODAY,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
WE CAN VERY ACCURATELY
DETERMINE THE AGE AT WHICH

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
A MINERAL OR A ROCK
FRAGMENT OR A POTTERY SHARD

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
OR AN OLD TREE THAT'S
BURIED IN A SEDIMENT,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
WHAT THE AGE OF
THAT MATERIAL IS.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
SO IT'S BEEN VERY
BENEFICIAL FOR UNRAVELING

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
THE TIME SCALE OF
EARTH'S HISTORY.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
IN 1980, FATHER
AND SON SCIENTISTS

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
WALTER AND LUIS ALVAREZ
FOUND STRONG EVIDENCE

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
THAT A GIANT ASTEROID
HIT THE EARTH

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
AROUND 65 MILLION
YEARS AGO,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
DRASTICALLY CHANGING
THE ENVIRONMENT

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
AND POSSIBLY KILLING
OFF THE DINOSAURS.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
UP UNTIL THAT
POINT THAT WAS

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
ALWAYS ONE OF
THE BIG MYSTERIES

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
IS HOW DID THE DINOSAURS
ACTUALLY GO EXTINCT?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
AND SO THIS RECOGNITION
THAT CATASTROPHISM

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
ACTUALLY DOES OCCUR...

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
FIRST EVERYTHING
WAS CATASTROPHIC

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
- NOAH'S FLOOD - THEN IT
BECAME UNIFORMITARIANISM

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
WHERE EVERYTHING WAS
THE SAME THROUGH HISTORY

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
AND NOW WE'VE RECOGNIZED
THAT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
IT'S NEITHER ONE
OR THE OTHER.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
WE HAVE PERIODS WHERE
THINGS DON'T CHANGE

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
AND THEN PERHAPS RARE BUT
REALLY CATASTROPHIC EVENTS

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
HAVE OCCURRED
IN THE PAST.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
AND SO IT'S LIKE
READING A HISTORY BOOK

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
BUT EACH PAGE IS A VERY
LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
AND WE USE THE FOSSILS AND
THE DIFFERENT ROCK TYPES

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
AND SO ON TO TRY AND
RECONSTRUCT EVENTS

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
GOING BACK TO THE EARLY
HISTORY OF OUR PLANET.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
THE THING THAT REALLY
SEPARATES GEOLOGY

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
FROM ALL OTHER SCIENCE
IS THE FACT THAT

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
GEOLOGY DEALS WITH
VAST SUMS OF TIME.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
TIME THAT MOST HUMANS CANNOT
EVEN BEGIN TO RELATE TO.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
GEOLOGICAL TIME IS OFTEN
REFERRED TO AS "DEEP TIME".

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO CONCEIVE OF.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
WE TALK ABOUT SUCH
INCREDIBLY LONG EXPANSES

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
OF TIME.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
WE THINK OUR PLANET
WAS FORMED ABOUT

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
4.6 BILLION YEARS AGO.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
BUT WHAT DOES THAT
NUMBER REALLY MEAN?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
HOW VAST IS 4.6
BILLION YEARS?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
IT'S MIND-BOGGLING.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR US TO COMPREHEND

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
THIS GEOLOGIC DEEP TIME.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
BUT BY CONDENSING 4.6
BILLION YEARS INTO A

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
ONE-YEAR CALENDAR, WE
CAN BEGIN TO APPRECIATE

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
THE VAST HISTORY
OF THE EARTH.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
IN THIS ONE-YEAR
COMPARISON,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
EACH SECOND WILL
EQUAL ABOUT 146 YEARS;

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
AND EACH DAY, 12.6
MILLION YEARS.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
AND WE BEGIN WHEN THE EARTH
FORMED OUT OF A NEBULA

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
ON JANUARY 1ST.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
THE OLDEST FOUND ROCKS DATE
BACK 3.8 BILLION YEARS

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
- MARCH 4TH ON
OUR CALENDAR.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
THE FIRST BACTERIA APPEARED
THREE AND A QUARTER

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
BILLION YEARS AGO, BUT MORE
THAN A BILLION YEARS PASS

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
BEFORE THE FIRST
CELLS WITH A NUCLEUS

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
APPEAR ON JULY 17TH.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
IT IS NOT UNTIL SEPTEMBER
30TH THAT THE FIRST

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
MULTI-CELLED ORGANISMS
SUCH AS SEAWEED

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
AND ALGAE APPEARED -
1.5 BILLION YEARS AGO.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
ON NOVEMBER 21ST, ONLY
500 MILLION YEARS AGO,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
THE FIRST FISH APPEARED.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AND LATER, ON NOVEMBER 24TH,
THERE IS FOSSIL EVIDENCE

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
THAT THE FIRST
LAND PLANTS APPEARED.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
ON DECEMBER 1ST THE FIRST
INSECTS ARRIVED, FOLLOWED

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
BY SHARKS ON DECEMBER 2ND,
370 MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
DECEMBER 12TH BEGINS
THE AGE OF THE REPTILES,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
INCLUDING THE DINOSAURS,
WHO FIRST APPEARED

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
228 MILLION YEARS AGO
AND REIGNED THE EARTH

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS UNTIL
THE 26TH OF DECEMBER

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
WHEN A GIANT METEOR
SLAMMED INTO THE EARTH

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
CAUSING MASS EXTINCTION.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
ON DECEMBER 28TH,
TWO DAYS LATER,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
THE FIRST MONKEYS APPEARED.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
AND, ON NEW YEAR'S EVE,
DECEMBER 31ST AT 11:48 PM,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
HOMO SAPIENS ARRIVED.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
AND OVER THE
NEXT 12 MINUTES,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY
WOULD UNFOLD

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
INCLUDING THE RISE
AND FALLS OF EMPIRES,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
AND MANS' LANDING
ON THE MOON

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
WHICH WOULD TAKE PLACE
A QUARTER OF A SECOND

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
BEFORE THE STROKE
OF MIDNIGHT.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
GEOLOGY IS A
RELATIVELY NEW SCIENCE.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
WE ARE JUST SCRATCHING
THE SURFACE OF WHAT WE

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
CAN KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY
OF THIS AWESOME PLANET.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
MOST PEOPLE THINK OF
GEOLOGY AS SIMPLY

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THE STUDY OF ROCKS.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
BUT FOR ME GEOLOGY IS
MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN JUST

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
LOOKING AT ROCKS.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
IT'S ABOUT ALL OF THE
DIFFERENT EARTH PROCESSES

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
THAT SHAPE THE SURFACE OF
THE EARTH WHERE WE LIVE,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
THAT CONTROL THINGS LIKE
VOLCANISM AND EARTHQUAKES

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
AND WHERE ALL OF OUR
NATURAL RESOURCES COME FROM.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
ONE OF THE THINGS I
REALLY LIKE ABOUT GEOLOGY,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
YOU GET A CHANCE TO
REALLY FIND OUT ABOUT

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
THE PHYSICAL EARTH YOU
LIVE ON, YOU KNOW,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
WHICH YOU NEVER REALLY
THINK ABOUT FROM DAY TO DAY.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
WE KNOW ABOUT THE CARS WE
DRIVE, ABOUT THE HOUSES

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
WE HAVE, ABOUT THE
COMPUTERS WE OWN,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
BUT WE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE VERY THING

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
THAT WE'RE WALKING
ON EVERY DAY.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
GEOLOGY IS A FASCINATING AND
EXTREMELY EXCITING SCIENCE

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING AT
SO MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
OF THE EARTH.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
AND IT TIES IN BIOLOGY
AND ASTRONOMY AND PHYSICS

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE AND
OCEANOGRAPHY AND SO MANY

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
THINGS THAT THERE'S NO
SINGULAR ASPECT OF GEOLOGY

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
AND ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU
LOOK AT TELLS AN AMAZING

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
AND FANTASTIC STORY
ABOUT THE EARTH.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
GEOLOGISTS HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO UNRAVEL

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
MANY OF THE MYSTERIES
OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY,

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
BUT WE STILL HAVE
A LONG WAY TO GO

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
IN UNDERSTANDING OUR
PLANET'S DIVERSE TERRAIN

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:00.000
AND THE PROCESSES THAT
SHAPE OUR DYNAMIC WORLD.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:13.000
*

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:24.000
*

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
*
