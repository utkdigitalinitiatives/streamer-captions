00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.070
Romans, make way the goodAndronicus.

3
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.330
Patron of virtue, Rome'sbest champion,

4
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.000
successful in the battlesthat he fights,

5
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.370
with honor and withfortune is returned

6
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.500
from where he circumscribedwith his sword

7
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
and brought to yoke theenemies of Rome.

8
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.130
Hail, Rome,

9
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.670
victorious in thy mourningweeds.

10
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.470
Lo, as the bark that hathdischarged her freight

11
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.900
returns with preciouslading to the bay

12
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.570
from whence at first sheweighed her anchorage,

13
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.370
cometh Andronicus, boundwith laurel boughs,

14
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.430
to resalute his countrywith his tears

15
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.970
tears of true joy for hisreturn to Rome.

16
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.930
Thou great defender ofthis capitol,

17
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.700
stand gracious to therights that we intend.

18
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.100
Romans of five and twentyvaliant sons,

19
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.070
half of the number thatKing Priam had,

20
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.030
behold the poor remains,alive and dead.

21
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.530
These that survive letRome reward with love,

22
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.270
these that I bring untotheir latest home

23
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.730
with burial amongst theirancestors.

24
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.870
Here Goths have given meleave to sheathe my sword.

25
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.070
Titus, unkind and carelessof thine own,

26
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.400
why sufferest thou thysons, unburied yet,

27
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.270
to hover on the dreadfulshore of Styx?

28
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.830
Make way to lay them bytheir brethren.

29
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.530
There greet in silence, asthe dead are wont,

30
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.130
and sleep in peace, slainin your country's wars.

31
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.870
O, sacred receptacle of myjoys,

32
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.130
sweet cell of virtue andnobility,

33
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.270
how many sons hast thou ofmine in store

34
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.800
that thou wilt neverrender to me more?

35
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.470
Give us the proudestprisoner of the Goths,

36
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.730
that we may hew his limbsand on a pile,

37
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.730
ad manes fratrum,sacrifice his flesh

38
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.970
before this earthy prisonof their bones

39
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.930
that so the shadows be notunappeased

40
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.900
nor we disturbed withprodigies on earth.

41
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.830
I give you him, thenoblest that survives,

42
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.070
the eldest son of thisdistressed queen.

43
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.030
Stay, Roman brethren!

44
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.500
Gracious conqueror,victorious Titus,

45
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.470
rue the tears I shed,

46
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.330
a mother's tears inpassion for her son.

47
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.630
And if thy sons were everdear to thee,

48
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.230
O, think my son to be asdear to me.

49
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.730
Sufficeth not that we arebrought to Rome

50
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.570
to beautify thy triumphsand return captive to thee

51
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.830
and to thy Roman yoke; butmust my sons

52
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.070
be slaughtered in thestreets for valiant doings

53
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.900
in their country's cause?

54
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.530
O, if to fight for kingand commonweal

55
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.470
were piety in thine, it isin these.

56
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.730
Andronicus, stain not thytomb with blood.

57
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.100
Wilt thou draw near thenature of the gods?

58
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.830
Draw near them, then, inbeing merciful.

59
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.930
Sweet mercy is nobility'strue badge.

60
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.770
Thrice noble Titus, sparemy firstborn son.

61
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.070
Patient yourself, madam,and pardon me.

62
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.730
These are their brethrenwhom your Goths beheld,

63
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.530
alive and dead, and fortheir brethren slain

64
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.300
religiously they asksacrifice.

65
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.370
To this, your son ismarked, and die he must,

66
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.670
to appease their groaningshadows that are gone.

67
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.270
Away with him, and make apath straight;

68
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.070
and with our swords, upona pile of wood,

69
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.100
let's hew his limbs tillthey be clean consumed.

70
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.030
O, cruel, irreligiouspiety!

71
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.230
Was never Scythia half sobarbarous?

72
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.300
Oppose not Scythia toambitious Rome.

73
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.170
Alarbus goes to rest, andwe survive

74
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.430
to tremble under Titus'threatening look.

75
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.530
And, madam, standresolved, but hope withal

76
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.630
the self-same gods thatarm the queen of Troy

77
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.170
with opportunity of sharprevenge

78
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.070
upon the Thracian tyrantin his tent

79
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.270
may favor Tamora, thequeen of Goths

80
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.230
when Goths were Goths andTamora was queen

81
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.170
to quit the bloody wrongsupon her foes.

82
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.570
See, lord and father, howwe have performed

83
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.000
our Roman rites: Alarbus'limbs are lopped,

84
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.730
and entrails feed thesacrificing fire,

85
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.100
whose smoke, like incense,doth perfume the sky.

86
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.900
Remaineth not but to interour brethren

87
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.170
and with loud larumswelcome them to Rome.

88
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.970
Let it be so, and letAndronicus

89
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.300
make this his latestfarewell to their souls.

90
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.170
In peace and honor restyou here, my sons.

91
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.730
Rome's readiest champions,repose you here in rest,

92
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.600
secure from worldlychances and mishaps.

93
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.130
Here lurks no treason;here no envy swells.

94
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.030
Here grow no damned drugs;here are no storms,

95
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.870
no noise but silence andeternal sleep.

96
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.830
In peace and honor restyou here, my sons.

97
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.400
In peace and honor liveLord Titus long.

98
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.100
My noble lord and father,live in fame.

99
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.970
Lo, at this tomb, mytributary tears I render

100
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.500
for my brethren'sobsequies.

101
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.330
And at thy feet I kneelwith tears of joy

102
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.500
shed on this earth for thyreturn to Rome.

103
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.530
O, bless me here with thyvictorious hand,

104
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.570
whose fortunes Rome's bestcitizens applaud.

105
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.870
Kind Rome, that hast thuslovingly reserved

106
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.870
the cordial of mine age toglad my heart.

107
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.470
Lavinia, live; outlive thyfather's days

108
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.330
and fame's eternal date,for virtue's praise.

109
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.270
Succession Saturninus.Succession Saturninus.

110
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.970
Succession Saturninus.Succession Saturninus.

111
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.900
Succession Saturninus.Succession!

112
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.700
Noble patricians, patronsof my right,

113
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.870
defend the justice of mycause with arms.

114
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.170
And, countrymen, my lovingfollowers,

115
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.830
plead my successive titlewith your swords.

116
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.070
I am his firstborn sonthat was the last thatwear

117
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.870
the imperial diadem ofRome.

118
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.330
Then let my father'shonors live in me,

119
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.470
nor wrong mine age withthis indignity.

120
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.830
Romans, friends,followers, favorers of myright,

121
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.470
if ever Bassianus,Caesar's son,

122
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.730
were gracious in the eyesof royal Rome,

123
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.630
keep then this passage tothe capitol

124
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.030
and suffer not dishonor toapproach the imperialseat.

125
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.870
To virtue consecrate

126
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.930
to justice, continence,and nobility.

127
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.770
But let desert in pureelection shine

128
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.470
and Romans fight forfreedom in your choice.

129
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.330
Princes, that strive byfactions and by friends

130
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.800
ambitiously for rule andempery,

131
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.400
know that the people ofRome,

132
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.430
for whom we stand aspecial party,

133
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.100
have, by common voice inelection for the Romanempery,

134
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.100
chosen Andronicus,surnamed Pius

135
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.300
for many good and greatdesserts to Rome.

136
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.500
A nobler man, a braverwarrior

137
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.830
lives not this day withinthe city wall.

138
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.000
He by the senate isaccited home

139
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.670
from weary wars againstthe barbarous Goths

140
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.870
that with his sons, aterror to our foes,

141
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.200
hath yoked a nationstrong, trained up inarms.

142
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.870
Ten years are spent

143
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.930
since first he undertookthis cause for Rome

144
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.400
and chastised with armsour enemies' pride.

145
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.000
Five times, he hathreturned bleeding to Rome,

146
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.100
bearing his valiant sonsin coffins from the field.

147
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.800
And at this day,

148
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.300
to the monument of theAndronici done sacrificeof expiation

149
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.130
and slain the noblestprisoner of the Goths.

150
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.230
And now at last, ladenwith honor's spoils,

151
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.930
returns the goodAndronicus to Rome;

152
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.800
renowned Titus,flourishing in arms.

153
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.900
Let us entreat, by honorof his name

154
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.330
whom worthily you wouldhave now succeed

155
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.070
and in the capitol andsenate's right,

156
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.600
whom you pretend to honorand adore

157
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.230
let you withdraw you andabate your strength,

158
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.330
dismiss your followersand, as suitors should,

159
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.270
plead your desserts inpeace and humbleness.

160
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.970
How fair the tribunespeaks to calm mythoughts.

161
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.130
Marcus Andronicus, so Ido affy

162
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.430

and her to whom my thoughts arehumbled all, rich ornament,

166
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.570
that I will here dismissmy loving friends

167
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.100
and to my fortunes and thepeople's favor

168
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.300
commit my cause in balanceto be weighed.

169
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.470

as I am confident and kindto thee.

And that he will, andshall if Lucius live.

290
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.270
Traitors, avaunt!

291
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.230
Where is the emperor'sguard?

292
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.530
Treason, my lord! Laviniais surprised.

293
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.770
Surprised by whom?

294
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.370
By him that justly maybear his betrothed

295
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.630
from all the world away.

296
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.430
Brothers, help convey herhence away,

297
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.500
and with my sword, I'llkeep this door safe.

298
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.200
Follow, my lord, and I'llsoon bring her back.

299
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.700
My lord! You pass nothere.

300
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.670
What, villain boy!

301
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.800
Bar'st me my way in Rome?

302
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.830
Help, Lucius, help!

303
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.000
My lord!

304
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.700
You are unjust, and morethan so.

305
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.000
In wrongful quarrel youhave slain your son.

306
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.600
Nor thou nor here are anysons of mine.

307
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.470
My sons would never sodishonor me.

308
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.400
Traitor, restore Laviniato the emperor.

309
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.100
Dead, if you will, but notto be his wife

310
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.230
but as another's lawfulpromised love.

311
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.030
No, Titus, no.

312
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.300
The emperor needs her not;

313
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.670
nor her nor thee, nor anyof thy stock.

314
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.130
I'll trust by leisure himthat mocks me once;

315
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.430
thee never, nor thytraitorous, haughty sons,

316
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.930
confederates all thus todishonor me.

317
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:20.030
Was none in Rome to make astale but Saturnine?

318
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.400
Full well, Andronicus,

319
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.670
agree these deeds withthat proud brag of thine

320
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.600
that said'st I begged theempire at thy hands.

321
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.770
O, monstrous; whatreproachful words arethese?

322
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.800
Go thy ways; go, give thatchanging peace

323
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.000
to him that flourished forher with his sword.

324
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.330
A valiant son-in-law thoushalt enjoy,

325
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.370
one fit to bandy with thylawless sons,

326
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.000
to ruffle in thecommonwealth of Rome.

327
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.270
These words are razors tomy wounded heart.

328
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.270
I will, therefore.

329
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.870

Titus, when wert thou wontto walk alone,

355
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.770
dishonored thus, andchallenged of wrongs?

356
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.300
O, Titus, see; O, see whatthou hast done:

357
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.130
in a bad quarrel slain avirtuous son.

358
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.670
No, foolish tribune, no.

359
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.370
No son of mine, nor thou,nor these confederates

360
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.330
in the deed that hathdishonored all our family;

361
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.100
unworthy brother andunworthy sons.

362
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.030
But let us give himburial, as becomes.

363
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.230
Give Mutius burial withour brethren.

364
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.600
Traitors, away.

365
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.130
He rests not in this tomb.

366
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.730
This monument 500 yearshath stood

367
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.300
which I have sumptuouslyreedified.

368
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.570
Here none but soldiers andRome's servitors

369
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.930
repose in fame; nonebasely slain in brawls.

370
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.370
Bury him where you can.

371
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.900
He comes not here.

372
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.300
My lord, this is impietyin you.

373
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.430
My nephew Mutius' deeds doplead for him.

374
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:05.900
He must be buried with hisbrethren.

375
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.330
And shall, or him we willaccompany.

376
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.500
"And shall."

377
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.800
What villain was it spakethat word?

378
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800
He that would vouch it inany place but here.

379
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.600
What, would you bury himin my despite?

380
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.500
No, noble Titus, butentreat of thee

381
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.070
to pardon Mutius and tobury him.

382
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.830
Marcus, even thou haststruck upon my crest,

383
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.830
and with these boys, minehonor thou hast wounded.

384
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.770
My foes I do repute youevery one.

385
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.000
So trouble me no more, butget you gone.

386
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.530
He is not with himself.

387
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.700
Let us withdraw.

388
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.430
Not I, till Mutius' bonesbe buried.

389
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.370
Brother, for in that namedoth nature plead

390
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.730
Father, and in that namedoth nature speak

391
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.900
Speak thou no more, if allthe rest will speed.

392
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.630
Renowned Titus, more thanhalf my soul

393
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.830
Dear father, soul andsubstance of us all

394
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.200
Suffer thy brother Marcus

395
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.370
to inter his noble nephewhere in virtue's nest

396
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.070
that died in honor andLavinia's cause.

397
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.330
Thou art a Roman; be notbarbarous.

398
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.330
The Greeks, upon advice,did bury Ajax that slewhimself.

399
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.970
And wise Laertes' son didgraciously plead hisfunerals.

400
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.370
Let not young Mutius,then, that was thy joy,

401
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.200
be barred his entrancehere.

402
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.330
Rise, Marcus, rise.

403
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.870
The dismalest day is thisthat e'er I saw,

404
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:40.830
to be dishonored by mysons in Rome.

405
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.100
Well, bury him, and buryme the next.

406
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.670
There lie thy bones, sweetMutius, with thy friends,

407
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.530
till we with trophies doadorn thy tomb.

408
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.870
No man shed tears fornoble Mutius.

409
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.130
He lives in fame that diedin virtue's cause.

410
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.030
My lord, to step out ofthese dreary dumps

411
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.130
How comes it that thesubtle queen of Goths

412
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.630
is of a sudden thusadvanced in Rome?

413
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.730
I know not, Marcus, but Iknow it is;

414
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.830
whether by device or no,the heavens can tell.

415
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.970
Is she not, then,beholding to the man

416
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.070
that brought her for thishigh good turn so far?

417
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.070
Yes, and will nobly himremunerate.

418
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.430
So Bassianus, you haveplayed your prize.

419
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.500
God give you joy, sir, ofyour gallant bride.

420
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.900
And you of yours, my lord.

421
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.630
I say no more, nor wish noless.

422
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.130
And so I take my leave.

423
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.500
Traitor!

424
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.800
If Rome have law or wehave power,

425
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.800
thou and thy faction shallrepent this rape.

426
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.400
Rape call you it, my lord,to seize my own,

427
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.570
my true betrothed love,and now my wife?

428
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.000
But let the laws of Romedetermine all.

429
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.200
Meanwhile am I possessedof that is mine.

430
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.030
'Tis good, sir; you arevery short with us.

431
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.030
But if we live, we'll beas sharp with you.

432
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.530
My lord, what I have done,as best I may,

433
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.130
answer I must, and shalldo with my life.

434
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.730
Only thus much I give YourGrace to know:

435
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.630
by all the duties that Iowe to Rome,

436
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.700
this noble gentleman, LordTitus here,

437
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.030
is in opinion and in honorwronged;

438
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.930
that in the rescue ofLavinia with his own hand

439
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.730
did slay his youngest sonin zeal to you

440
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.600
and highly moved to wrathto be controlled

441
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.730
in that he frankly gave.

442
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.170
Receive him then to favor,Saturnine,

443
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.100
that hath expressedhimself in all his deeds

444
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.570
a father and a friend tothee and Rome.

445
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.330
Prince Bassianus, leave toplead my deeds.

446
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.100
'Tis thou and these thathath dishonored me.

447
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.270
Rome and the righteousheavens be my judge

448
00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.930
how I have loved andhonored Saturnine.

449
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:07.370
My worthy lord, if everTamora were gracious

450
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.900
in those princely eyes ofthine, then hear me speak

451
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.230
indifferently for all, andat my suit, sweet,

452
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.630
pardon what has passed.

453
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.400
What, madam, be dishonoredopenly

454
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.670
and basely put it upwithout revenge?

455
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.630
Not so, my lord.

456
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.100
The gods of Rome forfend

457
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.930
I should be author todishonor you.

458
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.130
But on mine honor may Iundertake

459
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.130
for good Lord Titus'innocence in all,

460
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.570
whose fury not dissembledspeaks his griefs.

461
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.570
And at my suit, lookgraciously on him.

462
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:40.630
Lose not so noble a friendon vain suppose,

463
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:46.230
nor with sour looksafflict his gentle heart.

464
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.630
My lord, be ruled by me.

465
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.430
Be won at last.

466
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.800
Dissemble all your griefsand discontents.

467
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.770
You are but newly plantedin your throne.

468
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.370
Lest then the people andpatricians too

469
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.700
upon a just survey takeTitus' part,

470
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.070
and so supplant you foringratitude

471
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.270
which Rome reputes to be aheinous sin

472
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:10.000
yield at entreats, andthen let me alone.

473
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.130
I'll find a day tomassacre them all

474
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.730
and raise their factionand their family,

475
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.130
the cruel father and histraitorous sons

476
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.970
to whom I sued for my dearson's life,

477
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.130
and make them know what'tis to let a queen

478
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.330
kneel in the streets andbeg for grace in vain.

479
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.030
Come, come, sweet emperor.

480
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.600
Come, Andronicus.

481
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.400
Take up this good old man,and cheer the heart

482
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.070
that dies in tempest ofthy angry frown.

483
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.200
Rise, Titus, rise.

484
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.770
My empress hath prevailed.

485
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.470
I thank Your Majesty andher, my lord.

486
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.530
These words, these looksinfuse new life in me.

487
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.770
Titus, I am incorporate inRome,

488
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.400
a Roman now adoptedhappily.

489
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.570
I must advise the emperorfor his good.

490
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:02.900

That, on mine honor, heredo I protest.

503

Away, and talk not;trouble us no more.

Nay, nay, sweet emperor.

We must all be friends.

I found a friend.

515
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.300
And sure as death, I swore

516
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.000
