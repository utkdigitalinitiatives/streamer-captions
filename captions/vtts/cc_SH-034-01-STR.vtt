00:00:00.000 --> 00:02:15.300


2
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.070
Romans, make way the good Andronicus.

3
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.330
Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,

4
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.000
successful in the battles that he fights,

5
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.370
with honor and with fortune is returned

6
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.500
from where he circumscribed with his sword

7
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
and brought to yoke the enemies of Rome.

8
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.130
Hail, Rome,

9
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.670
victorious in thy mourning weeds.

10
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.470
Lo, as the bark that hath discharged her freight

11
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.900
returns with precious lading to the bay

12
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.570
from whence at first she weighed her anchorage,

13
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.370
cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,

14
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.430
to resalute his country with his tears

15
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.970
tears of true joy for his return to Rome.

16
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.930
Thou great defender of this capitol,

17
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.700
stand gracious to the rights that we intend.

18
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.100
Romans of five and twenty valiant sons,

19
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.070
half of the number that King Priam had,

20
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.030
behold the poor remains, alive and dead.

21
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.530
These that survive let Rome reward with love,

22
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.270
these that I bring unto their latest home

23
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.730
with burial amongst their ancestors.

24
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.870
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.

25
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.070
Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,

26
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.400
why sufferest thou thy sons, unburied yet,

27
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.270
to hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?

28
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.830
Make way to lay them by their brethren.

29
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.530
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,

30
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.130
and sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars.

31
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.870
O, sacred receptacle of my joys,

32
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.130
sweet cell of virtue and nobility,

33
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.270
how many sons hast thou of mine in store

34
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.800
that thou wilt never render to me more?

35
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.470
Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,

36
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.730
that we may hew his limbs and on a pile,

37
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.730
ad manes fratrum, sacrifice his flesh

38
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.970
before this earthy prison of their bones

39
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.930
that so the shadows be not unappeased

40
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.900
nor we disturbed with prodigies on earth.

41
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.830
I give you him, the noblest that survives,

42
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.070
the eldest son of this distressed queen.

43
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.030
Stay, Roman brethren!

44
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.500
Gracious conqueror, victorious Titus,

45
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.470
rue the tears I shed,

46
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.330
a mother's tears in passion for her son.

47
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.630
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,

48
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.230
O, think my son to be as dear to me.

49
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.730
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome

50
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.570
to beautify thy triumphs and return captive to thee

51
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.830
and to thy Roman yoke; but must my sons

52
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.070
be slaughtered in the streets for valiant doings

53
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.900
in their country's cause?

54
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.530
O, if to fight for king and commonweal

55
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:05.470
were piety in thine, it is in these.

56
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.730
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood.

57
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.100
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?

58
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.830
Draw near them, then, in being merciful.

59
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.930
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge.

60
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.770
Thrice noble Titus, spare my firstborn son.

61
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.070
Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.

62
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.730
These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld,

63
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.530
alive and dead, and for their brethren slain

64
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.300
religiously they ask sacrifice.

65
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.370
To this, your son is marked, and die he must,

66
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.670
to appease their groaning shadows that are gone.

67
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.270
Away with him, and make a path straight;

68
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.070
and with our swords, upon a pile of wood,

69
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.100
let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.

70
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.030
O, cruel, irreligious piety!

71
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.230
Was never Scythia half so barbarous?

72
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.300
Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.

73
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.170
Alarbus goes to rest, and we survive

74
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.430
to tremble under Titus' threatening look.

75
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:18.530
And, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal

76
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.630
the self-same gods that arm the queen of Troy

77
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.170
with opportunity of sharp revenge

78
00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.070
upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent

79
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:27.270
may favor Tamora, the queen of Goths

80
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.230
when Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen

81
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.170
to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

82
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.570
See, lord and father, how we have performed

83
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.000
our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopped,

84
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.730
and entrails feed the sacrificing fire,

85
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.100
whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.

86
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.900
Remaineth not but to inter our brethren

87
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.170
and with loud larums welcome them to Rome.

88
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.970
Let it be so, and let Andronicus

89
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.300
make this his latest farewell to their souls.

90
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.170
In peace and honor rest you here, my sons.

91
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:07.730
Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,

92
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.600
secure from worldly chances and mishaps.

93
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:17.130
Here lurks no treason; here no envy swells.

94
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.030
Here grow no damned drugs; here are no storms,

95
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:25.870
no noise but silence and eternal sleep.

96
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.830
In peace and honor rest you here, my sons.

97
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.400
In peace and honor live Lord Titus long.

98
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.100
My noble lord and father, live in fame.

99
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.970
Lo, at this tomb, my tributary tears I render

100
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.500
for my brethren's obsequies.

101
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.330
And at thy feet I kneel with tears of joy

102
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:00.500
shed on this earth for thy return to Rome.

103
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.530
O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,

104
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.570
whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud.

105
00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.870
Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved

106
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.870
the cordial of mine age to glad my heart.

107
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.470
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days

108
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:26.330
and fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise.

109
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.270
Succession Saturninus. Succession Saturninus.

110
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:32.970
Succession Saturninus. Succession Saturninus.

111
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.900
Succession Saturninus. Succession!

112
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.700
Noble patricians, patrons of my right,

113
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.870
defend the justice of my cause with arms.

114
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.170
And, countrymen, my loving followers,

115
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.830
plead my successive title with your swords.

116
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.070
I am his firstborn son that was the last that wear

117
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:53.870
the imperial diadem of Rome.

118
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.330
Then let my father's honors live in me,

119
00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.470
nor wrong mine age with this indignity.

120
00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.830
Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,

121
00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.470
if ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,

122
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.730
were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,

123
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.630
keep then this passage to the capitol

124
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.030
and suffer not dishonor to approach the imperial seat.

125
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.870
To virtue consecrate

126
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:17.930
to justice, continence, and nobility.

127
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.770
But let desert in pure election shine

128
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.470
and Romans fight for freedom in your choice.

129
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:27.330
Princes, that strive by factions and by friends

130
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.800
ambitiously for rule and empery,

131
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.400
know that the people of Rome,

132
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.430
for whom we stand a special party,

133
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.100
have, by common voice in election for the Roman empery,

134
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.100
chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius

135
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.300
for many good and great desserts to Rome.

136
00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.500
A nobler man, a braver warrior

137
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.830
lives not this day within the city wall.

138
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.000
He by the senate is accited home

139
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.670
from weary wars against the barbarous Goths

140
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.870
that with his sons, a terror to our foes,

141
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.200
hath yoked a nation strong, trained up in arms.

142
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.870
Ten years are spent

143
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.930
since first he undertook this cause for Rome

144
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.400
and chastised with arms our enemies' pride.

145
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.000
Five times, he hath returned bleeding to Rome,

146
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.100
bearing his valiant sons in coffins from the field.

147
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.800
And at this day,

148
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.300
to the monument of the Andronici done sacrifice of expiation

149
00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.130
and slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths.

150
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.230
And now at last, laden with honor's spoils,

151
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.930
returns the good Andronicus to Rome;

152
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.800
renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.

153
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.900
Let us entreat, by honor of his name

154
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.330
whom worthily you would have now succeed

155
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.070
and in the capitol and senate's right,

156
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.600
whom you pretend to honor and adore

157
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.230
let you withdraw you and abate your strength,

158
00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:48.330
dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,

159
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.270
plead your desserts in peace and humbleness.

160
00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.970
How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts.

161
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.130
Marcus Andronicus, so I do affy

162
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.430
in thy uprightness and integrity,

163
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.770
and so I love and honor thee and thine,

164
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:05.770
thy noble brother Titus and his sons,

165
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.330
and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all, rich ornament,

166
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.570
that I will here dismiss my loving friends

167
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.100
and to my fortunes and the people's favor

168
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.300
commit my cause in balance to be weighed.

169
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.470
Friends that have been thus forward in my right,

170
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.370
I thank you all and here dismiss you all

171
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.100
and to the love and favor of my country

172
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.970
commit myself, my person, and the cause.

173
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:44.930
Rome, be as just and gracious unto me

174
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:47.300
as I am confident and kind to thee.

175
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.630
Romans, and me, a poor competitor.

176
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.830
Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,

177
00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.070
gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome.

178
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.900
Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.

179
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:14.300
And welcome, nephews, from successful wars

180
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.970
you that survive and you that sleep in fame.

181
00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.500
Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,

182
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.730
whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,

183
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.030
send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,

184
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.630
this palliament of white and spotless hue

185
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.870
and name you in election for the empery

186
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.830
with these, our late-deceased emperor's sons.

187
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.330
Be candidatus, then, and put it on,

188
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.000
and help to set a head on headless Rome.

189
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.400
A better head her glorious body fits

190
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:51.070
than his that shakes for age and feebleness.

191
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.070
What, should I don this robe and trouble you,

192
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.470
be chosen with proclamations today,

193
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.700
tomorrow yield up rule, resign my life,

194
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.400
and set abroad new business for you all?

195
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:08.300
Rome, I have been thy soldier 40 years

196
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.230
and led my country's strength successfully

197
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:14.500
and buried one and twenty valiant sons,

198
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.700
knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,

199
00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.970
in right and service of their noble country.

200
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:25.000
Give me a staff of honor for mine age,

201
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.770
not a scepter to control the world.

202
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.200
Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.

203
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.830
Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.

204
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.400
Proud and ambitious tribune!

205
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.530
Canst thou tell?

206
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.800
Patience, Prince Saturninus.

207
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.530
Romans, do me right!

208
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.200
Patricians, draw your swords and sheath them not

209
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.630
till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.

210
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.530
Andronicus, would thou were shipped to hell

211
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.730
rather than rob me of the people's hearts.

212
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.770
Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good

213
00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.530
that noble-minded Titus means to thee!

214
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.970
Content thee, Prince; I will restore

215
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.670
the people's hearts to thee and wean them from themselves.

216
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.530
Andronicus, I do not flatter thee

217
00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.570
but honor thee, and will do till I die.

218
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.070
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,

219
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:14.830
I will most thankful be.

220
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.470
And thanks to men of noble minds is honorable meed.

221
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.600
People of Rome and people's tribunes here,

222
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.630
I ask your voices and your suffrages.

223
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.100
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?

224
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.970
To gratify the good Andronicus

225
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.700
and gratulate his safe return to Rome,

226
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.530
the people will accept whom he admits.

227
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.070
Tribunes, I thank you, and this suit I make:

228
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.470
that you create our emperor's eldest son, Lord Saturnine,

229
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:51.870
whose virtues will, I hope,

230
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.100
reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth

231
00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.800
and ripen justice in this commonweal.

232
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.730
Then if you will elect by my advice,

233
00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:06.200
crown him, and say, "Long live our emperor."

234
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.800
With voices and applause of every sort,

235
00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.300
patricians and plebeians,

236
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:13.930
we create Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor

237
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.830
and say, "Long live our Emperor Saturnine."

238
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.900
Long live our Emperor Saturnine.

239
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.630
Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done to us

240
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.270
in our election this day, I give thee thanks

241
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:06.730
in part of thy desserts and will with deeds

242
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.530
requite thy gentleness.

243
00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.570
And for an onset, Titus,

244
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.370
to advance thy name and honorable family,

245
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.900
Lavinia will I make my empress,

246
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.200
Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,

247
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.970
and in the sacred Pantheon her espouse.

248
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:28.170
Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?

249
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.730
It doth, my worthy lord.

250
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.770
And in this match I hold me highly honored of Your Grace.

251
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.930
And here, in sight of Rome,

252
00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.900
to Saturnine, king and commander of our commonweal,

253
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:58.600
the wide world's emperor, do I consecrate my sword,

254
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.400
my chariot, and my prisoners,

255
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.530
presents well worthy Rome's imperious lord.

256
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:07.230
Receive them, then, the tribute that I owe,

257
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.070
mine honor's ensigns humbled at thy feet.

258
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:13.400
Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life.

259
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.170
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts

260
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.400
Rome shall record.

261
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.730
And when I do forget the least of these unspeakable desserts,

262
00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.200
Romans, forget your fealty to me.

263
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.830
Now, madam, are you prisoner to an emperor,

264
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:29.700
to him that for your honor and your state

265
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.270
will use you nobly and your followers.

266
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.570
A goodly lady trust me, of the hue

267
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:46.030
that I would choose, were I to choose anew.

268
00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.900
Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance.

269
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.470
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,

270
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.500
thou comes not to be made a scorn in Rome.

271
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.630
Princely shall be thy usage every way; rest on my word.

272
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.900
And let not discontent daunt all your hopes.

273
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.370
Madam, he comforts you can make you greater

274
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.030
than the queen of Goths.

275
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.870
You are not displeased with this, Lavinia?

276
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.870
Not I, my lord, sith true nobility

277
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.630
warrants these words in princely courtesy.

278
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.530
Thanks, sweet Lavinia.

279
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.230
Romans, let us go.

280
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.500
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free.

281
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.830
Proclaim our honors, lords, with trump and drum.

282
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:53.700
Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.

283
00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.530
How, sir.

284
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:57.570
Are you in earnest, then, my lord?

285
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.370
Aye, noble Titus, and resolved withal

286
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.370
to do myself this reason and this right.

287
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.100
Suum cique is our Roman justice.

288
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.900
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.

289
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.270
And that he will, and shall if Lucius live.

290
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.270
Traitors, avaunt!

291
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.230
Where is the emperor's guard?

292
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.530
Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised.

293
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.770
Surprised by whom?

294
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.370
By him that justly may bear his betrothed

295
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.630
from all the world away.

296
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:22.430
Brothers, help convey her hence away,

297
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:24.500
and with my sword, I'll keep this door safe.

298
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.200
Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.

299
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.700
My lord! You pass not here.

300
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.670
What, villain boy!

301
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.800
Bar'st me my way in Rome?

302
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.830
Help, Lucius, help!

303
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.000
My lord!

304
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.700
You are unjust, and more than so.

305
00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.000
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.

306
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.600
Nor thou nor here are any sons of mine.

307
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.470
My sons would never so dishonor me.

308
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.400
Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.

309
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.100
Dead, if you will, but not to be his wife

310
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.230
but as another's lawful promised love.

311
00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:59.030
No, Titus, no.

312
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.300
The emperor needs her not;

313
00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.670
nor her nor thee, nor any of thy stock.

314
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:09.130
I'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once;

315
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.430
thee never, nor thy traitorous, haughty sons,

316
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.930
confederates all thus to dishonor me.

317
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:20.030
Was none in Rome to make a stale but Saturnine?

318
00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.400
Full well, Andronicus,

319
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.670
agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine

320
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.600
that said'st I begged the empire at thy hands.

321
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:28.770
O, monstrous; what reproachful words are these?

322
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.800
Go thy ways; go, give that changing peace

323
00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.000
to him that flourished for her with his sword.

324
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.330
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy,

325
00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.370
one fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,

326
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.000
to ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.

327
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.270
These words are razors to my wounded heart.

328
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.270
I will, therefore.

329
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.870
Lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,

330
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:49.270
that like the stately Phoebe amongst her nymphs

331
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.170
dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome.

332
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.900
If thou be pleased with this, my sudden choice,

333
00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:00.400
behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride

334
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.570
and will create thee empress of Rome.

335
00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.200
Speak, queen of Goths.

336
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.130
Dost thou applaud my choice?

337
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.970
And here I swear, by all the Roman gods,

338
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.200
sith priest and holy water are so near,

339
00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.470
and taper burn so bright, and everything in readiness

340
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:17.930
for Hymenaeus stand, I will not resalute

341
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.400
the streets of Rome or climb my palace

342
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.730
till from forth this place I lead espoused

343
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.670
my bride along with me.

344
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.830
And here in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,

345
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.230
if Saturnine advance the queen of Goths,

346
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.770
she will a handmaid be to his desires,

347
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.330
a loving nurse, a mother to his youth.

348
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.630
Ascend, fair queen, the Pantheon.

349
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.030
Lords, accompany your noble emperor and his lovely bride,

350
00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.730
sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,

351
00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:57.600
whose wisdom hath her fortunes conquered.

352
00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.300
There shall we consummate our spousal rites.

353
00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.670
I am not bid to wait upon this bride.

354
00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:11.930
Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,

355
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.770
dishonored thus, and challenged of wrongs?

356
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.300
O, Titus, see; O, see what thou hast done:

357
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.130
in a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.

358
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.670
No, foolish tribune, no.

359
00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:26.370
No son of mine, nor thou, nor these confederates

360
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.330
in the deed that hath dishonored all our family;

361
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.100
unworthy brother and unworthy sons.

362
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.030
But let us give him burial, as becomes.

363
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.230
Give Mutius burial with our brethren.

364
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.600
Traitors, away.

365
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.130
He rests not in this tomb.

366
00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:46.730
This monument 500 years hath stood

367
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:49.300
which I have sumptuously reedified.

368
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.570
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors

369
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:56.930
repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls.

370
00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.370
Bury him where you can.

371
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.900
He comes not here.

372
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.300
My lord, this is impiety in you.

373
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.430
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him.

374
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:05.900
He must be buried with his brethren.

375
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.330
And shall, or him we will accompany.

376
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.500
"And shall."

377
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.800
What villain was it spake that word?

378
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.800
He that would vouch it in any place but here.

379
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.600
What, would you bury him in my despite?

380
00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.500
No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee

381
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.070
to pardon Mutius and to bury him.

382
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.830
Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,

383
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:24.830
and with these boys, mine honor thou hast wounded.

384
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.770
My foes I do repute you every one.

385
00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:29.000
So trouble me no more, but get you gone.

386
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.530
He is not with himself.

387
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.700
Let us withdraw.

388
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.430
Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.

389
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.370
Brother, for in that name doth nature plead

390
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.730
Father, and in that name doth nature speak

391
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.900
Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.

392
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.630
Renowned Titus, more than half my soul

393
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.830
Dear father, soul and substance of us all

394
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.200
Suffer thy brother Marcus

395
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.370
to inter his noble nephew here in virtue's nest

396
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:05.070
that died in honor and Lavinia's cause.

397
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:08.330
Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous.

398
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:12.330
The Greeks, upon advice, did bury Ajax that slew himself.

399
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.970
And wise Laertes' son did graciously plead his funerals.

400
00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:19.370
Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy,

401
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.200
be barred his entrance here.

402
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.330
Rise, Marcus, rise.

403
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:35.870
The dismalest day is this that e'er I saw,

404
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:40.830
to be dishonored by my sons in Rome.

405
00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.100
Well, bury him, and bury me the next.

406
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.670
There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,

407
00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.530
till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.

408
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.870
No man shed tears for noble Mutius.

409
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.130
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.

410
00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:13.030
My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps

411
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.130
How comes it that the subtle queen of Goths

412
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.630
is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?

413
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.730
I know not, Marcus, but I know it is;

414
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:25.830
whether by device or no, the heavens can tell.

415
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.970
Is she not, then, beholding to the man

416
00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.070
that brought her for this high good turn so far?

417
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.070
Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.

418
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.430
So Bassianus, you have played your prize.

419
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.500
God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride.

420
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.900
And you of yours, my lord.

421
00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.630
I say no more, nor wish no less.

422
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.130
And so I take my leave.

423
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:56.500
Traitor!

424
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.800
If Rome have law or we have power,

425
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.800
thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.

426
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.400
Rape call you it, my lord, to seize my own,

427
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.570
my true betrothed love, and now my wife?

428
00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.000
But let the laws of Rome determine all.

429
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.200
Meanwhile am I possessed of that is mine.

430
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.030
'Tis good, sir; you are very short with us.

431
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:20.030
But if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.

432
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.530
My lord, what I have done, as best I may,

433
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.130
answer I must, and shall do with my life.

434
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.730
Only thus much I give Your Grace to know:

435
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.630
by all the duties that I owe to Rome,

436
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.700
this noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,

437
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.030
is in opinion and in honor wronged;

438
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.930
that in the rescue of Lavinia with his own hand

439
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.730
did slay his youngest son in zeal to you

440
00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.600
and highly moved to wrath to be controlled

441
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.730
in that he frankly gave.

442
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:45.170
Receive him then to favor, Saturnine,

443
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.100
that hath expressed himself in all his deeds

444
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.570
a father and a friend to thee and Rome.

445
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.330
Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds.

446
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.100
'Tis thou and these that hath dishonored me.

447
00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.270
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge

448
00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.930
how I have loved and honored Saturnine.

449
00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:07.370
My worthy lord, if ever Tamora were gracious

450
00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.900
in those princely eyes of thine, then hear me speak

451
00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:14.230
indifferently for all, and at my suit, sweet,

452
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.630
pardon what has passed.

453
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:18.400
What, madam, be dishonored openly

454
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.670
and basely put it up without revenge?

455
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.630
Not so, my lord.

456
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.100
The gods of Rome forfend

457
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.930
I should be author to dishonor you.

458
00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.130
But on mine honor may I undertake

459
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.130
for good Lord Titus' innocence in all,

460
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.570
whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs.

461
00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:36.570
And at my suit, look graciously on him.

462
00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:40.630
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,

463
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:46.230
nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.

464
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.630
My lord, be ruled by me.

465
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:50.430
Be won at last.

466
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:52.800
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents.

467
00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.770
You are but newly planted in your throne.

468
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.370
Lest then the people and patricians too

469
00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.700
upon a just survey take Titus' part,

470
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.070
and so supplant you for ingratitude

471
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:04.270
which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin

472
00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:10.000
yield at entreats, and then let me alone.

473
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.130
I'll find a day to massacre them all

474
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.730
and raise their faction and their family,

475
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:19.130
the cruel father and his traitorous sons

476
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.970
to whom I sued for my dear son's life,

477
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.130
and make them know what 'tis to let a queen

478
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.330
kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.

479
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:31.030
Come, come, sweet emperor.

480
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.600
Come, Andronicus.

481
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.400
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart

482
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:39.070
that dies in tempest of thy angry frown.

483
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:42.200
Rise, Titus, rise.

484
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.770
My empress hath prevailed.

485
00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.470
I thank Your Majesty and her, my lord.

486
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.530
These words, these looks infuse new life in me.

487
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.770
Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,

488
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.400
a Roman now adopted happily.

489
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.570
I must advise the emperor for his good.

490
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:02.900
This day, all quarrels die, Andronicus.

491
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.530
And let it me mine honor, good my lord,

492
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:06.930
that I have reconciled your friends and you.

493
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:09.300
For you, Prince Bassianus,

494
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.870
I have passed my word and promise to the emperor

495
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:15.430
that you will be more mild and tractable.

496
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.930
And fear not, lords, and you, Lavinia.

497
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.170
By my advice, all humbled on your knees,

498
00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.600
you shall ask pardon of His Majesty.

499
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.370
We do, and vow to heaven and to His Highness

500
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.130
that what we did was, mildly as we might,

501
00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.330
tendering our sister's honor and our own.

502
00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:36.130
That, on mine honor, here do I protest.

503
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.670
Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.

504
00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.100
Nay, nay, sweet emperor.

505
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.230
We must all be friends.

506
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:45.530
The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace.

507
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.470
I will not be denied.

508
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:51.000
Sweet heart, look back.

509
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:03.730
Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,

510
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:08.630
and at my lovely Tamora's entreats,

511
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:12.570
I do remit these young men's heinous faults.

512
00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:13.730
Stand up.

513
00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.800
Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,

514
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.500
I found a friend.

515
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.300
And sure as death, I swore

516
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.000
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.

517
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:35.170
Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,

518
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.630
you are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.

519
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.730
This day shall be a love day, Tamora.

520
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.270
Tomorrow, and it please Your Majesty

521
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.070
to hunt the panther and a hart with me,

522
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:51.870
with horn and hound, we'll give Your Grace bonjour.

523
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.500
Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.

524
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.270
