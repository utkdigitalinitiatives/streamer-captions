WEBVTT

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
*

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
YOU IN THE GAME.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
YOU WANT TO GET MONEY,
YOU WANT TO BUY HOUSES,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
YOU WANT TO BUY CARS.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
THAT'S WHAT YOU
WANT AND SOMETIMES

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
YOU LAND ON THE JAIL PART.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
YOU GOTTA TAKE THE TIME.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
YOU REALIZE YOU IN
JAIL WHEN YOU WAKE UP

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
AND YOU CAN'T GO NOWHERE AND
YOU JUST WALK AROUND.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
CAN'T GO TO THE STORE,
GO IN YOUR POCKET

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
AND CAN'T PULL OUT NO
MONEY OR NO NOTHING.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I DON' T THINK THAT
I'M A CRIMINAL.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I JUST SEE MYSELF
AS A YOUNG MAN

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
THAT MADE A BAD
CHOICE BASICALLY.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
BUT I'M SCARED FOR
THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
IT JUST MAKES ME NERVOUS AND I
THINK ABOUT IT A LOT.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'M FRANK DODY.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I'M THE PRINCIPLE OF
ISLAND ACADEMY.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
A HIGH SCHOOL LOCATED ON
RIKER'S ISLAND.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
MOST OF OUR STUDENTS ARE 16 TO
18 YEARS OF AGE ALTHOUGH WE DO

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
PROVIDE EDUCATION FOR GUYS
OVER 21 AND MOST OF THEM HAVE

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME WAY IN
THE DRUG INDUSTRY.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
MY NAME IS TRAVIS BERRY,
I'M 18.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'M HERE FOR THE
POSSESSION OF DRUGS.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
JAIL IS THE DOWNFALL FOR..
THE PRICE THAT YOU PAY

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
OF SELLING DRUGS OR
WHATEVER CRIME YOU COMMIT.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
THE AVERAGE KID WHO COMES
THROUGH HERE IS TELLING US THE

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
SAME STORY AND THAT IS I
DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL OUTSIDE.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL THERE.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
WHY WOULD I GO TO SCHOOL NOW
THAT I'M INCARCERATED?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
IN THE EARLY WEEKS IN
THERE TIME WITH US,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
THAT'S THE KID
WE'RE LIVING WITH.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
WE'RE LIVING WITH A
DISINTERESTED, UNMOTIVATED KID

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT
HE CAN BE A STUDENT.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
WHEN I GO HOME, WHATEVER
I DO THAT GOT ME HERE,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'M GONNA DO
SMARTER, THAT'S IT.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'M GONNA JUST DO IT SMARTER.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I AIN'T GONNA FRONT FOR
THE CAMERA AND LIE,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'M GONNA KEEP IT REAL
AND DO WHAT I DO.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'M GONNA GET A JOB BUT I'M
STILL GONNA DO WHAT I DO.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA COME
BACK CAUSE I CAN'T BUT,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I'M STILL GONNA DO WHAT I DO.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
ONCE THEY'VE BEEN
WITH US AWHILE,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
ONCE WE'VE GIVEN THEM SUCCESSFUL
ACADEMIC EXPERIENCES,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
ONCE THEY'VE MET THE NURTURING
TEACHERS THAT WE HAVE HERE,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
THEY BEGIN TO BELIEVE THAT
THEY CAN BE STUDENTS.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
THEY BEGIN TO
CHANGE THE VISION

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
OF THEMSELVES IN
INCARCERATION.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
AND WE HOPE, AND WE HAVE
COUNCILLORS WHO HELP US

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
PREPARE THIS, THAT THEY CAN
BEGIN TO VISION THEMSELVES

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
AS SOMEBODY DIFFERENT
IN SOCIETY,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
THEN THEY WERE GOING TO
BE BEFORE THEY MET US.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
THE MAJOR THRUST OF THIS
SCHOOL IS IMPROVING LITERACY.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
ILLITERACY IS RAMPANT IN
THE JAIL POPULATION.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
IT IS RAMPANT IN THE
ADOLESCENT POPULATION

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
THAT WE SERVE.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
SO ALTHOUGH WE OFFER COMPUTERS
AND ART AND BARBERING AND

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
SOCIAL STUDIES, EVERYBODY HAS
A STAKE IN HELPING THE KIDS BE

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
MORE LITERATE SO THEY COULD
READ AND WRITE AND THEN

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
PARTICIPATE IN EDUCATION
PROGRAM WHEN THEY LEAVE US.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
AS WE WERE SAYING GIRLS, WE
WERE TALKING ABOUT ONE OF THE

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
NOTED SHORT STORY
WRITERS AND POETS.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
AND I WANTED TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO EDGAR ALLAN POE

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
WHO WROTE THE RAVEN.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER
HEARD OF THE RAVEN ?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
THE RAVEN I'M NOT...

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.000
NO.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
ALRIGHT.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
BECAUSE BEING INCARCERATED IS
LIKE IT MAKES YOU SIT THERE

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
AND THINK LIKE WHEN I
GO ON THE OUTSIDE,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
AND HOW TO MOVE.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I KNOW NOT TO DO THIS BECAUSE
THIS WILL GET ME IN TROUBLE

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK,
I WANT TO GO FORWARD.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
AT FIRST, I GOTTA
GET MY G.E.D.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
IN ORDER TO DO ANYTHING.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
THEN I'M GONNA GO TO COLLEGE
AND THAT'S GONNA BE MY MAJOR.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
CRIMINAL JUSTICE, I'M GONNA
MAJOR IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I WANT TO GO HOME.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I WANT TO BE A LAWYER BUT
I WRITE A LOT.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I'M WRITING A BOOK RIGHT NOW.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
IT'S A POETRY BOOK.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I WRITE POETRY.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
AND MR. KING THE TEACHER,
HE'S HELPING ME.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
MY POEM'S CALLED PEACE.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
SOMETIMES I WISH THE WORLD
COULD BE AT PEACE.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
NO COPS THROWING PEOPLE FACE
FIRST ON THE CONCRETE.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
MY HEART SKIP BEATS CAUSE
I'M IN PAIN.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
THINGS ARE ON FIRE
SURROUNDED BY FLAMES.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
CAN YOU SEE THESE COLORS,
WHAT DO THE MEAN?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
IF YOU DON'T KNOW,
I'LL TELL YOU.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
THEY MEAN I'M A
BRIGHT YOUNG LADY.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I DREAM PLENTY OF DREAMS,
DREAMS TO BE FREE EVERYDAY.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
DREAM I'LL GO TO A
BETTER PLACE.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:37.000
*

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
THIS IS THE BARBERY CLASS.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
THIS IS WHERE HE'LL LEARN THE
BASIC SKILLS NECESSARY TO GO

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
OUT AND GET WHAT WE CALL
A JOB CUTTING HAIR.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
ONE OF THE GREAT ADVANTAGES OF
THIS PARTICULAR CLASS IS THAT

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
ONCE A STUDENT FINISHED THIS
CLASS, AND HE GOES HOME,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW ROOMS
THAT HE'LL BE ABLE TO LEAVE

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
AND GO HOME AND BE ABLE
TO GET SOME EMPLOYMENT.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
THAT'S WHY THIS CLASS
IS SO IMPORTANT.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
IF I CAN GET THEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE WILL BE

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
TOOLS THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE
TO USE WHEN THEY LEAVE HERE.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THESE WILL BE SERVICES THAT
EVEN BARBERS ON THE OUTSIDE

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DOING
ON A REGULAR BASIS.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
BUT THEY'LL LEARN TO DO THEM
HERE SO THERE WILL BE A CARRY

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
OVER WHEN THEY LEAVE AND HAVE
AN EDGE I LIKE TO CALL IT.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
SO THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY
FOR THEM TO START THAT PROCESS

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
OF FINDING SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN HAVE

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
AND FEEL COMFORTABLE ABOUT.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
SEE, ONCE THESE GUYS YOU SEE
WHEN THEY COME IN THE ROOM.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
ONCE THESE GUYS START TO CUT
HAIR, THERE IS A SENSE OF

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
CONFIDENCE THAT YOU'LL
SEE NO OTHER PLACE.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I CAN, I CAN ACCOMPLISH,
I CAN DO.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
AND NOW ALL I NEED THEM TO
DO IS TO HOLD ON TO THAT

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
WHEN THEY CROSS THAT
BRIDGE TO FREEDOM.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I GET STORIES ALL THE TIME
ABOUT GUYS OUT WORKING IN THE

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
CITY THAT USED TO COME HERE.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
MATTER OF FACT, SOMEBODY
TOLD ME A FEW WEEKS AGO,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
MR. PARKER DO YOU
KNOW A CERTAIN KID?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
HE CALLED HIS NAME AND I SAID
WELL, I DON'T REMEMBER HIM.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
YA BUT HE SAID HE GOT
HIS TRAINING RIGHT HERE

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
AT OUR ACADEMY.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOOD NEWS TO
HEAR WHEN YOU GOT GUYS THAT

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
ARE REALLY TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF THIS SKILL.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
AND IT'S A SKILL THAT CAN
LAST THEM A LIFETIME.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
WELL, WE'VE COME TO REALIZE A
COUPLE OF THINGS: FIRST OF ALL,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
WE'VE COME TO REALIZE THAT
WE CAN'T DO IT OURSELVES.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
YOU KNOW, UNDER THE LAW OUR
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO HOLD

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
PEOPLE PENDING TRIAL OR WHILE
THEY SERVE THEIR SENTENCE AND

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
WE HAVE NO REAL OBLIGATION TO
THEM OR STATUTORY RELATIONSHIP

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000
WITH THEM ONCE THEY LEAVE.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
HOWEVER, WE'VE TAKEN IT UPON
OURSELVES TO ORGANIZE A

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
COLLABORATION AMONG MORE THAN
40 COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS,
OTHER CITY AGENCIES,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
SOCIAL SERVICE PARTNERS,
ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
LEGAL SERVICES
ORGANIZATIONS, TO FOCUS ON

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
HELPING THE INDIVIDUALS
WHO LEAVE OUR JAILS,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
BE SUCCESSFUL UPON RELEASE

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
AND REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD
THEY COME BACK.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
MY NAME IS BRIANA VAN HEYDORN.
I'M HERE FROM C.E.O.,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
THE CENTER FOR EMPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
C.E.O. IS A TRANSITIONAL
EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
YOU WORK WITH US TEMPORARILY
DOING LIGHT MAINTENANCE,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
CONSTRUCTION, LANDSCAPING
AND WE'LL HELP YOU SECURE

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
AND MAINTAIN A PERMANENT JOB.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
A PERSON IS FIRST
INTRODUCED TO C.E.O.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
AT ORIENTATION IN E.M.T.C.
ON RIKERS ISLAND.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
AND THE COUNCIL WILL GO IN OR
I WILL GO IN AND EXPLAIN WHAT

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
THE PROGRAM IS, TALK TO PEOPLE
ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE DO,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT WHILE
THEY'RE HERE IN THE FACILITY.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
DEMOLITION IS SOMETHING
I WOULDN'T MIND DOING

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
BUT IF I HAD A CHOICE
I WOULD RATHER PICK.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE
THAT MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T DONE

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
BEFORE BUT YOU ARE
INTERESTED IN DOING?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I NEVER HAD NO EXPERIENCE IN
LIKE BEING AN ELECTRICIAN BUT

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I WOULD LIKE TO
DO THAT TOO.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
OK, BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO...

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
NOBODY IS GOING TO STAY ON A
JOB THEY DON'T LIKE RIGHT?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
IF I DIDN'T
LIKE MY JOB,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I WOULDN'T COME TO
JAIL EVERYDAY RIGHT?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS NOT
ONLY PUT YOU IN A JOB THAT YOU

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
WOULD BE ABLE TO
KINDA STAY IN..

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
BUT A JOB THAT YOU
LIKE AS WELL.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR
YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY WHO

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
ARE LEAVING INCARCERATION TO
HAVE A TRANSITIONAL JOB

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
AND IMMEDIATE MONEY BECAUSE OUR
SOCIETY IS SO MATERIALISTIC.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
AND A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE
GET CAUGHT UP IN MTV,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
GET CAUGHT UP IN A LOT
OF THE MUSIC VIDEOS

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
AND THE GLITZ AND
THE GLAMOUR

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
AND I WANT TO LEAVE WITH
A NEW PAIR OF SNEAKERS.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
AND A LOT OF WHAT GETS OUR
YOUNG PEOPLE IN TROUBLE

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
IS CHASING THAT
IMMEDIATE MONEY.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT
TRANSITIONAL JOB BECAUSE IT IS

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
THAT IMMEDIATE MONEY, IT'S
SOMETHING THAT THEY SEE THAT

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
IS HAPPENING RIGHT
HERE IN THE MOMENT

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
AS OPPOSED TO DELAYING
GRATIFICATION,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
THAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
IS REALLY DIFFICULT

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I WANT TO COME OUT
WITH A PLAN.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I DON'T WANT TO COME OUT THERE
WITH JUST .. NOTHING TO DO.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
THE FASTER I LEFT, THE FASTER
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK IN HERE.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I'M GLAD YOU
SAID THAT.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU MAYBE SHOULD DO

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
IS MAKE THAT PLAN AS
TIGHT AS POSSIBLE

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
SO WHEN YOU SIT DOWN
WITH THAT JOB COACH,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
YOU SAY LOOK, I ALREADY
GOT MY PLAN, LET'S GO.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
YOU KNOW, HOW CAN
YOU HELP ME?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
RIGHT?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
JOB COACHES LOVE TO
SEE THAT BECAUSE

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
WE DON'T WANT
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIKE...

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
WELL WE GOTTA PULL
TEETH AND YOU SEEM..

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
YOUR WELL ON YOUR WAY
TO DOING YOUR THING.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
THAT'S FABULOUS.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A KID

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
WHO ENDS UP COMING BACK
HERE AND ONE WHO FINDS

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
A LEGITIMATE PLACE
IN SOCIETY,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE
WHO FINDS A SUPPORT SYSTEM

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
IN THE COMMUNITY AND
ONE WHO DOESN'T.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM
COULD BE THEIR FAMILY,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM
COULD BE A C.B.O.,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM
COULD BE A GOOD FRIEND

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
WHO'S TURNED HIS
OWN LIFE AROUND,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
OR A MENTOR.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO IT IS,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT ORGANIZATION,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
BUT NO KID IN THIS SOCIETY
IS GONNA MAKE IT WITHOUT

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
THE SUPPORT OF SOMEBODY
ELSE HELPING THEM TO MAKE

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
THE RIGHT DECISIONS
ALONG THE WAY.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:12.000
*

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:21.000
*

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
MY NAME IS JAHMAR MOORE.
I'M 19.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I'VE BEEN INCARCERATED 3 TIMES.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
THE FIRST TIME ROBBERY.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
THE SECOND TIME A
GUN CHARGE

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:39.000
AND THE THIRD TIME
POSSESSION OF CRACK.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
MY NAME IS JAMILAH CLARK AND I
AM THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
SERVICES FOR AN AGENCY CALLED
ADOLESCENT REENTRY INITIATIVE.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000
WE WORK WITH YOUNG
MEN AGES 16 TO 19

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
PROVIDING REENTRY SERVICES.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
THE OVERARCHING
GOAL, I WOULD SAY,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
IS TO HELP THEM NOT
COME BACK TO JAIL.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
THE WAY THAT USUALLY LOOKS IS
WE HELP CONNECT THEM TO

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
PROGRAMS, EITHER VOCATIONAL
EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
SUBSTANCE ABUSE,
MENTAL HEALTH,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
WHATEVER IT IS THEY NEED
TO GET BACK ON THE PATH

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
SO THEY DON'T END
UP BACK HERE.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
WE DO TYPICALLY 3 TO 4
DISCHARGE PLANNING SESSIONS

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
WHILE THE YOUNG MAN IS
STILL HERE AT RIKERS.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
LOGISTICALLY, IT'S
TO GET INFORMATION

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
ABOUT THE YOUNG PERSON AND SEE
WHAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
DEVELOP A DISCHARGE PLAN
FOR WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
WHEN THEY GET OUT.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
IT ALSO HELPS WITH BONDING.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
BECAUSE WE ARE AN INTENSIVE
CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
WE DO HOME BASED CASE
MANAGEMENT.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
THE MOST IMPORTANT
CONNECTION IS BETWEEN

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
THE CASE MANAGER
AND THE CLIENT.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I MET JAHMAR IN APRIL OF 2006
AND WORK WITH HIM

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
APPROXIMATELY 5 OR 6
WEEKS UNTIL HE'S RELEASE

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
IN MAY OF 2006.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
TO MEET HIM, YOU KNOW RIGHT
AWAY THAT HE'S A YOUNG MAN

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
WITH A LOT OF DREAMS, A LOT OF
PASSION FOR LIFE AND SIMPLY

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
JUST DOESN'T NECESSARILY
HAVE THE TOOLS

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
TO KNOW HOW TO GET FROM
POINT A TO POINT B

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
AND SO WE WORK REALLY
HARD TO TRY TO DO THAT.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I THINK THE PULL OF WHERE HE
LIVES AND HIS REPUTATION AND A

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
LOT OF HIS ACTIVITIES SORT
OF CONSUMED HIM SOMEWHERE

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
IN THAT PROCESS AND IT SEEMED
LIKE YOU KNOW A LITTLE

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
BIT AT A TIME I
WAS LOOSING HIM.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
BUT WE FINALLY WERE ABLE TO
COME BACK AROUND AND GET HIM

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
TO THE POINT WHERE HE WAS
WILLING TO GO TO A PROGRAM.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
HE HAD GONE TO THE
INTERVIEW, SIGNED UP,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
GOTTEN THE
ACCEPTANCE LETTER...

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
INTERVIEW SKILLS AND ALL THAT
KIND OF STUFF..

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
AND THAT'S WHAT THE GROUP ON
THURSDAYS WILL HELP YOU DO.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000
THEY WILL HELP YOU
FILL OUT RESUMES

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
AND RESEARCH ON LIKE JOBS AND
HELP YOU FILL OUT APPLICATIONS

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
AND THAT KIND OF STUFF.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
JAHMAR: I MET JAMILAH LAST YEAR
I WAS IN THE 6 BUILDING

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
AND I SIGNED UP TO THE
R.I. PROGRAM.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
AND I WENT HOME AND
SHE WAS FOLLOWING ME,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
HELPING ME OUT
AND ALL THAT.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
SHE'D COME AROUND AND WE'D
TALK ABOUT STUFF THAT I DID,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
HOW COULD I CHANGE
WHAT I DID...

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
AND THEN WHAT I WANT
TO DO AFTER THAT.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
DO I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
OR WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH
MY LIFE. BASICALLY,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
THAT'S GOOD, THAT IS WHEN
THEY CARE ABOUT YOU.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I MEAN SHE CARED.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO HELP ME,
SO YAH IT FEEL GOOD.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
SO WE STILL NEED YOU
TO BE GOOD?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
ALRIGHT.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
JUST REMEMBER, THINK OF ALL
THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AND

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
USE THE TRICKS THAT THE GUY
TOLD YOU IN TERMS OF MAKING

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
THE 8 DAYS GO FASTER.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
ONE FISH FRIDAY AND
TWO COP OUT SUNDAYS.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LONG
TIME AT ALL NOW RIGHT.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
IT'S NOT.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
SEE.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
AND THEN JUST THINK
AT 6 O'CLOCK,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
THE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY,
I WILL BE HERE IN A VAN.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000
(LAUGHTER.)

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO
PICK UP JAHMAR.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
HE'S BEING RELEASED TODAY.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF
THE PROGRAM AT A.R.I.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
IS TO PROVIDE A RIDE HOME ON A
CLIENTS DAY OF RELEASE.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
SO WE GO AND PICK THEM UP AT
6 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
AND WE TAKE THEM TO
THEIR HOME.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
JAMILAH: I'M EXCITED UM..

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION
OF EXCITEMENT AND NERVOUS

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE
THE REAL TEST BEGINS.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
IT'S EASY TO MAKE PLANS
WHEN IT'S ISOLATED,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
BUT WHEN YOUR OUT AND
BACK IN THE COMMUNITY..

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
THAT'S WHEN YOU SEE WHETHER OR
NOT YOU'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
KEEP THE MOTIVATIONS
AND MAKE IT HAPPEN.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:47.000
SO I'M EXCITED FOR HIM
BECAUSE WHERE HE IS, IS HELL.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
SO I'M EXCITED FOR HIM
NOT TO BE HERE ANYMORE

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
BUT I'M ALSO NERVOUS FOR HIM
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG THING

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
FOR HIM TO NOW BE IN A POSITION
TO ACTUALIZE ALL THE PLANS

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
THAT WE MADE AND ALL THE
DREAMS THAT HE HAS.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
JAHMAL MOORE!

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
ALRIGHT COME ON OUT.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
STAND RIGHT HERE.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
WHAT'S YOUR DATE OF BIRTH?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
FOR WHAT CRIME?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
LET ME TAKE A LOOK INSIDE.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000
JAMILAH: IN TERMS OF THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A KID

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
WHO WALKS OUT OF RIKERS
WITHOUT A PROGRAM?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
I'D SAY I THINK THE
RECIDIVISM RATE

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
IS SOMEWHERE AROUND
60 TO 70 PERCENT

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
OF THEM WILL BE BACK
WITHIN A YEAR.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
GUARD: ONE DISCHARGE
JAHMAL MOORE.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000
OK, TAKE IT OUT.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
SUP.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
JAMILAH: THE RIDE HOME
DEPENDS ON THE KIDS,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
SOME KIDS ARE REALLY
QUIET AND REFLECTIVE,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
SOME KIDS WHO WERE
TALKATIVE IN THERE,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
WHEN ON THE RIDE HOME
HAVE NOTHING TO SAY

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
AND THEY DON'T REALLY
WANT TO BE ENGAGED

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
BECAUSE OF WHAT EVER IS
GOING THROUGH THEIR MINDS,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
OR HOW THEY'RE FEELING
ABOUT COMING HOME.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
SOME OF THEM, YOU CAN'T
STOP THEM FROM TALKING

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
AND THEY WANT YOU TO SLOW
DOWN WHEN YOU GET CLOSE

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD SO
THEY CAN SEE THIS STORE

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
AND THIS BUILDING AND
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
JAMILAH: WE HAVE DECIDED THAT
THIS IS OUR LAST TIME

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING
FOR THIS ANYMORE.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000
JAHMAR: NO, I AIN'T GOING
THROUGH THIS NO MORE.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
JAMILAH: NEVER EVER EVER?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
JAHMAR: NEVER

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
GOING OVER THE BRIDGE
AND IT FEELS GREAT.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
FREEDOM.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
JAMILAH: WHAT DO THEY CALL
THIS THE BRIDGE

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
OF NO RETURN OR
SOMETHING?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
JAHMAR: DON'T CALL IT THAT. 
SEE I'M RETURNING RIGHT?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
JAMILAH: WHEN YOU GO IN,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.000
IT FEELS LIKE YOUR NOT
GOING TO COME OUT.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:13.000
JAHMAR: I CAME BACK.
I MADE IT OUT.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
MY LAST TRIP ON THE BRIDGE.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
ESPECIALLY LIKE IT'S HARD
TO CHANGE CAUSE YOU GO HOME,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
YOU AROUND THE SAME
PEOPLE YOU WAS AROUND.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
YOU IN THE SAME PLACE,
SAME PREDICAMENT.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
YOU GOTTA GET YOUR
WAY OUT OF IT.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I WANT TO BE A POSITIVE ROLL
MODEL WHEN I GET OUT.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I GOT TWO YOUNGER BROTHERS,
ONE IS 10 AND ONE IS 7.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO
GET OUT TO THEM.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
YAH, THAT'S MY FAMILY!

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
JAMILAH: SCHOOL'S OUT SO YOUR
BROTHERS ARE HOME.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
YAH.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
YOU KNOW THEY'RE
GONNA BE HAPPY.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
JAHMAR: BEING PART OF THE
REENTRY PROGRAM

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
IS A LOT HELPFUL FOR
PEOPLE THAT GET OUT.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
WHEN YOU GET OUT YOU GOT
PEOPLE THAT CALL YOU ON TIME,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
TELL YOU WHERE TO BE AT.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
YOU GOT PEOPLE LIKE
A SECOND MOTHER.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
YOU GOT ROLL MODELS.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
PEOPLE THAT TRY TO
HELP YOU A LOT.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
AND IT'S JUST UP TO YOU
IF YOU WANT TO DO IT.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
JAHMAR!

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:58.000

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:08.000
