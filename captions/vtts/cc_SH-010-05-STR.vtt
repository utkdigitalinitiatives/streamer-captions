2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.300
Now, as thou lovest me,let me see his letter.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.470
Good Master Fabian, grantme another request.

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.530
Any thing.

5
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.330
Do not desire to see thisletter.

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.530
This is, to give a dog,

7
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.830
and in recompensedesire my dog again.

8
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.330
Belong you to the LadyOlivia, friends?

9
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.300
Ay, sir; we are some ofher trappings.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.630
I know thee well; how dostthou, my good fellow?

11
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.970
Truly, sir,

12
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.100
the better for my foes andthe worse for my friends.

13
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.830
Just the contrary; thebetter for thy friends.

14
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.800
No, sir, the worse.

15
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.000
How can that be?

16
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.600
Marry, sir, they praise meand make an ass of me;

17
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.300
now my foes tell meplainly I am an ass:

18
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.100
so that by my foes, sir I profitin the knowledge of myself,

19
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.470
and by my friends, I am abused:

20
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.570
if you will let your lady know

21
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.200
I am here to speak with her,

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.630
and bring her along with you,

23
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.900
it may awake mybounty.

24
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.300
O, lullaby to yourbounty till I come again.

25
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.070
I will awake it soon.

26
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.800
Here comes the man, sir,that did rescue me.

27
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.800
That face of his I doremember well;

28
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.570
Yet, when I saw it last,it was besmear'd

29
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.870
As black as Vulcan in thesmoke of war:

30
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.270
A bawbling vessel was hecaptain of,

31
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.570
For shallow draught andbulk unprizable;

32
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330
With which such scathfulgrapple did he make

33
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.270
With the most noble bottomof our fleet,

34
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.100
That very envy and thetongue of loss

35
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.800
Cried fame and honour onhim. What's the matter?

36
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.200
Orsino, this is thatAntonio

37
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.630
That took the Phoenix andher fraught from Candy;

38
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.530
And this is he that didthe Tiger board,

39
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.730
When your young nephewTitus lost his leg:

40
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.570
Here in the streets,desperate of shame and state,

41
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.900
In private brabble did weapprehend him.

42
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.730
He did me kindness, sir,drew on my side;

43
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.670
But in conclusion putstrange speech upon me:

44
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.630
I know not what 'twas butdistraction.

45
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.930
Notable pirate! thousalt-water thief!

46
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.670
What foolish boldness broughtthee to their mercies,

47
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.930
Whom thou, in terms sobloody and so dear,

48
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.830
Hast made thine enemies?

49
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.600
Orsino, noble sir,

50
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.270
Be pleased that I shake offthese names you give me:

51
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.500
Antonio never yet wasthief or pirate,

52
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.100
Though I confess, on baseand ground enough,

53
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.670
Orsino's enemy. Awitchcraft drew me hither:

54
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.500
That most ingrateful boythere by your side,

55
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.830
From the rude sea'senraged and foamy mouth

56
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.200
Did I redeem; a wreck pasthope he was:

57
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.770
His life I gave him anddid thereto add

58
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.900
My love, without retentionor restraint,

59
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.900
All his in dedication; forhis sake

60
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.200
Did I expose myself, purefor his love,

61
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.270
Into the danger of thisadverse town;

62
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.500
Drew to defend him when hewas beset:

63
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.230
Where being apprehended,his false cunning,

64
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.400
Not meaning to partakewith me in danger,

65
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.670
Taught him to face me outof his acquaintance,

66
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.600
And grew a twenty yearsremoved thing

67
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.870
While one would wink;denied me mine own purse,

68
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.670
Which I had recommended tohis use

69
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.670
Not half an hour before.

70
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.970
How can this be?

71
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.130
When came he to this town?

72
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.900
To-day, my lord; and forthree months before,

73
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.900
No interim, not a minute'svacancy,

74
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.300
Both day and night did wekeep company.

75
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.330
Here comes the countess:now heaven walks on earth.

76
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.700
But for thee, fellow; fellow,thy words are madness:

77
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.470
Three months this youthhath tended upon me;

78
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.030
But more of that anon.Take him aside.

79
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.430
What would my lord, butthat he may not have,

80
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.330
Wherein Olivia may seemserviceable?

81
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.630
Cesario, you do not keeppromise with me.

82
00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.670
Madam!

83
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.600
Gracious Olivia,--

84
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.800
What do you say, Cesario?Good my lord,--

85
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.200
My lord would speak; myduty hushes me.

86
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.630
If it be aught to the oldtune, my lord,

87
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.900
It is as fat and fulsometo mine ear

88
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.670
As howling after music.

89
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.630
Still so cruel?

90
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.930
Still so constant, lord.

91
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.630
What, to perverseness? youuncivil lady,

92
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.300
To whose ingrate andunauspicious altars

93
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.600
My soul the faithfull'stofferings hath breathed out

94
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.570
That e'er devotiontender'd! What shall I do?

95
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.000
Even what it please my lord,that shall become him.

96
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.700
Why should I not, had Ithe heart to do it,

97
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.470
Like to the Egyptian thiefat point of death,

98
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.900
Kill what I love?--asavage jealousy

99
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.830
That sometimes savoursnobly. But hear me this:

100
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.900
Since you to non-regardancecast my faith,

101
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.500
And that I partly know theinstrument

102
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.330
That screws me from mytrue place in your favour,

103
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.830
Live you the marble-breastedtyrant still;

104
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.970
But this your minion, whomI know you love,

105
00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.430
And whom, by heaven Iswear, I tender dearly,

106
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.400
Him will I tear out ofthat cruel eye,

107
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.970
Where he sits crowned inhis master's spite.

108
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.570
Come, boy, with me; mythoughts are ripe in mischief:

109
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.170
I'll sacrifice the lambthat I do love,

110
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.030
To spite a raven's heartwithin a dove.

111
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.800
And I, most jocund, aptand willingly,

112
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.300
To do you rest, a thousanddeaths would die.

113
00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.430
Where goes Cesario?

114
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.370
After him I love

115
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.800
More than I love theseeyes, more than my life,

116
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.630
More, by all mores, thane'er I shall love wife.

117
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.830
If I do feign, youwitnesses above

118
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.300
Punish my life fortainting of my love!

119
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.600
Ay me, detested! how am Ibeguiled!

120
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.630
Who does beguile you? whodoes do you wrong?

121
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.870
Hast thou forgot thyself?is it so long?

122
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.070
Call forth the holyfather.

123
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.000
Come, away!

124
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.830
Whither, my lord? Cesario,husband, stay.

125
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.530
Husband!

126
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.630
Ay, husband: can he thatdeny?

127
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.370
Her husband, sirrah!

128
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.400
No, my lord, not I.

129
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.330
Alas, it is the basenessof thy fear

130
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.400
That makes thee stranglethy propriety:

131
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.130
Fear not, Cesario; takethy fortunes up;

132
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.230
Be that thou know'st thouart, and then thou art

133
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.000
As great as that thoufear'st.

134
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.530
O, welcome, father!

135
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.430
Father, I charge thee, bythy reverence,

136
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.500
Here to unfold, thoughlately we intended

137
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.430
To keep in darkness whatoccasion now

138
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.830
Reveals before 'tis ripe,what thou dost know

139
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.430
Hath newly pass'd betweenthis youth and me.

140
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.900
A contract of eternal bondof love,

141
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.330
Confirm'd by mutualjoinder of your hands,

142
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.400
Attested by the holy closeof lips,

143
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400
Strengthen'd byinterchangement of your rings;

144
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.800
And all the ceremony ofthis compact

145
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.470
Seal'd in my function, bymy testimony:

146
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.430
Since when, my watch hathtold me, toward my grave

147
00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:29.630
I have travell'd but twohours.

148
00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:35.230
O thou dissembling cub!what wilt thou be

149
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.070
When time hath sow'd agrizzle on thy case?

150
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.100
Or will not else thy craftso quickly grow,

151
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.070
That thine own trip shallbe thine overthrow?

152
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.700
Farewell, and take her;but direct thy feet

153
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.770
Where thou and Ihenceforth may never meet.

154
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.230
My lord, I do protest--

155
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.300
O, do not swear!

156
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.070
Hold little faith, thoughthou hast too much fear.

157
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.100
For the love of God, a surgeon!

158
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.900
Send one presently to Sir Toby.

159
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.070
What's the matter?

160
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.530
He has broke my head acrossand has given Sir Toby

161
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.330
a bloody coxcomb too: forthe love of God, your help!

162
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.470
I had rather than fortypound I were at home.

163
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:08.200
Who has done this, SirAndrew?

164
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.530
The count's gentleman,one Cesario:

165
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.730
we took him for a coward,

166
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.500
but he's the verydevil incardinate.

167
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.030
My gentleman, Cesario?

168
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:18.800
'Od's lifelings, here he is!You broke my head for nothing;

169
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.800
and that that I did, I wasset on to do't by Sir Toby.

170
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.200
Why do you speak to me? Inever hurt you:

171
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.330
You drew your sword uponme without cause;

172
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.400
But I bespoke you fair,and hurt you not.

173
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.000
If a bloody coxcomb be ahurt, you have hurt me:

174
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.730
I think you set nothingby a bloody coxcomb.

175
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.570
Here comes Sir Toby halting;you shall hear more:

176
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.670
but if he had notbeen in drink,

177
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.770
he would have tickled youothergates than he did.

178
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.100
How now, gentleman! howis't with you?

179
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:52.170
That's all one: has hurt me,and there's the end on't.

180
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.170
Sot, didst see Dicksurgeon, sot?

181
00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.930
O, he's drunk, SirToby, an hour agone;

182
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.700
his eyes were set ateight i' the morning.

183
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.270
Then he's a rogue, and apassy measures panyn:

184
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.570
I hate a drunken rogue.

185
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.930
Away with him! Who hathmade this havoc with them?

186
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.000
I'll help you, Sir Toby,

187
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.770
because well bedressed together.

188
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.970
Will you help? an ass-headand a coxcomb and a knave,

189
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.170
a thin-faced knave, a gull!

190
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:31.200
Get him to bed, and lethis hurt be look'd to.

191
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.100
I am sorry, madam, I havehurt your kinsman:

192
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.300
But, had it been thebrother of my blood,

193
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.330
I must have done no lesswith wit and safety.

194
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.230
You throw a strange regardupon me, and by that

195
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.030
I do perceive it hathoffended you:

196
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.200
Pardon me, sweet one, evenfor the vows

197
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.070
We made each other but solate ago.

198
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:53.430
One face, one voice, onehabit, and two persons,

199
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.300
A natural perspective,that is and is not!

200
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.230
Antonio, O my dearAntonio!

201
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:02.770
How have the hours rack'dand tortured me,

202
00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.330
Since I have lost thee!

203
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:06.270
Sebastian are you?

204
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.000
Fear'st thou that,Antonio?

205
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.900
How have you made divisionof yourself?

206
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.930
An apple, cleft in two, isnot more twin

207
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:18.630
Than these two creatures.Which is Sebastian?

208
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.070
Most wonderful!

209
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:27.500
Do I stand there? I neverhad a brother;

210
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.170
Nor can there be thatdeity in my nature,

211
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:33.300
Of here and every where. Ihad a sister,

212
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.630
Whom the blind waves andsurges have devour'd.

213
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.170
Of charity, what kin areyou to me?

214
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.470
What countryman? whatname? what parentage?

215
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.770
Of Messaline: Sebastianwas my father;

216
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.630
Such a Sebastian was mybrother too,

217
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.830
So went he suited to hiswatery tomb:

218
00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.230
If spirits can assume bothform and suit

219
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.570
You come to fright us.

220
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.300
A spirit I am indeed;

221
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.270
But am in that dimensiongrossly clad

222
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.330
Which from the womb I didparticipate.

223
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.700
Were you a woman, as therest goes even,

224
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.600
I should my tears let fallupon your cheek,

225
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.200
And say 'Thrice-welcome,drowned Viola!'

226
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.100
My father had a mole uponhis brow.

227
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.070
And so had mine.

228
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.000
And died that day whenViola from her birth

229
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.670
Had number'd thirteenyears.

230
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:17.570
O, that record is livelyin my soul!

231
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.130
He finished indeed hismortal act

232
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:20.930
That day that made mysister thirteen years.

233
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.930
If nothing lets to make ushappy both

234
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.570
But this my masculineusurp'd attire,

235
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:29.300
Do not embrace me tilleach circumstance

236
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.370
Of place, time, fortune,do cohere and jump

237
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.300
That I am Viola: which toconfirm,

238
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.170
I'll bring you to acaptain in this town,

239
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.700
Where lie my maiden weeds;by whose gentle help

240
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.970
I was preserved to servethis noble count.

241
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.030
All the occurrence of myfortune since

242
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:57.670
Hath been between thislady and this lord.

243
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:05.230
So comes it, lady, youhave been mistook:

244
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.800
But nature to her biasdrew in that.

245
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.930
You would have beencontracted to a maid;

246
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.170
Nor are you therein, by mylife, deceived,

247
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.730
You are betroth'd both toa maid and man.

248
00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:24.470
Be not amazed; right nobleis his blood.

249
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.470
If this be so, as yet theglass seems true,

250
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.600
I shall have share in thismost happy wreck.

251
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.670
Boy, thou hast said to mea thousand times

252
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:37.230
Thou never shouldst lovewoman like to me.

253
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.970
And all those sayings willI overswear;

254
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.930
And those swearings keepas true in soul

255
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.700
As doth that orbedcontinent the fire

256
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.300
That severs day fromnight.

257
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.730
Give me thy hand;

258
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.600
And let me see thee in thywoman's weeds.

259
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.570
The captain that did bringme first on shore

260
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:55.570
Hath my maid's garments:he upon some action

261
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.430
Is now in durance, atMalvolio's suit,

262
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.900
A gentleman, and followerof my lady's.

263
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.330
He shall enlarge him:fetch Malvolio hither:

264
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.130
And yet, alas, now Iremember me,

265
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.830
They say, poor gentleman,he's much distract.

266
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.800
A most extracting frenzyof mine own

267
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.270
From my remembranceclearly banish'd his.

268
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.270
How does he, sirrah?

269
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.600
Truly, madam, he holdsBelzebub at the staves's end

270
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.670
as well as a man inhis case may do:

271
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.430
has here writ a letter to you;

272
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.800
I should have given'tyou to-day morning,

273
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.030
but as a madman'sepistles are no gospels,

274
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:30.630
so it skills not much whenthey are delivered.

275
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.330
Open't, and read it.

276
00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.000
Look then to be well edified

277
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.900
when the fooldelivers the madman.

278
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.430
'By the Lord, madam,'--

279
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:41.400
How now! art thou mad?

280
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.530
No, madam, I do but readmadness: an your ladyship

281
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.830
will have it as it oughtto be, you must allow Vox.

282
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:47.800
Prithee, read i' thy rightwits.

283
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.700
So I do, madonna; but to readhis right wits is to read thus:

284
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.270
therefore perpend, myprincess, and give ear.

285
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.270
Read it you, sirrah.

286
00:12:54.270 --> 00:13:06.530
'By the Lord, madam,you wrong me,

287
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.270
and the world shall know it:

288
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.830
though you have putme into darkness

289
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.930
and given your drunkencousin rule over me,

290
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.170
yet have I thebenefit of my senses

291
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.000
as well as your ladyship.

292
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.500
I have your own letter

293
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.130
that induced me to thesemblance I put on;

294
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.600
with the which I doubt notbut to do myself much right,

295
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.600
or you much shame.

296
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.130
Think of me as youplease. I leave my duty

297
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:36.000
a little unthought of andspeak out of my injury.

298
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.270
THE MADLY-USED .'MALVOLIO

299
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.530
Did he write this?

300
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.370
Ay, madam.

301
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.370
This savours not much ofdistraction.

302
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.030
See him deliver'd, Fabian;bring him hither.

303
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:51.730
My lord, thesethings further thought on,

304
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.870
To think me as well asister as a wife,

305
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.230
One day shall crown thealliance on't, so please you,

306
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.930
Here at my house and at myproper cost.

307
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:06.970
Madam, I am most apt toembrace your offer.

308
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.830
Your master quits you; andfor your service done him,

309
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.500
So much against the mettleof your sex,

310
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.330
So far beneath your softand tender breeding,

311
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.870
And since you call'd memaster for so long,

312
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.000
Here is my hand: you shallfrom this time be

313
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.500
Your master's mistress.

314
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:34.100
A sister! you are she.

315
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.670
Is this the madman?

316
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.500
Ay, my lord, this same.

317
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.770
How now, Malvolio!

318
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.100
Madam, you have done mewrong,

319
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.070
Notorious wrong.

320
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.530
Have I, Malvolio? no.

321
00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.230
Lady, you have. Pray you,peruse that letter.

322
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.770
You must not now deny itis your hand:

323
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.200
Write from it, if you can,in hand or phrase;

324
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.200
Or say 'tis not your seal,nor your invention:

325
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.570
You can say none of this:well, grant it then

326
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.770
And tell me, in themodesty of honour,

327
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.400
Why you have given me suchclear lights of favour,

328
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.830
Bade me come smiling andcross-garter'd to you,

329
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.230
To put on yellow stockingsand to frown

330
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.930
Upon Sir Toby and thelighter people;

331
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.500
And, acting this in anobedient hope,

332
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.870
Why have you suffer'd meto be imprison'd,

333
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:18.400
Kept in a dark house,visited by the priest,

334
00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.030
And made the mostnotorious geck and gull

335
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:23.270
That e'er invention play'don? tell me why.

336
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:25.930
Alas, Malvolio, this isnot my writing,

337
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.670
Though, I confess, muchlike the character

338
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.500
But out of question 'tisMaria's hand.

339
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.930
And now I do bethink me,it was she

340
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.200
First told me thou wast mad;then camest in smiling,

341
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.670
And in such forms whichhere were presupposed

342
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.730
Upon thee in the letter.Prithee, be content:

343
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.330
This practise hath mostshrewdly pass'd upon thee;

344
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.430
But when we know thegrounds and authors of it,

345
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.270
Thou shalt be both theplaintiff and the judge

346
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.170
Of thine own cause.

347
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.970
Good madam, hear me speak,

348
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.970
And let no quarrel nor nobrawl to come

349
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.030
Taint the condition ofthis present hour,

350
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.800
Which I have wonder'd at.In hope it shall not,

351
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.700
Most freely I confess,myself and Toby

352
00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.400
Set this device againstMalvolio here,

353
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.830
Upon some stubborn anduncourteous parts

354
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.070
We had conceived againsthim: Maria writ

355
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.730
The letter at Sir Toby'sgreat importance;

356
00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:31.470
In recompense whereof hehath married her.

357
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.170
How with a sportful maliceit was follow'd,

358
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:37.330
May rather pluck onlaughter than revenge;

359
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.870
If that the injuries bejustly weigh'd

360
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.700
That have on both sidespass'd.

361
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:48.130
Alas, poor fool, how havethey baffled thee!

362
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:52.530
Why, 'some are born great,some achieve greatness,

363
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:56.270
and some have greatnessthrown upon them.'

364
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.030
I was one, sir, in thisinterlude; one Sir Topas, sir;

365
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:06.700
but that's all one. 'By theLord, fool, I am not mad.'

366
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.170
But do you remember?

367
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.730
'Madam, why laugh you atsuch a barren rascal?

368
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.530
an you smile not, he's gagged:'

369
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:24.000
and thus the whirligig oftime brings in his revenges.

370
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.400
I'll be revenged on thewhole pack of you.

371
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.030
He hath been mostnotoriously abused.

372
00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.700
Pursue him and entreat himto a peace:

373
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.100
He hath not told us of thecaptain yet:

374
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:46.170
When that is known andgolden time convents,

375
00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.770
A solemn combination shallbe made

376
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.130
Of our dear souls.Meantime, sweet sister,

377
00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:56.930
We will not part fromhence. Cesario, come;

378
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.630
For so you shall be, whileyou are a man;

379
00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:02.100
But when in other habitsyou are seen,

380
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:10.930
Orsino's mistress and hisfancy's queen.

381
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.270
[Sings]

382
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:28.030
When that I was and alittle tiny boy,

383
00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.900
With hey, ho, the wind andthe rain,

384
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.600
A foolish thing was but atoy,

385
00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.130
For the rain it rainethevery day.

386
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:47.970
But when I came to man'sestate,

387
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:52.970
With hey, ho, the wind and therain.

388
00:18:52.970 --> 00:19:00.170
'Gainst knaves and thievesmen shut their gate,

389
00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:05.630
For the rain, it rain'th everyday.

390
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:11.070
It rain'th every day.

391
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.670
But when I came, alas! towive,

392
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:20.800
With hey, ho, the wind and therain

393
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.970
By swaggering could Inever thrive,

394
00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:31.370
For the rain, it rain'th everyday.

395
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:36.430
But when I came unto mybeds,

396
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:42.200
With hey, ho, the wind andthe rain.

397
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.970
With toss-pots still haddrunken heads,

398

For the rain, it rain'th everyday.

399
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.570
It rain'th every day.

400
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:05.330
A great while ago theworld begun,

401
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:11.470
With hey, ho, the wind and therain.

402
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:18.800
But that's all one, ourplay is done,
