00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000



00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:40.750

        [MUSIC PLAYING]


00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.830

        His chief characteristic was
        singleness of purpose.
      

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.470



00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.060

        His idea of happiness was to
        fight and his idea of misery
      

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.490

        was submission.


00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.230

        His favorite occupation
        was bookworming.
      

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.520

        And his favorite poets
        were Shakespeare,
      

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.350

        Aeschylus and Goethe.


00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.030

        His favorite heroes were the
        rebel slave leader, Spartacus,
      

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.550

        and the astronomer Kepler.


00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.300

        His favorite names were Laura
        and Jenny and his favorite
      

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.380

        dish was fish.


00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.560

        His favorite motto was, you
        must have doubts about
      

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.770

        everything.


00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.850

        And his favorite
        color was red.
      

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:26.990



00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.390

        Karl Marx died 100 years ago,
        yet his specter continues to
      

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.630

        haunt our world.


00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.930

        Though his body is safely buried
        in Highgate Cemetery,
      

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.910

        his ideas refuse to lie down
        and die quietly beside him.
      

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.620

        Those ideas have shaped our
        world more profoundly than
      

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.970

        Darwin, Freud, or Einstein.


00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.310

        They've inspired men and women
        to fight and die for them, to
      

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.910

        overthrow old nations and
        construct new ones.
      

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.630

        And yet in Britain, where he
        spent the most productive
      

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.180

        years of his life, people know
        relatively little about him,
      

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.030

        apart from that grim, imposing
        monument in Highgate Cemetery
      

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.570

        with its gigantic beard, which
        has come to be a sort of
      

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.610

        symbol for what people think
        of as Marx or Marxism.
      

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.440



00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.480

        For 14 years, I've been
        coming here now.
      

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.700

        And my main objective is to
        endeavor to keep this grave as
      

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.570

        tidy and as clean as possible.


00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.690



00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.370

        No matter what the weather--
        whether it's
      

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.470

        rain, sunshine or snow--


00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.460

        there's always someone visiting
        the grave of Marx.
      

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.040

        And they come from all
        parts of the world.
      

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.680

        I feel it's a rather beautiful
        monument myself.
      

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.020

        It's like the philosophy of
        Marx, I think, so strong.
      

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.770

        Many, many English people visit
        here, like other people,
      

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.690

        but they know very
        little about him.
      

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.340

        But after leaving this cemetery,
        they've had their
      

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.100

        first lesson in Marxism after
        reading the slogan there.
      

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.950

        The philosophers have only
        interpreted the world in
      

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.580

        various ways.


00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.560

        The point, however,
        is to change it.
      

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.810

        That just as important today as
        it was when it was written.
      

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.280

        The words written on Marx's
        monument are important today,
      

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.860

        because his philosophy has
        changed the world.
      

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.860

        From the Soviet revolution of
        1917 to the present day, one
      

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.220

        third of the world's
        population--
      

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.740

        1 and a half thousand million
        people in over 30 countries--
      

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.780

        have come to live in societies
        claiming inspiration from the
      

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.080

        ideas of Karl Marx.


00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.820



00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.510

        His revolutionary ideas of class
        struggle have inspired a
      

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.120

        chain of revolutions throughout
        the world.
      

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.360

        But the Marxist states that have
        resulted have sometimes
      

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.870

        been a long way from Marx's
        original ideas.
      

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.900



00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.940

        Even the forbidding monument to
        Marx in Highgate Cemetery
      

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.130

        is not, in fact, where he
        was originally buried.
      

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.930

        His original grave lies 100
        yards away marked by plain,
      

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.740

        stone slab.


00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.590

        And the contrast between these
        two graves is like the gap
      

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.680

        between what Marx was and
        what he's become.
      

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.770

        Between Marx himself and the
        long tradition called Marxism.
      

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.750

        I have never seen a man whose
        bearing was so provoking and
      

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.450

        intolerable.


00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.330

        He was domineering, impetuous,
        passionate, full of boundless
      

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.160

        self-confidence, vain,
        treacherous, and morose, a
      

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.440

        powerful, shaggy,
        untamed old man.
      

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.570

        These are some of the ways that
        Marx's contemporaries
      

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.930

        described him.


00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.930

        Marx was a German Jew, studied
        philosophy and law, married a
      

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.000

        minor aristocrat, was forced by
        his political activities to
      

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.540

        move from Germany to France, to
        Belgium, finally to settle
      

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.600

        in Britain, where a Prussian
        police spy described his life.
      

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.210

        Marx lives in one
        of the worst--
      

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.440

        therefore one of the cheapest--


00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.950

        quarters of London.


00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.730

        In the whole apartment, there
        is not one clean and solid
      

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.450

        piece of furniture.


00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.460

        In private life, he is an
        extremely disorderly, cynical,
      

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.620

        human being and a bad host. He
        leads a real gypsy existence--
      

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.520

        washing, grooming, and changing
        his linen are things
      

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.710

        he does rarely.


00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.320

        He's often drunk.


00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.350

        Though he's often idle for days
        on end, he will work day
      

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.330

        and night with tireless
        endurance when he has a great
      

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.220

        deal of work to do.


00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.590

        Much of Marx's work was done in
        the British museum, using
      

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.130

        this vast library to research
        and write a complex,
      

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.790

        far-reaching, interconnected
        series of books, pamphlets,
      

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.280

        articles and manifestos.


00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.380

        They're aimed not so much at a
        moral protest at the evils of
      

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.600

        capitalism, as at a cool,
        dispassionate analysis of how
      

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.420

        capitalism actually works, how
        it came about, and how it can
      

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.010

        be changed.


00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.090

        For this reason, his key
        theoretical work is called--
      

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.370

        not as you might expect,
        socialism--
      

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.470

        but Capital.


00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.460

        It's a book that the Russian
        censors pronounced so boring
      

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.730

        that they let it through.


00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.100

        But it's no museum piece, hidden
        within its sometimes
      

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.250

        forbidding prose is the
        promise of revolution.
      

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.410

        It was a starting point for
        a chain of ideas that have
      

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.970

        inspired a world movement.


00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.990

        "Workers of all lands, unite.


00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.140

        You have nothing to lose but
        your chains," Marx wrote in
      

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.290

        the Communist Manifesto.


00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.980

        These are the industrial working
        class to whom Marx
      

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.690

        addressed himself.


00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.340

        His writing was aimed at
        their emancipation.
      

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.290

        It was rooted in the material
        reality of their lives.
      

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.640

        Marx began by examining
        human labor.
      

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.230

        The exercise of labor power--


00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.360

        labor, is the workers
        own life activity.
      

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.090

        And this life activity he sells
        to another person, in
      

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.490

        order to secure the necessary
        means of subsistence.
      

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.390

        He works in order to live.


00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:57.460

        For Marx, the capitalist hired
        the worker's labor power in
      

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.150

        order to extract a
        surplus from it.
      

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.630

        And there was a built in
        conflict between the workers
      

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:03.750

        and the capitalists
        who exploited
      

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.710

        them, a class struggle.


00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:10.760

        Nothing new, he wrote, because
        one fact is common to all past
      

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.200

        ages, the exploitation of
        one class by another.
      

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.020

        The key thing about any society
        was who provided labor
      

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.580

        power, who owned the means of
        production, and how this
      

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.370

        relationship was organized.


00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.550

        In capitalism, for instance,
        the workers don't own the
      

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.560

        factories, the means of
        production, so they must sell
      

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.760

        their labor as a commodity to
        those who do, who extract a
      

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.490

        surplus from their labor.


00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.930

        In the same way in feudal
        society, the serfs were tied
      

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:43.770

        to the land and obliged to hand
        over a part of what they
      

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.250

        produced to the lord
        of the manor.
      

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.170

        And in slave society, the
        slaves themselves were
      

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.390

        physically owned by their
        masters, who also owned what
      

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.930

        they produced with
        their labor.
      

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.280

        For Marx, the difference
        between capitalism and
      

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.290

        previous systems was
        its phenomenal
      

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.630

        productiveness and dynamism.


00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.380



00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.090

        Marx believed that the pumping
        out of surplus from the
      

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.340

        workers' labor power gave
        capitalism its revolutionary
      

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.650

        force, allowing it to reinvest
        the surplus and expand,
      

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.940

        harnessing the new technologies
        of the industrial
      

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:23.300

        age, shattering older ways of
        organizing society, drawing
      

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.570

        men, women, and children from
        off the land into the new
      

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.820

        forms of factory production.


00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:34.010



00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.330

        Capitalism adapted workers to
        the disciplines of factory
      

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.580

        labor, fixing them
        in their place.
      

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.480

        In Marx's words, it transformed
        the living worker
      

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.350

        into a mere living accessory
        of the machine.
      

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:50.600

        In so doing, capitalism had
        produced a new kind of human
      

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.910

        being, the industrial worker,
        the proletariat.
      

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.340

        For Marx, workers were alienated
        or separated from
      

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.080

        both the products of their labor
        and from the surplus
      

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.630

        expropriated by the capitalist.
        Their working
      

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.920

        lives were fragmented by
        the division of labor.
      

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.470

        They were split off from other
        workers through competition.
      

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:14.040

        They'd lost a sense of being
        at home in the world they
      

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.130

        themselves had created.


00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.660

        Instead their lives were
        overshadowed by the alien
      

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.500

        force of capital, feeding
        off their living labor.
      

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.960

        Marx wrote, "Capital is dead
        labor that, vampire-like,
      

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.910

        lives only by sucking living
        labor, and lives the more, the
      

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.710

        more labor it sucks." And yet,
        he believed capitalism was to
      

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.940

        be its own grave-digger.


00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.360

        Behind the dynamism and
        productiveness of capitalism,
      

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.790

        Marx saw the appalling
        conditions it offered to
      

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.230

        working men and women, living
        cramped in overcrowded
      

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.810

        tenements with open sewers,
        crippled by hunger, illness,
      

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.670

        and debt and by the constant
        fear of unemployment, slumps,
      

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.130

        and crises of capitalism.


00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.700

        Marx believed that the
        experience of capitalism would
      

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.140

        begin to unify the proletarian
        as a class.
      

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.970

        He wrote, "With the development
        of industry, the
      

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.290

        proletariat not only increases
        in number, it becomes
      

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.540

        concentrated in greater
        masses.
      

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.580

        Its strength grows and it feels
        that strength more."
      

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.310

        Marx believed that the workers
        would increasingly abandon
      

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.930

        attempts at compromise
        and reform.
      

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:24.190

        They would challenge the
        capitalist system through
      

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.490

        trade unions and political
        parties.
      

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.320

        These industrial and political
        struggles would produce a
      

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.180

        class-conscious labor movement
        that would finally overthrow
      

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.430

        capitalism.


00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.780



00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.990

        Marx rooted his analysis in the
        realities of 19th century
      

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.700

        industry, partly learned from
        his friend Engels--
      

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.370

        a mill-owner in Manchester,
        then the hub of world
      

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.090

        production.


00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.000

        Marx made no claim that
        his analysis would be
      

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.500

        good for all time.


00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.420

        So what relevance does it
        have 100 years later?
      

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.590

        What stands on the site of
        Engels' original factory?
      

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.440

        What kind of capitalism
        remains?
      

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.280

        Well for a start, not much,
        because recession has struck
      

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.880

        here as elsewhere.


00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.740

        Capitalism seems to have
        disappeared, though not quite
      

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.280

        in the way Marx imagined.


00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.650

        But in one corner
        of the factory,
      

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.070

        it's a different story.


00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.150

        A thriving young business
        manufactures high tech
      

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.830

        microchip control systems for
        the leisure industry.
      

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.360

        Its managing director
        is 22 years old.
      

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.480

        I don't know really how
        Marx would see us now.
      

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.790

        I suppose by the definition
        of capitalism, yes I'm a
      

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:33.900

        capitalist. I'd like to think
        that I'm not the same sort of
      

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.820

        capitalist that used to be
        here in the time of Marx.
      

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.630

        I think capitalism still exists,
        obviously it's got to
      

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.810

        if people are going to work,
        producing things, making
      

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.620

        profits, and creating jobs.


00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.570

        However, I think they overall
        face of it has
      

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.070

        changed an awful lot.


00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.740

        Nowadays, there's much more
        cooperation between myself and
      

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.850

        the people working here.


00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.460

        The products that we're
        manufacturing the most of, at
      

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.340

        the moment, is the
        Snooker light.
      

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.450

        It goes into a Snooker
        club and monitors the
      

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.530

        actual table usage.


00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.370

        We've installed them
        in Snooker clubs
      

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.620

        all over the country.


00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:13.060



00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.500

        It's an irony that Marx
        might have cherished,
      

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.660

        that down in London--


00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.610

        where Mike Newton's electronic
        control systems monitor the
      

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.900

        Snooker tables--


00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.850

        one young, unemployed player
        sees the system through
      

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.100

        different eyes.


00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.230



00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.310

        When you first become
        unemployed, you start off and
      

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.480

        you think to yourself, it'll
        only take two or three weeks
      

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.990

        until I find a position and
        I should be all right.
      

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.820

        Then a week amounts.


00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.970

        And it just really is
        soul-destroying.
      

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.090

        I get GBP 22 a week.


00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.780

        I'd like to see Maggie Thatcher
        live off of GBP 22 a
      

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.670

        week, I really would.


00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:50.810

        You just get deeper and
        deeper in debt.
      

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.280

        There's no way in the
        world that you can
      

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.410

        live on GBP 22 a week.


00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.020

        You can't eat properly.


00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.250

        You only eat once a
        day, and even then
      

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.060

        only very cheap foods.


00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.890

        When you get bills come in, you
        have to phone the people
      

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:07.090

        up or go to see the people, like
        cap-in-hand all the time.
      

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.630

        It's almost what it
        was 100 years ago.
      

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:11.690

        We're going backwards
        instead of forwards.
      

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:12.690

        We're going backwards.


00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:16.260

        Same old thing, the rich man in
        his castle and the poor man
      

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.310

        at his gates.


00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:18.260

        The system--


00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.400

        capitalism system-- doesn't
        give us anything really.
      

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.640

        They're just-- all they're
        interested in is just making
      

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.660

        as much money as possible,
        and fuck the
      

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.470

        rights of the workers.


00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.510

        They haven't got any rights as
        far as they're concerned.
      

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:34.620

        If a boss is generous enough to
        offer you a job, that's it
      

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.590

        as far as he's concerned.


00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.310

        Then he's God.


00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:39.700

        And you must look up to him and
        do everything you possibly
      

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.460

        can to keep it.


00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:43.220

        Because he knows full well
        that if you don't tow the
      

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.780

        line, he'll just sling you out
        and get somebody else.
      

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:47.510

        And you're always conscious
        of that fact.
      

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.450



00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:54.110

        A century after Marx's death,
        the image of workers as the
      

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.430

        raw material for the industrial
        sausage machine may
      

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.990

        seem to many people
        a bit far-fetched.
      

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:11.360



00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.820

        Marx would have been the first
        to see that in the journey
      

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.200

        from the 19th century to the
        present day, capitalism has
      

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.210

        changed profoundly.


00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.640

        Some have even claimed that
        class divisions and,
      

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:28.340

        therefore, class struggle have
        ceased to exist. Of course,
      

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.750

        today's working class looks a
        great deal of different from
      

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.430

        the 19th century sepia prints as
        it hurries to the office or
      

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.040

        the factory of modern
        capitalism.
      

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:40.930



00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.300

        It's no longer the top hat and
        the cloth cap that describes
      

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.420

        capitalism, nor even its
        modern equivalent--
      

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.090

        the bowler hat and
        the hard hat.
      

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:56.350



00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:59.700

        Today's proletariat works in
        a range of industries that
      

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.680

        didn't exist a century ago.


00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.160

        It includes more women workers,
        more black workers,
      

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.360

        more workers in the office and
        service sectors, more public
      

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:11.370

        employees, fewer in
        manufacturing.
      

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.450

        The modern working class
        is divided in all
      

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.530

        these different ways.


00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.490

        And yet, it still sells
        its labor for wages.
      

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.090

        And it's labor still produces
        profits, at
      

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.040

        least that's the intention.


00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.600

        And people still experience--


00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.650

        even with three million
        unemployed--
      

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.750

        the feeling that work
        is not the center of
      

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.790

        their creative lives.


00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.420

        It's just a job really.


00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.710

        You do your job, but I wouldn't
        say it was interest.
      

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.380

        You don't choose
        it as a career.
      

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.640

        It's just something
        that you take out.
      

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.710

        Obviously I make the money, so
        that's an important part.
      

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.130

        You need money anywhere,
        then you go to work.
      

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.530

        You've got to come to work and
        earn some money to do what you
      

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.490

        want to do at home and enjoy
        yourself, haven't you?
      

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:59.020



00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.190

        Many people will recognize the
        sense of release at the end of
      

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:04.140

        the working day.


00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.350

        Marx had written, the worker
        only feels at home outside his
      

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.150

        work, and in his work
        he feels a stranger.
      

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.390

        He is at home when he's not
        working, and when he works his
      

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.030

        is not at home.


00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.220

        Marx also pointed to the way
        workers become split off from
      

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.350

        the products of their labor,
        which stare back at them from
      

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.430

        the shelves of shops, stores,
        and supermarkets as if they
      

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.170

        were alien objects.


00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.210

        He wrote, "There is a definite
        social relation between men
      

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.030

        that assumes in their eyes the
        fantastic form of a relation
      

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.250

        between things.


00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.850

        This I call the fetishism, which
        attaches itself to the
      

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.790

        products of labor, so soon
        as they are produced as
      

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:47.010

        commodities." Marx anticipated
        the consumer society.
      

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:52.440



00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.630

        In the language of consumption,
        objects take on a
      

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.360

        kind of magical significance
        of their own.
      

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.270

        We are the products of a new
        consciousness industry, buying
      

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.530

        not just goods but identities.


00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.230

        Money becomes the universal
        language of human relations.
      

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.020

        Fundamentally, the capitalism
        that Marx wrote about a
      

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.200

        century ago remains intact.


00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:16.680

        Capital still commands the
        forces of production.
      

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.940

        It harnesses and hires
        labor power.
      

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.030

        It secures the raw materials
        for production.
      

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.720

        It develops and implements
        new technologies.
      

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.690

        It reaches out to ever-expanding
        world markets,
      

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.630

        maximizing profits, knocking out
        competitors, centralizing
      

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:35.880

        on a world scale.


00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:41.180



00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:45.180

        The capitalism we face today
        links London, New York, Tokyo,
      

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.010

        into a concentrated, integrated
        world system.
      

00:18:50.010 --> 00:19:08.280

        [MUSIC: "WALL STREET
        SHUFFLE" BY 10CC]
      

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.510

        Today, we live in a world of
        international banks, where
      

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.940

        finance capital coordinates
        the running of the
      

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.550

        international economy.


00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:18.910

        The banks are interlinked with
        international corporations
      

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.720

        that employ an international
        workforce.
      

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.950

        They operate through
        international trade and
      

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.190

        transportation.


00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:30.580

        They communicate through
        international data systems.
      

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.720

        Marx wrote, "The bourgeoisie has
        subjected the country to
      

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.950

        the rule of the towns." From the
        corporate headquarters in
      

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.490

        the great cities, they direct
        the modern world.
      

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.330

        They invest internationally--
        splitting up work between
      

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.240

        factories in different
        countries, linking the world
      

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.180

        through what Marx called, a new
        and international division
      

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.210

        of labor, drawing in a new Third
        World workforce at low
      

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.880

        wages to yield higher profits,
        the most exploited sector of
      

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.130

        modern industrial capitalism.


00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:03.140



00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.920

        This Third World workforce--


00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.090

        fresh to the discipline
        of the factory--
      

00:20:07.090 --> 00:20:10.300

        operates 20th century technology
        in return for wages
      

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.520

        and conditions which hark back
        to the 19th century.
      

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:18.920

        The working condition here is
        very bad because we work 16
      

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:19.660

        hours a day.


00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.260

        They are forcing us to have
        overtime all the day.
      

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.800

        We have six to six, some
        times six to eight.
      

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.130

        Yeah, it's really sad,
        because they give
      

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:31.010

        us compulsory overtime.


00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:33.290

        Sometimes they are collapse--


00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.570

        but nobody can go out because
        the door is locked, padlocked.
      

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.540

        And the window is closed.


00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.270

        Nobody can go home
        to their place.
      

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:47.980

        For Third World workers, life
        under capitalism seems similar
      

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.580

        to the conditions described by
        Marx's collaborator, Engels,
      

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.760

        when he wrote, "A horde of
        ragged women and children
      

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.800

        swarm about here, as filthy as
        the swine that thrive upon the
      

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:04.960

        garbage heaps and in the
        puddles." It's the usual
      

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.790

        catalogue of poverty--


00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.740

        hunger, disease, poor


00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.010

        sanitation, high infant mortality.


00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:15.390



00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.740

        A century after Marx's death,
        capitalism has certainly
      

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.640

        changed and yet not changed.


00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.600

        It's still a system which Marx
        would recognize, and in which
      

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.860

        we recognize him.


00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.210

        But Marx also thought of
        capitalism as its own
      

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.680

        gravedigger.


00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.960

        How did that idea stand
        the test of time?
      

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.190



00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.210

        For Marx, capitalism bore
        within it the seeds of
      

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:40.180

        revolution.


00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.090

        He expected this to begin in
        Europe, where capitalism was
      

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.160

        most advanced, and to become
        a world process as it
      

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.260

        progressed.


00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.360

        The nearest he came to this in
        his own lifetime was with the
      

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.660

        uprising of the French workers
        against the state in 1871 and
      

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.230

        the formation of what
        has come to be known
      

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.410

        as The Paris Commune.


00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.440

        The Commune began when French
        workers took the opportunity
      

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.820

        of a war between France and
        Germany to undertake the first
      

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.950

        proletarian revolution.


00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:11.540

        Marx, who was commonly seen as
        an enemy of democracy, admired
      

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.790

        the Commune because it tried
        to set up a decentralized
      

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:18.210

        federal system of direct
        democracy, whereas Engels put
      

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.460

        it, all officials--


00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.660

        high or low--


00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.760

        were paid only the wages
        received by other workers.
      

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.300

        And they were subject
        to election and
      

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.540

        recall at short notice.


00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.960

        The Communards had toppled the
        existing state machinery,
      

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.580

        which they saw as organizing
        society to serve the interests
      

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.420

        of capitalism.


00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.380

        In place of the dictatorship
        of the bourgeoisie, they
      

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.460

        installed what Marx and others
        called, the dictatorship of
      

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.390

        the proletariat.


00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.090

        For the Communards, this
        dictatorship meant genuine
      

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.020

        popular power.


00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.570

        They attempted to defend the
        common ownership and control
      

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:56.010

        of the productive forces, to
        build a society where-- in
      

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:56.960

        Marx's words--


00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.700

        "The free development of each is
        the condition for the free
      

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.310

        development of all." It was an
        experiment that couldn't be
      

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.560

        allowed to succeed.


00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:32.390



00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.030

        The French and Prussian
        rulers joined forces
      

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.440

        to destroy the Commune.


00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.450

        The forces of order besieged
        Paris to stamp out this
      

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.920

        short-lived experiment.


00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.340

        Over 20,000 Communards
        were killed.
      

00:23:46.340 --> 00:24:02.210



00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.920

        During the half century between
        the Paris Commune and
      

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.370

        the end of the first World War,
        Marxist ideas became a
      

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.510

        powerful force throughout
        Europe.
      

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.000

        And just as the chaos of the
        Franco-Prussian war had helped
      

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.270

        to bring about the Paris
        Commune, so the colossal
      

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.700

        slaughter and incompetence of
        the first World War helped to
      

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.470

        produce the right conditions for
        the overthrow of the Czar
      

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:25.720

        Nicholas II.


00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.570



00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.420

        The Bolsheviks seized power
        in the first successful
      

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.680

        revolution claiming inspiration
        from Marx's ideas.
      

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.490

        Under conditions of severe
        czarist repression, the
      

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.880

        Bolsheviks had forged a
        tightly disciplined,
      

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.090

        centralized, secretive
        revolutionary party which
      

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:51.200

        spread Marx's ideas throughout
        the Russian Workers' Movement.
      

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.440

        Their leader was Lenin, and like
        Marx himself, he argued
      

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.130

        that a Russian Revolution would
        only survive if it was
      

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.890

        part of an international
        revolution.
      

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:04.360

        He claimed, "We are now in a
        besieged fortress, waiting for
      

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.550

        the other detachments of the
        world socialist revolution to
      

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.400

        come to our relief."


00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.370

        The conventional wisdom has it
        that this world revolution
      

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:16.430

        never materialized, and
        therefore Marx was wrong.
      

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.900

        But in fact, during the years
        following World War I, Marx's
      

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.610

        predictions came within a hair's
        breath of succeeding.
      

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:24.450

        Even Britain--


00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.430

        the center of European
        stability--
      

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:30.430

        was closer to revolution than
        at any time in this century.
      

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.800

        There were tanks on the streets
        of London, troops
      

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.240

        encircling Glasgow where
        the red flag
      

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.660

        flew on the town hall.


00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.620

        There were little Moscows in
        the [? ronda ?], strikes on
      

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.060

        the railways and in the mines,
        dockers refusing to load arms
      

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.800

        for the war against Soviet
        Russia, coupled with the
      

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.050

        threat of a general strike.


00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.390



00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:51.520

        In northern Italy--


00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.960

        in Milan and Turin--


00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.860

        the scenario was much as
        Marx had predicted.
      

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.700

        The international proletarians
        occupied the factories and
      

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.620

        took control of production by
        setting up workers' councils.
      

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.040

        "The Factory Council is the
        model for the proletarian
      

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.730

        state," claimed their
        leader Gramsci.
      

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:11.440

        They armed themselves to
        defend their gains.
      

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.670

        It was a challenge that was only
        contained by the army and
      

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.920

        by Mussolini's Blackshirts.


00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:23.380



00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.700

        "Berlin Under the Red
        Flag," announced the
      

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.980

        headlines in 1919.


00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.740

        In the unrest following World
        War I, the Kaiser was deposed
      

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.560

        and a republic formed under
        the powerful German Social
      

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.540

        Democrat Party, who
        were strongly
      

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.990

        influenced by Marxism.


00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.150

        In January 1919, the
        Spartacist League--
      

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.630

        forerunner of the German
        Communist Party--
      

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.220

        led uprisings throughout
        Germany, which came close to
      

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.040

        the revolution Marx
        had expected.
      

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.480

        Many soldiers and workers had
        been disillusioned and
      

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.510

        radicalized by the war.


00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.230

        And in Bremen, Leipzig, Bavaria,
        and Hamburg, Soviet
      

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:01.660

        republics were set up.


00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.370

        Spartacists leader, Karl
        Liebknecht, announced "Whether
      

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.630

        or not we shall survive
        when all is achieved,
      

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.330

        our program we live.


00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.310

        It will dominate the world of
        liberated peoples in spite of
      

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:17.450

        all." Because the German army
        was unreliable, this
      

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.710

        revolutionary crisis was only
        put down by a volunteer
      

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.370

        right-wing militia, the Free
        Corps, forerunner of Hitler's
      

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.620

        brownshirts.


00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.360



00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.700

        The Free Corps broke the back
        of the German Workers'
      

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:35.660

        Movement at the cost of
        thousands of lives.
      

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.390

        The leaders--


00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:38.270

        among them Rosa Luxemburg--


00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.370

        were murdered and dumped
        in the canals.
      

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:58.610



00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.700

        In Hungary, the pattern
        was the same--
      

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.770

        the monarchy overthrown by
        a broad based socialist
      

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:04.850

        government.


00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.690

        Then the declaration of
        a Soviet Republic.
      

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:11.740

        Its leader, Bela Kun said,
        quoting Marx, "Every step of
      

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.230

        actual movement is more
        important than a dozen
      

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:19.520

        programs." The Hungarian Soviet
        lasted six months and
      

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.560

        was undermined by the invasion
        of Czech and Romanian forces
      

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.620

        who occupied Budapest. Workers'
        Councils like this
      

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.990

        one were executed.


00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:33.350



00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.840

        Marx's predictions of
        proletarian revolution in the
      

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.730

        advanced capitalist countries
        had been proved right.
      

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:42.300

        The proletariat looked-- for
        a time-- as though it would
      

00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.620

        become the leading class
        of the 20th century.
      

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.930

        Where the Marxist movements went
        wrong was in misjudging
      

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:53.530

        the resilience of capitalism and
        the strength of the state.
      

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.960

        It was a costly mistake.


00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.630

        And as the tide of revolution
        in Europe began to ebb, it
      

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:04.220

        left the Russian revolution
        isolated and exposed.
      

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.020

        The Soviet Union
        stood isolated.
      

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.880

        It was encircled by Czarist
        troops backed by the armies of
      

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.410

        17 nations.


00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.850

        These were the soldiers,
        workers, and peasants who
      

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.160

        fought to hold back the
        combined forces of the
      

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.130

        capitalist countries in their
        crusade against what the
      

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:25.910

        British War Secretary, Winston
        Churchill, called "The
      

00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:29.610

        nameless beast of communism."


00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.030

        For a time, it seemed likely
        that the first Marxist
      

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.510

        revolution would be defeated,
        like the other
      

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.880

        revolutions in Europe.


00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:39.410

        But in an amazingly short space
        of time, the Bolsheviks
      

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.040

        shaped a Red Army from an


00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.100

        undisciplined, backward, peasantry.


00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.880

        Its organizer was the War
        Commissar, Trotsky.
      

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.400

        This army took on a vastly
        superior force and, against
      

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.510

        all expectations, they won.


00:29:54.510 --> 00:30:05.180



00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:10.220

        The Soviet Revolution survived
        but at appalling cost.
      

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.170

        Russia's backward and
        underdeveloped industry lay in
      

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:16.760

        ruins, devastated by the war.


00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:20.800

        Nine million people had died in
        the war from famine, cold
      

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.040

        and disease.


00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.090

        Now to the immense problems
        of this vast semi-feudal,
      

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.530

        backward nation were
        added the burden
      

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.780

        of millions of refugees.


00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.240



00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.010

        There was also sabotage by
        opponents of the Bolsheviks
      

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:41.820

        and even armed rebellion from
        among their supporters.
      

00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:44.930

        Lenin faced these colossal
        problems by establishing--
      

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:45.970

        in his own words--


00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.740

        "Strict, iron discipline backed
        up by the state power
      

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:52.340

        of the armed workers." And
        Lenin's centralized Bolshevik
      

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:56.700

        party structure became the
        instrument of this discipline.
      

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.840

        He had set in motion the
        state machine that
      

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.850

        Stalin would inherit.


00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:04.280

        Opposition was banned and the
        secret police began the
      

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.940

        searches, arrests
        and executions.
      

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.620

        Rosa Luxemburg had written, "The
        remedy which Trotsky and
      

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.430

        Lenin have found-- the
        elimination of
      

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.950

        democracy as such--


00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.290

        is worse than the disease it
        is supposed to cure, for it
      

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.940

        stops up the very living source
        from which alone can
      

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.840

        come the correction of all the
        innate shortcomings of social
      

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.590

        institutions.


00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.560

        That source is the active,
        untrammeled, energetic
      

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.760

        political life of the broadest
        masses of the people." Her
      

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.700

        words were tragically borne
        out in the trials and
      

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.310

        executions of Mensheviks and
        social revolutionaries.
      

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.790

        Lenin's Party of Iron became
        increasingly centralized,
      

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:45.530

        bureaucratic and dictatorial.


00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:48.740

        Worst of all, Red Terror failed
        to solve Russia's
      

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.650

        economic problems. Lenin was
        forced to relax the rigors of
      

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.250

        war communism and adopt a new
        economic policy of limited
      

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.990

        private enterprise.


00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.650

        The new policy worked.


00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.820

        The peasants provided food for
        the cities and industrial
      

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.170

        production began again.


00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:11.800



00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.180

        The new socialist society began
        to tackle the aftermath
      

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:23.150

        of the war, to feed and clothe
        the millions of orphans, to
      

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.140

        provide free education and to
        raise the cultural level of
      

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:31.030

        the Russian population, to
        produce a new generation of
      

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.230

        human beings--


00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:38.240

        tough, clean, disciplined,
        hardworking, to break the hold
      

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:42.520

        of religious superstition,
        and to construct a modern
      

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.320

        industrial society.


00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.320

        In spite of everything,
        the Soviet
      

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.790

        Revolution did move forward.


00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.240



00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.290

        In spite of everything, there
        was a sense of optimism, of
      

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:00.920

        the novelty and boldness of
        the Soviet experiment.
      

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.840

        There was a sense of modernism,
        of new openings
      

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.090

        towards the future.


00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:11.260



00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.260

        People were becoming aware of
        themselves as agents in a
      

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.950

        process of revolutionary
        change.
      

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:48.160



00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.820

        Lenin died in 1924.


00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.460

        There was genuine
        popular grief.
      

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:56.560



00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.200

        Almost at once, the construction
        of the Lenin myth
      

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.020

        began, part of which is that
        Lenin had no responsibility
      

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.560

        for the excesses that
        were to follow.
      

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:11.780



00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:14.550

        Stalin was waiting
        in the wings.
      

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.670

        Already General Secretary under
        Lenin, Stalin was an
      

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.040

        ambitious careerist who
        had made his way
      

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.210

        up the party hierarchy.


00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.800

        He took control of the funeral
        arrangements and mummified
      

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.050

        Lenin like a pharaoh.


00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:31.520



00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.580

        Lenin had built the Soviet party
        machine that Stalin was
      

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.830

        to control.


00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:38.480



00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.010

        Towards the end of his life,
        he had sensed the possible
      

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:43.510

        consequences.


00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.310

        But Lenin's warnings
        were ignored.
      

00:34:45.310 --> 00:35:06.850



00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.740

        Throughout the '20s
        and '30s, Stalin
      

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.030

        consolidated his control.


00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:14.470

        He began to build his own frozen
        version of socialism, a
      

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.620

        society of neat lives and
        optimistic souls with no room
      

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.930

        for questioning or debate.


00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:27.290



00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.880

        Stalin was determined to drag
        Russia out of backwardness.
      

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.830

        "Either we do it or they
        crush us," he claimed.
      

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:36.420

        He set about mechanizing and


00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.370

        collectivising the mass of peasants.


00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:41.940

        His aim was to use agriculture
        to supply the surplus for
      

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.460

        rapid industrialization.


00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.930

        And to achieve this, Stalin
        decided to eliminate the
      

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:49.360

        wealthier peasants as a class.


00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:54.280

        About five million people were
        deported and two million died.
      

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.820

        For Stalin, this was
        only a beginning.
      

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.320

        He jailed or executed millions
        of people in the party, the
      

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:02.200

        army and the bureaucracy.


00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.510

        to the fulfillment of the

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.560

        Stalin had done more to destroy
        the hope of socialism

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.930

        And yet, at the price of terror,
        Stalin modernized the
      

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.460

        Soviet economy.


00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:24.770

        And under Stalin, Marxism
        became the religion of

        Russia's national development.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:34.600

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:36.960

        system of exploitation.


00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.740

        manual and mental labor.


00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.290

        incentives.


00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:49.320

        extracted from their labor.

        replaced by a privileged
        administrative class who
      

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:00.630

        controlled and disposed of the
        surplus because they were

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.220

        and narrowing the gap between
        the theories about socialism
      

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.470

        and the practice in
        Czechoslovakia.
      

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:02.810



00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:06.280

        The Communist Party abandoned
        its control of information
      

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:07.890

        through censorship.


00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.740

        The free flow of information
        must have come as a profound
      

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:14.000

        shock after two decades
        of silence.
      

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.620

        It opened eyes and opened
        mouths, stimulating criticism
      

00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:19.070

        and debate.


00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.360

        The truth about the system could
        finally be acknowledged.
      

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.230

        The leadership even relaxed
        its monopoly of power
      

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.970

        claiming, the party cannot
        impose its authority.
      

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:34.560

        This has to be won, again and
        again, by party activity.
      

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.700

        But for the Soviet Union-- as
        Marx would have put it-- the
      

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.500

        force of argument
        was countered by
      

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:41.370

        the argument of force.


00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:44.970

        Warsaw Pact tanks invaded
        Czechoslovakia to be met with
      

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.840

        popular defiance.


00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.360

        The same tanks had crushed the
        East German generals' strike
      

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.550

        of 1953 and the worker's
        councils of the Hungarian
      

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.650

        uprising of 1956.

        Soviet soldiers--


00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.720

        who had been told that
        they had come to save
      

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:04.480

        Czechoslovakia from CIA-backed
        counter revolution--
      

00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.380

        were faced with the nonviolent
        protests of the mass of the
      

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.630

        Czech people.


00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.620



00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:17.010

        The Soviet tank crews were
        besieged, not by capitalist
      

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.040

        stooges, but by Czech socialists
        arguing their
      

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.340

        position and demanding
        Russia's departure.
      

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:34.640



00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.600

        On the walls of Prague appeared
        a single word in
      

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.430

        Russian, why?


00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.850



00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:44.210

        The day after the invasion--


00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.300

        under the noses of
        the Russians--
      

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.850

        1,200 Czech communists met
        secretly in a factory to
      

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.660

        oppose the Soviet invasion.


00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:53.920

        officials under the Stalinist
      

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.530

        regime of Novotny--


00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.390

        denounced the Russians and
        called for their withdrawal.
      

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:05.920

        Communist Party is strongly
        against occupation.
      

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:07.970

        It means against Russians.


00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:12.380

        I think it's only one who
        organized everything against
      

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:15.240

        occupants, I think it's
        Communist Party's Czech

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:22.440

        Maybe you are surprised about
        this fact, but it's reality.
      

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.090

        It took 18 months before
        control was finally
      

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.280

        reestablished.


00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.200

        Dubcek's supporters were
        jailed or demoted.
      

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.450

        The reform was dismantled.


00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:34.770



00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.170

        For the masses, Western-style
        consumerism was offered to
      

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:39.830

        pacify opposition.


00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:43.310

        But in Czechoslovakia as in
        Poland, a cumbersome,
      

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:46.800

        top-heavy political system found
        this hard to deliver.
      

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.080



00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.170

        In Poland, the monument
        proudly proclaims--
      

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:59.070

        Leninism, the triumphant
        banner of our epoch.
      

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.560

        The Leninist version of Marxism
        received a rude shock
      

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.510

        when, in 1980, a genuine trade
        union movement emerged from a
      

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:08.470

        series of bitter strikes
        throughout Poland.
      

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:14.280



00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.580

        It's common to recognize in
        solidarity, the Catholic and
      

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.980

        nationalist opposition
        to Polish communism.
      

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:24.640

        But solidarity was a profound
        threat above all, because it
      

00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.700

        gained the support of 3/4 of the
        Polish working class, even
      

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:33.190

        in the communist power base of
        the Silesian coal fields.

        [SPEAKING POLISH]


00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.490

        It was the renewal of class
        struggle between the workers
      

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:04.950

        and their so-called workers'
        state which made solidarity
      

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.810

        such a powerful challenge.


00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:11.270

        They proposed basic changes,
        echoing the Paris Commune for
      

00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:12.860

        genuine work-based democracy.

        with the organized industrial

        power of the strike.

        helpfully that if the government

        point out that every uprising in
