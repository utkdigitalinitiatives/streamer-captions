00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.430
MAN: One of the last jobs
I had in Yellowstone was

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.800
delivering the
mail on snowmobile.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.500
There I was in the world's
first national park, and I

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.930
remember going down
into Hayden Valley.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.660
There were bison crossing over
the road--2,000-pound mammals

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.330
crossing over the road,
and it was so cold.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.500
It was about 60 below zero.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.360
And the bison, as they
breathed, their exhalation

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.500
would seem to crystallize in
the air around them, and there

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.000
were these sheets, these
ropey stands of crystals kind

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.630
of flowing down
from their breath.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.460
And I saw them, and they just
moved their heads and were

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.500
looking at me, and I remember
thinking that if I had not

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.500
been on that machine, I would
have thought I had been thrust

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.460
fully back into the
Pleistocene, back into

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.300
the Ice Age.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.760
And I remember just
stopping and turning it off

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.860
because the only way you could
hear was to turn that thing

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.100
off, and I would turn it off,
and I would listen, and I felt

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.260
like this was the first day...

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
and this morning was the first
time the sun had ever come up

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.600
and the shadows that are being
cast right now is the first

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.530
time those shadows have
ever been cast on the earth.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.530
And I was all alone, but I
felt I was in the presence

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.900
of everything around me
and I was never alone.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.300
It was one of those moments
when you get pulled outside

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.030
of yourself into the
environment around you,

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.860
and I felt like I was just
with the breath of the bison

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.560
as they were exhaling and
I was exhaling and they

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.760
were inhaling.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.960
It was all kind of flowing
together, and I forgot

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.200
completely about the mail.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.860
All I was thinking of
was that a single moment

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.330
in a place as wild as
Yellowstone, and most

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.560
of the national parks,
can last forever.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.900
PETER COYOTE: In 1883, a young
politician, the second son

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.100
of a prominent New York
City family, became alarmed

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.860
about reports that the vast
herds of buffalo that had once

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.400
blanketed the Great Plains
were quickly disappearing.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.830
So he hurried west on the
Northern Pacific Railroad

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.860
and got off when he reached
the heart of the badlands

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.500
in the Dakota territory.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.500
[Train whistle blows]

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.500
His name was Theodore
Roosevelt.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.500
He was 24 years old, and he
was afraid the buffalo would

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.530
become extinct before he
got the chance to shoot one.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.300
He hired a local guide and
endured days of rough travel

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.430
by horseback until he finally
came across a solitary buffalo

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.730
bull, killed it, and then
removed its head for shipment

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.100
back to New York to be
mounted on his wall.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.330
MAN: Roosevelt loved to kill.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.230
He liked to shoot quadrupeds.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.800
At times he basically said
he didn't trust Americans who

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.700
wouldn't hunt, and he hinted
that he didn't believe that

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.400
Americans should have
citizenship who weren't

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.860
willing to kill a quadruped.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.330
COYOTE: That first trip to the
west, Roosevelt said later,

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.660
was an important
turning point for him.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.660
Over the next several years,
he would return again

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.730
and again to take more hunting
trips into the mountains,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.360
to ranch on the open plains,
to build up his health

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.360
and character by pursuing what
he called "the strenuous life,"

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.660
to become, in his own words,
"at heart as much a Westerner

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.230
as I am an Easterner."

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.860
Roosevelt would never lose his
love of hunting, but in time

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.260
he would learn that there were
much bigger and more important

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.900
trophies to pursue.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.460
[Roaring]

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.160
WOMAN: Our national parks
are an idea, an idea based

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.100
on generosity--not just for
our own species, but

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.160
for all species.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.400
I think that is profoundly
original in terms of a people

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.660
that say, we value
wild nature in place.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.730
We are of this place.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.630
And I think it's our
own declaration of both

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.160
independence and
interdependence.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.360
MAN: The great wilds of our
country, once held to be

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.830
boundless and inexhaustible,
are being rapidly invaded

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.760
and overrun in every
direction, and everything

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.100
destructible in them
is being destroyed.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:27.360
How far destruction may go
is not easy to guess.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.030
Every landscape, low and high,
seems doomed to be trampled

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.500
and harried.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.500
John Muir.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.260
COYOTE: As the 19th century
entered its final decade,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.430
Americans began to take
stock of what they had made

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.860
of the continent they had
been so busily subduing.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.700
Only 50 years earlier,
the nation's western border

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.400
had been the spine of
the Rocky Mountains.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.500
Buffalo numbering in the
tens of millions teemed

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.630
on the Great Plains.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.530
Vast forests had never
heard the ring of an ax.

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.830
Indian peoples stilled
controlled most of the west.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.500
[Train whistle blowing]

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.600
Now the nation stretched
all the way to the Pacific.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.430
Railroads had pushed into
every corner of the country.

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.360
Indians had been
systematically dispossessed

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.660
from their homelands and
forced onto reservations.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.300
White settlements had sprung
up in so many places that the

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.460
director of the census of 1890
announced he could no longer

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:40.500
find an American frontier.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.700
The bountiful land Thomas
Jefferson considered nature's

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:49.660
nation had seemingly
been conquered.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.600
MAN: The moment that Americans
start setting aside these

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.430
national parks is also the
moment of sort of the most

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.260
explosive exploitation of
so many elements

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.960
of the national landscape.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:01.860
It's the cutting down of
the north woods

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.260
at an extraordinary rate.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.300
It's the destruction of the
bison herds, the elimination

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.530
of the passenger pigeons.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.160
There is so much being
destroyed in the name

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.330
of progress in the United
States in the late 19th

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:17.430
century that the parks are a
kind of reaction against that.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.130
They are saying, if we keep
going the way we're going,

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.660
we're going to use it all up,
and some of this is

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.100
so beautiful, so essential to
who we are as a people that

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.760
we've got to put walls around
these parts and protect them

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.100
from ourselves.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.500
COYOTE: By 1890, the United
States has established 4

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.460
national parks: Yellowstone,
the world's first; the high

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.660
country of Yosemite; and
two groves of big trees

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.860
in California--General
Grant and Sequoia.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.700
The army had recently
been placed in charge

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.530
of protecting them all.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.800
[Gunshot]

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:02.300
Nonetheless, park wildlife
were still routinely killed.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.730
Cows and sheep still
overgrazed park meadows.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:10.330
Ancient forests were
still endangered.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.060
And tourists seemed intent
on squandering the treasures

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.460
a previous generation
had bequeathed them.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.030
The park idea, not yet
a quarter century old,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.330
still seemed an
uncertain experiment.

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.860
The issues of what was
permissible and proper

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.800
for people who visited the
parks were still unresolved.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.560
But as a new century was
about to dawn, a handful

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.230
of Americans began to question
the headlong rush that had

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.000
caused so much devastation
and saw in the national parks

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.460
a seed of hope that at least
some pristine places could be

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.600
saved before it was too late.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.530
Among them would be the young
assemblyman from New York City

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.430
who had gone west on a boyish
impulse but who would mature

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:06.730
into a president whose most
lasting legacy was rescuing

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.760
large portions of
America from destruction.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.160
MAN: Surely our people do not
understand even yet the rich

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.860
heritage that is theirs.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.330
There can be nothing in the
world more beautiful than

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:31.230
the Yosemite, the groves of
giant sequoias and redwoods,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:38.430
the canyon of the Yellowstone,
the canyon of the Colorado,

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.760
the Three Tetons.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.200
And our people should see to
it that they are preserved

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.830
for their children and their
children's children forever

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:55.060
with their majestic
beauty all unmarred.

DIFFERENT MAN: Dear reader,

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:16.230
today I'm in the Yellowstone
Park, and I wish I were dead.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:21.030
The park is just a howling
wilderness of 3,000 square

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:27.200
miles, full of all imaginable
freaks of a fiery nature.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.400
I have been through the park
in a buggy in the company of

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.430
an adventurous old lady from
Chicago and her husband,

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:43.130
who disapproved of the
scenery as being ungodly.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.200
I fancy it scared them.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200
Rudyard Kipling.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.500
COYOTE: In 1889, Rudyard
Kipling, a young Englishman

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.560
and aspiring writer,
was making his first tour

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.400
of the United States,
financing the trip by

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.160
writing dispatches for
newspapers overseas.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.160
Like many foreigners, Kipling
could not resist stopping

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.130
at Yellowstone, a place
already known around the world

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.030
as the wonderland.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:18.300
Most visitors in those days
were well-to-do, able to pay

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:22.600
the $120 train fare across
the continent to the remote

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.060
northwestern corner of
Wyoming and then $40 more

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:31.030
for the 5-day stagecoach trip
through the park known as

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:33.630
the grand tour.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.100
The first stop was the hotel
at Mammoth Hot Springs,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.300
where everyone unpacked
quickly and then rushed to buy

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.930
souvenirs and post cards
made by the park's resident

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.500
photographer, Frank J. Haynes.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.400
Many guests were perfectly
content to view the Mammoth

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:56.160
Springs from the comfort of
the hotel veranda, but some

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.630
bought guide books and
hiked up to the terraces

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.730
for a closer look.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.300
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
I found a basin which some

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.200
learned hotelkeeper has
christened Cleopatra's Pitcher

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:14.960
or Mark Antony's Whiskey Jug
or something equally poetical.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.060
I do not know the
depth of that wonder.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.200
The eye looked down into
an abyss that communicated

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:25.800
directly with the central
fires of the earth.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:31.060
The ground rings hollow as a
kerosene tin, and someday the

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:35.460
Mammoth Hotel, guests and all,
will sink into the caverns

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.160
below and be turned
into a stalactite.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.330
COYOTE: In the morning,
the passengers loaded back

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.200
into their assigned carriages
and one by one set off toward

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.800
the park's interior, spaced
about every 500 yards to

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.200
lessen the effects of dust
that clung in the air, Kipling

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.600
wrote, as dense as a fog.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.100
He was bemused by his fellow
tourists, especially the older

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:09.060
woman from Chicago sitting
next to him, who chewed gum

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.700
and talked constantly,
pontificating with her husband

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.700
on everything they
encountered, especially once

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:19.800
they reached the
first geyser area.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.400
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING:
The old lady, regarding the

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.760
horrors of the fire holes,
could only say "Good Lord!"

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.460
at 30-second intervals.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:35.100
Her husband talked about the
dreadful waste of steam power.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.060
"And if," continued the old
lady," if we find a thing

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.260
"so dreadful as all that steam
and sulfur allowed on the face

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.430
"on the earth, mustn't we
believe there is something

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:48.830
"10,000 times
more terrible below,

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:54.100
"prepared for our destruction?"

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:57.330
COYOTE: At noon, they stopped
at a tent hotel, a place

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.530
called Larry's, run by
Larry Matthews, a friendly

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.930
and loquacious Irishman
known for lavishing special

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.530
attention on his
gentille guests.

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.800
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING: Larry
enveloped us all in the golden

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.960
glamour of his speech,
'ere we had descended.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.700
And the tent with the rude
trestle table became a palace,

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.100
the rough fare
became delicacies

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.200
of Delmonico's, and we,
the abashed recipients

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.600
of Larry's imperial bounty.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:35.130
It was only later that I
discovered that I had paid 8

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.500
shillings for tinned beef,
biscuits, and beer.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.160
COYOTE: Like the other
establishments within

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160
the park, Larry's encouraged
tourists to believe that all

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.700
the water in Yellowstone
was impregnated with sulfur

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.000
and therefore unfit
for drinking.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.730
It was untrue, but it
boosted sales of mineral water

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.900
and beer at the inflated
price of 50 cents a bottle

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:09.800
and created roadsides
littered with empties.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.200
When the parade of
stagecoaches reached the lower

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.800
geyser basin, the tourists
encamped for two nights

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.860
at the Fire Hole Hotel,
or later, the more luxurious

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:24.830
Fountain Hotel, built at a
cost of $100,000 and capable

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:30.030
of handling 350 guests,
complete with electric lights,

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:36.130
steam heat, and hot baths fed
by one of the thermal springs.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.900
The next two days of the grand
tour were devoted exclusively

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.260
to visiting the spectacular
array of geysers and thermal

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.330
pools and fumaroles,
the largest concentration

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.460
of them in the world.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.260
Tourists would peer down
the throat of gaping holes

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.000
in the ground, taking their
chances that a geyser was not

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.430
about to erupt in their face.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.760
They marveled at the beauty of
translucent pools of turquoise

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:08.730
water, washed pieces of linen
in Handkerchief Pool, which

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.360
turned the cloth
white as snow.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.900
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING: They
are guarded by soldiers who

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.100
patrol with loaded six-shooters
in order that the

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.900
tourists may not bring up
fence-rails and sink them

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:26.060
in a pool or chip the fretted
tracery of the formations

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:30.360
with a geological hammer or,
walking where the crust is too

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:34.000
thin, foolishly cook himself.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.060
COYOTE: No visit to
Yellowstone was considered

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:45.100
complete without seeing Old
Faithful go off on schedule.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.030
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING: All
the young ladies remarked that

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.800
it was elegant and betook
themselves to writing their

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:53.630
names in the bottoms
of shallow pools.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:58.030
Nature fixes the insult
indelibly, and the after-years

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:04.400
will learn that Hattie, Sadie,
Mamie, Sophie, and so forth

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.760
have taken out their hairpins
and scrawled in the face

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.600
of Old Faithful.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.830
COYOTE: The last night in the
park was spent at a hotel near

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.660
the majestic Grand Canyon
of the Yellowstone.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.800
The view from its edge was
considered the inspirational

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.800
grand finale.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.160
Even the cynical Rudyard
Kipling was impressed.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.730
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING: All
I can say is that without

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:39.000
warning or preparation,
I looked into a gulf 1,700

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.730
feet deep with eagles
and fish hawks circling far

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:48.460
below, and the sides of that
gulf were one wild welter

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:55.130
of color--crimson, emerald,
cobalt, ocher, amber, honey

00:19:55.130 --> 00:20:00.300
splashed with port wine,
snow white, vermillion, lemon,

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:04.960
and silver-gray
in wide washes.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.760
So far below that no sound
of its strife could reach us,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.000
the Yellowstone River ran,
a finger-wide strip

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.160
of jade green.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.330
Now I know what it is to sit
enthroned amid the clouds

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.530
of sunset.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.530
COYOTE: The final day
consisted of a stagecoach ride

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.030
back to the start of the tour,
lunch once more at Larry's,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.330
shouting out the names
of their home states

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.960
and countries to passing
wagons filled with fresh loads

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.900
of tourists heading into the
park, dinner at the hotel

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.760
at Mammoth Hot Springs,
then on to the train waiting

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:58.460
at the station to carry them
and their memories away.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.200
MAN AS RUDYARD KIPLING: "And
to think," said the old lady

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.100
from Chicago, "that this
showplace has been going

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:12.800
"on all these days, and
none of we ever saw it."

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.000
Rudyard Kipling.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.360
MAN: Those first few
years--and maybe this was OK

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.900
because there were so few
visitors--but it was

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.000
just wide open.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.830
Those early visitors trying to
figure out how best to enjoy

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:35.000
Yellowstone were very quickly
teaching the managers what

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.200
wasn't gonna work.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.530
Nobody knew how to act in
a national park.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:43.660
It hadn't been decided yet.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.500
COYOTE: Having created the
national parks, Congress had

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:50.360
not seen fit to provide some
kind of authority to oversee

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:54.800
them, and in 1886, it even
refused to appropriate any

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.360
money whatsoever.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.130
General Phillip Sheridan had
been forced to send the U.S.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.160
Cavalry into Yellowstone
simply to maintain some

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.430
semblance of order.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.230
By the 1890s, this
temporary arrangement had

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.000
become permanent.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.130
Up to 4 troops of cavalry
were stationed at the newly

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:21.930
constructed Fort Yellowstone
near the Mammoth Hot Springs.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:24.460
SCHULLERY: I think the odds
are really good that if

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.260
the army hadn't been sent in,
Yellowstone wouldn't

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.960
have made it.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.630
Writing your name on things
was such a proud tradition

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.460
that people would put their
address, too, and the soldiers

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.030
could just very simply go
out and write them all down,

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.560
head back to the hotel,
and look through the hotel

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:46.600
registers and find these
people and drag them by the

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.330
collar back out so they could
spend some time scrubbing

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.630
their name off.

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.260
COYOTE: The army was expected
to patrol 2 million acres

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.330
on horseback, doing their best
to stop poachers and vandals

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.060
and campers careless
with their fires.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.360
But the troopers were hampered
by the fact that the federal

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.260
park existed in a
legal no man's land.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.530
Usually their only recourse
was a warning, or in the most

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.900
serious cases,
expulsion from the park.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.200
Army engineers built and
improved the roads and bridges

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.330
that guided travel within the
park to the places tourists

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.030
wanted to see, while leaving
major portions of Yellowstone

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:35.400
a roadless and
totally wild expanse.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.100
With the tourists gone,
the cavalrymen found

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.830
themselves holed up in
small cabins scattered

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:47.260
around the park, patrolling
for poachers on skis in frigid

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.630
temperatures and
lethal snowstorms.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.530
Frederick Remington, when he
visited and traveled with

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.000
the soldiers in Yellowstone,
said that they were very fond

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.800
of saying that Yellowstone
had 3 seasons: July, August,

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.200
and winter, and they hated it.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.660
COYOTE: Men were lost
transporting mail from one

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.600
isolated outpost to another.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.600
They died in avalanches.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.400
Some may have been killed
by poachers, who were often

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.360
better equipped and more
experienced at maneuvering

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.830
through the back
country in deep snow.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.630
MAN: In my last report,
I noted the death of Private

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:27.560
Matthews of Troop B,
6th Cavalry, while on detached

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.130
service for the mail.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:32.730
A most thorough search for
his remains was continued

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.930
for almost 6 months
after his disappearance.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.830
His body was found
early in June.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.730
It was evident that he
became lost and while in that

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:49.930
condition became crazed
and perished from the cold.

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.500
Captain George Anderson.

00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.060
COYOTE: The cavalry was also
in charge of the nation's 3

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:04.330
other national parks--General
Grant, Sequoia, and the high

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.800
country surrounding Yosemite.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.830
Each spring, troops stationed
at the Presidio in San

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.730
Francisco would make the
2-week, 250-mile ride to the

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:19.860
Sierras and patrol the 3 parks
during the summer season.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.530
Some of them were African
Americans, the celebrated

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.530
buffalo soldiers of the 9th
and 10th Cavalry who had made

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.600
a name for themselves
in the Indian wars.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.360
Their commander was Captain
Charles Young, born into

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.900
slavery in Kentucky, whose
father had escaped bondage

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.460
during the Civil War to
enlist in the Union Army.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.930
Young followed his father's
example of military service,

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:53.000
becoming the third black man
to graduate from West Point

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.300
and the first to be put in
charge of a national park.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.000
JOHNSON: If you're an enlisted
man and then you see

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.500
an African American
officer--an officer--

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.900
that stays in your mind,

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.230
and it also sparks a fire in
your own sense of self-worth,

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.500
your own sense of what is
possible in this world,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.230
because you might say to
yourself, "If he could do

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.730
"that, maybe I could
do that as well."

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:22.930
So he was a walking
inspiration to the enlisted

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.730
men in the 9th
and 10th Cavalry.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.460
COYOTE: As superintendent of
Sequoia, Young directed his

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:33.300
men to complete the
first wagon road into

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.460
the Giant Forest.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.600
They accomplished more in
one summer than had been done

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.230
in the 3 previous
years combined.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.560
They built the
first trail to Mt. Whitney,

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.530
the highest peak in
the west, and erected fences

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:54.360
around the big trees to
prevent vandalism by visitors.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.660
JOHNSON: So the early
parks--Yellowstone, Sequoia,

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.530
and Yosemite--you had
to have park protectors

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.760
because otherwise, people
would be going into those

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.200
areas doing what they've
always done--cutting trees

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.630
down, you know, for firewood,
or shooting the game, shooting

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:09.960
the deer to feed their family.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.060
How do you tell someone who's
just trying to keep their

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.230
children fed, not hungry,
that it's illegal now to

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.200
shoot the game in Yosemite
or in Sequoia National Park?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.930
And that would be a difficult
proposition if you were

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:28.900
a white soldier, but when you
add that overlay of race,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.500
which is no overlay at all,
and you have an African

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:36.630
American, a colored man,
giving orders to people who

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:41.660
are not used to taking orders
from anyone who looks like me,

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.130
then you have the beginning
of a very interesting day.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:48.430
COYOTE: Like their
counterparts at Yellowstone,

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.230
the troops in California had
to operate without clear legal

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.730
authority and therefore
invented techniques to protect

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:58.060
their parks.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.560
When they collected travelers'
rifles upon entry and only

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.830
returned them when the
visitors left, the wildlife

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.700
began to come back.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.800
Sheep herders defiantly
bringing their flocks into the

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.930
park's alpine meadows had been
openly scornful of the troops,

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:18.660
once they realized that the
army had no power of criminal

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.730
arrest and prosecution.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:26.100
The soldiers then came up
with a creative solution.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.960
JOHNSON: It was
a standard rule.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.300
You find the sheep that are
grazing illegally in the park,

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.630
and you move the sheep out
to the eastern boundary

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.860
of the park.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.260
You find the sheepherders,
and you move them out the

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.260
western boundary of the park.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.260
Now, the park in
those days was 1,500

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:44.030
square miles, so
by the time the sheep

00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:46.830
and the sheep herders were
reunited, well, let's just say

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.860
the season was done, and if
you have a business and your

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.500
business is herding sheep and
that happens to you more than

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.330
once or twice, you don't come
back, and I think that was

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:59.260
a pretty effective way of
dealing with illegal grazing

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.060
in the park.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.860
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: For many
years, the military have guarded

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:09.330
the great Yellowstone Park,
and now they are guarding

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.360
the Yosemite.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.700
They found it a desert as
far as underbrush, grass,

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:19.430
and flowers were concerned,
but in two years, the skin

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.660
of the mountains
is healthy again.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.300
Blessings on Uncle
Sam's soldiers.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.760
They have done their job well,
and every pine tree is waving

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.460
its arm for joy.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.430
COYOTE: No one was more
thankful for the army's

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:42.760
presence than John Muir,
for whom the Sierra Nevada was

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.200
the range of light--mountains,
he wrote, "that were throbbing

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.130
"and pulsing with the
heartbeats of God."

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.360
WOMAN: I think John Muir
understood, as perhaps no one

00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:01.330
else has, how essential beauty
is--natural beauty is to us.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.900
Without beauty, we have no,
kind of, lubrication

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.700
of the human spirit.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:12.160
We would just be dead, and
that's really what drove him.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.000
That's what fueled him.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.600
COYOTE: Clambering
ecstatically over

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.330
the mountainsides, Muir had
become a self-taught expert

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:24.100
in glaciers, a keen observer
and lover of everything he

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.130
encountered, from the tiniest
specks of lichen on a rock to

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.530
the mighty sequoias.

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:34.130
And through his magazine
articles, he had emerged as

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:37.300
a wilderness prophet,
a nationally known voice

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.930
for preserving the last
remaining vestiges

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:44.760
of America's virgin
forests and unspoiled lands.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:51.230
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: Mere
destroyers--tree killers,

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.200
wool and mutton men,
spreading death and confusion

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.130
in the fairest groves and
gardens ever planted.

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.800
Let the government hasten
to cast them out and make

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.300
an end of them.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.700
Any fool can destroy trees.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.760
They cannot run away.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.260
And if they could, they would
still be destroyed--chased

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:20.100
and hunted down as long as fun
or a dollar could be got out

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.730
of their bark hides.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.960
Through all the wonderful,
eventful centuries since

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:32.000
Christ's time and long before
that, God has cared for these

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.060
trees, saved them from
drought, disease, avalanches,

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:43.030
and a thousand straining,
leveling tempests and floods,

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:46.830
but he cannot save
them from fools.

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.500
Only Uncle Sam can do that.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.200
COYOTE: Yosemite's high
country had been designated

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.860
a national park in 1890,
but the valley itself remained

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:04.430
under the control of a
California state commission

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:07.060
and their political
appointees, a group

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.060
of "blundering, plundering,
moneymaking vote sellers,"

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:12.160
Muir said.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.360
He wanted it all
transferred back to

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.230
the federal government.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:21.530
Only then, he believed,
would it be safe from ruin.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:25.300
In 1892, to help promote
Yosemite's protection,

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.160
Muir and a small group of
prominent Californians formed

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.260
a new organization.

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.060
They called it
the Sierra Club.

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:38.960
Muir enthusiastically agreed
to serve as its president,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.300
hoping, he said, that "we
will be able to do something

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:46.030
"for wildness and make
the mountains glad."

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.630
[Scattered applause]

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.660
MAN: In the 19th century,
when the census bureau would

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.500
do its census, it would draw a
line that's the frontier line,

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:09.060
and proudly say it marches
westward, and their definition

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.860
of it had this
wonderful phrase.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.600
It would say, in the last
10 years, this many million

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:19.060
of acres have been "redeemed
from wilderness by

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.960
"the hand of man."

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:28.500
"Redeemed from wilderness
by the hand of man."

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:34.830
In other words, a virgin forest
is redeemed when it's cut down.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.800
A beautiful mountain stream is
redeemed when the miners are

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.630
turned loose in it.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:47.060
That symbolized what our
view of nature was as we were

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:51.160
rushing across the continent.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:56.130
That's totally the opposite
of what John Muir would say.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.760
Wilderness isn't
redeemed by man.

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.830
Man is redeemed by wilderness.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.860
MAN: To know you are the first
to set foot in homes that have

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:26.030
been deserted for centuries
is a strange feeling.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:30.560
It is as though unseen eyes
watched, wondering what aliens

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.700
were invading their
sanctuaries and why.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:42.530
The dust of centuries filled
the rooms and rose in thick

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.530
clouds at every movement.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.400
Al Wetherill.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.430
COYOTE: A few months before
Rudyard Kipling visited

00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:58.200
Yellowstone, cowboys
searching for stray cattle

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.300
in southwestern Colorado,
along the edge of a high

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.960
plateau known as Mesa Verde,
came upon the ruins

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.260
of an ancient city tucked
into the side of a cliff.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.630
Using a tree trunk and their
lariats, they improvised

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.400
a ladder and descended
for a closer look.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.530
MAN AS AL WETHERILL: It was
like treading holy ground to

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:27.730
go into those peaceful-looking
homes of a vanished people.

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.000
Things were arranged in the
rooms as if people might just

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.900
have been out
visiting somewhere.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:39.900
COYOTE: In quick succession,
they soon came across even

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.630
more ruins nestled into the
remote canyon walls of Mesa

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:47.330
Verde and gave
names to them all.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.400
Cliff Palace.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.930
Spruce Tree House.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:55.760
Balcony House.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.300
It was the largest
concentration ever found

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.030
of the cliff dwellings--built,
occupied, and then

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:06.130
mysteriously deserted nearly a
thousand years earlier by

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:09.230
the ancestors of some of the
modern Pueblo Indians

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:11.200
of the southwest.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.360
MAN AS AL WETHERILL: We knew
that if we did not break into

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.400
that charmed world, someone
else would sometime--someone

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.560
who might not love and respect
those emblems of antiquity

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.200
as we did.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.530
COYOTE: The cowboys who
discovered the ruins were the

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:33.160
Wetherills--5 brothers from
a family of Quakers who had

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:37.660
moved to Colorado from
Kansas 8 years earlier.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.630
The oldest was Richard,
who encouraged them all to

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.960
spend every free moment
digging among the ruins,

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.730
hoping to sell their
discoveries to museums

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:50.960
in big cities.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.730
MAN AS AL WETHERILL: We had
started in as just ordinary

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:55.360
pothunters,

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.430
but as work progressed along
that sort of questionable

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:03.230
business, we developed quite a
bit of scientific knowledge by

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:07.730
careful work and comparisons.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.230
COYOTE: One day a stranger
showed up, a young Swedish

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:14.330
nobleman with an interest
in archaeology--

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.800
Gustaf Nordenskiold.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.100
When the Wetherills showed
him the ruins, his enthusiasm,

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.060
one of the brothers
remembered, increased almost

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:26.160
beyond his control.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.660
For two months, from sunup to
sundown, he kept the Wetherill

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.630
brothers busy, teaching them
more scientific methods.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.430
He showed them how to use
a mason's trowel instead

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:44.060
of a spade, digging slowly and
carefully to reveal a relic

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.500
without damaging it.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.060
He insisted on labeling and
photographing everything

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.060
and often saved items that
no other archaeologist

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.530
of the time would have kept--
wood ash from fire pits,

00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:01.430
dust and trash from the
floors, even dried pieces

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:05.130
of human excrement that one
day might help determine what

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:09.930
the ancient Puebloans had
been eating so long ago.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.460
In all,
he amassed hundreds of items

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:17.360
which he intended to
ship home to Sweden.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.460
But when his pack animals,
loaded down with artifacts,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.600
reached the railway station
in Durango, Nordenskiold was

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.360
immediately arrested.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.800
MAN: The basic problem was,

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.900
this foreigner is stealing our

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.030
relics, our bowls, our pots,

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:36.260
and we're not gonna allow that.

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.800
It's all right for we
Americans to steal them,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.130
but it's not all right for
those foreigners to do it.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:45.130
Gustaf's lawyer asked the
judge, under what law are we

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:46.560
arresting him?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.860
And there was no law.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.900
There was no law at all,
so they couldn't stop him.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.300
They couldn't stop anybody,
and that probably sparked some

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.830
interest--why
isn't there a law?

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.700
COYOTE: Nordenskiold was
released and got to take his

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:05.000
huge shipment home to
Scandinavia, where he

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.860
published the first scientific
study of the cliff dwellers.

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:12.660
But the controversy had
brought worldwide attention to

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.600
Mesa Verde and to the fact
that its treasures were

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:18.830
completely unprotected.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:35.130
MAN: We have seen the Indian
and the game retreat before

00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:39.860
the white man and the
cattle and beheld the tide

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.600
of immigration move forward
which threatens before long to

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.060
leave no portion of our vast
territory unbroken by the

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:51.730
farmer's plow or untrodden
by his flocks.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.230
There is one spot left--a
single rock about which this

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:02.630
tide will break and past which
it will sweep, leaving it

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:07.560
undefiled by the unsightly
traces of civilization.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:12.660
Here in this Yellowstone Park,
the large game of the west may

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:17.300
be preserved from
extermination in this,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.560
their last refuge.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.660
George Bird Grinnell.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.030
COYOTE: By the 1890s,
few Americans understood as

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:33.100
keenly as George Bird
Grinnell, the editor and owner

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.360
of "Forest and Stream"
magazine, how fearful

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.700
the price had been for the
nation's relentless expansion

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.830
across the continent.

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:46.200
Raised on the estate of the
famous painter and naturalist

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.860
John James Audubon at the
north end of Manhattan,

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:52.500
Grinnell could remember
spotting a bald eagle from his

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.360
bedroom window and watching
immense flocks of passenger

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.800
pigeons darkening the sky from
horizon to horizon as they

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.560
passed overhead.

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.600
Traveling across Kansas,
he had once encountered

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.960
a buffalo herd so vast that
his train was forced to stop

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.260
for 3 hours while the
beasts crossed the tracks.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.800
He had hunted elk in Nebraska
when elk could still be found

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.300
on the plains, ridden with
the Pawnees in a great buffalo

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.030
chase as the Indians brought
down their prey with bows

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.600
and arrows.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.830
Now all that and so much
more suddenly seemed gone or

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:39.130
on the verge of disappearing.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.600
Passenger pigeons had been
so systematically killed that

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.300
a bird once numbering in the
hundreds of millions had been

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:51.130
reduced to a handful, and soon
the death of a solitary bird

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.230
in a Cincinnati zoo would
bring an end to

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.360
the species' existence.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.700
The hide-hunters had been
equally effective

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.460
with the buffalo.

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.060
By the mid-1880s, the last of
the great free-roaming herds

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:07.600
had been slaughtered.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.530
Now the only wild herd left in
the country was in Yellowstone

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:18.460
National Park, estimated at
only a few hundred animals.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.700
MAN AS GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL:
For 4 centuries, we have been

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:25.300
killing and marketing game,
destroying it as rapidly

00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:29.600
and as thoroughly as we knew
how, and making no provision

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.860
toward replacing the supply.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.160
We are just beginning to
ask one another how we may

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.900
preserve the little that
remains for ourselves

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:40.900
and our children.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.530
COYOTE: Grinnell regularly
used the pages of "Forest

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:52.560
and Stream" to try to point
Americans in a new direction.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.830
It wasn't that he
was against hunting.

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.030
In fact, he loved to hunt.

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.260
Grinnell just feared that
without wise management,

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:04.960
there would be nothing
left for hunters to shoot.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.160
He proposed the creation of
a new organization aimed

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:12.230
at stopping the heedless
killing of wild birds,

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:15.230
"in honor," Grinnell wrote,
"of the man who did more to

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:18.860
"teach Americans about birds of
their own land than any other

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.500
"who ever lived."

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:25.660
He named the group
The Audubon Society.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.760
And when Grinnell published
a mildly critical review

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:32.000
of Theodore Roosevelt's book
chronicling his own western

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.800
adventures, the young author
burst into Grinnell's office

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.600
to confront him.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.760
The two men turned the awkward
moment into the beginning

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:45.730
of a lasting friendship and
together formed the Boone

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:49.330
and Crockett Club to promote
what they called "the manly

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:52.560
"sport of hunting."

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.060
DUNCAN: But Grinnell had
other, larger issues in mind

00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:59.360
that he wanted to steer Teddy
Roosevelt toward, and I think

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.730
over time he became something
of a mentor to Roosevelt,

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:06.930
of taking this energetic guy,
this guy who was a political

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.360
star, a rising political star,
and gradually pointing him

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:15.860
in directions that were
clearly in Roosevelt's heart

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:19.530
but needed that little tilt
from George Bird Grinnell to

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:22.260
bring them to fruition.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:25.260
COYOTE: As president of the
new club, Theodore Roosevelt

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:28.960
was increasingly drawn into
Grinnell's battles, including

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.830
the longstanding crusade to
keep Yellowstone as pristine

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.260
as possible.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.430
It was a constant fight.

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:39.760
There were repeated attempts
in Congress to reduce

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.730
the park's size or open it up
to greater

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:45.130
commercial exploitation.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:49.230
Roosevelt helped
defeat them all.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:53.230
But despite those successes,
there was still no federal law

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.660
giving Yellowstone's
caretakers clear authority to

00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:01.230
protect its wildlife,
including its dwindling herd

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.100
of wild buffalo.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:10.530
On March 13, 1894,
two troopers out

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:14.260
on patrol in Yellowstone
heard shots in the distance

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.030
and hurried in that direction.

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.700
[Gunshot]

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.760
Soon they came across
several buffalo carcasses.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.630
A man was hunched over one of
them, so busily skinning it

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.660
that he didn't realize the
troopers were there until one

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:31.530
of them was beside him
with a drawn gun.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:35.130
The poacher was Edgar Howell,
and he had been methodically

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.900
killing as many buffalos as
he could, planning to haul out

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:43.900
their heads for sale to
a Montana taxidermist.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:47.760
As luck would have it,
a reporter named Emerson Hough

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.760
on assignment for "Forest and
Stream," was also in the park

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:55.230
with a photographer to do an
article about Yellowstone

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.630
in the winter.

00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.500
When the poacher bragged that
the worst punishment he could

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.400
receive for his crime was
expulsion from the park

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.960
and the loss of only 26
dollars' worth of equipment,

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.130
Hough realized he had stumbled
onto a great story and quickly

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:15.960
telegraphed it to Grinnell
in New York City.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:20.060
Grinnell knew just what
to do with it.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.830
SCHULLERY: Grinnell just
pulled out all the stops.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.830
He ran the story in
"Forest and Stream."

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:29.900
He was in contact with
everybody he knew who might be

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.800
able to wake up, you know,
the sleeping giant,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.500
the American public, and
make them care about this,

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.460
and he succeeded.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.700
COYOTE: Within a week,
legislation was working its

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.160
way through Congress,
authorizing regulations that

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.600
would finally protect the
park, its geysers,

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.700
and its wildlife.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:56.930
On May 7, 1894, less than two
months after Howell's capture,

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:02.630
President Grover Cleveland
signed the bill into law.

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.660
[Birds chirping]

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:08.800
SCHULLERY: George Bird
Grinnell and Theodore Roosevelt

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.460
and the other defenders of
Yellowstone were thinking

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:17.760
in ecosystem terms before
anybody was using the term.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.500
They saw places like
Yellowstone as reservoirs.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.900
They used the
term "reservoir."

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.630
It was a reservoir
for wildlife.

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:34.760
I think if the opportunity
presented by the capture

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:39.400
of Howell had been missed,
we would have lost the bison.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.900
They were so close to gone.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:01.530
MAN: Gentlemen, why in
heaven's name this haste?

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:04.100
You have time enough.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:08.030
Why sacrifice the present to
the future, fancying that you

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:11.700
will be happier when your
fields teem with wealth

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.260
and your cities with people?

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.730
In Europe, we have cities
wealthier and more populous

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:24.900
than yours, and we
are not happy.

00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:29.760
You dream of your posterity,
but your posterity will look

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:34.500
back to yours as the golden
age and envy those who first

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:38.560
burst into this silent,
splendid nature, who first

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.460
lifted up their axes upon
these tall trees and lined

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:48.400
these waters with
busy wharves.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.230
Why, then, seek to complete,
in a few decades, what took

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:57.900
the other nations of the
world thousands of years?

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:03.200
Why, in your hurry to subdue
and utilize nature, squander

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.700
her splendid gifts?

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:13.860
You have opportunity such as
mankind has never had before

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.730
and may never have again.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.530
Lord James Bryce.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.330
MAN: The first duty of the
human race is to control

00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:32.130
the earth it lives upon.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:36.200
The first principle of
conservation is development,

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.260
the use of natural resources
now existing on this continent

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:44.760
for the benefit of the
people who live here now.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.830
Gifford Pinchot.

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.600
COYOTE: Gifford Pinchot was
a graduate of Yale who had

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:57.330
studied forestry in Germany
and France and returned as

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.930
the first American to
declare himself

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.800
a professional forester.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.030
He and John Muir had met in
1896 and in the beginning

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:10.500
enjoyed each other's company,
camping together on the rim

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.800
of the Grand Canyon.

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.930
But while the two men agreed
that America's forests were

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:20.660
being rapaciously destroyed,
they ultimately parted company

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:23.700
on the solution.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.500
Muir considered
forests sacred.

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.100
He wanted them treated as
parks with logging, grazing,

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.900
and hunting prohibited.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.000
Pinchot didn't agree.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.530
He wanted forests protected,
too, but he believed the best

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:44.030
way to do it was to manage
their use, not leave them alone.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.900
His favorite saying was
"the greatest good

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:49.760
"for the greatest number."

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.760
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: Much is
said on questions of this kind

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.600
about the greatest good
for the greatest number,

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:02.860
but the greatest number is too
often found to be number one.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.560
It is never the greatest
number in the common meaning

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.860
of the term that makes the
greatest noise and stir

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:12.630
on questions mixed with money.

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.000
Complaints are made in
the name of poor settlers

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.360
and miners, while the wealthy
corporations are kept

00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:22.560
carefully hidden
in the background.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.960
Let right, commendable
industry be fostered, but as

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.560
to these Goths and Vandals
of the wilderness who are

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.760
spreading black death in the
fairest woods God ever made,

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.560
let the government
up and at 'em.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.500
CRONON: We often tell
stories about the origins

00:51:43.500 --> 00:51:46.200
of the American conservation
movement by setting John Muir

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.200
and Gifford Pinchot in
counterpoint with each other.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.260
Often in those stories,
John Muir is the hero

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:53.030
and Gifford Pinchot
is the villain.

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:57.030
In fact, they represent,
I think, two sides of one coin.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:00.230
Muir is the figure who
celebrates the sacred

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:04.160
in nature--the wildness,
the otherness of nature,

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.800
that which we need to protect
if we are not to contaminate

00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.430
things that are nonhuman
with our own human agendas.

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:14.300
Pinchot, on the other hand,
is about a conservation that

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.230
celebrates sustainability.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:20.000
It's about keeping the
roots of our material lives

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.830
in the natural world in such
a way that we don't destroy

00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:27.800
nature as we use nature
for our own livelihood.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.960
COYOTE: Congress and the
administration of President

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.660
Grover Cleveland sided with
Pinchot, who was appointed

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:37.700
the nation's chief forester.

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.060
National forests would
become part of the Department

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:44.860
of Agriculture, used and
managed like a crop,

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:49.000
not preserved like a temple.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.360
But if Muir could not prevail
on the future of all national

00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:56.760
forests, he tried to salvage
at least a partial victory by

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:01.560
protecting one forest as
a national park.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:04.560
It was in western
Washington state within sight

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:08.500
of the cities of Seattle and
Tacoma, the ancient homeland

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:12.430
of nearly a dozen Indian
tribes, including the Cowlitz,

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:16.630
Nisqually, Puyallup,
and Yakima, who called it

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:21.830
Tahoma, the big mountain
where the waters begin.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:27.030
White settlers called
it Mount Rainier.

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:29.930
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: Altogether,
this is the richest subalpine

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:37.560
garden I ever found,
a perfect floral elysium.

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.860
The icy dome needs not a man's
care, but unless the reserve

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:46.130
is guarded, the flower
bloom will soon be killed,

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:49.100
and nothing of the forest
will be left but black

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:52.530
stump monuments.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:56.060
COYOTE: A broad coalition,
including the Sierra Club,

00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:58.860
the National Geographic
Society, and the Northern

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.930
Pacific Railroad, worked hard
with Muir for more than 5

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:08.860
years, and on March 2, 1899,
Mount Rainier became the

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:12.230
nation's fifth national park.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:23.000
MAN: When on the streets I
meet young girls and matrons

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.960
with their kindly faces
and see the egrets in their

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.760
bonnets and hats, I cannot
help feeling that these

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.700
daughters of Eve do not
know how these feathers

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:36.260
were obtained.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:41.060
These plumes only grow while
the bird is rearing its young,

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:44.460
and I believe that if most of
the women who wear them knew

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:48.460
they were obtained by shooting
the mother on her nest,

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.560
they would be ashamed to
keep them, even in secret,

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:57.060
much less to display them
on the public streets.

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.060
John F. Lacey.

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:02.460
COYOTE: For centuries,
the nation's greatest breeding

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.200
ground for its most beautiful
plumed birds was southern

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.560
Florida, where the fresh
waters of Lake Okeechobee

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.230
drained slowly toward the Gulf
of Mexico, through cypress

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:17.960
swamps and mangrove forests
and the biggest saw grass marsh

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.500
in the world, the Everglades.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:25.700
But by 1900, the long plumes
of the great white and snowy

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:30.230
egrets had become more
valuable per ounce than gold,

00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:34.730
and nearly 95% of Florida's
shorebirds had been killed by

00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:37.100
plume hunters.

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.660
More than 5 million birds a
year were perishing to satisfy

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:44.230
the demand of the latest
fashion trend--using bird

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:48.360
feathers to
decorate women's hats.

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:52.130
Strolling the streets of New
York for part of an afternoon,

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:58.360
one ornithologist counted 542
feathered hats, representing

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:02.300
40 different species.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:06.930
Some hats included an
entire stuffed bird.

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.600
MAN AS GEORGE BIRD GRINNELL:
Fashion decrees feathers,

00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.500
and feathers it is.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.230
This condition of affairs must
be something of a shock to

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:22.060
the leaders of the Audubon
Society, who were sanguine

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.930
enough to believe that the
moral idea represented by

00:56:24.930 --> 00:56:30.360
their movement would be enough
to influence society at large.

00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:33.230
George Bird Grinnell.

00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:36.200
COYOTE: The Audubon Society
had done its best to try to

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.760
persuade women not to buy such
hats, even promoted the sale

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:44.230
of featherless hats called
Audubonetts decorated

00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:46.360
with ribbons.

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.630
It didn't work, and the
millenary industry, based

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:54.000
principally in New York City,
used its influence in Congress

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.930
to defeat a series of national
laws aimed at stopping

00:56:57.930 --> 00:56:59.930
the slaughter.

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:04.130
Then an unlikely
champion stepped forward.

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:06.700
MAN AS JOHN F. LACEY:
We have a wireless telegraph,

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:08.860
a thornless cactus,

00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:13.130
a seedless orange, and
a coreless apple.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.860
Let us now have
a birdless hat.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:18.760
John F. Lacey.

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:24.500
COYOTE: As the Republican
party began fracturing

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.330
at the start of the 20th
century into a progressive

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:31.100
wing and a group of die-hard
conservatives known as

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.700
Stand-Pat Republicans,
Representative John F. Lacey

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:39.000
of Oskaloosa, Iowa,
counted himself with those

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.360
opposed to change.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:45.000
But when it came to defending
wildlife or saving America's

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.760
remaining unspoiled lands,
Lacey's definition

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.430
of conservative placed him not
only outside his fellow

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:55.430
Stand-Patters but
in the vanguard of even

00:57:55.430 --> 00:58:00.760
the most progressive
politicians of the day.

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.760
MAN AS JOHN F. LACEY: The first
settlers found this continent

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:06.360
a storehouse of energy and
national wealth, but we have

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:10.160
not been content with
using these resources.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:14.430
We have wasted them
as reckless prodigals.

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:17.330
For more than 300 years,
destruction was

00:58:17.330 --> 00:58:20.830
called improvement.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:24.630
Mankind must conserve the
resources of nature, or the

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:28.960
world will, at no distant day,
become as barren as

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.330
a sucked orange.

00:58:32.330 --> 00:58:34.900
COYOTE: It had been Lacey,
working with George Bird

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.860
Grinnell and Theodore
Roosevelt, who pushed through

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:41.000
the bill that finally gave
government officials the tools

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:44.830
they needed to protect
America's last wild buffalo

00:58:44.830 --> 00:58:47.400
herd in Yellowstone.

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:51.260
Now, after years of ceaseless
effort, he won passage

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:57.160
of another landmark, the Lacey
Bird and Game Act of 1900.

00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.330
Soon, government agents were
confiscating huge shipments

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:06.030
of bird skins and feathers.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.800
But the Lacey Act did not
put an end to plume hunting

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:14.830
entirely, especially in
the lawless Everglades.

00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:18.160
5 years after the bill's
passage, a game warden was

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.560
murdered by poachers.

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.430
3 years after that,
another one was gunned down.

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.700
Some people began thinking
that the uniquely abundant

00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:33.100
array of wildlife in southern
Florida would never be safe

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.760
unless the Everglades
itself was set aside, like

00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:40.260
Yellowstone, as
a national park.

00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.700
MAN AS JOHN F. LACEY: The
attempt to preserve and restore

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.030
some of the wildlife of America

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:52.060
is no longer looked upon
as a fad or idle sentiment.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:55.300
We have given an awful
exhibition of slaughter

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.960
and destruction which may
serve as a warning to

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.430
all mankind.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:04.160
Let us now give an example
of wise conservation of what

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:09.200
remains of the
gifts of nature.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.260
COYOTE: As America moved into
a new century, a new word--

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:17.730
conservation--had crept into
the nation's vocabulary.

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:23.130
Now a new president would
turn the word into a movement.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:30.000
MAN: Like all Americans,
I like big things--big

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.330
prairies, big forests and
mountains, big wheat fields,

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.200
railroads, and herds
of cattle, too.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:42.160
Big factories, steamboats,
and everything else.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.700
CRONON: I think it's hard to
exaggerate the significance

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.560
of Theodore Roosevelt
in the history

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.700
of American conservation.

01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:51.430
He creates a presidency when
he arrives in the White House

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:54.600
that sets in motion most of
the conservation agendas that

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.200
will define the first half
of the 20th century.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:03.300
MAN: The key to Teddy
Roosevelt's leadership was his

01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.700
passion, his audacity,
the fact that he was

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:13.460
an inspiring public speaker
and enjoyed leading the country.

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:17.360
He was a person who turned
the country in a different

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.730
direction where conservation
was concerned.

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:24.760
COYOTE: In the spring of 1903,
Theodore Roosevelt once again

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.700
boarded a train headed west,
and on April 8, he stepped off

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:32.930
at the Northern Pacific
railroad terminal just outside

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:36.230
of Yellowstone National Park.

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:40.430
He was no longer the scrawny
and inexperienced Easterner

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:43.600
cowboys had laughed at
and called "four-eyes"

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.830
20 years earlier.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:47.960
He was a national hero,

01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.160
the leader of the Rough Riders
in the war with Spain,

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:53.700
a former governor
of New York state,

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.530
President William McKinley's
running mate in 1900,

01:01:57.530 --> 01:02:02.060
and now, following McKinley's
assassination in 1901,

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.330
the youngest president
in United States history.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:09.400
MAN: The president
unites in himself

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.700
powers and qualities
that rarely go together...

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.430
the qualities of a man of action

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.500
with those of a scholar
and writer...

01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:21.230
the instincts
and accomplishments

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.630
of the best breeding and culture

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:25.960
with the broadest
democratic sympathies.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.200
He is doubtless the most
vital man on the continent,

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:32.360
if not on the planet, today.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.930
John Burroughs.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.630
COYOTE: Not since Thomas
Jefferson a century earlier

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.900
had there been
an American president

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.600
with greater interest
in the natural world.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.930
JENKINSON: Roosevelt began
his life as a naturalist.

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:52.630
He formed Theodore Roosevelt's
Natural History Museum

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:55.500
as a child, and he was
a taxidermist.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.430
He would find snakes and mice
and other creatures

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:01.430
and sometimes store them
in the refrigerator,

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:02.960
the icebox of his family.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.360
Several maids quit over this.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.160
The house smelled of taxidermy.
He had formaldehyde everywhere.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.860
This was a young boy
who was fascinated by

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.630
the idea of the museum
and nature,

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:17.400
but all of this is preliminary.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.460
It wasn't until he went
out to Dakota in 1883

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.730
that Roosevelt really
started to understand

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.760
what was at stake in the debate

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.560
about the future of nature
in this country.

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.060
COYOTE: "When I hear about
the destruction of a species,"

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.530
he said, "I feel
just as if the works

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:41.330
"of some great writer
had perished."

01:03:41.330 --> 01:03:43.500
JENKINSON: I think it can
be said that Roosevelt invented

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.760
the national wildlife
refuge system.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.600
This was done
by executive order alone.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.700
A national park
needs to be voted on

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.430
by a majority
in two houses of Congress.

01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:55.730
Roosevelt said to his
attorney general Philander Knox,

01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:57.060
"Is there anything
that would prevent me

01:03:57.060 --> 01:04:00.260
"from naming Pelican Island
on the Indian River in Florida

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.600
"a national bird sanctuary?"

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.500
and Knox, the Attorney General,
said, "No, nothing."

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.060
And so Roosevelt said,
"I do declare it."

01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:11.100
COYOTE: When Roosevelt
arrived in Yellowstone,

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.300
he was in the middle
of a national tour

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:15.760
unprecedented in its ambition.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.660
14,000 grueling miles.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:23.200
25 states.
150 towns and cities.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.460
More than 200 speeches
in the space of 8 weeks.

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.360
From the day he left Washington,

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:33.760
he had been looking forward
to some time off in Yellowstone,

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.730
and immediately
upon his arrival,

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:37.930
he set off on horseback
with the Army's

01:04:37.930 --> 01:04:41.130
acting park superintendent
as his host,

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:42.830
leaving the rest
of the presidential

01:04:42.830 --> 01:04:44.330
entourage behind,

01:04:44.330 --> 01:04:48.000
including his staff,
his Secret Service men,

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.500
his physician, and all
the reporters covering the trip.

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.960
"As far as the world at large
is concerned,"

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.430
his private secretary
told the press,

01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:59.800
"The president will be lost."

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.030
Only John Burroughs,
the popular nature writer,

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.560
was allowed to come along.

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:09.460
The summer tourist season
was still two months away,

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.260
so Roosevelt had Yellowstone
essentially to himself.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.730
He loved every minute of it.

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:23.100
He delighted in seeing
so many animals--

01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:25.660
herds of mule deer
and whitetails

01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:29.330
and pronghorn antelope,
flocks of bighorn sheep.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:32.600
He watched an eagle swoop down

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.930
to try to capture
a yearling elk,

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:38.660
saw cougars feasting
on the carcasses of their prey,

01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:41.130
spent 4 hours one afternoon

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:43.200
looking through
his field glasses,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.300
trying to count all the elk
within sight,

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:49.930
ultimately estimating them
to number 3,000.

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:56.860
On Easter morning, the President
of the United States

01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.530
insisted on leaving the campsite
entirely on his own.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.760
He tramped 18 miles
over rough ground

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.500
in order to sneak up
to within 50 yards

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.000
of another elk herd,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.960
sat down on a rock, and gazed
rapturously upon them

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:18.360
while he ate his lunch
of hardtack and sardines.

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.230
One morning,
President Roosevelt was shaving,

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:24.730
and he had lathered up his face
with shaving cream,

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:26.560
and he was shaving himself
in the wilderness

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:27.800
with a little mirror,

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.060
when somebody came in and said,

01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:30.800
"There are bighorn sheep
out there

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:32.930
"and they're
coming down this cliff."

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:35.630
So, Roosevelt said, "By Godfrey,
I have to see that,"

01:06:35.630 --> 01:06:38.300
and he jumps up with
half of his face clean-shaven

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.060
and the other half
full of lather

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:42.160
and runs out into nature to see

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:46.900
the bighorn sheep coming down
this nearly sheer cliff.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:50.000
And Burroughs said, "What kind
of president is this?"

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.600
He's just an overgrown boy who's
so enthusiastic about nature

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.360
that it infects
everyone around him

01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:00.400
with a new enthusiasm
for the natural world.

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:05.100
COYOTE: Roosevelt
was witnessing firsthand

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.860
the results of the wildlife
protection bill

01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:12.000
he and George Bird Grinnell
and Congressman John Lacey

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.860
had worked so hard to pass.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:17.760
The game animals were now
much more numerous,

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.160
he assured Burroughs,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.800
than when he had last visited
the park 12 years earlier.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:27.700
Still, the president was itching
to shoot something.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:34.260
SCHULLERY: Roosevelt will always
baffle people who don't hunt

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:38.130
because he both loved animals
and loved hunting them,

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:41.000
and in Yellowstone,
what he really wanted to do

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.560
was shoot a mountain lion.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:48.600
At the time, park managers
were killing predators.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.130
It was something
that was going on anyway.

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:55.700
And so to Roosevelt's mind,
"Well, why not me?"

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:59.530
COYOTE: The president's
advisers thought

01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:02.230
killing any animal
in a national park

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:03.800
would be bad politics

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.930
and quietly dissuaded him.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.400
In all, Roosevelt spent
two weeks in Yellowstone,

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:17.330
including several days traveling
in a horse-drawn sleigh

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:19.000
to the park's interior,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.830
still covered in some places
by up to 6 feet of snow.

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:27.430
He saw the Norris geyser basin
and Old Faithful

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:29.860
and skied to the rim
of the Grand Canyon

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.060
of the Yellowstone.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.830
But these wonders held
only passing interest to him

01:08:35.830 --> 01:08:38.200
compared to the park's wildlife.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.530
In addition
to the larger animals,

01:08:41.530 --> 01:08:44.200
he recorded sightings
of pine squirrels

01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.730
and snowshoe hares

01:08:45.730 --> 01:08:48.000
and scores of different birds,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.760
including a pygmy owl,
the first he had ever seen.

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:56.600
"He responded with boyish glee,"
Burroughs wrote.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.000
"I think the president
was as pleased

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.630
"as if we had bagged
some big game."

01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.260
At one point,
Roosevelt sees a mouse

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.630
that he thinks
is new to science,

01:09:06.630 --> 01:09:09.230
so he jumps off the sleigh
and grabs it with his hand

01:09:09.230 --> 01:09:11.700
and kills it and then stuffs it.

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.300
MAN AS JOHN BURROUGHS:
While we all went fishing

01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.330
in the afternoon,
the president skinned his mouse

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:21.330
and prepared the pelt
for Washington.

01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:24.160
It was done as neatly
as a professed taxidermist

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.160
would have done it.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:29.330
This was the only game
the president killed

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:31.360
in the park.

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.500
John Burroughs.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.300
COYOTE: On April 24, at the end
of Roosevelt's visit,

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:49.230
the entire population of
the town of Gardiner, Montana,

01:09:49.230 --> 01:09:51.730
gathered at the park's
north entrance

01:09:51.730 --> 01:09:53.230
for a special ceremony.

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:58.100
A new arch to welcome visitors
to Yellowstone

01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.660
was under construction,

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.730
and the president
had agreed to speak

01:10:01.730 --> 01:10:04.060
at the laying
of the arch's cornerstone.

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:08.460
For the occasion,
Roosevelt reluctantly

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.800
changed out of his
camping clothes,

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.300
put on a business suit,

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.960
and rode through town
to the awaiting crowd.

01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:21.230
He watched as the cornerstone
was carefully put into place,

01:10:21.230 --> 01:10:23.430
then climbed to a rough platform

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.530
on the stonework
of the incomplete pillar

01:10:26.530 --> 01:10:28.000
and began to speak.

01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:34.300
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
The Yellowstone Park

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:37.230
is something absolutely unique
in the world,

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.460
so far as I know.

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:43.200
This park was created
and is now administered

01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.100
for the benefit and enjoyment
of the people.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.800
The scheme of its preservation

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.260
is noteworthy in its
essential democracy.

01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:56.900
The only way that
the people as a whole

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:59.960
can secure to themselves
and their children

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.160
the enjoyment in perpetuity

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.830
of what the Yellowstone park
has to give

01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:08.800
is by assuming ownership
in the name of the nation

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.000
and jealously safeguarding
and preserving

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.160
the scenery, the forests,
and the wild creatures.

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.300
JENKINSON: Roosevelt argued
that the parks

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:24.700
are a democratic experience.

01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.260
That was his essential argument
about the national parks,

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:32.400
that the rich people
always have their playgrounds,

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.530
they know how
to amuse themselves,

01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:37.000
and that America
as a classless society

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.500
or at least a society
that would like to be classless

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.530
needs to have places where
regular human beings can go

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:47.000
and stand side by side
with the rich and privileged

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.500
and enjoy the same experience

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.200
and not be made to feel
that they are somehow less.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.600
And so his primary argument
was that the national parks

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.700
are a democratic experiment
in nature.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.730
COYOTE: Before he got
back on the train

01:12:02.730 --> 01:12:04.400
to resume his trip,

01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.900
Roosevelt also
deliberately quoted

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:10.160
from the act of Congress
that had made Yellowstone

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:12.930
the world's first
national park--

01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:16.230
"for the benefit and enjoyment
of the people."

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:22.430
Later, when the arch
was finally completed,

01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:26.430
that phrase would be permanently
carved into its mantle

01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:29.300
so that everyone
who entered Yellowstone

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:33.060
would be reminded of why
the park was there

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.230
and for whom.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:42.460
JOHNSON: I remember the first
time I arrived in Yellowstone,

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:44.800
I got off the bus right outside
the north entrance,

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:48.200
where there's that wonderful
stone arch that says

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.430
"For the benefit and enjoyment
of the people."

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:53.730
It doesn't say,
"For the benefit and enjoyment

01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.130
"of some of the people,
or a few of the people."

01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:57.500
It says, "All of the people,"

01:12:57.500 --> 01:12:59.430
and for me,
that meant democracy,

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:01.130
and for me,
that meant I was welcome,

01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:02.900
and I stepped outside,
and as I was

01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.560
stepping down onto the ground,

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.700
there was bison, a 2,000-pound
animal walking by,

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.160
and there was
no one else around.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.000
The bison was just strolling by.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.860
And I looked up at the driver
and I said,

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:15.260
"Does this happen all the time?"

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:17.830
and he looked at me and said,
"All the time."

01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:20.260
And I said to myself,
"I've arrived,"

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.400
and I can't imagine being
in any other place,

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.260
and to be honest with you,
once I stepped off that bus,

01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.530
I never got back on.

01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:28.460
[Whistle blows]

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.400
COYOTE: Two weeks
after leaving Yellowstone,

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.660
Roosevelt's whirlwind tour
brought him

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.800
to Arizona's Grand Canyon

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.430
for a brief stop on the way

01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:56.100
from New Mexico
to southern California.

01:13:57.660 --> 01:14:00.800
Roosevelt had never before seen
the Grand Canyon,

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:04.600
and he was overwhelmed by
the vista from the south rim.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.060
He longed to spend
more time there,

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:10.230
but his schedule permitted
only this quick visit

01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:13.530
and a few remarks to the crowd
that had gathered to greet him.

01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:18.130
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT: I
want to ask you to do one thing

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:19.660
in connection with it

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:22.800
in your own interest and in
the interest of the country.

01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:30.060
Keep this great wonder of nature
as it now is.

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:37.430
Leave it as it is.
You cannot improve it.

01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:42.260
The ages have been at work on it
and man can only mar it.

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.300
What you can do is to keep it
for your children,

01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:51.430
your children's children,
and for all who come after you

01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:55.300
as one of the great sights
which every American,

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:58.300
if he can travel at all,
should see.

01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.060
JENKINSON: The great statement
in this speech is

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:06.100
"Leave it as it is.

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:09.930
"The ages have been
at work on it

01:15:09.930 --> 01:15:11.900
"and man can only mar it."

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.830
Nothing has ever been said
about the national parks

01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:17.060
as fine as that.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.400
The idea for Roosevelt
was that humans have an itch

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.730
to change things...

01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:26.660
but the beauty
of the Grand Canyon

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.930
is when you look at it
and you see nothing

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:30.900
that humans have constructed.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.760
It's a magnificent thing
that he said,

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.200
and if that were the one
wilderness statement

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.260
of American life,

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:43.100
I believe
it's greater than Thoreau.

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.930
I believe that it's
greater than John Muir.

01:15:46.930 --> 01:15:49.830
"Leave it as it is.
The ages have been at work on it

01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:52.300
"and man can only mar it"

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.530
should be the motto in front
of every national park

01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:56.200
in the country.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:57.660
And if you think
that this was said

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:02.700
by a man on a 14,000-mile trip
in which he gave 262 speeches

01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:04.300
more or less
off the top of his head

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:07.100
on seeing the Grand Canyon
for the first time,

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:09.660
you realize what
presidential greatness can be.

01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:17.230
COYOTE: Then Roosevelt
was gone...

01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:19.900
and by the next day, he was

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.400
whistle-stopping his way
through California,

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.800
giving 2 to 3 speeches a day,

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:27.760
attending banquets and dinners
in his honor,

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.260
presiding at dedications
and groundbreakings,

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:35.360
setting the frenetic pace
that had become his hallmark.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:40.800
[Bird cawing]

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.800
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
Nothing can be done well

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:45.630
at a speed of 40 miles a day.

01:16:45.630 --> 01:16:47.730
Far more time should be taken.

01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:51.860
Walk away quietly
in any direction

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.530
and taste the freedom
of the mountaineer.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.560
Climb the mountains
and get their good tidings.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.460
Nature's peace
will flow into you

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:07.200
as sunshine flows into trees.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.160
The winds will blow their own
freshness into you

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.830
and the storms their energy

01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:17.160
while cares will drop off
like autumn leaves.

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:25.360
COYOTE: By 1903,
John Muir was 65

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:28.000
and more famous than ever.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.800
Mountain peaks and canyons,
campsites and glaciers

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.500
now bore his name.

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:39.660
Magazine editors besieged him
with requests for articles.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:43.230
The Sierra Club he had founded
was growing steadily,

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:46.060
and the hikes he personally led
into the mountains

01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:48.960
were always the club's
most heavily attended.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:54.330
People loved to hear him preach
his deeply held gospel

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:57.300
that salvation could be found
through immersion

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:58.700
in the natural world.

01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:02.630
WOMAN: John Muir was there,

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:05.560
mounted on the horse
which he rode now and then,

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.800
when no woman would accept
the loan of it.

01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:12.530
He was rapt, entranced.

01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:15.160
He threw up his arms
in a grand gesture.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.200
"This is the morning
of creation," he cried.

01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:21.100
"The whole thing
is beginning now."

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.260
"The mountains
are singing together."

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.900
Harriet Monroe.

01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:32.230
COYOTE: For nearly a decade now,

01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:35.200
he had been struggling to have
the Yosemite Valley

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.700
given back to
the federal government

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.500
and made part of the larger
Yosemite National Park.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:44.260
But nothing he seemed
to say or do

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.860
had proven successful.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.060
Things remained at a standstill
in the spring of 1903,

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.960
as Muir prepared to leave his
home in Martinez, California,

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.060
and embark on a trip to Europe
and Asia with some friends.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.900
Suddenly, his plans changed.

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.000
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: An influential
man from Washington

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.860
wants to make a trip
into the Sierra with me,

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:12.660
and I might be able to do some
forest good,

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:15.230
in freely talking
around the campfire.

01:19:18.930 --> 01:19:20.300
COYOTE: It was the president,

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.560
still working his way up
through California,

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:27.230
asking Muir to accompany him
during a visit to Yosemite.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.030
"I do not want
anyone with me but you,"

01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:32.400
Roosevelt had written.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.230
"I want to drop
politics absolutely

01:19:35.230 --> 01:19:38.030
"and just be out in the open
with you."

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:44.600
Muir realized this was
the opportunity of a lifetime.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:47.900
He purchased a brand-new
woolen suit for the occasion

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:50.700
and hurried to join
the presidential entourage.

01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:57.260
On May 15, they set off for
the Mariposa Grove of big trees

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.400
in a flurry of activity.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:03.960
A long caravan of wagons filled
with staff and dignitaries,

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.700
a detachment
of 30 buffalo soldiers

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.700
riding along as escorts.

01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:13.730
Muir soon found himself seated
in the president's coach

01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:16.160
along with the governor
of California,

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:19.730
the Secretary of the Navy,
the Surgeon General,

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:21.430
two college presidents,

01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:23.900
and Roosevelt's
personal secretary.

01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.400
It was hardly the trip
he had been promised,

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:31.530
but Muir tried his best
to squeeze in words

01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:33.330
to the president and governor

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:37.830
about the issue of making
all of Yosemite a national park.

01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:43.430
In the grove of mighty sequoias,

01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:47.130
the president's group paused,
as all tourists did,

01:20:47.130 --> 01:20:51.360
for a snapshot at the famous
Wawona tunnel tree,

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:54.500
and later, they posed
for an official photograph,

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.460
lined up along the base
of the Grizzly Giant,

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:01.100
the oldest and most famous
sequoia in Yosemite,

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:05.060
estimated to be 2,700 years old

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:11.260
and boasting a single branch
that was 6 1/2 feet in diameter.

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:15.460
Then the troops, the phalanx
of reporters and photographers,

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.800
and virtually all
of the official party

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:20.060
headed back to the Wawona Hotel,

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:23.160
where a series of receptions
and a grand dinner

01:21:23.160 --> 01:21:25.230
were scheduled
in the president's honor

01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:26.560
that evening.

01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:33.100
None of them knew that Roosevelt
had no intention of attending.

01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:37.630
Instead, he remained behind
with only John Muir

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:39.660
and a few park employees,

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:41.630
who started preparing a camp

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:44.160
at the base
of one of the sequoias,

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.330
part of a secret plan
Roosevelt had hatched

01:21:47.330 --> 01:21:50.200
to allow him time
alone with the trees

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.830
and the man who
considered them sacred.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.230
They built a fire
and sat around it,

01:21:57.230 --> 01:22:02.300
eating a simple supper, talking
as twilight enveloped them,

01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:06.030
getting to know one another
in the glow of the blaze.

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.100
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
The night was clear,

01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:14.130
and in the darkening aisles
of the great sequoia grove,

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:18.160
the majestic trunks,
beautiful in color and symmetry,

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:22.230
rose around us like the pillars
of a mightier cathedral

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:26.730
than ever was conceived even by
the fervor of the Middle Ages.

01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:31.330
Hermit thrushes sang beautifully
in the evening.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.900
JENKINSON: And Muir said,

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.030
"I fell in love with this
Theodore Roosevelt."

01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:38.800
I mean, he actually
used those words.

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:42.160
"You can't resist this man.
I fell in love with him."

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.360
Roosevelt, interestingly enough,

01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:46.260
came back and complained
a little bit about Muir

01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:48.630
and said, "He doesn't know
his bird songs."

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:49.960
Roosevelt's an ornithologist.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.160
He knows everything there is
to know about birds.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.130
But Muir also got one off
on Roosevelt.

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:57.360
He said to him, "Mr. President,

01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.160
"when are you going to get over
this infantile need you have

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:02.660
"to kill animals?"

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:05.230
Roosevelt would not have taken
that from any other human being.

01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:09.560
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: I had a
perfectly glorious time

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:12.100
with the president
and the mountains.

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.300
I never before
had a more interesting,

01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:17.460
hearty, and manly companion.

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:21.600
I stuffed him pretty well
regarding the timber thieves

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.630
and other spoilers
of the forest.

01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:27.930
COYOTE: Long after sundown,

01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:31.530
with no tent and only
a pile of army blankets,

01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.730
the two men finally
went to sleep.

01:23:33.730 --> 01:23:36.360
[Owl hooting]

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.830
[Horse whinnying]

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:40.700
COYOTE: The next morning
at 6:30,

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:44.030
they saddled up for the long
ride to Yosemite Valley,

01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:46.900
with the guide under
strict orders from the president

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:50.530
to avoid at all costs
the Wawona Hotel

01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:54.500
and the delegation of officials
he had jilted the night before.

01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:00.200
In the high country
near Glacier Point,

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:03.000
with its spectacular panorama
of the valley

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.900
and its waterfalls
arrayed at their feet,

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:08.460
they stopped and once more
made camp

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:12.260
at a spot their guide--
Charlie Leidig--had picked out.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.800
MAN AS CHARLIE LEIDIG: Around
the campfire, Roosevelt and Muir

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.260
talked far into the night
regarding Muir's glacial theory

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:24.360
of the formation
of Yosemite Valley.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.930
They also talked a great deal

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:28.800
about the protection
of forests in general

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.800
and Yosemite in particular.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.960
I heard them discussing
the setting aside

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:39.960
of other areas in the United
States for park purposes.

01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.800
There was some difficulty
in their campfire conversation

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.660
because both men wanted
to do the talking.

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:53.000
COYOTE: They awoke
the next morning,

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.500
covered by a light snow that
had fallen in the high country

01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.800
during the night.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:00.230
Rather than
feeling inconvenienced,

01:25:00.230 --> 01:25:02.730
the president couldn't
have been more delighted.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.360
"We slept in a snowstorm
last night,"

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.130
he exclaimed to the crowds

01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:11.530
that had been patiently waiting
for him on the valley floor.

01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:15.800
"This," he said, "has been
the grandest day of my life."

01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:20.730
After camping one more night
alone with Muir,

01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:23.360
the president was
picked up and escorted

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.760
back to the train station
for the resumption

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.560
of his cross-country tour.

01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:32.800
And when he spoke at
the state capital in Sacramento

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.060
a day later,

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.530
Roosevelt's words sounded
as if they could have come

01:25:37.530 --> 01:25:40.760
from the lips of John Muir.

01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:42.660
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
Lying out at night under those

01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:48.060
sequoias was lying in a temple
built by no hand of man.

01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:52.400
A temple grander than
any human architect

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.430
could by any possibility build,

01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:59.460
and I hope for the preservation
of the groves of giant trees

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.160
simply because it would be
a shame to our civilization

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.760
to let them disappear.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.760
They are monuments
in themselves.

01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.560
I want them preserved.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:18.100
We are not building
this country of ours for a day.

01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:20.360
It is to last through the ages.

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:25.860
COYOTE: Within 3 years,
the California legislature

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.900
and United States Congress

01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:30.930
approved the transfer
of the Yosemite Valley

01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:33.160
and Mariposa big trees

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:35.160
back to the federal government.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:43.030
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: I am now
an experienced lobbyist.

01:26:43.030 --> 01:26:45.600
My political education
is complete.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.300
Have attended the legislature,

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:53.230
made speeches,
explained, exhorted,

01:26:53.230 --> 01:26:56.400
persuaded every mother's son
of the legislators,

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.100
newspaper reporters,
and everybody else

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.230
who would listen to me.

01:27:01.230 --> 01:27:03.300
And now that
the fight is finished

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:07.930
and my education as a politician
and lobbyist is finished,

01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:10.300
I am almost finished myself.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:14.500
COYOTE: Yosemite National Park

01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:16.800
now encompassed
almost everything

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.330
Muir had been fighting for.

01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:21.830
"Sound the timbrel,"
he wrote a friend,

01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:26.530
"and let every Yosemite
tree and stream rejoice."

01:27:29.530 --> 01:27:31.200
JOHNSON: I remember one
day I was walking

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.630
in the Cook's Meadow,

01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:35.330
which is the meadow in the
central part of Yosemite Valley,

01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:37.360
and there was a woman there,

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.430
and she was just looking
up and around her

01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:44.060
and she just kept saying,
"Oh. Oh, my.

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.500
"Oh, my."

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:47.200
I looked at her, I said,
"Ma'am, are you all right?"

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.560
She said, "Yes, I'm just fine.
I just--oh."

01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:54.030
I didn't have to talk
to her about

01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:55.660
the transcendent experience.

01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:58.560
She was having one, and it
wasn't a transcendent experience

01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.430
because it was a national park.

01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:02.700
It was transcendent because
it was Yosemite Valley.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.960
But because it had become
a national park,

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:07.530
she could have
that transcendent experience.

01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:11.830
And that's commonplace
in Yosemite.

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:13.960
And where else can you get
an experience like that?

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:31.000
[Bird cawing]

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:35.730
WOMAN: In other parts
of the world,

01:28:35.730 --> 01:28:38.000
there are certain areas
that are preserved

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.160
because some rich nobleman
out of the goodness of his heart

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.330
decided to decree it.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.530
But in the United States,
you don't have to be

01:28:49.530 --> 01:28:53.730
dependent on some rich guy
being generous to you.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.900
To me that's what
national parks mean.

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:01.730
It's a symbol of democracy,
democracy when it works well.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.430
At its best.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:09.460
COYOTE: Back in 1870,

01:29:09.460 --> 01:29:13.900
a 15-year-old boy in Kansas
was idly reading the newspaper

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:16.730
that had been used
to wrap his lunch.

01:29:16.730 --> 01:29:18.260
He came across an article

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:21.260
about a mysterious sunken lake
in Oregon

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:23.360
and he vowed to visit it
one day.

01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:28.360
It would take
William Gladstone Steel

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:30.600
15 years to get there.

01:29:32.500 --> 01:29:35.000
MAN AS WILLIAM STEEL:
Imagine a vast mountain,

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.200
6 by 7 miles through,

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.760
at an elevation of 8,000 feet
with the top removed

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:44.000
and the inside hollowed out,

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.760
then filled with the clearest
water in the world,

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.330
and you have
a perfect representation

01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:51.530
of Crater Lake.

01:29:53.630 --> 01:29:55.560
COYOTE: When a volcanic eruption

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.760
witnessed by the ancestors
of the Klamath Indians

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:05.000
blew the top off a mountain peak
in the Cascades 7,700 years ago,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.900
the hole that was left
began slowly filling

01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:10.800
with each year's rainfall
and snowmelt.

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.560
The result was Crater Lake--

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.700
at 1,942 feet, the deepest lake
in America.

01:30:20.700 --> 01:30:24.030
Because it is filled
almost entirely by snowfall,

01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:26.900
the lake is also
the world's clearest.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:30.830
An 8-inch disc lowered
into its sky-blue waters

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:35.300
is still visible 142 feet
below the surface.

01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:41.100
William Steel resolved that
it should be protected forever,

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:44.130
just like Yellowstone
and the other parks.

01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.900
That quest took him
another 17 years

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:51.560
of tireless promotion
and lobbying

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:54.930
before he finally succeeded
in 1902,

01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:57.360
when Crater Lake
became the nation's

01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.400
sixth national park.

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:02.930
And it had all happened

01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:06.060
because of this accidental
lunchtime reading

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:09.400
32 years earlier.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.930
DUNCAN: The parks, they're
the greatest spots on earth,

01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:15.200
wonderful natural places,

01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.130
but the story of national parks

01:31:17.130 --> 01:31:19.600
really isn't a story
about the place.

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:22.760
It's--it's the story of people

01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:25.730
who fell in love
with those places,

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:28.830
people who became
so devoted to them

01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:32.160
that they wanted to do anything
they could to save them.

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.930
SMITH: Richard Wetherill.

01:31:40.930 --> 01:31:43.200
He's broadening out
from Mesa Verde.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.760
He wants to make people aware

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:47.100
that we have such a treasure,
such a heritage here,

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.630
and yet here's this cowboy.

01:31:49.630 --> 01:31:51.530
A cowboy, and we all know
what cowboys are.

01:31:51.530 --> 01:31:53.100
We read in our dime novels.

01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:55.000
They can't be doing
anything scholarly.

01:31:57.060 --> 01:31:59.730
COYOTE: Despite his lack
of formal education,

01:31:59.730 --> 01:32:02.430
Richard Wetherill wanted to be
taken seriously

01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:04.430
as an archaeologist.

01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:08.300
He had left Mesa Verde
and began scouring the Southwest

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:10.030
in search of other ruins.

01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:16.930
His journey took him from
Colorado to Utah and Arizona

01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:21.760
and finally to New Mexico,
to a place called Chaco Canyon.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:24.430
another eerily silent
set of ruins

01:32:24.430 --> 01:32:27.360
left behind
by the ancient Puebloans.

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:32.830
With walls
of remarkable workmanship,

01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:35.100
some rising 5 stories,

01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:37.730
Pueblo Bonito, the biggest ruin,

01:32:37.730 --> 01:32:40.800
contained remnants
of an enclosed plaza,

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.730
35 circular kivas,

01:32:43.730 --> 01:32:48.330
more than 2 acres
honeycombed by 650 rooms,

01:32:48.330 --> 01:32:52.460
connected by small
passageways and doors.

01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:55.900
The religious and cultural hub
of the civilization

01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.360
that had dominated
the surrounding region

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.530
between 850 A.D. and 1200 A.D.

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:07.230
By itself, Pueblo Bonito
was several times larger

01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:09.130
than anything at Mesa Verde

01:33:09.130 --> 01:33:11.400
and it sat in the midst
of an array

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.200
of nearly a dozen other
significant ruins.

01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:18.400
Wetherill moved there
with his wife Marietta,

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:20.060
filed a homestead claim,

01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:24.500
and hired nearly 100 Navajos
to help with the excavations.

01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:30.660
Though Wetherill tried
to carry on his work

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:33.860
as carefully and scientifically
as possible,

01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:36.960
professional archaeologists
still dismissed him

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.130
as a pothunter.

01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:41.360
And as the relics
he was unearthing

01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360
reached eastern museums,

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:48.300
50,000 pieces of turquoise,
10,000 pieces of pottery,

01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:51.400
5,000 stone implements,
and much more,

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.330
they clamored for the government
to do something to stop him.

01:33:56.730 --> 01:33:58.500
SMITH: Richard Wetherill
was very careful

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:00.730
identifying everything he found.

01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:04.230
He was ahead of
the professional archaeologists,

01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:06.500
which is an oxymoron
at that time,

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:07.860
but he was ahead of them,

01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.530
and I think they were
jealous of him.

01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.530
There's a snobbishness.

01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:14.430
Educated Easterners
can't believe

01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:17.460
that a western cowboy could
possibly be doing these things.

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:21.160
COYOTE: For his part,
Wetherill said,

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.100
he would gladly turn over
any portions of Chaco Canyon

01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.700
if the federal government
would simply do something

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:29.860
to protect them.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.360
But the criticism
of Wetherill's work

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:35.000
would not go away.

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:38.900
[Bird cawing]

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:41.330
COYOTE: Meanwhile,
back at Mesa Verde,

01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:46.000
the ruins Wetherill had first
discovered were in danger.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.730
Thieves, pot hunters,
and tourists

01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:50.430
were flocking to the site,

01:34:50.430 --> 01:34:54.460
looting the artifacts,
damaging the ancient structures,

01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:57.830
sometimes even setting off
sticks of dynamite

01:34:57.830 --> 01:35:00.500
simply to frighten away
the rattlesnakes.

01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:05.900
Now a new group
had taken up the cause

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.930
of protecting its treasures.

01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:13.900
WOMAN: Mesa Verde
seems to be set apart

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.260
for a park,

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.960
and to make and keep it as such

01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:22.500
is the aim of the Colorado
Cliff Dwellings Association

01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:24.700
of Women.

01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.000
Virginia McClurg.

01:35:29.130 --> 01:35:31.960
COYOTE: Virginia McClurg
was a well-known lecturer

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:34.430
with a seemingly
boundless determination

01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:36.260
to leave her mark on the world.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.230
She gathered a group of women

01:35:39.230 --> 01:35:42.660
into the Colorado
Cliff Dwellings Association,

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.400
organized petitions,

01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:46.730
wrote personal letters
to the president,

01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:49.130
held rummage sales,
and solicited

01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:52.060
10-cent contributions
from other women's groups

01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:54.300
across the country.

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:55.800
And it was working.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:57.930
Support for protecting
Mesa Verde

01:35:57.930 --> 01:36:00.930
had become a national cause.

01:36:00.930 --> 01:36:03.930
But just when Congress
seemed ready to act,

01:36:03.930 --> 01:36:06.300
it became clear
to those around her

01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.900
that Virginia McClurg
had a different vision

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.860
of how Mesa Verde
should be preserved.

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.960
WOMAN AS VIRGINIA McCLURG:
I do not see why

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:18.760
this small and compact tract
in the proposed park

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.160
should not be under
the protective care

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:26.030
of a body of 125 women
with hereditary membership

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:29.830
who know more about the matter
and care about the matter

01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:31.560
than anyone else.

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:36.760
Virginia became
so engrossed in it

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:40.560
that it suddenly was not
our park as a nation,

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.830
it was her park.

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:45.760
COYOTE: Twice McClurg
even negotiated leases

01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:48.630
between her group
and the Ute Indians

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:51.330
only to have the federal
government remind her

01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:55.500
that private citizens
cannot make treaties.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.400
The uproar she created

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.730
threatened to derail
the bill in Congress

01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:03.430
at the very moment it seemed
headed for passage.

01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:05.700
Even some of her closest allies

01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:08.400
now suspected
that Virginia McClurg

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.500
had lost sight of the real goal.

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:16.560
Lucy Peabody, the association's
vice regent,

01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:20.960
had preferred to get results
rather than grab headlines.

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.930
She believed that
only as a national park

01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:28.260
could Mesa Verde be properly
saved for future generations,

01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:32.230
and now felt compelled to resign
from the association.

01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.430
With her went
many other members,

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:39.000
including some of the group's
most nationally prominent women.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.660
McClurg, once the darling
of the press,

01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:48.330
found herself disparaged
in newspaper editorials.

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.900
SMITH: There was a sadness
in all this.

01:37:51.900 --> 01:37:55.360
At the moment of your greatest
achievement, you lose it.

01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.900
I--I think it's
a normal reaction.

01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:00.960
This becomes
so possessive with her

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.060
that to have it within
your grasp, right there,

01:38:04.060 --> 01:38:05.130
and it's gone.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:10.000
COYOTE: On June 29, 1906,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.030
President Roosevelt
signed the law

01:38:12.030 --> 01:38:15.000
creating Mesa Verde
National Park,

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.860
the first of its kind,

01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:20.600
meant to celebrate
not majestic natural scenery

01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.960
but a prehistoric culture
and its people.

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.930
With Mesa Verde protected,

01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:35.630
anger over
Richard Wetherill's excavations

01:38:35.630 --> 01:38:39.260
at Chaco Canyon in New Mexico
boiled over

01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:42.660
and set in motion events
that would change the course

01:38:42.660 --> 01:38:43.900
of park history.

01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:47.700
SMITH: The bill for Mesa Verde
was just for Mesa Verde,

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:50.100
but what about the other ruins?

01:38:50.100 --> 01:38:52.000
There's sites all over
the Southwest,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.360
and the same thing's
happening there.

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:58.230
COYOTE: Once more,
Representative John F. Lacey

01:38:58.230 --> 01:39:02.730
came to the rescue of places
nowhere near and nothing like

01:39:02.730 --> 01:39:04.000
his native Iowa.

01:39:05.260 --> 01:39:07.630
He sponsored a new bill to make

01:39:07.630 --> 01:39:11.860
any unauthorized disturbance
of any prehistoric ruin

01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:13.260
a federal crime.

01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.100
The act for the preservation
of American antiquities

01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:21.130
also granted the president
of the United States

01:39:21.130 --> 01:39:24.160
an extraordinary power:

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:28.200
the exclusive authority without
any Congressional approval

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.960
to set aside places
that would be called

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:34.500
not national parks
but national monuments.

01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:38.530
MAN: John F. Lacey
gave the president

01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:41.000
the greatest power a president
could ever have

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
for the preservation of nature,

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.200
which allowed the president
to do

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.060
something as simple
as pick up a pen

01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.260
and declare an area
of the public domain

01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.600
a national monument,

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.330
and since Teddy Roosevelt
happened to be

01:39:55.330 --> 01:39:57.100
the president at the time,

01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.260
was that a gift or what?

01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:01.130
Bully. Delighted.

01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.300
Teddy Roosevelt
picked up that pen

01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:06.630
and started creating
national monuments

01:40:06.630 --> 01:40:08.960
and the country would
never be the same again.

01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:15.500
COYOTE: Roosevelt quickly
put his new powers to use.

01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:19.630
He proclaimed the first
national monument,

01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:24.800
a unique mass of grooved rock
sacred to several Indian tribes

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:29.360
rising nearly 900 feet above
the plains of eastern Wyoming.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.800
It was called Devil's Tower.

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:37.260
Then he named El Morro
National Monument in New Mexico,

01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:41.400
a rock abutment bearing
prehistoric Indian petroglyphs

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:45.430
as well as the inscriptions
of early Spanish expeditions

01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:49.400
that had come north from Mexico
300 years earlier

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.100
and founded a colony 15 years
before the Pilgrims

01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:54.930
landed at Plymouth Rock.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.530
And on March 11, 1907,

01:41:00.530 --> 01:41:03.700
he did exactly what
Richard Wetherill had wanted

01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:07.300
and created Chaco Canyon
National Monument.

01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:12.160
Roosevelt would also
use the antiquities act

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.660
to protect an endangered grove
of coastal redwoods

01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:17.700
north of San Francisco

01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:21.730
named in honor of the man who
had first introduced Roosevelt

01:41:21.730 --> 01:41:24.000
to the giant trees--

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.230
Muir Woods.

01:41:28.230 --> 01:41:31.530
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: The man of
science, the naturalist,

01:41:31.530 --> 01:41:34.900
too often loses sight
of the essential oneness

01:41:34.900 --> 01:41:36.230
of all living beings

01:41:36.230 --> 01:41:39.300
in seeking to classify
them in kingdoms,

01:41:39.300 --> 01:41:41.500
orders, species, etc.

01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:46.930
While the eye of the poet,
the seer,

01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:50.860
never closes on the kinship
of all God's creatures.

01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:53.400
And his heart
ever beats in sympathy

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.760
with great and small alike

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:59.460
as Earth-borne companions
and fellow mortals

01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:03.130
equally dependent on Heaven's
eternal love.

01:42:07.900 --> 01:42:12.830
COYOTE: In 1905, John Muir's
life had been beset by sorrow.

01:42:12.830 --> 01:42:16.430
His devoted life Louie
died of lung cancer

01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:18.730
and he buried her
next to her parents

01:42:18.730 --> 01:42:20.760
near an orchard on their farm.

01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:25.900
President Roosevelt,
who had lost his first wife

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.100
as a young man,

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:30.960
and then found solace
in the open spaces of the west,

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:34.260
sent his personal condolences.

01:42:34.260 --> 01:42:38.030
"Get out among the mountains
and trees, friend," he wrote.

01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:41.830
"They will do more for you than
either man or woman could."

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:46.060
But the aging mountaineer
went instead

01:42:46.060 --> 01:42:48.000
to the deserts of Arizona,

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.360
where it was hoped
his daughter Helen

01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.230
might recover from pneumonia.

01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:57.760
In his grief, he began exploring
the surrounding area

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:01.430
and discovered that in fact
he was, once again,

01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:03.500
in a majestic forest,

01:43:03.500 --> 01:43:07.500
only this one was
200 million years old

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:11.160
and all of the trees
had long ago fossilized

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.530
into solid rock.

01:43:13.530 --> 01:43:15.700
It was the petrified forest.

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:24.260
EHRLICH: I think parks represent
the wildness inside us.

01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:29.360
They're the place
where we can be lonely,

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:32.060
where we can
experience solitude.

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:39.530
They're a place we go to
as refuge, as sanctuary.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:45.300
It's a place we go out to
to come back in.

01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:49.300
It's the only place perhaps left
in many people's lives

01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:50.700
where that's possible.

01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.000
COYOTE: Soon, Muir was
himself again,

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:00.930
sometimes taking total strangers
on long walks

01:44:00.930 --> 01:44:03.800
through the tumbled and broken
stone trees.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.960
In what he now called

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.960
"these enchanted
carboniferous forests,"

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.830
he loved nothing more
than to sit

01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:14.430
near the trunk
of a petrified tree

01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:17.700
and inspect it minutely
with a magnifying glass.

01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.560
But even this forest
was endangered.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:26.060
Scavengers used dynamite
to blow up large logs

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:29.860
in hopes of finding
amethyst crystals inside them.

01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:33.760
Boxcar loads of petrified wood
were being shipped east

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.500
to be made into tabletops
and mantelpieces.

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:40.360
An enormous stone crusher
was being constructed

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.700
to pulverize the logs for use
as industrial abrasives.

01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:51.130
For years, John F. Lacey had
been trying to protect the area

01:44:51.130 --> 01:44:53.700
by making it a national park.

01:44:53.700 --> 01:44:56.560
Congress would not go along.

01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:58.860
But John Muir knew somebody

01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.700
who now could save
his enchanted forest

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.400
with a stroke of his pen.

01:45:05.530 --> 01:45:09.300
President Roosevelt invoked
the antiquities act again,

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:13.500
and Petrified Forest
National Monument was created.

01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:19.030
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
There is nothing more practical

01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:22.200
than the preservation
of beauty,

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.430
than the preservation
of anything

01:45:24.430 --> 01:45:27.830
that appeals to the higher
emotions of mankind.

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:33.860
I believe we are past
the stage of national existence

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:36.560
when we could
look on complacently

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.360
at the individual
who skinned the land

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:45.060
and was content for the sake
of 3 years' profit for himself

01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:47.730
to leave a desert
for the children of those

01:45:47.730 --> 01:45:49.730
who were to inherit the soil.

01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:54.130
JENKINSON: If government
doesn't protect

01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:56.330
the weakest elements of humanity

01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:58.330
and the weakest elements
of nature...

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.930
the whole game is lost.

01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:05.930
That was
an incredible breakthrough

01:46:05.930 --> 01:46:07.200
for a man who grew up

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:09.560
in a profoundly
Republican household

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:12.360
in an age of J.P. Morgan
and John Rockefeller.

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:17.130
There's a paradox at the very
center of American life.

01:46:17.130 --> 01:46:21.230
We are meant to be
the most materially happy,

01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:24.160
wealthiest, most privileged
people who ever lived on Earth.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:27.230
That's one version
of the American dream.

01:46:29.230 --> 01:46:32.860
We are also Thoreau's Americans
and Jefferson's Americans,

01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:36.600
and Roosevelt's
Grand Canyon Americans.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:39.330
We want that, and somehow
we've gotten it into our heads

01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:41.100
that we can have both,

01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:42.460
and maybe we can.

01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:48.600
But Roosevelt understood
that we can only have both

01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.900
if we severely restrain
our acquisitive energies

01:46:51.900 --> 01:46:53.600
for some parts
of this continent.

01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:55.900
That's the key.

01:46:57.900 --> 01:46:59.730
UDALL: We used to talk
about Teddy Roosevelt

01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:02.030
having distance in his eyes...

01:47:03.330 --> 01:47:07.130
and that's what's important,
is to have this

01:47:07.130 --> 01:47:12.360
strong, powerful
part of our heritage vivid

01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:16.260
so that people can understand it
and appreciate it.

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:18.260
COYOTE: Before his presidency
was over,

01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:21.360
he would create
5 new national parks,

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:26.760
51 federal bird sanctuaries,
4 national game refuges,

01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.130
18 national monuments,

01:47:29.130 --> 01:47:33.500
and more than 100 million acres
worth of national forests.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:43.060
Now Roosevelt wanted one more
national park added to his list,

01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:45.960
the place he had urged
the citizens of Arizona

01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:50.430
to leave as it is--
the grandest canyon on Earth.

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:55.700
Developers were already
erecting buildings,

01:47:55.700 --> 01:47:58.060
miners were filing claims,

01:47:58.060 --> 01:48:02.160
and ranchers were grazing cattle
all along the south rim.

01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:07.700
But even Theodore Roosevelt
could not persuade Congress

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:08.860
to act.

01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:11.430
Local sentiment
and vested interests

01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:13.400
were just too powerful.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.560
The president looked
for some way, any way

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.730
to prevent the canyon
from becoming

01:48:18.730 --> 01:48:22.430
another commercialized
Niagara Falls.

01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:26.060
He found his solution
in the antiquities act.

01:48:28.130 --> 01:48:30.800
CRONON: It was written
basically to try to prevent

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.960
the destruction of Indian
archaeological sites

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:35.430
in the American southwest,

01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:37.230
the idea being that
there were people going in

01:48:37.230 --> 01:48:38.900
and robbing these graves,

01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:40.630
and that that
needed to be stopped.

01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:44.400
And so a law is written
that says the president

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.000
can very quickly set aside
a tract of land

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.430
as a national monument,

01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:51.600
and that's a fairly
narrow purpose.

01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:54.760
But there were no
restrictions in the law,

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.160
and Teddy Roosevelt
quite quickly realized

01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.330
that you could set aside land

01:48:58.330 --> 01:49:00.560
for reasons
other than archaeology,

01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:02.530
and the great beneficiary
of that law would be

01:49:02.530 --> 01:49:03.660
the Grand Canyon.

01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:07.400
COYOTE: The wording
of the antiquities act

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:10.060
referred to protection
of so-called

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:13.860
"objects of historic
and scientific interest,"

01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:17.560
and though it had contemplated
only small-sized parcels,

01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:20.700
up to then, no more than
5,000 acres,

01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:22.700
it did not absolutely restrict

01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:25.800
the number of acres a president
could set aside.

01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:34.500
On January 11, 1908,
declaring the Grand Canyon

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:38.160
"an object of unusual
scientific interest,

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.460
"being the greatest
eroded canyon

01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:42.400
"within the United States,"

01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:48.100
Roosevelt set aside
806,400 acres

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.760
as a national monument.

01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:53.760
It would not enjoy
the same protections

01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:55.660
as a national park,

01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:58.930
but it was a step
in the right direction.

01:49:58.930 --> 01:50:01.530
Politicians in Arizona
were outraged

01:50:01.530 --> 01:50:04.860
and threatened to challenge
Roosevelt in court.

01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:06.830
Members of Congress complained

01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:10.700
that the president
had overstepped his authority.

01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:12.060
He ignored them all.

01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.930
UDALL: A lot of Westerners,
powerful Westerners,

01:50:15.930 --> 01:50:19.100
Congressmen, senators,
were opposed and critical...

01:50:20.330 --> 01:50:25.000
and that was part
of Teddy Roosevelt's power,

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:29.130
that he could overwhelm
the wishes of local people

01:50:29.130 --> 01:50:30.460
and dared to do it.

01:50:32.230 --> 01:50:34.130
JENKINSON: Well,
there was furor.

01:50:34.130 --> 01:50:37.130
There is always furor
when these things happen.

01:50:37.130 --> 01:50:38.230
Short-term.

01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:42.060
But Roosevelt understood

01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:44.660
that short-term
controversy over nature

01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:47.360
leads to long-term benefit.

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:51.500
Roosevelt's view was that
an intact environment

01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:55.730
is infinitely more valuable
spiritually and economically

01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:57.360
than an extracted one.

01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:01.960
UDALL: But history
always vindicates,

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:03.900
always vindicates what they did.

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:09.530
There's not a single person
in Arizona today

01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:12.900
who would say the Grand Canyon
was a mistake.

01:51:25.930 --> 01:51:27.930
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
The very first reservation

01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:30.260
that ever was made
in this world,

01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:34.800
the garden of Eden,
contained only one tree.

01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:37.400
The smallest reservation
that ever was made.

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:42.700
Yet no sooner was it made

01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:46.730
than it was attacked
by everybody in the world--

01:51:46.730 --> 01:51:49.560
the devil, one woman,
and one man.

01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:54.030
This has been the history
of every reservation

01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:56.930
that has been made
since that time,

01:51:56.930 --> 01:52:00.400
that is, as soon as
a reservation is once created,

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:04.130
then the thieves and the devil
and his relations

01:52:04.130 --> 01:52:05.760
come forward to attack it.

01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:13.530
DUNCAN: He said,
"Nothing dollarable is safe"...

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:18.400
and it's like this insight
into human beings,

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:19.600
but particularly Americans.

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:23.160
He understood
this relentless grasp

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.830
of American commerce.

01:52:24.830 --> 01:52:26.700
It wants to reach
into everything.

01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.400
And he realized
that if a dollar value

01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:34.700
could be attached to,
in his mind, a sacred place,

01:52:34.700 --> 01:52:36.100
it was vulnerable.

01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:40.260
COYOTE: Since the start
of the 20th century,

01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:42.730
the city of San Francisco
had been looking

01:52:42.730 --> 01:52:46.960
for a better supply of water
to fuel its growth,

01:52:46.960 --> 01:52:49.830
and it had set its sights
on the Tuolumne River

01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:51.330
and the Hetch Hetchy Valley

01:52:51.330 --> 01:52:55.260
as the perfect place for a dam
and reservoir,

01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:58.300
a narrow valley
remote enough to assure

01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:01.860
that the waters trapped
from the yearly Sierra runoff

01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:03.330
would stay pure.

01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:06.330
The fact that it was
within the boundaries

01:53:06.330 --> 01:53:08.300
of Yosemite National Park

01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:11.800
only added to its
attractiveness to city planners.

01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:15.100
No competing claims
to water rights existed.

01:53:15.100 --> 01:53:18.700
The only land owner to deal with
was the federal government.

01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:22.100
Damming and flooding
Hetch Hetchy

01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:26.160
would be cheaper and easier
than finding alternative sites.

01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.930
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: That
anyone would try to destroy

01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:33.860
such a place seems incredible,

01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:36.660
but sad experience shows
that there are people

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:40.600
good enough and bad enough
for anything.

01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:47.830
COYOTE: To John Muir,
allowing a dam

01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:49.930
in any national park

01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:52.800
would betray the very purpose
of parks,

01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:54.830
and even worse in his eyes,

01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:57.500
set a dangerous precedent
for the future.

01:53:58.830 --> 01:54:02.930
Hetch Hetchy was among his
favorite places in Yosemite.

01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:05.700
He called it
"one of nature's rarest

01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:08.160
"and most precious
mountain temples."

01:54:09.630 --> 01:54:14.060
With its own majestic waterfalls
and massive granite faces,

01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:17.530
it had all the beauty of
the more famous Yosemite Valley

01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:19.830
20 miles to the south, he said,

01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:22.460
without the clutter
of tourist hotels.

01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.860
When he had helped
draw the boundary lines

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:28.530
for the national park
back in 1890,

01:54:28.530 --> 01:54:31.230
he had deliberately included
Hetch Hetchy.

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.160
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
These temple destroyers,

01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:39.560
devotees of
ravaging commercialism,

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:43.400
seem to have a perfect contempt
for nature,

01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:45.160
and instead of
lifting their eyes

01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:47.030
to the god of the mountains,

01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:49.530
lift them
to the almighty dollar.

01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:52.400
Dam Hetch Hetchy.

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:54.400
As well, dam for water-tanks

01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:57.360
the people's cathedrals
and churches,

01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:00.760
for no holier temple
has ever been consecrated

01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.300
by the heart of man.

01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:08.760
COYOTE: At first,
Muir's view had prevailed.

01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.760
Theodore Roosevelt's
interior secretary

01:55:11.760 --> 01:55:16.030
turned down San Francisco's
application 3 different times.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.460
Then on April 18, 1906,
a tremendous earthquake

01:55:22.460 --> 01:55:24.560
had shaken San Francisco,

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.660
bringing down
hundreds of buildings

01:55:26.660 --> 01:55:30.060
and igniting fires
that consumed most of the city,

01:55:30.060 --> 01:55:31.430
killing thousands.

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:38.060
With San Francisco
reduced to ashes,

01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:40.160
politicians redoubled
their efforts

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:42.230
for a reservoir at Hetch Hetchy,

01:55:42.230 --> 01:55:45.230
claiming falsely
that its water supply

01:55:45.230 --> 01:55:47.200
could have prevented
the destruction.

01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:52.900
In a referendum,
San Franciscans voted 7-1

01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:54.660
in favor of the dam.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.260
The city's mayor
launched a campaign

01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:00.300
attacking Muir's character

01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.360
for trying to obstruct
the project.

01:56:03.730 --> 01:56:07.960
Even Muir's own Sierra Club
split over the issue,

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:11.360
with some prominent members
advocating the dam.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.760
MAN: They loved Yosemite,

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:19.960
but they loved Yosemite
in a kind of additive way.

01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:23.230
It wasn't at the core of their
understanding of America.

01:56:23.230 --> 01:56:27.700
And for them in San Francisco,
the city came first.

01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:30.460
COYOTE: Meanwhile, an old
adversary of Muir's

01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:33.060
stepped forward
on the city's behalf--

01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:34.360
Gifford Pinchot.

01:56:35.730 --> 01:56:37.660
As the nation's top forester

01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:40.430
and President Roosevelt's
trusted adviser,

01:56:40.430 --> 01:56:42.800
Pinchot had become
one of the most powerful

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:44.260
men in Washington.

01:56:44.260 --> 01:56:46.960
At his urging,
Roosevelt had reserved

01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:49.660
millions of acres
of western land

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.100
as national forests

01:56:51.100 --> 01:56:53.700
in the face
of Congressional opposition.

01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:56.900
Pinchot steadfastly believed

01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:00.630
that conservation meant
wise use of nature,

01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:03.300
not preserving it
for its own sake,

01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.730
and he had never been
a wholehearted supporter

01:57:05.730 --> 01:57:07.200
of national parks,

01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:10.230
let alone John Muir's
unbending vision

01:57:10.230 --> 01:57:12.600
of protecting
and expanding them.

01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:17.430
When a new interior secretary
joined the administration,

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:20.800
Pinchot began lobbying him
in support of the dam.

01:57:22.130 --> 01:57:25.760
In response, Muir once again
took his case

01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:27.960
to the man with whom
he had shared

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:32.230
3 magical nights in the park
back in 1903--

01:57:32.230 --> 01:57:36.530
the outdoorsman he considered
a friend and kindred spirit.

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:45.000
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: April 21,
1908. Dear Mr. President,

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.560
a few promoters
of the present scheme

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:50.100
all show forth
a proud set of confidence

01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:52.600
that comes from
a good, sound, substantial

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:54.700
irrefragable ignorance.

01:57:56.830 --> 01:58:00.460
Hetch Hetchy is one of the most
sublime and beautiful

01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:02.800
and important features
of the park,

01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:05.160
and to dam and submerge it

01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:08.630
would be hardly
less destructive and deplorable

01:58:08.630 --> 01:58:11.730
than would be the damming
of Yosemite itself.

01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:17.000
Faithfully and devotedly yours,
John Muir.

01:58:19.530 --> 01:58:21.960
MAN AS THEODORE ROOSEVELT:
My dear Mr. Muir,

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:26.530
Pinchot is rather favorable
to the Hetch Hetchy plan.

01:58:26.530 --> 01:58:27.960
I have sent him your letter

01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:30.660
with a request
for a report on it.

01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:32.860
I will do everything in my power

01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:35.460
to protect not only
the Yosemite,

01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.330
which we have already protected,

01:58:37.330 --> 01:58:40.800
but other similar great natural
beauties of this country.

01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:46.460
But you must remember
that it is out of the question

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:48.360
permanently to protect them,

01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:52.060
unless we have a certain degree
of friendliness toward them

01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:54.060
on the part of the people
of the state

01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.660
in which they are situated.

01:58:59.730 --> 01:59:02.760
CRONON: What makes the conflict
between Muir and Pinchot

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:04.730
so bitter, so personal

01:59:04.730 --> 01:59:10.560
is that 2 really wonderful
visions of the human good,

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:12.930
both of which
are worth celebrating,

01:59:12.930 --> 01:59:15.000
are on a collision course,

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
and that collision course meets

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.160
in Hetch Hetchy Valley
in Yosemite National Park.

01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:22.800
For one man, Muir,
that valley and that park

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:24.160
are a cathedral,

01:59:24.160 --> 01:59:26.830
and anything that might
desecrate that cathedral

01:59:26.830 --> 01:59:28.130
is blasphemy.

01:59:28.130 --> 01:59:31.330
It is a--it is a sacrilege
against God.

01:59:31.330 --> 01:59:33.030
For the other man, Pinchot,

01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:35.900
these are resources that serve
the common good.

01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:37.960
These are resources
for a democracy.

01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:43.200
COYOTE: But Pinchot
was in Washington

01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.300
and Muir was in California.

01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.000
Pinchot's view prevailed.

01:59:49.630 --> 01:59:51.700
Pending Congressional approval,

01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:55.760
the interior secretary granted
San Francisco's application,

01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:58.100
calling it "the greatest benefit

01:59:58.100 --> 02:00:00.360
"to the greatest
number of people."

02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:06.030
President Roosevelt did nothing
to stop it.

02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:10.130
Muir was devastated.

02:00:11.630 --> 02:00:13.200
But the fight was not over.

02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:18.130
A year later, with Roosevelt
out of the White House,

02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:21.000
the new president,
William Howard Taft,

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.500
came to California on his own
tour of Yosemite,

02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:27.800
and to the dismay of
San Francisco's politicians,

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:30.860
chose Muir as his guide.

02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:35.230
Before the visit was over,
Taft decided to oppose the dam.

02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:38.930
By 1913, however,

02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:41.400
yet another president
had taken office--

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:45.860
Woodrow Wilson, who chose
as his secretary of the interior

02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:51.660
Franklin K. Lane, the former
city attorney for San Francisco.

02:00:51.660 --> 02:00:55.860
Lane wasted no time getting
the project back on track.

02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:06.030
Muir was now 75, and the long
battle over Hetch Hetchy

02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:07.460
had taken its toll.

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.960
Ten years earlier,
he had anticipated

02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:14.400
completing 20 books
in his old age.

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.130
Because of what he called
"this everlasting

02:01:17.130 --> 02:01:18.700
"Hetch Hetchy business,"

02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:21.630
he had managed to finish only 2.

02:01:21.630 --> 02:01:23.930
"I wonder,"
he wrote his daughter,

02:01:23.930 --> 02:01:28.030
"if leaves feel lonely when they
see their neighbors falling."

02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:34.630
Still, he soldiered on,
speaking, writing,

02:01:34.630 --> 02:01:36.660
urging anyone who would listen

02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:39.360
not to flood
the exquisite valley.

02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:43.230
"I still think we can win,"
Muir said

02:01:43.230 --> 02:01:46.200
in November of 1913, adding,

02:01:46.200 --> 02:01:49.560
"anyhow, I'll be relieved
when it's settled,

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:50.930
"for it's killing me."

02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:57.260
3 weeks later, the bill
approving the dam

02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:00.300
cleared its final hurdle
in Congress.

02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:03.900
President Wilson
quickly signed it into law.

02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:08.930
MAN: It was sorrowful indeed

02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:11.400
to see him sitting
in his cobwebbed study

02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:13.560
in his lonely house

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:16.330
with the full force
of his defeat upon him

02:02:16.330 --> 02:02:20.260
after the struggle of a lifetime
in the service of Hetch Hetchy.

02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:26.000
I could not but think that
if Congress, the president,

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:30.330
and even the San Francisco
contingent could have seen him,

02:02:30.330 --> 02:02:32.100
they would certainly
have been willing

02:02:32.100 --> 02:02:36.060
to have delayed any action
until the old man had gone away.

02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:39.600
And I fear that is
going to be very soon...

02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:44.330
as he appeared to me
to be breaking very fast.

02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:47.460
Robert Marshall.

02:02:52.630 --> 02:02:54.860
COYOTE: Exhausted and frail,

02:02:54.860 --> 02:02:57.500
Muir forced himself
to finish a book

02:02:57.500 --> 02:02:59.560
on his travels in Alaska.

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:03.330
He built new bookcases
in the big, empty house

02:03:03.330 --> 02:03:05.830
he had once shared
with his wife Louie

02:03:05.830 --> 02:03:07.060
and their 2 children.

02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:12.400
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
The battle for conservation

02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:15.130
will go on endlessly.

02:03:15.130 --> 02:03:17.360
It is part
of the universal warfare

02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:19.200
between right and wrong.

02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:24.300
Fortunately, wrong cannot last.

02:03:25.500 --> 02:03:29.300
Soon or late, it must
fall back home to Hades,

02:03:29.300 --> 02:03:32.630
while some compensating good
must surely follow.

02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:37.430
They will see
what I meant in time.

02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.230
There must be places
for human beings

02:03:41.230 --> 02:03:44.160
to satisfy their souls--

02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:46.500
food and drink is not all.

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:50.200
There is the spiritual.

02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:53.230
In some, it is only
a germ, of course.

02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:56.360
But the germ will grow.

02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:04.430
COYOTE: In December of 1914,
he came down with pneumonia.

02:04:05.700 --> 02:04:08.800
On Christmas Eve, John Muir,

02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:12.230
the wilderness prophet
who had struggled so hard

02:04:12.230 --> 02:04:15.000
to get his adopted country
to experience

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.830
the blessings of nature, died.

02:04:21.500 --> 02:04:24.830
POPE: I think when John Muir
walked into Yosemite,

02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:28.260
a century-long
conversation began...

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.460
and it was a conversation about
the nature of America

02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:36.430
and about whether
we were going to remain

02:04:36.430 --> 02:04:39.100
what Lincoln called
"the last best hope of Earth"

02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:41.500
or whether we were simply
going to become another Europe.

02:04:43.130 --> 02:04:45.160
And John Muir's
encounter with Yosemite--

02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:47.000
remember, he was a European.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.460
He came from this
narrow Scots background.

02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:51.660
He was not an American.

02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:54.830
And he encountered Yosemite
and he imagined what America

02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:55.930
could be.

02:04:57.030 --> 02:04:58.660
And for a century,
we've fought about

02:04:58.660 --> 02:05:01.660
whether we liked
his vision or not.

02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:07.230
MAN: I like what he said
on one occasion

02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:10.830
where he essentially said,
"the enemies of wildness

02:05:10.830 --> 02:05:14.130
"are invincible,
and they are everywhere,

02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:16.000
"but the fight must go on...

02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:20.000
"and for every acre
that you gain,

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.160
"10,000 trees and flowers
and all the other forest people

02:05:24.160 --> 02:05:28.200
"and the usual
unborn generations

02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:31.300
"will rise up
and call you blessed."

02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:36.260
COYOTE: 4 years
after Muir's death,

02:05:36.260 --> 02:05:40.930
work on the dam he had opposed
with all his strength began,

02:05:40.930 --> 02:05:42.660
and the Hetch Hetchy valley,

02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:46.830
whose tranquil meadows he had
compared to a landscape garden

02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:48.460
and a mountain temple

02:05:48.460 --> 02:05:52.500
would slowly be entombed under
hundreds of feet of water.

02:05:56.830 --> 02:06:00.560
But Muir's fight had struck
a chord in many Americans,

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:03.100
who now wondered
if a lovely valley

02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.060
in Yosemite National Park

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:07.300
could be turned
into a reservoir,

02:06:07.300 --> 02:06:10.230
were any national parks safe?

02:06:14.630 --> 02:06:18.230
CRONON: John Muir lost the fight
over Hetch Hetchy

02:06:18.230 --> 02:06:19.800
and the dam was built,

02:06:19.800 --> 02:06:21.600
and people who live
in San Francisco today

02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:23.900
drink the water of Hetch Hetchy.

02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:26.900
Muir died feeling that
he'd been defeated by that,

02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:29.960
and that was a great tragedy
at the end of his life.

02:06:29.960 --> 02:06:33.300
But it's also true that
Hetch Hetchy would then go on

02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:34.860
across the 20th century

02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:37.400
as a kind of battle cry
that would inform

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:40.930
all wilderness, wild land,
parkland battles

02:06:40.930 --> 02:06:42.900
from that moment on.

02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:45.600
It looks like a defeat, and yet
what's interesting about it

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:48.600
is that in that defeat,
a whole series of people

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:51.630
began to wonder whether
the parks needed more protection

02:06:51.630 --> 02:06:52.960
than they currently had.

02:06:54.530 --> 02:06:57.030
That there needed to be
some greater rampart,

02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:59.530
some greater wall that could
defend the parks

02:06:59.530 --> 02:07:01.730
against a future
such controversy.

02:07:05.860 --> 02:07:08.360
COYOTE: A proposal
that Muir had supported

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:12.000
now began gaining greater ground
across the nation--

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:15.560
to create an agency
within the federal government

02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:19.460
whose sole job would be
to promote, administer,

02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:21.930
and protect the national parks,

02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:25.260
to make sure they fulfilled
their great promise

02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:28.430
and endured
for countless generations.

02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:34.630
MAN: Muir said...

02:07:34.630 --> 02:07:37.330
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: As long as
I live, I will hear the birds

02:07:37.330 --> 02:07:40.960
and the winds
and the waterfalls sing.

02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:44.460
I'll interpret the rocks
and learn the language

02:07:44.460 --> 02:07:47.700
of flood, of storm
and avalanche.

02:07:50.230 --> 02:07:52.730
I'll make the acquaintance
of the wild gardens

02:07:52.730 --> 02:07:53.930
and the glaciers

02:07:53.930 --> 02:07:59.300
and get as near to the heart
of this world as I could.

02:08:00.730 --> 02:08:03.800
And so I did.
I sauntered about

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:06.430
from rock to rock,
from grove to grove,

02:08:06.430 --> 02:08:07.800
from stream to stream,

02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:09.730
and whenever I met a new plant,

02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:12.960
I would sit down beside it
for a minute or a day

02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:16.160
to make its acquaintance,
hear what it had to tell.

02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:18.300
I asked the boulders
where they had been

02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:19.660
and whither they were going

02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:24.000
and when night found me,
there I camped.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:28.030
I took no more heed to save time
or to make haste

02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:31.860
than did the trees or the stars.

02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:34.360
This is true freedom,

02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:38.360
a good practical
sort of immortality.
