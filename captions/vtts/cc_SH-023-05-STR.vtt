00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270


2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.000
Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.230
How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.930
By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.900
Where is the post that came from Montague?

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.130
How far off is our brother Montague?

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.370
By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.430
And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.200
At Southam I did leave him with his forces,

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.170
And do expect him here some two hours hence.

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.070
Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.800
It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.870
The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.

14
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.270
Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.

15
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.030
They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.000
O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.900
Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,

18
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.300
That we could hear no news of his repair?

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.900
Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,

20
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.470
Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,

21
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.830
Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?

22
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.730
And he shall pardon thee these outrages.

23
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.800
Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.170
Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down,

25
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
Call Warwick patron and be penitent?

26
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.800
And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.600
I thought, at least, he would have said the king;

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.130
Or did he make the jest against his will?

29
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.670
Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?

30
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.270
Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:

31
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.070
I'll do thee service for so good a gift.

32
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.

33
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.300
Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.

34
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.730
Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:

35
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.500
And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;

36
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.730
And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.

37
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.530
But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:

38
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.700
And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:

39
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.170
What is the body when the head is off?

40
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.200
Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,

41
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.770
But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,

42
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.530
The king was slily finger'd from the deck!

43
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.630
You left King Henry at the Bishop's palace,

44
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.930
And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.

45
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.370
'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.

46
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.670
Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:

47
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.900
Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.

48
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.230
I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,

49
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.030
And with the other fling it at thy face,

50
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.030
Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.

51
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.830
Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,

52
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.700
This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair

53
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.970
Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.670
Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,

55
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.670
'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'

56
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.570
O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!

57
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.070
Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.700
The gates are open, let us enter too.

59
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.300
So other foes may set upon our backs.

60
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.970
Stand we in good array; for they no doubt

61
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.900
Will issue out again and bid us battle:

62
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.370
If not, the city being but of small defence,

63
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.730
We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.

64
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.670
O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

65
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.270
Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.630
Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason

67
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.770
Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.

68
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.300
The harder match'd, the greater victory:

69
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.900
My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.

70
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.370
Somerset, Somerset, for Lancaster!

71
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.570
Two of thy name, both Dukes of Somerset,

72
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.170
Have sold their lives unto the house of York;

73
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.570
And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.

74
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.770
And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,

75
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.770
Of force enough to bid his brother battle;

76
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.570
With whom an upright zeal to right prevails

77
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.970
More than the nature of a brother's love!

78
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.570
Clarence. Clarence for Lancaster.

79
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.970
et tu Brute. Wilt thou stab Caesar to?

80
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.530
A parley sent to George of Clarence.

81
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.500
(horn sounds)

82
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.070
Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.

83
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.830
Father of Warwick, know you what this means?

84
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.570
Look here, I throw my infamy at thee

85
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.470
I will not ruinate my father's house,

86
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.430
Who gave his blood to line the stones together,

87
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.170
And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,

88
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.870
That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,

89
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.930
To bend the fatal instruments of war

90
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.800
Against his brother and his lawful king?

91
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.700
Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:

92
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.570
To keep that oath were more impiety

93
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.300
Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.

94
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.530
I am so sorry for my trespass made

95
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.500
That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,

96
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.200
I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,

97
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.500
With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--

98
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.970
As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--

99
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.570
To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.

100
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.170
And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,

101
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.270
And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.

102
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.400
Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:

103
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.330
And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,

104
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.930
For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.

105
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.000
Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,

106
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.530
Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.

107
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.830
Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.

108
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.370
O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!

109
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.200
What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?

110
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.500
Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?

111
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.730


112
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.570
Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!

113
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.370
I will away towards Barnet presently,

114
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.530
And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.

115
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.330
Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.

116
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.870
Lords, to the field; Saint George and victory!

117
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.900
(♪drums horns)

118
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:20.070
So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;

119
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.630
For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.

120
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.930
Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,

121
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.570
That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.

122
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:58.630
Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,

123
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:09.670
And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?

124
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:21.570
Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,

125
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:29.670
My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.

126
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:35.270
That I must yield my body to the earth

127
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:42.870
And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.

128
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:50.170
Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,

129
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:55.330
Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,

130
00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:01.070
Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,

131
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.570
Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree

132
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:14.000
And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.

133
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.470
These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,

134
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.430
Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,

135
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.670
To search the secret treasons of the world:

136
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.900
The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,

137
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.930
Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;

138
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.230
For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?

139
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:47.070
And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow?

140
00:11:50.870 --> 00:12:01.530
Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!

141
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:08.330
My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.

142
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:15.700
Even now forsake me, and of all my lands

143
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.030
Is nothing left me but my body's length.

144
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:36.370
Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?

145
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:45.000
And, live we how we can, yet die we must.

146
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:56.070
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.

147
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.970
We might recover all our loss again;

148
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.330
The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:

149
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.600
Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!

150
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:15.900
Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,

151
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.870
If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.

152
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:27.570
And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!

153
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.030
Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,

154
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.670
Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood

155
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:46.330
That glues my lips and will not let me speak.

156
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.970
Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.

157
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:54.900
Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;

158
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.530
And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,

159
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.930
And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'

160
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.670
And more he would have said, and more he spoke,

161
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.370
Which sounded like a canon in a vault,

162
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.330
That might not be distinguished; but at last

163
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.470
I well might hear, delivered with a groan,

164
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.170
'O, farewell, Warwick!'

165
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:27.930
Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;

166
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:33.870
For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.

167
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:27.500
Away, away, to meet the queen's great power!

168
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.830


169
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.670
(♪horns and cheers)

170
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.170
Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,

171
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.130
And we are graced with wreaths of victory.

172
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:54.500
But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,

173
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.400
I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,

174
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.630
That will encounter with our glorious sun,

175
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.870
Ere he attain his easeful western bed:

176
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.700
I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen

177
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.930
Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast

178
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.670
And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.

179
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.530
A little gale will soon disperse that cloud

180
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.670
And blow it to the source from whence it came:

181
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.200
Thy very beams will dry those vapours up,

182
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.800
For every cloud engenders not a storm.

183
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.730
The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,

184
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.500
And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:

185
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.000
If she have time to breathe be well assured

186
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.730
Her faction will be full as strong as ours.

187
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.400
We are advertised by our loving friends

188
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.400
That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:

189
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.170
We, having now the best at Barnet field,

190
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.900
Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;

191
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.900
And, as we march, our strength will be augmented

192
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.200
In every county as we go along.

193
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.330
Strike up the drum; cry 'Courage!' and away.

194
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:05.000
(drums sounds) Courage!

195
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:48.330
Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,

196
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.930
But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.

197
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.500
What though the mast be now blown overboard,

198
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.130
The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,

199
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.470
And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?

200
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:09.470
Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he

201
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.730
Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad

202
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.430
With tearful eyes add water to the sea

203
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.400
And give more strength to that which hath too much,

204
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.970
Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rocks,

205
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.970
Which industry and courage might have saved?

206
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:37.530
Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!

207
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:46.930
Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?

208
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:54.370
And Montague our topmost; what of him?

209
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.170
Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?

210
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.030
Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?

211
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:08.670
And Somerset another goodly mast?

212
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.670
The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?

213
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:17.230
And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I

214
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:22.100
For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?

215
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.430
We will not from the helm to sit and weep,

216
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:31.630
But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,

217
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.230
From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.

218
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.970
As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.

219
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:49.430
And what is Edward but ruthless sea?

220
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:55.770
What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?

221
00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:02.200
And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?

222
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:11.430
All these the enemies to our poor bark.

223
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:18.030
Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!

224
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.800
Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:

225
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.770
Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,

226
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:39.430
Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.

227
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:45.600
This speak I, lords, to let you understand,

228
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.170
If case some one of you would fly from us,

229
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.930
That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers

230
00:21:54.930 --> 00:22:05.500
More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.

231
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:14.300
Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided

232
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:22.700
'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.

233
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.070
Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit

234
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.430
Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,

235
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.400
Infuse his breast with magnanimity

236
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.870
And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.

237
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:44.470
I speak not this as doubting any here

238
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.230
For did I but suspect a fearful man

239
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.370
He should have leave to go away betimes,

240
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.830
Lest in our need he might infect another

241
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:57.700
And make him of like spirit to himself.

242
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.570
If any such be here--as God forbid!--

243
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.970
Let him depart before we need his help.

244
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.500
Women and children of so high a courage,

245
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:20.070
And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.

246
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.270
O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather

247
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.670
Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live

248
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.930
To bear his image and renew his glories!

249
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.830
And he that will not fight for such a hope.

250
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.870
Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,

251
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.500
If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.

252
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.600
Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.

253
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.400
And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.

254
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.370
Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.

255
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.870
Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.

256
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:54.830
I thought no less: it is his policy

257
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.370
To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.

258
00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.870
But he's deceived; we are in readiness.

259
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.400
(crowd) Ay!

260
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.600
This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.

261
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.870
Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.

262
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:17.600
(♪trumpet, battle cries)

263
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.670
(Edward yells from outside the walls)

264
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:25.170
Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,

265
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.900
Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,

266
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.830
Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.

267
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.030
I need not add more fuel to your fire,

268
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.630
For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out

269
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:49.000
Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!

270
00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:01.500
Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say

271
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:07.470
My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,

272
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.530
Ye see, I drink the water of my eye.

273
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.530
Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,

274
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.670
Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,

275
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.770
His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,

276
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.470
His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;

277
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:33.200
And yonder stands the wolf that makes this spoil.

278
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:39.770
You fight in justice lords: then, in God's name, lords,

279
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.970
Be valiant and give signal to the fight.

280
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.700
Now here a period of tumultuous broils.

281
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.800
Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:

282
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.170
For Somerset, off with his guilty head.

283
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.400
Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.

284
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.670
For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.

285
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:35.330
Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.

286
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.400
So part we sadly in this troublous world,

287
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.400
To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.

288
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.230
Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward

289
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.530
Shall have a high reward, and he his life?

290
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:56.600
It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!

291
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.770
Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.

292
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.800
What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?

293
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.600
Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make

294
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.100
For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,

295
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.330
And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?

296
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.130
Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!

297
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.930
Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;

298
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.170
Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,

299
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.800
Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,

300
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.030
Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.

301
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.070
Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!

302
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.470
That you might still have worn the petticoat,

303
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.630
And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.

304
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.400
Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;

305
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.870
His currish riddles sort not with this place.

306
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.100
By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.

307
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.470
Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.

308
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.400
For God's sake, take away this captive scold.

309
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.670
Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.

310
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.630
Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.

311
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.170
Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.

312
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.970
I know my duty; you are all undutiful:

313
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:24.870
Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,

314
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:29.130
And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all

315
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.470
I am your better, traitors as ye are:

316
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.730
And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.

317
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.930
Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.

318
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.300
Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.

319
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.970
And there's for twitting me with perjury.

320
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.800
O, kill me too!

321
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800
Marry, and shall.

322
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.400
Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.

323
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.500
Why should she live, to fill the world with words?

324
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.970
What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.

325
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.200
Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;

326
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.200
I'll hence to London on a serious matter:

327
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.000
Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.

328
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.070
What? what?

329
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:10.070
The Tower, the Tower. I'll root them out.

330
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:23.800
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!

331
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:37.730
Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!

332
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:48.800
They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,

333
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.030
Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,

334
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:59.200
If this foul deed were by to equal it:

335
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:05.700
He was a man; this, in respect, a child:

336
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:11.770
And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.

337
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:18.600
What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?

338
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:29.230
No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:

339
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:36.330
And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.

340
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:47.770
Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!

341
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:56.430
How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!

342
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.900
You have no children, butchers! if you had,

343
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.500
The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:

344
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.930
But if you ever chance to have a child,

345
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.130
Look in his youth to have him so cut off

346
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.470
As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!

347
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.030
Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.

348
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:27.670
Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,

349
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.700
Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:

350
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:37.000
What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.

351
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.470
By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.

352
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.170
Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.

353
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.770
Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?

354
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.900
Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:

355
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.970
'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.

356
00:33:52.470 --> 00:34:02.470
What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher? Richard.

357
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:08.870
Hard-favour'd Richard? Where art thou?

358
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:18.400
Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;

359
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.200
Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.

360
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.570
Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.

361
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.600
So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!

362
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.170
Where's Richard gone?

363
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.630
To London, all in post; and, as I guess,

364
00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.500
To make a bloody supper in the Tower.

365
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.370
He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.

366
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.500
Now march we hence: discharge the common sort

367
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.870
With pay and thanks, and let's away to London

368
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.100
To see our gentle queen how well she fares:

369
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.830
By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.

370
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.130
Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?

371
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.230
Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;

372
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:23.630
'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:

373
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.270
'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,

374
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.130
And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'

375
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:36.870
Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.

376
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.730
So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;

377
00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.870
So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece

378
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:53.570
And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.

379
00:36:53.570 --> 00:37:03.670
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?

380
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:22.400
What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?

381
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.930
Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;

382
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:31.200
The thief doth fear each bush an officer.

383
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.130
The bird that hath been limed in a bush,

384
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.800
With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;

385
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.470
And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,

386
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.400
Have now the fatal object in my eye

387
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.100
Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.

388
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.900
Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,

389
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.700
That taught his son the office of a fowl!

390
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.470
An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.

391
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:04.300
I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;

392
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.570
Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;

393
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.530
The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy

394
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.500
Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea

395
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.730
Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.

396
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.900
Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!

397
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.570
My breast can better brook thy dagger's point

398
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.700
Than can my ears that tragic history.

399
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:35.230
But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?

400
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.570
Think'st thou I am an executioner?

401
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.800
A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:

402
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.230
If murdering innocents be executing,

403
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.630
Why, then thou art an executioner.

404
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.670
Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.

405
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.170
Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,

406
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.800
Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.

407
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.900
And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,

408
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.700
Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,

409
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.070
And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,

410
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.330
And many an orphan's water-standing eye--

411
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.570
Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,

412
00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:15.070
And orphans for their parents timeless death--

413
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.800
Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.

414
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:24.530
The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;

415
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:28.370
The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;

416
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:33.670
Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;

417
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.300
The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,

418
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.030
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.

419
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.100
Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,

420
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.730
And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,

421
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.800
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,

422
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.800
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.

423
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.830
Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,

424
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.730
To signify thou camest to bite the world:

425
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.730
And, if the rest be true which I have heard,

426
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:02.770
Thou camest--

427
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.400
I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:

428
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.830
For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.

429
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:13.070
Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.

430
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.870
God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!

431
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.430
What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster

432
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:28.600
Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.

433
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.470
See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!

434
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.270
O, may such purple tears be alway shed

435
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.130
From those that wish the downfall of our house!

436
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.770
If any spark of life be yet remaining,

437
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:46.100
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:

438
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:53.230
I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.

439
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:57.170
Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;

440
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.500
For I have often heard my mother say

441
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.430
I came into the world with my legs forward:

442
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.600
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,

443
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.700
And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?

444
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.630
The midwife wonder'd and the women cried

445
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.600
'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'

446
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.500
And so I was; which plainly signified

447
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:27.330
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.

448
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.030
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,

449
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:36.000
Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.

450
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.170
I have no brother, I am like no brother;

451
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.570
And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,

452
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.200
Be resident in men like one another

453
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:52.230
And not in me: I am myself alone.

454
00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:10.330
Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:

455
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:15.230
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;

456
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.470
For I will buz abroad such prophecies

457
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.130
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,

458
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.770
And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.

459
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.700
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:

460
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.930
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,

461
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.500
Counting myself but bad till I be best.

462
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.300
I'll throw thy body in another room

463
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.330
And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.

464
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:23.670
(♪ drums horns)

465

466
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.800
(group) Long live Edward the Fourth!

467
00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:33.130
Once more we sit in England's royal throne,

468
00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:38.500
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.

469
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.570
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,

470
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:47.930
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!

471
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.430
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd

472
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.030
For hardy and undoubted champions;

473
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:58.530
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,

474
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:04.430
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,

475
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.770
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion

476
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:13.230
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.

477
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:18.630
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat

478
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:24.830
And made our footstool of security.

479
00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:30.470
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.

480
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:51.600
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself

481
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.100
Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,

482
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.030
Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,

483
00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:04.470
That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;

484
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:09.330
And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.

485
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.900
Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;

486
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.630
And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.

487
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.270
The duty that I owe unto your majesty

488
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.970
I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.

489
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:30.400
Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.

490
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.470
And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,

491
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:37.130
Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.

492
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:40.170
To say the truth so Judas kissed his master

493
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.330
And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.

494
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:47.100
Now am I seated as my soul delights,

495
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.570
Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.

496
00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:53.530
What will your grace have done with Margaret?

497
00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.470
Reignier, her father, to the king of France

498
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.170
Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,

499
00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.630
And hither have they sent it for her ransom.

500
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.570
Away with her, and waft her hence to France.

501
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.870
And now what rests but that we spend the time

502
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.730
With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,

503
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.370
Such as befits the pleasure of the court?

504
00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:16.670
Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!

505
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:22.670
For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.

506
00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:30.630
