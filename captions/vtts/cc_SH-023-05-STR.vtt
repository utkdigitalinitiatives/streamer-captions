00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270


2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.000
Where is the post thatcame from valiant Oxford?

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.230
How far hence is thy lord,mine honest fellow?

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.930
By this at Dunsmore,marching hitherward.

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.900
Where is the post thatcame from Montague?

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.130
How far off is our brotherMontague?

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.370
By this at Daintry, with apuissant troop.

8
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.430
And, by thy guess, hownigh is Clarence now?

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.200
At Southam I did leave himwith his forces,

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.170
And do expect him heresome two hours hence.

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.070
Then Clarence is at hand,I hear his drum.

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.800
It is not his, my lord;here Southam lies:

13
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.870
The drum your honour hearsmarcheth from Warwick.

14
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.270
Who should that be? belike,unlook'd-for friends.

15
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.030
They are at hand, and youshall quickly know.

16
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.000
O unbid spite! is sportfulEdward come?

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.900
Where slept our scouts, orhow are they seduced,

18
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.300
That we could hear no newsof his repair?

19
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.900
Now, Warwick, wilt thouope the city gates,

20
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.470
Speak gentle words andhumbly bend thy knee,

21
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.830
Call Edward king and athis hands beg mercy?

22
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.730
And he shall pardon theethese outrages.

23
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.800
Nay, rather, wilt thoudraw thy forces hence,

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.170
Confess who set thee upand pluck'd thee down,

25
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.670
Call Warwick patron and bepenitent?

26
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.800
And thou shalt stillremain the Duke of York.

27
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.600
I thought, at least, hewould have said the king;

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.130
Or did he make the jestagainst his will?

29
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.670
Is not a dukedom, sir, agoodly gift?

30
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.270
Ay, by my faith, for apoor earl to give:

31
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.070
I'll do thee service forso good a gift.

32
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
'Twas I that gave thekingdom to thy brother.

33
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.300
Why then 'tis mine, if butby Warwick's gift.

34
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.730
Thou art no Atlas for sogreat a weight:

35
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.500
And weakling, Warwicktakes his gift again;

36
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.730
And Henry is my king,Warwick his subject.

37
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.530
But Warwick's king isEdward's prisoner:

38
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.700
And, gallant Warwick, dobut answer this:

39
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.170
What is the body when thehead is off?

40
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.200
Alas, that Warwick had nomore forecast,

41
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.770
But, whiles he thought tosteal the single ten,

42
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.530
The king was slilyfinger'd from the deck!

43
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.630
You left King Henry at theBishop's palace,

44
00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.930
And, ten to one, you'llmeet him in the Tower.

45
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.370
'Tis even so; yet you areWarwick still.

46
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.670
Come, Warwick, take the time;kneel down, kneel down:

47
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.900
Nay, when? strike now, orelse the iron cools.

48
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.230
I had rather chop thishand off at a blow,

49
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.030
And with the other flingit at thy face,

50
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.030
Than bear so low a sail,to strike to thee.

51
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.830
Sail how thou canst, havewind and tide thy friend,

52
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.700
This hand, fast woundabout thy coal-black hair

53
00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.970
Shall, whiles thy head iswarm and new cut off,

54
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.670
Write in the dust thissentence with thy blood,

55
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.670
'Wind-changing Warwick nowcan change no more.'

56
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.570
O cheerful colours! seewhere Oxford comes!

57
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.070
Oxford, Oxford, forLancaster!

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.700
The gates are open, let usenter too.

59
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.300
So other foes may set uponour backs.

60
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.970
Stand we in good array;for they no doubt

61
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.900
Will issue out again andbid us battle:

62
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.370
If not, the city being butof small defence,

63
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.730
We'll quickly rouse thetraitors in the same.

64
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.670
O, welcome, Oxford! for wewant thy help.

65
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.270
Montague, Montague, forLancaster!

66
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.630
Thou and thy brother bothshall buy this treason

67
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.770
Even with the dearestblood your bodies bear.

68
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.300
The harder match'd, thegreater victory:

69
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.900
My mind presageth happygain and conquest.

70
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.370
Somerset, Somerset, forLancaster!

71
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.570
Two of thy name, bothDukes of Somerset,

72
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.170
Have sold their lives untothe house of York;

73
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.570
And thou shalt be thethird if this sword hold.

74
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.770
And lo, where George ofClarence sweeps along,

75
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.770
Of force enough to bid hisbrother battle;

76
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.570
With whom an upright zealto right prevails

77
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.970
More than the nature of abrother's love!

78
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.570
Clarence. Clarence forLancaster.

79
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.970
et tu Brute. Wilt thou stabCaesar to?

80
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.530
A parley sent to George ofClarence.

81
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.500
(horn sounds)

82
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.070
Come, Clarence, come; thouwilt, if Warwick call.

83
00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.830
Father of Warwick, knowyou what this means?

84
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.570
Look here, I throw myinfamy at thee

85
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.470
I will not ruinate myfather's house,

86
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.430
Who gave his blood to linethe stones together,

87
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.170
And set up Lancaster. Why,trow'st thou, Warwick,

88
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.870
That Clarence is so harsh,so blunt, unnatural,

89
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.930
To bend the fatalinstruments of war

90
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.800
Against his brother andhis lawful king?

91
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.700
Perhaps thou wilt objectmy holy oath:

92
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.570
To keep that oath weremore impiety

93
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.300
Than Jephthah's, when hesacrificed his daughter.

94
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.530
I am so sorry for mytrespass made

95
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.500
That, to deserve well atmy brother's hands,

96
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.200
I here proclaim myself thymortal foe,

97
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.500
With resolution,wheresoe'er I meet thee--

98
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.970
As I will meet thee, ifthou stir abroad--

99
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.570
To plague thee for thyfoul misleading me.

100
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.170
And so, proud-heartedWarwick, I defy thee,

101
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.270
And to my brother turn myblushing cheeks.

102
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.400
Pardon me, Edward, I willmake amends:

103
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.330
And, Richard, do not frownupon my faults,

104
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.930
For I will henceforth beno more unconstant.

105
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.000
Now welcome more, and tentimes more beloved,

106
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.530
Than if thou never hadstdeserved our hate.

107
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.830
Welcome, good Clarence;this is brotherlike.

108
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.370
O passing traitor,perjured and unjust!

109
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.200
What, Warwick, wilt thouleave the town and fight?

110
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.500
Or shall we beat thestones about thine ears?

111
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.730


112
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.570
Alas, I am not coop'd herefor defence!

113
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.370
I will away towards Barnetpresently,

114
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.530
And bid thee battle,Edward, if thou darest.

115
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.330
Yes, Warwick, Edwarddares, and leads the way.

116
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.870
Lords, to the field; SaintGeorge and victory!

117
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:14.900
(â™ªdrums horns)

118
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:20.070
So, lie thou there: diethou, and die our fear;

119
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.630
For Warwick was a bug thatfear'd us all.

120
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.930
Now, Montague, sit fast; Iseek for thee,

121
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.570
That Warwick's bones maykeep thine company.

122
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:58.630
Ah, who is nigh? come tome, friend or foe,

123
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:09.670
And tell me who is victor,York or Warwick?

124
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:21.570
Why ask I that? my mangledbody shows,

125
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:29.670
My blood, my want of strength,my sick heart shows.

126
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:35.270
That I must yield my bodyto the earth

127
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:42.870
And, by my fall, theconquest to my foe.

128
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:50.170
Thus yields the cedar tothe axe's edge,

129
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:55.330
Whose arms gave shelter tothe princely eagle,

130
00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:01.070
Under whose shade theramping lion slept,

131
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.570
Whose top-branch overpeer'dJove's spreading tree

132
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:14.000
And kept low shrubs fromwinter's powerful wind.

133
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.470
These eyes, that now are dimm'dwith death's black veil,

134
00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.430
Have been as piercing asthe mid-day sun,

135
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:28.670
To search the secrettreasons of the world:

136
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.900
The wrinkles in my brows,now filled with blood,

137
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.930
Were liken'd oft to kinglysepulchres;

138
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.230
For who lived king, but Icould dig his grave?

139
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:47.070
And who durst smile whenWarwick bent his brow?

140
00:11:50.870 --> 00:12:01.530
Lo, now my glory smear'din dust and blood!

141
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:08.330
My parks, my walks, mymanors that I had.

142
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:15.700
Even now forsake me, andof all my lands

143
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.030
Is nothing left me but mybody's length.

144
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:36.370
Why, what is pomp, rule,reign, but earth and dust?

145
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:45.000
And, live we how we can,yet die we must.

146
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:56.070
Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wertthou as we are.

147
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.970
We might recover all ourloss again;

148
00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:02.330
The queen from France hathbrought a puissant power:

149
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.600
Even now we heard the news:ah, could'st thou fly!

150
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:15.900
Why, then I would not fly.Ah, Montague,

151
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:21.870
If thou be there, sweetbrother, take my hand.

152
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:27.570
And with thy lips keep inmy soul awhile!

153
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.030
Thou lovest me not; for,brother, if thou didst,

154
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.670
Thy tears would wash thiscold congealed blood

155
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:46.330
That glues my lips andwill not let me speak.

156
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.970
Come quickly, Montague, orI am dead.

157
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:54.900
Ah, Warwick! Montague hathbreathed his last;

158
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.530
And to the latest gaspcried out for Warwick,

159
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.930
And said 'Commend me to myvaliant brother.'

160
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.670
And more he would havesaid, and more he spoke,

161
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.370
Which sounded like acanon in a vault,

162
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.330
That might not bedistinguished; but at last

163
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:14.470
I well might hear,delivered with a groan,

164
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.170
'O, farewell, Warwick!'

165
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:27.930
Sweet rest his soul! Fly,lords, and save yourselves;

166
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:33.870
For Warwick bids you allfarewell to meet in heaven.

167
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:27.500
Away, away, to meet thequeen's great power!

168
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.830


169
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.670
(â™ªhorns and cheers)

170
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.170
Thus far our fortune keepsan upward course,

171
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.130
And we are graced withwreaths of victory.

172
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:54.500
But, in the midst of thisbright-shining day,

173
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.400
I spy a black, suspicious,threatening cloud,

174
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.630
That will encounter withour glorious sun,

175
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.870
Ere he attain his easefulwestern bed:

176
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.700
I mean, my lords, thosepowers that the queen

177
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.930
Hath raised in Gallia havearrived our coast

178
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.670
And, as we hear, march onto fight with us.

179
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.530
A little gale will soondisperse that cloud

180
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.670
And blow it to the sourcefrom whence it came:

181
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:22.200
Thy very beams will drythose vapours up,

182
00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.800
For every cloud engendersnot a storm.

183
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.730
The queen is valued thirtythousand strong,

184
00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.500
And Somerset, with Oxfordfled to her:

185
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.000
If she have time tobreathe be well assured

186
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.730
Her faction will be fullas strong as ours.

187
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.400
We are advertised by ourloving friends

188
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.400
That they do hold theircourse toward Tewksbury:

189
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.170
We, having now the best atBarnet field,

190
00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.900
Will thither straight, forwillingness rids way;

191
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.900
And, as we march, ourstrength will be augmented

192
00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.200
In every county as we goalong.

193
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.330
Strike up the drum; cry'Courage!' and away.

194
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:05.000
(drums sounds) Courage!

195
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:48.330
Great lords, wise men ne'ersit and wail their loss,

196
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.930
But cheerly seek how toredress their harms.

197
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.500
What though the mast benow blown overboard,

198
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.130
The cable broke, theholding-anchor lost,

199
00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.470
And half our sailorsswallow'd in the flood?

200
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:09.470
Yet lives our pilot still.Is't meet that he

201
00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:12.730
Should leave the helm andlike a fearful lad

202
00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.430
With tearful eyes addwater to the sea

203
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.400
And give more strength tothat which hath too much,

204
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.970
Whiles, in his moan, theship splits on the rocks,

205
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.970
Which industry and couragemight have saved?

206
00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:37.530
Ah, what a shame! ah, whata fault were this!

207
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:46.930
Say Warwick was ouranchor; what of that?

208
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:54.370
And Montague our topmost;what of him?

209
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:59.170
Our slaughter'd friends thetackles; what of these?

210
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:04.030
Why, is not Oxford hereanother anchor?

211
00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:08.670
And Somerset anothergoodly mast?

212
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.670
The friends of France ourshrouds and tacklings?

213
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:17.230
And, though unskilful, whynot Ned and I

214
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:22.100
For once allow'd theskilful pilot's charge?

215
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.430
We will not from the helmto sit and weep,

216
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:31.630
But keep our course, thoughthe rough wind say no,

217
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:36.230
From shelves and rocks thatthreaten us with wreck.

218
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:41.970
As good to chide the wavesas speak them fair.

219
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:49.430
And what is Edward butruthless sea?

220
00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:55.770
What Clarence but aquicksand of deceit?

221
00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:02.200
And Richard but a raggedfatal rock?

222
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:11.430
All these the enemies toour poor bark.

223
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:18.030
Say you can swim; alas,'tis but a while!

224
00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:23.800
Tread on the sand; why,there you quickly sink:

225
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.770
Bestride the rock; thetide will wash you off,

226
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:39.430
Or else you famish; that'sa threefold death.

227
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:45.600
This speak I, lords, tolet you understand,

228
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.170
If case some one of youwould fly from us,

229
00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:54.930
That there's no hoped-formercy with the brothers

230
00:21:54.930 --> 00:22:05.500
More than with ruthlesswaves, with sands and rocks.

231
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:14.300
Why, courage then! whatcannot be avoided

232
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:22.700
'Twere childish weaknessto lament or fear.

233
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.070
Methinks a woman of thisvaliant spirit

234
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.430
Should, if a coward heardher speak these words,

235
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:33.400
Infuse his breast withmagnanimity

236
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.870
And make him, naked, foila man at arms.

237
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:44.470
I speak not this asdoubting any here

238
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.230
For did I but suspect afearful man

239
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.370
He should have leave to goaway betimes,

240
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.830
Lest in our need he mightinfect another

241
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:57.700
And make him of likespirit to himself.

242
00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.570
If any such be here--asGod forbid!--

243
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.970
Let him depart before weneed his help.

244
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:12.500
Women and children of sohigh a courage,

245
00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:20.070
And warriors faint! why,'twere perpetual shame.

246
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.270
O brave young prince! thyfamous grandfather

247
00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.670
Doth live again in thee:long mayst thou live

248
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.930
To bear his image andrenew his glories!

249
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:32.830
And he that will not fightfor such a hope.

250
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:36.870
Go home to bed, and likethe owl by day,

251
00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:41.500
If he arise, be mock'd andwonder'd at.

252
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.600
Thanks, gentle Somerset;sweet Oxford, thanks.

253
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.400
And take his thanks thatyet hath nothing else.

254
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.370
Prepare you, lords, forEdward is at hand.

255
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.870
Ready to fight; thereforebe resolute.

256
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:54.830
I thought no less: it ishis policy

257
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:56.370
To haste thus fast, tofind us unprovided.

258
00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:59.870
But he's deceived; we arein readiness.

259
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.400
(crowd) Ay!

260
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.600
This cheers my heart, tosee your forwardness.

261
00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.870
Here pitch our battle;hence we will not budge.

262
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:17.600
(â™ªtrumpet, battle cries)

263
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.670
(Edward yells fromoutside the walls)

264
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:25.170
Brave followers, yonderstands the thorny wood,

265
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:29.900
Which, by the heavens'assistance and your strength,

266
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.830
Must by the roots be hewnup yet ere night.

267
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.030
I need not add more fuelto your fire,

268
00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:43.630
For well I wot ye blaze toburn them out

269
00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:49.000
Give signal to the fight,and to it, lords!

270
00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:01.500
Lords, knights, andgentlemen, what I should say

271
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:07.470
My tears gainsay; forevery word I speak,

272
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.530
Ye see, I drink the waterof my eye.

273
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.530
Therefore, no more but this:Henry, your sovereign,

274
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:19.670
Is prisoner to the foe;his state usurp'd,

275
00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.770
His realm a slaughter-house,his subjects slain,

276
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.470
His statutes cancell'd andhis treasure spent;

277
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:33.200
And yonder stands the wolfthat makes this spoil.

278
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:39.770
You fight in justice lords:then, in God's name, lords,

279
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:44.970
Be valiant and give signalto the fight.

280
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.700
Now here a period oftumultuous broils.

281
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:21.800
Away with Oxford to HamesCastle straight:

282
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.170
For Somerset, off with hisguilty head.

283
00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.400
Go, bear them hence; Iwill not hear them speak.

284
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.670
For my part, I'll nottrouble thee with words.

285
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:35.330
Nor I, but stoop withpatience to my fortune.

286
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.400
So part we sadly in thistroublous world,

287
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.400
To meet with joy in sweetJerusalem.

288
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.230
Is proclamation made, thatwho finds Edward

289
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.530
Shall have a high reward,and he his life?

290
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:56.600
It is: and lo, whereyouthful Edward comes!

291
00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.770
Bring forth the gallant,let us hear him speak.

292
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.800
What! can so young a thornbegin to prick?

293
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:21.600
Edward, what satisfactioncanst thou make

294
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:28.100
For bearing arms, forstirring up my subjects,

295
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:32.330
And all the trouble thouhast turn'd me to?

296
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:40.130
Speak like a subject,proud ambitious York!

297
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:42.930
Suppose that I am now myfather's mouth;

298
00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:47.170
Resign thy chair, andwhere I stand kneel thou,

299
00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.800
Whilst I propose theselfsame words to thee,

300
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.030
Which traitor, thouwouldst have me answer to.

301
00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:56.070
Ah, that thy father hadbeen so resolved!

302
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.470
That you might still haveworn the petticoat,

303
00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.630
And ne'er have stol'n thebreech from Lancaster.

304
00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:01.400
Let AEsop fable in awinter's night;

305
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.870
His currish riddles sortnot with this place.

306
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:06.100
By heaven, brat, I'llplague ye for that word.

307
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.470
Ay, thou wast born to be aplague to men.

308
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:10.400
For God's sake, take awaythis captive scold.

309
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.670
Nay, take away thisscolding crookback rather.

310
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:14.630
Peace, wilful boy, or Iwill charm your tongue.

311
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.170
Untutor'd lad, thou arttoo malapert.

312
00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:19.970
I know my duty; you areall undutiful:

313
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:24.870
Lascivious Edward, andthou perjured George,

314
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:29.130
And thou mis-shapen Dick,I tell ye all

315
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:31.470
I am your better, traitorsas ye are:

316
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:34.730
And thou usurp'st myfather's right and mine.

317
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.930
Take that, thou likenessof this railer here.

318
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.300
Sprawl'st thou? take that,to end thy agony.

319
00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.970
And there's for twittingme with perjury.

320
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.800
O, kill me too!

321
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.800
Marry, and shall.

322
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.400
Hold, Richard, hold; forwe have done too much.

323
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.500
Why should she live, tofill the world with words?

324
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.970
What, doth she swoon? usemeans for her recovery.

325
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.200
Clarence, excuse me to theking my brother;

326
00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.200
I'll hence to London on aserious matter:

327
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.000
Ere ye come there, be sureto hear some news.

328
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.070
What? what?

329
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:10.070
The Tower, the Tower. I'll rootthem out.

330
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:23.800
O Ned, sweet Ned! speak tothy mother, boy!

331
00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:37.730
Canst thou not speak? Otraitors! murderers!

332
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:48.800
They that stabb'd Caesarshed no blood at all,

333
00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:53.030
Did not offend, nor werenot worthy blame,

334
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:59.200
If this foul deed were byto equal it:

335
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:05.700
He was a man; this, inrespect, a child:

336
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:11.770
And men ne'er spend theirfury on a child.

337
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:18.600
What's worse than murderer,that I may name it?

338
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:29.230
No, no, my heart willburst, and if I speak:

339
00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:36.330
And I will speak, that somy heart may burst.

340
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:47.770
Butchers and villains!bloody cannibals!

341
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:56.430
How sweet a plant have youuntimely cropp'd!

342
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.900
You have no children,butchers! if you had,

343
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.500
The thought of them wouldhave stirr'd up remorse:

344
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.930
But if you ever chance tohave a child,

345
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.130
Look in his youth to havehim so cut off

346
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.470
As, deathmen, you have ridthis sweet young prince!

347
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:17.030
Away with her; go, bearher hence perforce.

348
00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:27.670
Nay, never bear me hence,dispatch me here,

349
00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.700
Here sheathe thy sword,I'll pardon thee my death:

350
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:37.000
What, wilt thou not? then,Clarence, do it thou.

351
00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:39.470
By heaven, I will not dothee so much ease.

352
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.170
Good Clarence, do; sweetClarence, do thou do it.

353
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.770
Didst thou not hear meswear I would not do it?

354
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.900
Ay, but thou usest toforswear thyself:

355
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.970
'Twas sin before, but now'tis charity.

356
00:33:52.470 --> 00:34:02.470
What, wilt thou not? Where isthat devil's butcher? Richard.

357
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:08.870
Hard-favour'd Richard?Where art thou?

358
00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:18.400
Thou art not here: murderis thy alms-deed;

359
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.200
Petitioners for blood thoune'er put'st back.

360
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.570
Away, I say; I charge ye,bear her hence.

361
00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.600
So come to you and yours,as to this Prince!

362
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.170
Where's Richard gone?

363
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:57.630
To London, all in post;and, as I guess,

364
00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.500
To make a bloody supper inthe Tower.

365
00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:05.370
He's sudden, if a thingcomes in his head.

366
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:22.500
Now march we hence:discharge the common sort

367
00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.870
With pay and thanks, andlet's away to London

368
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.100
To see our gentle queenhow well she fares:

369
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:33.830
By this, I hope, she hatha son for me.

370
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.130
Good day, my lord. What,at your book so hard?

371
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.230
Ay, my good lord:--mylord, I should say rather;

372
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:23.630
'Tis sin to flatter;'good' was little better:

373
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.270
'Good Gloucester' and'good devil' were alike,

374
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.130
And both preposterous;therefore, not 'good lord.'

375
00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:36.870
Sirrah, leave us toourselves: we must confer.

376
00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.730
So flies the recklessshepherd from the wolf;

377
00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.870
So first the harmless sheepdoth yield his fleece

378
00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:53.570
And next his throat unto thebutcher's knife.

379
00:36:53.570 --> 00:37:03.670
What scene of death hathRoscius now to act?

380
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:22.400
What scene of death hathRoscius now to act?

381
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.930
Suspicion always hauntsthe guilty mind;

382
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:31.200
The thief doth fear eachbush an officer.

383
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.130
The bird that hath beenlimed in a bush,

384
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.800
With trembling wingsmisdoubteth every bush;

385
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.470
And I, the hapless male toone sweet bird,

386
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.400
Have now the fatal objectin my eye

387
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:47.100
Where my poor young waslimed, was caught and kill'd.

388
00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.900
Why, what a peevish foolwas that of Crete,

389
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.700
That taught his son theoffice of a fowl!

390
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.470
An yet, for all his wings,the fool was drown'd.

391
00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:04.300
I, Daedalus; my poor boy,Icarus;

392
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.570
Thy father, Minos, thatdenied our course;

393
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.530
The sun that sear'd thewings of my sweet boy

394
00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.500
Thy brother Edward, andthyself the sea

395
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.730
Whose envious gulf didswallow up his life.

396
00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:21.900
Ah, kill me with thyweapon, not with words!

397
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.570
My breast can better brookthy dagger's point

398
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.700
Than can my ears thattragic history.

399
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:35.230
But wherefore dost thoucome? is't for my life?

400
00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.570
Think'st thou I am anexecutioner?

401
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.800
A persecutor, I am sure,thou art:

402
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:44.230
If murdering innocents beexecuting,

403
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.630
Why, then thou art anexecutioner.

404
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:47.670
Thy son I kill'd for hispresumption.

405
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.170
Hadst thou been kill'd whenfirst thou didst presume,

406
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:52.800
Thou hadst not lived tokill a son of mine.

407
00:38:53.370 --> 00:38:57.900
And thus I prophesy, thatmany a thousand,

408
00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.700
Which now mistrust noparcel of my fear,

409
00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.070
And many an old man's sighand many a widow's,

410
00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.330
And many an orphan'swater-standing eye--

411
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:11.570
Men for their sons, wivesfor their husbands,

412
00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:15.070
And orphans for theirparents timeless death--

413
00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:18.800
Shall rue the hour thatever thou wast born.

414
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:24.530
The owl shriek'd at thybirth,--an evil sign;

415
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:28.370
The night-crow cried,aboding luckless time;

416
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:33.670
Dogs howl'd, and hideoustempest shook down trees;

417
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.300
The raven rook'd her onthe chimney's top,

418
00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:40.030
And chattering pies indismal discords sung.

419
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.100
Thy mother felt more thana mother's pain,

420
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.730
And, yet brought forthless than a mother's hope,

421
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.800
To wit, an indigested anddeformed lump,

422
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.800
Not like the fruit of sucha goodly tree.

423
00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.830
Teeth hadst thou in thyhead when thou wast born,

424
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:58.730
To signify thou camest tobite the world:

425
00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:01.730
And, if the rest be truewhich I have heard,

426
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:02.770
Thou camest--

427
00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:06.400
I'll hear no more: die,prophet in thy speech:

428
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.830
For this amongst the rest,was I ordain'd.

429
00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:13.070
Ay, and for much moreslaughter after this.

430
00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.870
God forgive my sins, andpardon thee!

431
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.430
What, will the aspiringblood of Lancaster

432
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:28.600
Sink in the ground? I thoughtit would have mounted.

433
00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.470
See how my sword weeps forthe poor king's death!

434
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.270
O, may such purple tearsbe alway shed

435
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:37.130
From those that wish thedownfall of our house!

436
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:40.770
If any spark of life beyet remaining,

437
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:46.100
Down, down to hell; andsay I sent thee thither:

438
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:53.230
I, that have neither pity,love, nor fear.

439
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:57.170
Indeed, 'tis true thatHenry told me of;

440
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.500
For I have often heard mymother say

441
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.430
I came into the world withmy legs forward:

442
00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:04.600
Had I not reason, thinkye, to make haste,

443
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.700
And seek their ruin thatusurp'd our right?

444
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.630
The midwife wonder'd andthe women cried

445
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.600
'O, Jesus bless us, he isborn with teeth!'

446
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.500
And so I was; whichplainly signified

447
00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:27.330
That I should snarl andbite and play the dog.

448
00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.030
Then, since the heavenshave shaped my body so,

449
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:36.000
Let hell make crook'd mymind to answer it.

450
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.170
I have no brother, I amlike no brother;

451
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.570
And this word 'love,' whichgraybeards call divine,

452
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.200
Be resident in men likeone another

453
00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:52.230
And not in me: I am myselfalone.

454
00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:10.330
Clarence, beware; thoukeep'st me from the light:

455
00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:15.230
But I will sort a pitchyday for thee;

456
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:16.470
For I will buz abroad suchprophecies

457
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.130
That Edward shall befearful of his life,

458
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.770
And then, to purge hisfear, I'll be thy death.

459
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.700
King Henry and the princehis son are gone:

460
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.930
Clarence, thy turn isnext, and then the rest,

461
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.500
Counting myself but badtill I be best.

462
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.300
I'll throw thy body inanother room

463
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.330
And triumph, Henry, in thyday of doom.

464
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:23.670
(â™ª drums horns)

465

466
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.800
(group) Long live Edward theFourth!

467
00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:33.130
Once more we sit inEngland's royal throne,

468
00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:38.500
Re-purchased with theblood of enemies.

469
00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.570
What valiant foemen, liketo autumn's corn,

470
00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:47.930
Have we mow'd down, intops of all their pride!

471
00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.430
Three Dukes of Somerset,threefold renown'd

472
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.030
For hardy and undoubtedchampions;

473
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:58.530
Two Cliffords, as thefather and the son,

474
00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:04.430
With them, the two bravebears, Warwick and Montague,

475
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.770
That in their chainsfetter'd the kingly lion

476
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:13.230
And made the foresttremble when they roar'd.

477
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:18.630
Thus have we sweptsuspicion from our seat

478
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:24.830
And made our footstool ofsecurity.

479
00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:30.470
Come hither, Bess, and letme kiss my boy.

480
00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:51.600
Young Ned, for thee, thineuncles and myself

481
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.100
Have in our armours watch'dthe winter's night,

482
00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.030
Went all afoot in summer'sscalding heat,

483
00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:04.470
That thou mightst repossessthe crown in peace;

484
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:09.330
And of our labours thoushalt reap the gain.

485
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:15.900
Clarence and Gloucester,love my lovely queen;

486
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.630
And kiss your princelynephew, brothers both.

487
00:46:23.270 --> 00:46:25.270
The duty that I owe untoyour majesty

488
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:27.970
I seal upon the lips ofthis sweet babe.

489
00:46:27.970 --> 00:46:30.400
Thanks, noble Clarence;worthy brother, thanks.

490
00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.470
And, that I love the treefrom whence thou sprang'st,

491
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:37.130
Witness the loving kiss Igive the fruit.

492
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:40.170
To say the truth soJudas kissed his master

493
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:43.330
And cried 'all hail!' whenas he meant all harm.

494
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:47.100
Now am I seated as my souldelights,

495
00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.570
Having my country's peaceand brothers' loves.

496
00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:53.530
What will your grace havedone with Margaret?

497
00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.470
Reignier, her father, tothe king of France

498
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:58.170
Hath pawn'd the Sicils andJerusalem,

499
00:46:58.170 --> 00:46:59.630
And hither have they sentit for her ransom.

500
00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.570
Away with her, and wafther hence to France.

501
00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.870
And now what rests butthat we spend the time

502
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:09.730
With stately triumphs,mirthful comic shows,

503
00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:12.370
Such as befits thepleasure of the court?

504
00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:16.670
Sound drums and trumpets!farewell sour annoy!

505
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:22.670
For here, I hope, beginsour lasting joy.
