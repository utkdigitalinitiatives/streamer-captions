1
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.570
For hundreds of centuries andlong after men had settled inthe land masses of Europe,

2
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.370
Asia and Africa,

3
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.700
this continent was unknown toany human being.

4
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.600
In swamps and valleys the sizeof Scotland

5
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.600
animals unknown in Europedisturbed only each other.

6
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:42.700
Strange birds of prey wheeledsafely over an empty continent.

7
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.770
At some point, we suppose notlater than 15,000 BC,

8
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.330
humans drifted down from Asiaand the Aleutians,

9
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.500
ranged the length and breadth ofthe Americas,

10
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.600
built and exhaustedcivilizations we know nothingabout.

11
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.400
Today there are only a fewancient relics,

12
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.470
such as this one in a remotecanyon of northern Arizona.

13
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.270
There were nations that neverknew each other, five hundredlanguages,

14
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.900
tribes that worshipped a bison,or a matriarch, or the corn theygrew.

15
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.400
There were tribes ruled bywarriors;

16
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.670
or by women farmers;

17
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.570
or by sacred elders.

18
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:48.530
Tribes that had never heard ofwar

19
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.530
and tribes debauched bycenturies of fighting.

20
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.630
Hollywood has often restaged thesight and sound of imaginarydances

21
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.630
but those sounds you hear arenot those of 25-dollar a dayIndian extras.

22
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.570
These are Apaches of the 1970's,for once in their history

23
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.370
allowing us to watch all but themost sacred moments

24
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.600
of an annual ceremony in whichsupernatural figures celebrate

25
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.600
the passage of their women fromchildhood to puberty.

26
00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.030
So for at least 150 centuriesbefore Yankee Doodle theirs wasthe American Way of Life.

27
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.900
But for better or worse this iswhat we've made of it.

28
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.130
And it is the past four-hundredyears that we think of as thehistory

29
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.130
of the land that becamethe United States.

30
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.800
I've been discovering thathistory for 40 years of reading

31
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.600
and travel throughout the UnitedStates,

32
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.370
and for 20 of those years I'velived here in this apartment

33
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.730
which overlooks Central Park inNew York City.

34
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:50.400
For most of my time as a foreigncorrespondent this has been mydaily map of the United States

35
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.100
- and I mean literally a map.

36
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.730
I once had a secretary who washopeless at geography and tohelp her -

37
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.530
and me find the right books,

38
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.800
I arranged them in this order;everything on New England is inthe north-east corner.

39
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.800
You go right down the coast toFlorida.

40
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.300
Across the Deep South, the SouthWest to California.

41
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.430
Up to Oregon, Washington -andyou have to have high boots toreach Alaska.

42
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.000
Now, because of a continuinginterest in California history,

43
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.070
California tends to go half wayacross the country

44
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:26.230
and spill right over into Texas,rather like a Californian'smental map of the United States.

45
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.370
Well, we all lay great stress onour favorite states and placesand people.

46
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.930
Don't be upset if some of yoursget squeezed out.

47
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:38.370
I have a man I'm mad about -overthere - Benjamin Franklin,

48
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.230
and I'm not sure that even hewill make it.

49
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.400
You know, when I told an oldSoutherner, a friend of mine,that I was going to try

50
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:56.270
and tell my version of Americanhistory in thirteen hours, hesaid 'better talk fast boy'.

51
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.100
So we ought to begin with thesimple colossal question

52
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.130
who was the first white man todiscover America,

53
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.400
which incidentally was namedafter a Florentine business manand promoter,

54
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.700
who promoted himself so well asto get his first name attachedto a continent,

55
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.300
he was Amerigo Vespucci.

56
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.130
He took no part in the earlyvoyages, so who was the first?

57
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.000
Well, there are people who arehot for the Vikings;

58
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.530
now we hear that the Phoenicianswere here first;

59
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:32.600
no, the Jews - who presumablytook one look at New York Cityand beat it back to the Nile.

60
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.500
The records of the earliestvoyages are either lost, orhighly debatable.

61
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.970
But there was one historicexpedition which is documentedbeyond all question.

62
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.900
Which is why we're going into mykitchen.

63
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.900
You know, some of the greatexplosions of history have beencaused

64
00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:02.470
by nothing more than thedenial of a simple human need.

65
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:11.170
Like a shortage of water, or toomany people in a small country,a total absence of timber,

66
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:20.230
which has plagued the Egyptianssince the time of Solomon.

67
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.900
Today we think of these spices-pepper, paprika,

68
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:30.070
cinnamon, cloves - as no morethan gilt to the lily.

69
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.530
But in the 15th century theywere what made food edible.

70
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.130
They had salt but no other wayof preserving food,

71
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:39.530
and even in rich houses, itoften came to the table putrid,

72
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.130
so these spices deceived thepalate,

73
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:47.070
if not the digestion, which theysometimes still do.

74
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.930
Now, in 1453 the Turks conqueredConstantinople

75
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.530
(our Istanbul) and it was thegateway to Asia.

76
00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:00.170
So what they'd done was to shutoff Europe from Asia, which waswhere the spices came from.

77
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:06.430
That's to say from here -fromthe Molucca Islands betweenBorneo and the Philippines.

78
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:11.430
It's astounding to me that thename -the Moluccas -is not asfamous as London or Boston,

79
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.330
because they were the SpiceIslands where the natives grew

80
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:20.470
and packed their preciousproducts for the Turks and forEurope.

81
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:25.300
How to reach them, exceptthrough Constantinople?

82
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.200
There was a superb sailor, anItalian who not only thought heknew how,

83
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.870
but was determined to do ithimself.

84
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.930
For many years a master marinerwith the Portuguese,

85
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.330
who then had the best merchantmarine in Europe,

86
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:42.230
he had spent much time withastronomers and mathematicianswho believed,

87
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.530
unlike many sailors, that theearth was round.

88
00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.270
The known map of the world was asingle land mass

89
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:55.770
as flat as a pancake with theunknown Ocean Sea around it.

90
00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:01.030
But if it was a sphere you couldobviously sail from the Westernextreme to the eastern,

91
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:08.330
to Japan, China and Indonesia,to the Indies where the spiceslay.

92
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:16.930
So thought Cristoforo Colombo.This tough, passionate Christianheld visionary talks with god,

93
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:22.200
but they did not cloud hisinstinct for ten per cent -whichwas what he demanded and got,

94
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.500
for all the loot of the lands hemight discover.

95
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.670
After a 15 years trek aroundEurope, he found his sponsors inthe King and Queen of Spain

96
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.900
who coveted the spice trade,needed gold for their dwindlingtreasury,

97
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.500
and shared Columbus'shorror of the infidel Turk.

98
00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.130
So they packed him off on hismission 'for gospel and forgold.'

99
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.070
And here in Barcelona harbor isa replica of the ship in whichColumbus sailed,

100
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.500
the Santa Maria.

101
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.330
Today it would not be acceptableas a yacht

102
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.400
by any self-respecting member ofthe jet set.

103
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.770
One hundred tons only and 75feet long,

104
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.300
it was not by a longshot one of the big ships of thetime,

105
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.370
but it would have to be sturdyenough to withstand roaringstorms

106
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:12.470
and quick enough to take shelterin the shallow channels of theimagined Atlantic Islands.

107
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.570
It was payed with pitch againstbarnacles,

108
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.670
had stones for ballast and amain mast as long as the keel.

109
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.670
The other two ships were smallerstill.

110
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:36.400
Here in the stern is Columbus'scabin and his bed.

111
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.670
Incidentally he was six feet,which in those days wasenormous,

112
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:47.900
and by the time he landed hemust have been permanently bentover.

113
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.830
And here he would have hischarts.

114
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.230
He'd been in the chartbusiness with his brother foryears

115
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.700
and, an odd detail about theprovisions.

116
00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.330
Naturally they carried red winewhich was a standard laxative,

117
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:07.600
but two-and-a-half liters perman per day, which sounds likean awful lot.

118
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.100
I suppose they meant it to keepthem philosophical if the worsthappened.

119
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.700
There were forty men aboard,including a surgeon and theKing's Controller of Accounts,

120
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:23.100
to keep tabs on Columbus'sswindle sheets when he startedto figure the cost of the gold

121
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.830
and the spices he was going totake.

122
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:29.370
There was a converted Jew whospoke Arabic,

123
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.500
which they thought was verysimilar to Chinese and so he'dbe the interpreter.

124
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:38.200
One Portuguese, another Italianand the rest were Spaniards.

125
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:46.530
And so on the evening of the 2ndAugust 1492 the entire crew wentashore for confession,

126
00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:49.530
received absolution for theirsins,

127
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.200
and on the morning of the 3rd,they set sail from Palos.

128
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.800
They sailed all through Augustand September

129
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.570
and saw none of the islandsthey'd expected.

130
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.770
The crews grew weary, thennervous, then panicky and wereclose to mutiny.

131
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.030
Maybe the world wasn't round.Maybe they'd fall off intospace.

132
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.170
The two other captains beggedColumbus to turn back.

133
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:32.700
He had drastically miscalculatedby about eighty per cent thewidth of the Ocean Sea,

134
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.870
so he faked the log by reducingthe mileage they'd gone fromSpain.

135
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:42.600
And to redress this deceit hetells us 'he pray'd mightily tothe Lord'.

136
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.070
Well, by Divine Intervention -orluck - on the following day, the12th October,

137
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:56.970
he sighted as he believed themainland of Asia or one of itsoffshore islands.

138
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:03.770
We know it was San Salvador, inthe Bahamas, and he went on toexplore Haiti and Cuba.

139
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.730
Like most eager travelers,Columbus found what he waslooking for.

140
00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:13.600
He decided that Cuba was Japan.He was a little baffled by theabsence of cities.

141
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.200
But there were spices, andcotton, and weird birds andcoppery colored natives

142
00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.230
who kept assuring him there weremountains of gold inland. Alwaysfurther inland.

143
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.070
If this was so

144
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:30.970
the slaves to work the goldmines were already on hand inthese peaceable natives.

145
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.370
He was almost convinced and likea good salesman he hurried backto Spain

146
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:40.630
with what we should call displaysamples of the products he'dgathered;

147
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.170
exotic plants, an alligator,brilliant parrots,

148
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:53.100
prize natives got up like showhorses, some gold.

149
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:59.200
Columbus's sales exhibition wasa total success and his nextfleet was 17 ships

150
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.530
and fifteen hundred men,sailors, soldiers, adventurers,rushed to found gold

151
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:07.170
and silver mining colonies,

152
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:12.730
and there was a clutch ofpriests along to sanctify thenecessary slaves.

153
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:18.130
But this time he really did findgold. And there now began thelongest,

154
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:23.870
the most determined and the mostbrutal, gold rush in history.

155
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:28.570
If the natives were sulky orhostile they were terrified intosubmission

156
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.370
by two acts of magicthat they'd never seen.

157
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:37.730
One was the firing of monstermachines called cannons, and theother was the appearance -

158
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:43.400
and this always worked of livingmonsters called horses.

159
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:49.300
There were many brave priestsalong who were sickened by theoutrages along the trail.

160
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:54.530
And there's an unforgettablestory of a native king who wasabout to be burned at the stake,

161
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.430
and as he felt the first firesrise on his body,

162
00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:01.900
he refused baptism on thegrounds that he might go toheaven

163
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.330
'and meet there onlyChristians'.

164
00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.830
Within fifty years of Columbussighting San Salvador theSpaniards had plundered

165
00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.030
and conquered the whole ofCentral America and Peru.

166
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.870
Now the Pope had proclaimed thateverything one hundred leagueswest of the Azores

167
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.830
belonged to Spain or her brotherPortugal.

168
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:27.070
But some nations refused to bowto this proclamation, mostdramatically the King of France.

169
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:33.570
"We fail", he said, "to findthis clause in Adam's will".

170
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.800
The first French arrivals onlytwelve years after Columbus

171
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:41.530
were Breton fishermen workingthe cod banks off Nova Scotia.

172
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.200
But they soon came on Indianseager to barter furs for bits ofmetal and gunpowder,

173
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.000
so they abandoned the cod,penetrated the Gulf and theRiver St. Lawrence

174
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.700
and trapped and skinned everyanimal in sight.

175
00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.070
These humble trappers wereincidentally

176
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:02.130
putting out the tentacles of theFrench Empire in the north.

177
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.170
While down in Mexico City,Cortes,

178
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.570
a penniless noblemanturned soldier was crowninghimself as a Mexican God.

179
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:18.170
The Spaniards were now ready toinvestigate their favorite myth

180
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:23.370
that to the north lay sevencities of gold.

181
00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:25.370
So in 1540 another soldier,

182
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:30.530
Francisco Vasquez de Coronado,marched north to find them.

183
00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.200
He started from Mexico withthree hundred men,

184
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:39.200
a horde of Indians, hundreds ofhorses, mules, cattle, sheep,goats and priests.

185
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.330
They marched for two years goingup through Arizona

186
00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:45.270
and New Mexico and Texas,wheeling north-east

187
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.200
into the middle of the presentstate of Kansas.

188
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.770
To us their expectations seempreposterous based on a wholeSpanish literature

189
00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:01.100
which said that North Americacontained volcanoes andmermaids,

190
00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:07.070
and was the place where Judastook his annual winter vacationfrom the fires of hell.

191
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.670
Also the splendid golden objectsthat abounded in Central America

192
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:15.330
were said to hang in the northfrom trees.

193
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.800
They found no cities, no gold,much less trees to hang it on.

194
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.900
Nothing but an endless lunarlandscape.

195
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.400
But these were the rigors of thesoldier's lot.

196
00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.470
Their one consolation was thatthe native humans at least couldbe conquered and hired to serve.

197
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.370
But once they came on aseemingly invincible pueblo.

198
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:12.370
It was a mountain stronghold ofhostile Indians, and it wascalled Acoma.

199
00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.130
The first white man to see itwas a scout from Coronado'sexpedition.

200
00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:34.370
He went back and he told hiscommander of a 'great city inthe sky'.

201
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:38.370
The strongest position hereported ever seen in the world.

202
00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:49.130
The Acoma Indians have livedhere for at least a thousandyears.

203
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:51.670
On their sheer pathways up therock

204
00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:58.030
countless hands have worndown cracks into smoothhandholds.

205
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:03.530
On such a climb an armor-cladsoldier was a pretty poor matchfor a nimble redskin.

206
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:08.770
Coronado surveyed it from afarand gave it a miss.

207
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.030
To this day the elders of theAcomas,

208
00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.230
unlike many Indian tribes,refuse to yield their ancientways,

209
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.370
or to perform for thewhite man.

210
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:23.370
They forbid all strangers toenter or see these sacred placescalled Kiva.

211
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.130
No power lines may be laid,

212
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:47.170
no artificial heat of any kindis available even for the bakingof bread,

213
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:52.530
Not for want of money butbecause the rock on which thecity itself is built is sacred

214
00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.530
and may not be broken or defiledin any way.

215
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.270
This old man, 30 miles away frommotels, pizza parlors

216
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.670
and Jo's second-hand car lot, isadding an extra room to hishouse

217
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:16.000
with no help from the techniquesof the American way of life.

218
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.900
How about the young? They lookAmerican, they talk American,

219
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.670
and today they are learning thattheir heritage is one ofbetrayal.

220
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:35.330
This may be the last generationwilling to walk the olduncomplaining ways.

221
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.870
Well, this windswept fortresswhich is at the top of thecontinental divide

222
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:37.430
remained unconquered for 59years after Coronado had seenit.

223
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:42.370
And then the Spaniards mounted athree-day and night assault andthey took it.

224
00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.370
It was a feat sufficient toprovoke in a soldier-poet astill celebrated epic poem.

225
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:53.870
And certainly the Spanish tookan epic revenge; six hundredprisoners, six hundred killed,

226
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.970
they took the leading 70warriors and tossed them off thetop of the cliff.

227
00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:03.330
They bound to life-timeservitude another five hundredmostly women and children.

228
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.570
And with the rest of thepopulation the adult males,

229
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:12.830
they cut off one foot todiscourage escape or any furthermilitary adventures.

230
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:17.630
And those who couldn't be wooedout of their own religion wereliterally thrown to the dogs,

231
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:21.630
or flogged into devotion to theCarpenter of Nazareth.

232
00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:44.370
As usual time softens the stingof these atrocities and 30 yearslater a mild Franciscan priest,

233
00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:49.170
Father Ramirez walked to theirfortress barefoot and unarmed,

234
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:53.300
and with the single weapon of acrucifix, converted them.

235
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.400
And they built this church.

236
00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.830
It was not possible to bury thedead in the solid stone.

237
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:04.670
So for over forty years theIndians brought up earth inhandfuls

238
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.670
from the plains below to makethis graveyard.

239
00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.470
If the desert winds can leavemountains with the sheen ofbones,

240
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:26.870
it's not surprising that thereare hardly any trace of theSpanish marches.

241
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:33.800
But there's an amazing one. Itis this towering bluff, ElMorro.

242
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.570
Indian guides led Coronado to itwhen his men were fainting withthirst.

243
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.170
At the foot of it was this poolof pure water,

244
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:45.000
which is something that anywherein the arid West

245
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.930
is likely to become a waystation or a camp ground.

246
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.730
It's odd that the first whitemen on the march through Americashould have yielded to that

247
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.230
curious human itch which hasafflicted tourists in the GreekIslands,

248
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:08.700
the Grand Canyon andDisneyland, to write up their names on a stone.

249
00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.670
It's odder still that suchinscriptions should survive in acountry

250
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:18.630
which tears down a skyscraperwhich is less than a quarter ofa century old.

251
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:23.700
At any rate the first man whocarved himself into immortality

252
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:31.400
and we think probably with thepoint of a sword -was this one;'Paso pora qui el arrivantando'

253
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.900
through here passed thegovernor,

254
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:41.900
Don Juan de Onyate after hisdiscovery of the Sea of theSouth, April 16th 1605.'

255
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:47.530
Now by the Sea of the South, hemeant that he'd been as far asthe Gulf of California,

256
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:52.670
and like every other Spaniardwho ever saw a body of waterthat was seemingly endless,

257
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.830
he thought he'd found thatpassage through to the Pacific.

258
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:59.870
He did set up the first Spanishgovernment in the South West,

259
00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.930
and here is his palace atSanta Fe.

260
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:14.400
It was built 10 years before thePilgrim Fathers landed on theNew England coast.

261
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:19.930
For the next two hundred yearsthese remote provinces of NewSpain today's Texas,

262
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:26.270
Arizona, California -slowlydeveloped an outpost economythroughout a burning landscape

263
00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.270
half the size of Europe.

264
00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:48.270
The Spanish had introduced twoindispensable elements ofWestern life;

265
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.970
the horse and the cow.

266
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:56.430
It was the horse that had firstterrified the Western Indianinto submission.

267
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:04.530
It was the horse that was to sethim free, and free-wheeling fromMexico to the Canadian tundra.

268
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.270
And the Spanish left behind inthe branding signs

269
00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:13.330
and the embossing of saddles awhole heraldry of ranching.

270
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.470
I imagine that those of us bornabroad

271
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.030
think of a rodeo as aWestern circus for the public'sentertainment.

272
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:25.170
But throughout two thousandmiles. the whole arc of thesouthwest a rodeo -

273
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:30.170
literally a round-up - is one ofthe timeless chores of ranching.

274
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:59.270
The word 'cowboy' is directlytranslated from 'vaquero'.

275
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.970
On this ranch in Arizona allthese men speak only Spanish,

276
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:08.770
except the ranch owner and hisforeman, known as the 'maja' ormajor domo.

277
00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:12.670
And their equipment retains theSpanish names; the lariat;

278
00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:26.530
the chaps they wear forprotection against the desertscrub called chaperral

279
00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.830
The purpose of the rodeo wasto round up once a year

280
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:34.630
all the cattle that had runfree and multiplied on the openrange;

281
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:41.430
to distinguish one man's herdfrom another by branding theyearling calves with the owner's

282
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:46.030
initials  or emblems which wereregistered with the governor ofeach province.

283
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:35.400
By the way the word 'cinch'comes from ranching. Thesaddle-girth is called a cincher

284
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.530
and when it was securelyfastened it was said to becinched.

285
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:43.700
I don't know who said it, and itcould have been me,

286
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:50.270
that a civilization is foundedin a crop and survives by a codeof law.

287
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.300
Well the Spaniards introducedmany of the basic Americancrops;

288
00:29:53.300 --> 00:30:00.630
oats, wheat. barley, orangesand they took the rudestindigenous cereal of the Indian

289
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.730
and they made it a staple fromthe Canadian border to the tipof South America -

290
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:09.730
that's maize, what is everywherecalled corn.

291
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.970
Two thousand miles to the northand east though a very differentway of life

292
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.170
was being developed by the toughdescendants of those Bretonfishermen.

293
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.700
They were exploring the watersand tracking down the game ofthat yawning stretch of forest

294
00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.700
and tundra in - Le Canada.

295
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:51.500
Furs, especially beaver, were infashionable demand in Europe,

296
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.600
and to get them the Frenchdeveloped an entirely new breedof explorers,

297
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.970
trappers and hunters,

298
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.670
living rough, outdoing theIndians at their own game -

299
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:09.970
so that it was said nofour-legged thing is safe from aFrenchman.

300
00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.100
These French Canadians arehunting the biggest

301
00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:20.500
and most elusive of all NorthAmerican deer the moose.

302
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.300
The man in the lead,incidentally, once had to kill abear that was stealing his food.

303
00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:27.970
He had no gun and stabbed itwith a knife on the end of astick.

304
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:25.600
So rapacious were the huntersthat they had to track fartherand farther into the interior

305
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:30.730
in order to find enough animalsto kill.

306
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.000
Forsaking the familiar boats ofEurope

307
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.200
they adopted from theIndians the canoe which wasideal,

308
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.100
not only for plying the widerivers

309
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.270
but ferreting through thewriggling channels of thenorthern lakes and marshes.

♪ SINGING ♪

311
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.800
Only the French, it was said,

312
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.370
would have wanted to settle alandscape of giant lily-pads.

313
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.470
Certainly only they and laterthe Scots

314
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:11.470
would have knotted alifeline across a continent oftundra.

315
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:19.930
One of the epic French journeysof exploration began in November1678

316
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:26.400
when a young nobleman, ReneCavelier Sieur de la Salle, setsail across Lake Ontario.

317
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.670
He was seeking a way southacross the continent by water.

318
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:36.570
His boat was wrecked and inmid-winter

319
00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:41.070
his expedition had todrag its equipment aroundNiagara Falls.

320
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.770
Despite many disasters, and tothe wonderment of the SenecaIndians,

321
00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.430
they managed in the spring of1679 to build another boat

322
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:54.700
and launched it on Lake Erie,where no ship had ever sailed.

323
00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:58.170
In it, La Salle sailed acrossthe Great Lakes, over Lake Erie,

324
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:00.800
up the St. Clair, up Lake Huron,westward

325
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.230
into Lake Michigan.

326
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:08.370
Battling hunger and appallingweather they reached theIllinois River.

327
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.570
The boat sank. They met and hadto fight hostile Indians,

328
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:16.270
and la Salle was plagued withdebts and doubters back home.

329
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.900
In the winter they had to dragtheir supplies overland, thegoing so bad

330
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:25.270
that they wore out a pair ofleather moccasins every day.

331
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.600
But eventually they reached openwater on a branch of theIllinois River.

332
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:34.130
And on the 6th February 1682they floated into theMississippi

333
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:36.930
and fifteen hundred miles downthe great river,

334
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:42.000
until after two months theyreached the open sea.

335
00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.800
On the 9th April La Salleassembled his men, raised across

336
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.730
and the banner of France, and inthe name of Louis X1Vth,

337
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:58.870
he took possession of all thevast lands he had covered andcalled them Louisiana.

338
00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.030
La Salle was killed on a laterexpedition

339
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:05.330
but in time the French built theport of New Orleans at the mouthof the Mississippi.

340
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:15.270
Yet they never domesticated theenormous hinterland La Salle hadbrought them.

341
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:19.530
Here is a French map of themid-eighteenth century, 1755,

342
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:24.270
which shows what an exclusivehold the French had in thenorth,

343
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:30.030
what an accurate picture of whatyou might call lateral America.

344
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:34.030
But you see the French were justas vague about what lay to thesouth

345
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:39.830
and west as the Spanish had beenabout what lay to their northand west.

346
00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.200
Being fishermen andtrappers, the French did a fine

347
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.430
job of mapping this entirenervous system of the rivers,

348
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.430
but beyond them they simply putin the names of Indian tribes

349
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:53.430
the Miamis, the Illinois, theSioux.

350
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.700
Down here in what is now theUnited States they did not plancolonies,

351
00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.300
they settled allays close to theriver, way stations,

352
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.270
or what we might call retailcenters for the down rivertraffic,

353
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:11.400
bearing fur and hides and timberdown to the port of New Orleans.

354
00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:17.170
But if they found some localuseful product a mineral salt,

355
00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.900
then they would stop and make atown.

356
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:24.430
And we're in one now, at St.Genevieve, Missouri on theMississippi,

357
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:29.630
which is one of the last toretain the flavor and the lookof provincial France.

358
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:32.430
We're in the house of a FrenchCanadian born merchant,

359
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.500
this is the desk where he didhis accounts;

360
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.570
here are the steps going up tothe bedroom, which was also usedfor winter storage.

361
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:42.900
I think this is the mostcharacteristic French house

362
00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:51.070
now remaining in the MississippiValley.

363
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:57.830
What the French found here waslead -veins of lead ofincredible richness.

364
00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.130
So they brought in two hundredFrench miners

365
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:05.070
and imported five hundred negroslaves from Santo Domingo.

366
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.530
And they carried the lead forshipping down the Mississippi,

367
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.500
across the flat lands that laysouth of this city

368
00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.270
which they called Le Grand Champ-the big field.

369
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:19.370
The French usually started witha fort and a few soldiers,

370
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:23.330
but they found this village,straggling village indefensible,

371
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:28.270
so they palisade the houses andit was everyman for himself.

372
00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.370
However, they prospered, andthey made a country town.

373
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.270
They brought over theirmissionaries and priests,

374
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.170
planted their familiar vines andshrubs - in fact,

375
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:42.200
imported their culture,including a useful strain of thrift.

376
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.000
The first man who owned thishouse prospered exceedingly, aman named Louis Bolduc.

377
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.170
And he kept his money stored inthe cellars there. One time anAmerican merchant came through.

378
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:56.970
And they took a bet as to whowas the wealthier.

379
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:04.200
When Bolduc sent for a servantand ordered up a half a bushelbasket to measure his silver,

380
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.030
the American paid up.

381
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.530
Now this place, St. Genevieve,in the late eighteenth century

382
00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:12.170
was a little Paris for theMississippi Valley.

383
00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:15.800
And parents with aspirations togentility

384
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.600
sent their children here tolearn to be good Catholics,

385
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.570
to learn to speak good French.

386
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:25.430
And one boy who came all the wayfrom Pittsburgh remembered veryvividly

387
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:30.200
that he had, after Sunday mass, attended a school ofmanners where -

388
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.300
he said -we learned thetwo elements of true politeness;

389
00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.300
grace and self-denial.

390
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:58.270
On the whole the French Catholicinfluence was instructive andbenign.

391
00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.330
It was rarely so in the Spanishsouth-west.

392
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:17.200
The Conquistadors had been sentas the sword of the pope.

393
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.730
And today in southern Arizona,the Papago Indians go off toworship

394
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:25.330
in one of the great imperialmonuments left by the Spanish,

395
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.530
the church of San Xavier delBac,

396
00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:34.530
where primitive Indianspractice the most sophisticatedrituals of Europe.

397
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.130
A chief of the Papagos.

398
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:35.300
After four centuries both oldand young are as unquestioninglydevout as the soldiers

399
00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:40.300
who had beaten their ancestorsinto a new, bizarre religion.

400
00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.530
Neither the plundering life ofthe Conquistadors

401
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.500
nor the vigorous life of theranchers went on for ever.

402
00:41:56.500 --> 00:42:01.230
As time went on so did themellowing of the Spanishheritage,

403
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:06.170
till by the beginning of the19th century the Spanish werethoroughly domesticated

404
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.670
in this part of the world, andespecially here in California.

405
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:13.700
By now the Indians had beentrained to be carpenters

406
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.200
and farmers and blacksmiths andgrowers of vines.

407
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.830
And comfortable families notmuch interested in money,

408
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:26.430
raised enough cattle and enoughcrops for their needs,

409
00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:31.130
practiced a strict butaffectionate Catholic disciplineon their children,

410
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:38.800
and lived in squares like these,lives that were balanced anduseful and benevolent.

411
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:55.830
The Spaniards' imperialambitions were checkmated toosoon for them to build,

412
00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:02.000
as the French did here in NewOrleans, a full-blown capitalcity.

413
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.230
This might have been the capitalof the United States

414
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:10.700
if Napoleon had not sold forcash the huge interior which LaSalle had claimed as Louisiana.

415
00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.730
But the French and then theSpanish prospered here, lawyersand bankers, merchants,

416
00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.400
ambassadors and playboys,

417
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.800
maintaining their quadroonmistresses in terracedapartments

418
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.800
overlooking the main square.

419
00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:46.700
Today New Orleans more or lessincorporates as a touristpackage

420
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.570
the French heritage in theUnited States.

421
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:54.570
And it is practically anobligation to abjure the hot dogfor the snail.

422
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.030
Holiday makers troop throughcurio shops

423
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:19.030
which were once the homes ofdiplomats and opera singers.

424
00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:29.830
But you won't find herereminders of the French figureswho created this city

425
00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.430
and the cities of theMississippi Valley.

426
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:34.100
They're not much known toAmericans.

427
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.670
We hardly know that we pronounceArkansas ARKENSAW,

428
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.500
and Chicago SHICAGO, becausethat's the way the French saidthem.

429
00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.400
We look to the north for theFrench contribution and think ofCanada.

430
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:50.630
And Canadian history islittle taught in Americanschools.

431
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:54.970
Consider their heroes; Pontiac,the brave Ottawa Chieftain;Cadillac,

432
00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:57.400
the settler of Detroit; La Sallehimself.

433
00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.130
They are recognized only as thenames of automobiles.

434
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:05.330
But in these quiet patios I'mreminded of one grand exception,

435
00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:10.470
the only French god in theAmerican Pantheon.

436
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:15.700
In the unlikely event that twohundred million Americans wereever put up

437
00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:25.930
against a wall at gunpoint andordered to name one Frenchmanwho had meant most to America,

438
00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:29.530
I think the name would be theMarquis de Lafayette.

439
00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:33.070
A young French nobleman, 19years old, newly married,

440
00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:36.230
forbidden to leave France whenthe War of Independence brokeout,

441
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:41.130
he escaped to America. "Myheart", he said, "enlisted inthe cause of liberty".

442
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:45.530
George Washington was moved byhis charm and bravery. He wasmade a Major-General,

443
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:49.070
was wounded, fought in the lastengagement at Yorktown,

444
00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.900
and was given the freedom of agrateful republic.

445
00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.430
He went home to fight in theFrench Revolution

446
00:45:55.430 --> 00:46:00.130
for what he believed was asimilar brave cause.

447
00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:04.130
He was too liberal for theRoyalists, and too moderate forthe Republicans,

448
00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.170
and he was thrown into adungeon.

449
00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:09.700
His wife asked to join him thereand she was allowed to.

450
00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:15.730
And they stayed five years,which broke her in spirit and in body.

451
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:19.070
They came to be buried togetherin a small graveyard in Paris,

452
00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:27.200
and in time by their side laytheir only son, GeorgeWashington Lafayette.

453
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:32.700
No country has been than Francein having in the person of oneman

454
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:36.270
such a permanent investmentin American goodwill.

455
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:39.300
You know, when General Pershingarrived in Europe

456
00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.330
with the vanguard of theAmerican Expeditionary Force in1917,

457
00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:45.600
and first set foot on Frenchsoil,

458
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:50.630
he greeted the French hostcommander with the shortsentence;

459
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:57.270
Lafayette nous voici - Lafayettewe are here.

460
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:59.430
Well, since we know which of thebig three,

461
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:03.070
the Spanish, theFrench, the British - won thiscontinent

462
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:10.800
it seemed to me only sporting topay an introductory tribute tothe losers

463
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.400
who left such a large andindelible mark on this country.

464
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.900
And it may be some consolationto those who believe

465
00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.730
that the meek, or the crafty,inherit the earth,

466
00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:26.800
to reflect that this continentwas ultimately won,

467
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.500
not by a race of militaryconquerors like the Spanish,

468
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:34.530
nor even by a nation of hunters,explorers, missionaries like theFrench,

469
00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:41.430
but by a small handful of peoplefrom a small island in the NorthAtlantic

470
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:49.370
who first sailed in three shipsinto Jamestown, Virginia to finda home from home.
