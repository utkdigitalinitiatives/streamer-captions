00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.030


2
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.730
Who meets us here?

3
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.900
Daughter, well met.

4
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.300
God give your graces both

5
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.370
a happy and a joyful time of day.

6
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.200
As much to you, good sister.

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.030
Whither away?

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.670
No farther than the Tower

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.670
and as I guess, upon the like devotion as yourselves:

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.030
to gratulate the gentle princes there.

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.800
Kind sister, thanks.

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.170
We'll enter all together.

13
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.300
And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.

14
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.800
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,

15
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.770
how doth the prince and my young son of York?

16
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.330
Right well, dear madam.

17
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.730
By your patience,

18
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.030
I may not suffer you to visit them.

19
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.170
The king hath strictly charged the contrary.

20
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.500
The king?

21
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.630
Who's that?

22
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.330
I mean the lord protector.

23
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.700
The Lord protect him from that kingly title.

24
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.730
Hath he set bounds between their love and me?

25
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.970
I am their mother.

26
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.570
Who shall bar me from them?

27
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.230
I am their father's mother.

28
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.400
I will see them.

29
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.330
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.

30
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.170
Then bring me to their sights.

31
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.700
I'll bear thy blame

32
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.400
and take thy office from thee, on my peril.

33
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400
No, madam, no.

34
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.170
I may not leave it so.

35
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.100
I am bound by oath,

36
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800
and therefore pardon me.

37
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400
Let me but greet you, ladies, one hour hence,

38
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.030
and I'll salute your grace of York as mother

39
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.130
and reverend looker-on of two fair queens.

40
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.370
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,

41
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.270
there to be crowned Richard's royal queen.

42
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.130
O, cut my lace asunder

43
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.970
that my pent heart may have some scope to beat,

44
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.830
or else I swoon with this dead-killing news.

45
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.400
Be of good cheer, Mother.

46
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.630
How fares your grace?

47
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.700
O Dorset, speak not to me. Get thee gone.

48
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.530
Death and destruction dogs thee at the heels.

49
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.800
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.

50
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.130
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas

51
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.600
and live with Richmond from the reach of hell.

52
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.800
Go! Hie thee.

53
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.300
Hie thee from this slaughterhouse,

54
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.670
lest thou increase the number of the dead

55
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.070
and make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,

56
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.100
nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen!

57
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.830
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.

58
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.900
Take all the swift advantage of the hours.

59
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.530
You shall have letters from me to my son

60
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.170
in your behalf to meet you on the way.

61
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.000
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

62
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.200
O ill-dispersing wind of misery.

63
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.830
O my accursed womb, the bed of death.

64
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.900
A cockatrice hast thou hatched to the world

65
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.430
whose unavoided eye is murderous.

66
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.430
Come, madam, come. I in all haste was sent.

67
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.130
And I with all unwillingness will go.

68
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.230
Oh, would to God that the inclusive verge of golden metal

69
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.500
that must round my brow were red-hot steel

70
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.800
to sear me to the brains.

71
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.800
Anointed let me be with deadly venom

72
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.730
and die ere men can say "God save the queen."

73
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.330
Go, go, poor soul.

74
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.870
I envy not thy glory.

75
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.030
To feed my humor, wish thyself no harm.

76
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.770
No.

77
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.030
Why?

78
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.800
When he that is my husband now

79
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.530
came to me as I followed Henry's corse

80
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.970
when scarce the blood was well-washed from his hands

81
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.900
which issued from my other angel husband

82
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.230
and that dear saint which then I, weeping, followed.

83
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.430
O, when I say I look'd on Richard's face,

84
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.200
this was my wish:

85
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.330
"Be thou," quoth I,

86
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.170
"accursed for making me, so young, so old a widow.

87
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.870
"And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed.

88
00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.230
"And be thy wife, if any be so mad,

89
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.070
"more miserable by the life of thee

90
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.930
than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death."

91
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.830
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again

92
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.070
within so small a time,

93
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.830
my woman's heart grossly grew captive to his honey words

94
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.070
and proved the subject of mine own soul's curse,

95
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.800
which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest.

96
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.600
For never yet one hour in his bed

97
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.770
did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep

98
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.230
but with his timorous dreams was still awaked.

99
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.500
Besides, he hates me for my father, Warwick,

100
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.030
and will no doubt shortly be rid of me.

101
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.300
Poor heart, adieu.

102
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.070
I pity thy complaining.

103
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.970
No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.

104
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.970
Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory.

105
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.500
Adieu, poor soul that takest thy leave of it.

106
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.630
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee.

107
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.170
Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee.

108
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.130
Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee.

109
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.100
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me.

110
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.370
Stay.

111
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.430
Yet look back with me unto the Tower.

112
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.630
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes

113
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.570
whom envy hath immured within your walls.

114
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.000
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.

115
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.930
Rude ragged nurse,

116
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.630
old sullen playfellow for tender princes,

117
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.730
use my babies well.

118
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.030
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.

119
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.630
Stand all apart!

120
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.170
Cousin of Buckingham.

121
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.900
My gracious sovereign.

122
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.370
Give me thy hand.

123
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.970
Thus high, by thy advice and thy assistance,

124
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.130
is King Richard seated.

125
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.500
But shall we wear these glories for a day,

126
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.900
or shall they last and we rejoice in them?

127
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.670
Still live they,

128
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.170
and forever let them last.

129
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.000
Ah, Buckingham,

130
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.600
now do I play the touch

131
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.370
to try if thou be current gold indeed.

132
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:29.000
Young Edward lives.

133
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.300
Think now what I would speak.

134
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.670
Say on, my loving lord.

135
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.970
Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king,

136
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.870
Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord.

137
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.530
Am I king?

138
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:43.730
'Tis so.

139
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:44.770
But Edward lives.

140
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:49.000
True, noble prince.

141
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.270
A bitter consequence that Edward still should live:

142
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:54.070
"True, noble prince."

143
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.270
Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.

144
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.430
Shall I be plain?

145
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.800
I wish the bastards dead,

146
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.500
and I would have it suddenly performed.

147
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.430
What sayest thou now?

148
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.700
Speak suddenly. Be brief.

149
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.300
Your grace may do your pleasure.

150
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.630
Tut, tut, thou art all ice.

151
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:16.100
Thy kindness freezeth.

152
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.930
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?

153
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.130
Give me some little breath,

154
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.570
some pause, dear lord,

155
00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.130
before I positively speak of this.

156
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:36.600
I will resolve you herein presently.

157
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.900
The king is angry.

158
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.730
See, he gnaws his lip.

159
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.970
I will converse with iron-witted fools and unrespective boys.

160
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.570
None are for me that look into me with considerate eyes.

161
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.830
High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.

162
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.930
Boy.

163
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.000
My lord.

164
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.500
Knowest thou not any whom corrupting gold

165
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.970
will tempt unto a close exploit of death?

166
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:22.570
I know a discontented gentleman

167
00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.800
whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.

168
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.630
Gold were as good as twenty orators

169
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.200
and will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.

170
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.730
What is his name?

171
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.470
His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.

172
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.000
I partly know the man.

173
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.000
Go, call him hither.

174
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.300
The deep-revolving witty Buckingham

175
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.970
no more shall be the neighbor to my counsels.

176
00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.400
Hath he so long held out with me untired,

177
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.070
and stops he now for breath?

178
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:54.430
Well, be it so.

179
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.830
How now, Lord Stanley, what's the news?

180
00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.200
Know, my loving lord,

181
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.400
the marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled to Richmond,

182
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.630
in the parts where he abides.

183
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.230
Come hither, Catesby.

184
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.770
Rumor it abroad that Anne, my wife,

185
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.000
is very grievous sick.

186
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.500
I will take order for her keeping close.

187
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.730
Inquire me out some mean-poor gentleman

188
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:24.900
whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter.

189
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.900
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.

190
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:31.000
Look how thou dreamest.

191
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.270
I say again,

192
00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.100
give out that Anne my queen is sick and like to die.

193
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.000
About it, for it stands me much upon

194
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.270
to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.

195
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.930
I must be married to my brother's daughter,

196
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.830
or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.

197
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.270
Murder her brothers, and then marry her:

198
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.400
uncertain way of gain.

199
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.930
But I am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.

200
00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.870
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

201
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.430
Is thy name Tyrrel?

202
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.930
James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.

203
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.830
Art thou, indeed?

204
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.770
Prove me, my gracious lord.

205
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.930
Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?

206
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.400
Please you, but I had rather kill two enemies.

207
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.270
Why, then thou hast it.

208
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.100
Two deep enemies,

209
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.070
foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers

210
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.430
are they that I would have thee deal upon.

211
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.270
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.

212
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.170
Let me have open means to come to them,

213
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.930
and soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.

214
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.700
Thou singest sweet music.

215
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.330
Hark, come hither, Tyrrel.

216
00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.070
Go by this token.

217
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.570
Rise and lend thine ear.

218
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.770
There is no more but so.

219
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:09.900
Say it is done,

220
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.830
and I will love thee and prefer thee for it.

221
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.970
I will dispatch it straight.

222
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:26.170
My lord, I have considered in my mind

223
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.170
the late request that you did sound me in.

224
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.600
Well, let that rest.

225
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.370
Dorset is fled to Richmond.

226
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.430
I hear the news, my lord.

227
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:38.900
Stanley, he is your wife's son.

228
00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:40.600
Well, look unto it.

229
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.100
My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,

230
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.730
for which your honor and your faith is pawned:

231
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:48.970
the earldom of Hereford

232
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.030
and the movables which you have promised I shall possess.

233
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.970
Stanley, look to your wife.

234
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.830
If she convey letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.

235
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.030
What says your highness to my just demand?

236
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.200
I do remember me, Henry VI did prophesy

237
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.330
that Richmond should be king

238
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.970
when Richmond was a little peevish boy.

239
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.830
A king, perhaps, perhaps--

240
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.130
My lord.

241
00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.330
How chance the prophet could not at that time have told me,

242
00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.300
I being by, that I should kill him?

243
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.830
My lord, your promise for the earldom--

244
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:16.170
Richmond.

245
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.930
When last I was at Exeter,

246
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.870
the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle there

247
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:21.270
and called it Rougemont,

248
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.700
at which name I started

249
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:23.970
because a bard of Ireland told me once

250
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.430
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.

251
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.370
My lord.

252
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.430
Aye, what's't o'clock?

253
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.400
I am thus bold

254
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.630
to put your grace in mind of what you promised me.

255
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:35.970
Well, but what's't o'clock?

256
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.630
Upon the stroke of ten.

257
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.630
Then let it strike.

258
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.730
Why let it strike?

259
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.730
Because that like a jack thou keepest the stroke

260
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.100
between thy begging and my meditation.

261
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.000
I am not in the giving vein today.

262
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.470
May it please you to resolve me my suit.

263
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.170
Thou troublest me.

264
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.530
I am not in the vein.

265
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.570
And is it thus?

266
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.900
Repays he my deep service

267
00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.200
with such contempt?

268
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.030
Made I him king for this?

269
00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:42.030
O, let me think on Hastings and be gone

270
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.900
to Brecknock while my fearful head is on.

271
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.170
The tyrannous and bloody act is done,

272
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.700
the most arch deed of piteous massacre

273
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.070
that ever yet this land was guilty of.

274
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.700
Dighton and Forrest,

275
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.830
who I did suborn to do this piece of ruthless butchery,

276
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.730
albeit they were fleshed villains, bloody dogs,

277
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.470
melted with tenderness and mild compassion,

278
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.170
wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.

279
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.870
"Oh, thus" quoth Dighton, "lay the gentle babes."

280
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:45.230
"Thus, thus," quoth Forrest,

281
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.570
"girdling one another within their alabaster, innocent arms.

282
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.570
"Their lips were four red roses on a stalk

283
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.770
"and in their summer beauty, kissed each other.

284
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.030
"A book of prayers on their pillow lay,

285
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.670
"which once," quoth Forrest, "almost changed my mind,

286
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.030
but O! The devil!"

287
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:13.300
There the villain stopped when Dighton thus told on:

288
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:18.000
"We smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature

289
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.630
that from the prime creation e'er she framed."

290
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.600
Hence both are gone...

291
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.630
with conscience and remorse.

292
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.300
They could not speak.

293
00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.830
And so I left them both

294
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.900
to bear this tidings to the bloody king.

295
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.800
And here he comes.

296
00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.000
All health, my sovereign lord.

297
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.630
Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?

298
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.770
If to have done the thing you gave in charge

299
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.600
beget your happiness,

300
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.400
be happy then, for it is done.

301
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.470
But didst thou see them dead?

302
00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.070
I did, my lord.

303
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.070
And buried, gentle Tyrrel?

304
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.500
The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them,

305
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.370
but where, to say the truth, I do not know.

306
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.200
Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,

307
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.670
when thou shalt tell the process of their death.

308
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.830
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good

309
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.800
and be inheritor of thy desire.

310
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.830
Farewell till then.

311
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.730
I humbly take my leave.

312
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.270
The son of Clarence have I pent up close.

313
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.600
His daughter meanly have I matched in marriage.

314
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.030
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,

315
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.070
and Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.

316
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.570
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond

317
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.900
aims at young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,

318
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.700
and by that knot looks proudly on the crown,

319
00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.200
to her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.

320
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.270
My lord?

321
00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.500
Good or bad news, that thou comest in so bluntly?

322
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.070
Bad news, my lord.

323
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.430
Ely is fled to Richmond,

324
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.600
and Buckingham, backed with the hardy Welshmen,

325
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.970
is in the field, and still his power increaseth.

326
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.770
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near

327
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.470
than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.

328
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.070
Come, I have learned that fearful commenting

329
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.770
is leaden servitor to dull delay.

330
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:03.770
Go, muster men.

331
00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:05.600
My counsel is my shield.

332
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.630
We must be brief when traitors brave the field.

333
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:20.600
So now prosperity begins to mellow

334
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.170
and drop into the rotten mouth of death.

335
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:29.530
Here in these confines, slyly have I lurked

336
00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.470
to watch the waning of mine enemies.

337
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.570
O, a dire induction am I witness to

338
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.830
and will to France,

339
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.700
hoping the consequence will prove

340
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.730
as bitter, black, and tragical.

341
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.000
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret.

342
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.400
Who comes here?

343
00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.570
Ah, my poor princes.

344
00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.770
Ah, my tender babes,

345
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:10.330
my unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets.

346
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.030
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air

347
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.830
and be not fixed in doom perpetual,

348
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.000
hover about me with your airy wings

349
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.830
and hear your mother's lamentation.

350
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.100
Hover about her.

351
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.830
Say that right for right

352
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.870
hath dimmed your infant morn to aged night.

353
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:33.470
So many miseries have crazed my voice

354
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:38.000
that my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.

355
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.870
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?

356
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.470
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.

357
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.670
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.

358
00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.470
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs

359
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:55.270
and throw them in the entrails of the wolf?

360
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.530
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?

361
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.500
When holy Harry died and my sweet son.

362
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.970
Dead life, blind sight,

363
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:14.830
poor mortal living ghost.

364
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:20.470
Woe's scene, world's shame,

365
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.400
grave's due by life usurped,

366
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.800
brief abstract and record of tedious days,

367
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.430
rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,

368
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.600
unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.

369
00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.730
Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave

370
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.700
as thou canst yield a melancholy seat.

371
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.530
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.

372
00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:49.730
O, who hath any cause to mourn but we?

373
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.500
If ancient sorrow be most reverend,

374
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.670
give mine the benefit of seniory

375
00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.800
and let my griefs frown on the upper hand.

376
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:06.100
If sorrow can admit society,

377
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.730
tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine.

378
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:17.800
I had an Edward till a Richard killed him.

379
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.900
I had a husband till a Richard killed him.

380
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.630
Thou hadst an Edward till a Richard killed him.

381
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.530
Thou hadst a Richard till a Richard killed him.

382
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:32.630
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him.

383
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.930
I had a Rutland too; thou holp'st to kill him.

384
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:41.730
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard killed him.

385
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.500
From forth the kennel of thy womb

386
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:50.730
hath crept a hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.

387
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.030
That dog that had his teeth before his eyes

388
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.870
to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,

389
00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.230
that excellent grand tyrant of the earth

390
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:05.730
that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,

391
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:09.030
that foul defacer of God's handiwork

392
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:14.430
thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.

393
00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:19.800
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,

394
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.130
how do I thank thee that this carnal cur

395
00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:26.900
preys on the issue of his mother's body

396
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:30.030
and makes her pew fellow with others' moan.

397
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.930
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes.

398
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:36.530
God witness with me; I have wept for thine.

399
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.000
Bear with me.

400
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.570
I am hungry for revenge,

401
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:46.130
and now I cloy me with beholding it.

402
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:54.200
Thy Edward, he is dead, that killed my Edward,

403
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.770
thy other Edward dead to quit my Edward.

404
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.330
Young York, he is but boot,

405
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:06.270
because both they match not the high perfection of my loss.

406
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:11.500
Thy Clarence, he is dead, that stabbed my Edward.

407
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.130
And to the beholders of that frantic play,

408
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:18.400
the adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,

409
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.300
untimely smothered in their dusky graves.

410
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.730
Richard yet lives.

411
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.370
Hell's black intelligencer

412
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.100
only reserved their factor

413
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.400
to buy souls and send them thither.

414
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.170
But at hand,

415
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:40.430
at hand ensues his piteous and unpitied end.

416
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:46.200
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray

417
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.170
to have him suddenly conveyed from hence.

418
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.230
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,

419
00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.900
that I may live and say the dog is dead!

420
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.100
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come

421
00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.000
that I should wish for thee to help me curse

422
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.770
that bottled spider, that foul, bunch-backed toad.

423
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:10.330
I called thee then vain flourish of my fortune.

424
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:16.200
I called thee then poor shadow, painted queen,

425
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.630
the presentation of but what I was,

426
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.930
the flattering index of a direful pageant,

427
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.070
one heaved ahigh to be hurled down below,

428
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.130
a mother only mocked with two fair babes,

429
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:30.970
a dream of what thou wast,

430
00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:35.370
a garish flag to be the aim of every dangerous shot,

431
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:41.070
a queen in jest, only to fill the scene.

432
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.870
Where is thy husband now?

433
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.830
Where be thy brothers?

434
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.970
Where are thy two sons?

435
00:25:51.970 --> 00:25:55.200
Wherein dost thou joy?

436
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.270
Who sues and kneels and says "God save the queen"?

437
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.830
Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?

438
00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:05.070
Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?

439
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:10.670
Decline all this, and see what now thou art.

440
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.830
For happy wife, a most distressed widow.

441
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:19.000
For joyful mother, one that wails the name.

442
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.630
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues.

443
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:31.170
For queen, a very caitive crowned with care.

444
00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:39.230
For she that scorned at me now scorned of me.

445
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:45.170
For she being feared of all now fearing one.

446
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:51.130
For she commanding all, obeyed of none.

447
00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:56.100
Thus hath the course of justice whirled about

448
00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:00.270
and left thee but a very prey to time,

449
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.830
having no more but thought of what thou wast

450
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.900
to torture thee the more, being what thou art.

451
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.130
Thou didst usurp my place.

452
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.300
Dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?

453
00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:25.500
Now thy proud neck bears half my burdened yoke

454
00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:32.730
from which even here I slip my wearied head

455
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:38.630
and leave the burden of it all on thee.

456
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:51.430
Farewell, York's wife

457
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.130
and queen of sad mischance.

458
00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.570
O, these English woes shall make me smile in France.

459
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.700
O, thou well-skilled in curses, stay awhile,

460
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.400
and teach me how to curse mine enemies.

461
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:14.570
Forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days.

462
00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:17.400
Compare dead happiness with living woe.

463
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.500
Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were

464
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.200
and he that slew them fouler than he is.

465
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.500
Bettering thy loss will make the bad causer worse.

466
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.300
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.

467
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.470
My words are dull!

468
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.000
O, quicken them with thine.

469
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine.

470
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:56.970
Why should calamity be full of words?

471
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.870
Windy attorneys to their clients' woes,

472
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:05.270
poor breathing orators of miseries,

473
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.370
let them have scope.

474
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.370
Though what they will impart help nothing else,

475
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.730
yet do they ease the heart.

476
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:18.300
If so, then be not tongue-tied.

477
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.600
Go with me,

478
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.030
and in the breath of bitter words,

479
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:24.530
let's smother my damned son

480
00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.000
that thy two sweet sons smothered.

481
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.800
The trumpet sounds.

482
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.000
Be copious in exclaims.

483
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.970
Who intercepts me in my expedition?

484
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.630
O, she that might have intercepted thee

485
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:50.570
by strangling thee in her accursed womb

486
00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.630
from all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done.

487
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.600
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?

488
00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.330
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence

489
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.530
and little Ned Plantagenet, his son?

490
00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.700
Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?

491
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.070
Where is kind Hastings?

492
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.430
A flourish, trumpets!

493
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.000
Strike alarum, drums!

494
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.130
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women

495
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.100
rail on the Lord's anointed.

496
00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.400
Strike, I say!

497
00:30:22.270 --> 00:30:25.330
Either be patient and entreat me fair,

498
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.630
or with the clamorous report of war,

499
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.400
thus will I drown your exclamations.

500
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.670
Art thou my son?

501
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:36.670
Aye, I thank God, my father, and yourself.

502
00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:39.700
Then patiently hear my impatience.

503
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.530
Madam, I have a touch of your condition

504
00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.330
that cannot brook the accent of reproof.

505
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.330
O, let me speak.

506
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:45.400
Do then, but I'll not hear.

507
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.230
I will be mild and gentle in my words.

508
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.170
And brief, good mother, for I am in haste.

509
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:52.830
Art thou so hasty?

510
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.000
I have stayed for thee, God knows,

511
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.730
in torment and in agony.

512
00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.200
And came I not at last to comfort you?

513
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.070
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well.

514
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:09.700
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my Hell.

515
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.400
A grievous burden was thy birth to me.

516
00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.170
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy,

517
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:20.100
thy schooldays frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,

518
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:24.570
thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,

519
00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:30.570
thy age confirmed, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,

520
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:34.230
more mild but yet more harmful, kind in hatred.

521
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.170
If I be so disgracious in your eye,

522
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.870
let me march on and not offend you, madam.

523
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:38.870
Strike up the drum!

524
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:39.870
I prithee, hear me speak.

525
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:40.870
You speak too bitterly.

526
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:41.970
Hear me a word,

527
00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.000
for I shall never speak to thee again.

528
00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:51.030
So.

529
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:55.400
Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance,

530
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.670
ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,

531
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:00.470
or I with grief and extreme age shall perish

532
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.530
and nevermore behold thy face again.

533
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:08.330
Therefore, take with thee my most grievous curse,

534
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.500
which in the day of battle, tire thee more

535
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.500
than all the complete armor that thou wearest.

536
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.770
My prayers on the adverse party fight.

537
00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:22.270
And there the little souls of Edward's children

538
00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.230
whisper the spirits of thine enemies

539
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.430
and promise them success and victory.

540
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.630
Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.

541
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:36.800
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.

542
00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.100
Though far more cause,

543
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.230
yet much less spirit to curse abides in me.

544
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.530
I say amen to her.

545
00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:47.830
Stay, madam.

546
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.830
I must talk a word with you.

547
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:58.300
I have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter.

548
00:32:58.300 --> 00:32:59.570
For my daughters, Richard,

549
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.900
they shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens,

550
00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.600
and therefore level not to hit their lives.

551
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.230
You have a daughter called Elizabeth,

552
00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.270
virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.

553
00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:08.370
And must she die for this?

554
00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.830
O, let her live,

555
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.100
and I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty,

556
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.970
slander myself as false to Edward's bed,

557
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.100
throw over her the veil of infamy.

558
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.230
So she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter,

559
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:20.200
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.

560
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:22.330
Wrong not her birth; she is a royal princess.

561
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.230
To save her life, I'll say she is not so.

562
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.070
Her life is safest only in her birth.

563
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.800
And only in that safety died her brothers.

564
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.100
Lo, at their birth, good stars were opposite.

565
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.200
No, to their lives ill friends were contrary.

566
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.070
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.

567
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.530
True, when avoided grace makes destiny.

568
00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.830
My babes were destined to a fairer death

569
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.730
if grace had blessed thee with a fairer life.

570
00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:44.130
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.

571
00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.470
Cousins, indeed, and by their uncle,

572
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:51.130
cozened of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life!

573
00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.270
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,

574
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.400
thy head, all indirectly, gave direction.

575
00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.470
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt

576
00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.170
till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart

577
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:04.330
to revel in the entrails of my lambs.

578
00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:07.400
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,

579
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.930
my tongue should to thine ears not name my boys

580
00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.800
till that my nails were anchored in thine eyes.

581
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.170
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,

582
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.800
like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft,

583
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.400
rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.

584
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.100
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise

585
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.170
and dangerous success of bloody wars

586
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.570
as I intend more good to you and yours

587
00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.200
than ever you or yours by me were harmed.

588
00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.700
What good is covered with the face of Heaven

589
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.030
to be discovered that can do me good?

590
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.130
The advancement of your children, gentle lady.

591
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.070
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?

592
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.970
Unto the dignity and height of fortune,

593
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:43.630
the high imperial type of this earth's glory.

594
00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.600
Flatter my sorrow with report of it.

595
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.070
Tell me, what state, what honor, what dignity

596
00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:49.870
canst thou demise to any child of mine?

597
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.230
Even all I have.

598
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.630
Aye, and myself and all

599
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:56.130
will I withal endow a child of thine

600
00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:58.000
so in the lethe of thy angry soul,

601
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.200
thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs

602
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.400
which thou supposest I have done to thee.

603
00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.100
Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness

604
00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.270
last longer telling than thy kindness' date.

605
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:10.000
Then know that from my soul, I love thy daughter.

606
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.870
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.

607
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:12.900
What do you think?

608
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.630
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul.

609
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:18.970
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,

610
00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:21.630
and from my heart's love, I do thank thee for it.

611
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.600
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.

612
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.870
I mean that with my soul, I love thy daughter

613
00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:28.570
and do intend to make her queen of England.

614
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.430
Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?

615
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.730
Even he that makes her queen; who else should be?

616
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:36.730
What, thou?

617
00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.400
Even so. How think you of it?

618
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.700
How canst thou woo her?

619
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.800
That would I learn of you,

620
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.970
as one being best acquainted with her humor.

621
00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:44.530
And wilt thou learn of me?

622
00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.700
Madam, with all my heart.

623
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:59.100
Send to her by the man that slew her brothers

624
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.230
a pair of bleeding hearts.

625
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.600
Thereon engrave Edward and York.

626
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.200
Then haply will she weep.

627
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.930
Therefore present to her--

628
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.070
as sometimes Margaret did to thy father,

629
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:14.570
steeped in Rutland's blood--

630
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:17.500
a handkerchief, which, say to her,

631
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.870
did drain the purple sap from her sweet brother's body,

632
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.100
and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.

633
00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.570
If this inducement move her not to love,

634
00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:30.270
send her a letter of thy noble deed.

635
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.800
Tell her thou madest away

636
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.130
her uncle Clarence, her uncle Rivers,

637
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.530
aye, and, for her sake,

638
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.770
mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.

639
00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.770
You mock me, madam?

640
00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.830
This is not the way to win your daughter.

641
00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:41.870
There is no other way,

642
00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.100
unless thou couldst put on some other shape

643
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.000
and not be Richard that hath done all this.

644
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.200
Say that I did all this for love of her.

645
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.500
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,

646
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.070
having bought love with such a bloody spoil!

647
00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.630
Look, what is done cannot be now amended!

648
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.630
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,

649
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:59.170
which after hours, gives leisure to repent.

650
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.430
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,

651
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:03.500
to make amends, I'll give it to your daughter.

652
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.970
If I have killed the issue of your womb,

653
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.170
to quicken your increase,

654
00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.500
I will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.

655
00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.500
A grandam's name is little less in love

656
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.700
than is the doting title of a mother.

657
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:17.600
They are as children but one step below,

658
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.870
even of your mettle, of your very blood.

659
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:23.370
Of all one pain, save for a night of groans endured of her,

660
00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.300
for whom you bid like sorrow.

661
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:27.470
Your children were vexation to your youth,

662
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:29.830
but mine shall be a comfort to your age.

663
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.330
The loss you have is but a son being king,

664
00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.830
and by that loss, your daughter is made queen.

665
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.930
I cannot make you what amends I would.

666
00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.830
Therefore, accept such kindness as I can.

667
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.430
Dorset, your son, that with a fearful soul

668
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.830
leads discontented steps in foreign soil,

669
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:48.200
this fair alliance quickly shall call home

670
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.470
to high promotions and great dignity.

671
00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:52.930
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,

672
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.870
familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother.

673
00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.800
Again shall you be mother to a king

674
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.870
and all the ruins of distressful times repaired

675
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.200
with doubled riches of content.

676
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.200
What?

677
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.000
We have many goodly days to see.

678
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.070
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed

679
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.200
shall come again, transformed to Orient pearl,

680
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.470
advantaging their loan with interest

681
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:17.400
of ten times double gain of happiness.

682
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.030
Go then, my mother.

683
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.630
To thy daughter go.

684
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:24.070
Make bold her bashful years with your experience.

685
00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:26.830
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale

686
00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:28.730
put in her tender heart

687
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.770
the aspiring flame of golden sovereignty.

688
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:33.230
Acquaint the princess

689
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.030
with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys,

690
00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.730
and when this arm of mine hath chastised the petty rebel,

691
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:41.470
dull-brained Buckingham,

692
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.700
bound with triumphant garlands will I come

693
00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.500
and lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed,

694
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.600
to whom I will retail my conquest won,

695
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:53.000
and she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.

696
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.970
What were I best to say?

697
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.430
Her father's brother would be her lord?

698
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:04.030
Or shall I say her uncle?

699
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.330
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?

700
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:09.500
Under what title shall I woo for thee

701
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.470
that God, the law, my honor, and her love,

702
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.900
can make seem pleasing to her tender years?

703
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.270
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.

704
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.230
Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.

705
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.200
Tell her the king that may command entreats.

706
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.730
That at her hands which the king's king forbids.

707
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:25.030
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.

708
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.100
To veil a title, as her mother doth.

709
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.700
Say I will love her everlastingly.

710
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.700
But how long shall that title "ever" last?

711
00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.300
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.

712
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.870
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?

713
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.530
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.

714
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.400
As long as Hell and Richard likes of it.

715
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.500
Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.

716
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.130
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.

717
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:44.700
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.

718
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:46.770
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.

719
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.200
Then plainly to her, tell her my loving tale.

720
00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.330
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.

721
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:52.730
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick!

722
00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:55.530
O no, my reasons are too deep and dead.

723
00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.630
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.

724
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.970
Harp not on that string, madam.

725
00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:01.170
That is past.

726
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.230
Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break.

727
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.570
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown--

728
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.500
Profaned, dishonored, and the third, usurped.

729
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.700
I swear--

730
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.230
By nothing, for this is no oath.

731
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:13.030
Thy George, profaned, hath lost his holy honor.

732
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.930
Thy garter, blemished, pawned his knightly virtue.

733
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:19.000
Thy crown, usurped, disgraced his kingly glory.

734
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.370
If something thou wouldst swear to be believed,

735
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:23.670
swear then by something that thou hast not wronged.

736
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:24.670
Now, by the world--

737
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.330
'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.

738
00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:27.330
My father's death--

739
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.400
Thy life hath it dishonored.

740
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.400
Then by myself--

741
00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.400
Thyself is self misused.

742
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.400
Why, then, by God.

743
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.770
God's wrong is most of all!

744
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.800
If thou didst fear to break an oath with God,

745
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.730
the unity the king my husband made,

746
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.370
thou hadst not broken nor my brothers died.

747
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:42.400
If thou hadst feared to break an oath with Him,

748
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.170
the imperial metal circling now thy head

749
00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:48.330
had graced the tender temples of my child,

750
00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:50.970
and both the princes had been breathing here,

751
00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.800
which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,

752
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.570
thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.

753
00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:58.330
What canst thou swear by now?

754
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.100
The time to come.

755
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.030
That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast.

756
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:06.130
For I myself have many tears to wash hereafter time

757
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.500
for times past wronged by thee.

758
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.770
The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughtered,

759
00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.900
ungoverned youth, to wail it in their age.

760
00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.200
The parents live whose children thou hast butchered,

761
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.570
old barren plants, to wail it with their age.

762
00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.530
Swear not by time to come,

763
00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.830
for that thou hast misused ere used

764
00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:30.400
by times ill used o'erpast!

765
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.100
As I intend to prosper and repent,

766
00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.200
so thrive I in my dangerous affairs of hostile arms.

767
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.130
Myself, myself confound.

768
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.630
God and fortune bar me happy hours.

769
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.500
Day, yield me not thy light nor night, thy rest.

770
00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.330
Be opposite, all planets of good luck, to my proceeding

771
00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:48.530
if, with dear heart's love, immaculate devotion,

772
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.830
holy thoughts, I tender not your beauteous, princely daughter.

773
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:54.900
In her consists my happiness and thine.

774
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.870
Without her, follows to myself and thee,

775
00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:00.930
herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,

776
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:04.400
death, desolation, ruin, and decay.

777
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.730
It cannot be avoided but by this.

778
00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.630
It will not be avoided but by this.

779
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:15.430
Therefore, dear mother-- I must call you so--

780
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:19.000
be the attorney of my love to her.

781
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.330
Plead what I will be, not what I have been.

782
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:25.430
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.

783
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:28.730
Urge the necessity and state of times,

784
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:32.030
and be not peevish found in great designs.

785
00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.270
Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?

786
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.130
Aye, if the devil tempt you to do good.

787
00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.930
Shall I forget myself to be myself?

788
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:49.230
Aye, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.

789
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:51.670
Yet thou didst kill my children.

790
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:55.670
But in your daughter's womb, I bury them,

791
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.430
where, in that nest of spicery,

792
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:00.770
they will breed selves of themselves,

793
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.530
to your recomforture.

794
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:06.670
Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?

795
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:09.670
And be a happy mother by the deed.

796
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.900
I go.

797
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.330
Write to me very shortly,

798
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.100
and you shall understand from me her mind.

799
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.270
Bear her my true love's kiss.

800
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.930
And so, farewell.

801
00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.370
Relenting fool and shallow, changing woman.

802
00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:44.970
How now. What news?

803
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.600
Mighty sovereign, on the western coast

804
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.200
rideth a puissant navy.

805
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.130
To our shores throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,

806
00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.300
unarmed and unresolved to beat them back.

807
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.130
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral.

808
00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.470
And there they hull, expecting but the aid of Buckingham

809
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:59.970
to welcome them ashore.

810
00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.700
Some light-foot friend post to the duke of Norfolk:

811
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.230
Ratcliffe, thyself, or Catesby.

812
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:06.230
Where is he?

813
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:07.230
Here, my lord.

814
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.330
Catesby, fly to the duke.

815
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.070
I will, my lord, with all convenient haste.

816
00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.930
Ratcliffe, come hither.

817
00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:13.070
Post to Salisbury.

818
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:14.570
When thou comest thither--

819
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:15.730
Dull, unmindful villain,

820
00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:17.630
why stayest thou here and goest not to the duke?

821
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.330
First, mighty liege, tell me your highness' pleasure,

822
00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:23.230
what from your grace I shall deliver to him.

823
00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.230
O true, good Catesby.

824
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.400
Bid him levy straight

825
00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.330
the greatest strength and power that he can make

826
00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.030
and meet me suddenly at Salisbury.

827
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:31.670
I go.

828
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.500
What may it please you shall I do at Salisbury?

829
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.430
Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?

830
00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:39.000
Your highness told me I should post before.

831
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.170
My mind is changed.

832
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.500
Stanley, what news with you?

833
00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.300
None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing,

834
00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.970
nor none so bad but well may be reported.

835
00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:51.870
Hoyday, a riddle.

836
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.800
Neither good nor bad.

837
00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.670
What needest thou run so many miles about,

838
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:57.930
when thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?

839
00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.500
Once more, what news?

840
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.530
Richmond is on the seas.

841
00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.700
There let him sink, and be the seas on him.

842
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.600
White-livered runagate!

843
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.770
What doth he there?

844
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:10.370
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.

845
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:12.630
Well, as you guess.

846
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.330
Stirred up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,

847
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.870
he makes for England, here to claim the crown.

848
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:19.630
Is the chair empty?

849
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.130
Is the sword unswayed?

850
00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:24.300
Is the king dead, the empire unpossessed?

851
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.970
What heir of York is there alive but we?

852
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.800
And who is England's king but great York's heir?

853
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.330
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?

854
00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:36.970
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.

855
00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:40.230
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,

856
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:43.430
you cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.

857
00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:48.370
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.

858
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.270
No, my good lord.

859
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.100
Therefore mistrust me not.

860
00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.430
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?

861
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.530
Where be thy tenants and thy followers?

862
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:01.670
Are they not now upon the western shore,

863
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.670
safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?

864
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.070
No, my good lord.

865
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.670
My friends are in the north.

866
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:07.830
Cold friends to me!

867
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:09.000
What do they in the north,

868
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.330
when they should serve their sovereign in the west?

869
00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:14.600
They have not been commanded, mighty king.

870
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.130
Pleaseth your majesty to give me leave,

871
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.400
I'll muster up my friends and meet your grace

872
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.530
where and what time your majesty shall please.

873
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.300
Aye.

874
00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:28.900
Aye, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond.

875
00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.900
But I'll not trust thee.

876
00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.070
Most mighty sovereign,

877
00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:38.070
you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.

878
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:41.230
I never was nor never will be false.

879
00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.770
Go then and muster men.

880
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.300
But leave behind your son, George Stanley.

881
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.770
Look your heart be firm,

882
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.570
or else his head's assurance is but frail.

883
00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:01.230
So deal with him as I prove true to you.

884
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.570
My gracious sovereign...

885
00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.000
now in Devonshire, as I by friends am well advertised,

886
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.830
Sir Edward Courtney and the haughty prelate,

887
00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:11.400
bishop of Exeter, his elder brother,

888
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.770
with many more confederates, are in arms.

889
00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:17.200
My liege, in Kent, the Guildfords are in arms.

890
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.300
And every hour, more competitors flock to the rebels,

891
00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:20.570
and their power grows strong.

892
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:22.800
My lord, the army of great Buckingham--

893
00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:23.900
Out on you, owls!

894
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.400
Nothing but songs of death?

895
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.100
There, take thou that till thou bring better news.

896
00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.530
The news I have to tell your majesty

897
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.630
is that by sudden floods and fall of waters,

898
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.030
Buckingham's army is dispersed and scattered

899
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.200
and he himself wandered away alone, no man knows whither.

900
00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:41.770
I cry thee mercy.

901
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.770
There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.

902
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:47.000
Hath any well-advised friend proclaimed reward

903
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.600
to him that brings the traitor in?

904
00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.270
Such proclamation hath been made, my lord.

905
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:52.070
Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,

906
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:53.900
'tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.

907
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.700
But this good comfort bring I to your highness:

908
00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.000
the Breton navy is dispersed by tempest!

909
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.630
Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a boat unto the shore

910
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.100
to ask those on the banks

911
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.630
if they were his assistants, yea or no.

912
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.700
Who answered him, they came from Buckingham,

913
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.730
upon his party.

914
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.230
He, mistrusting them, hoist sail

915
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.700
and made his course again for Brittany.

916
00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.270
March on, march on, since we are up in arms,

917
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.170
if not to fight with foreign enemies,

918
00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.370
yet to beat down these rebels here at home.

919
00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:21.730
My liege! The Duke of Buckingham is taken!

920
00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:25.230
That is the best news.

921
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:26.900
That the Earl of Richmond

922
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.200
is with a mighty power landed at Milford

923
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.330
is colder tidings, yet they must be told.

924
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:33.630
Away toward Salisbury.

925
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.770
While we reason here,

926
00:48:34.770 --> 00:48:36.500
a royal battle might be won and lost.

927
00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.630
Someone take order

928
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.330
that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury.

929
00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:41.200
The rest march on with me!

930
00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:01.770
Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:

931
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:04.270
that in the sty of the most deadly boar,

932
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:07.500
my son George Stanley is franked up in hold.

933
00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.000
If I revolt, off goes young George's head.

934
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.970
'Tis fear of that holds off my present aid.

935
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.230
So get thee gone.

936
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:17.270
Commend me to thy lord.

937
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:20.800
Withal, say that the queen hath heartily consented

938
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.000
he should espouse Elizabeth, her daughter.

939
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.530
But tell me, where is princely Richmond now?

940
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.200
At Pembroke or at Harford-west in Wales

941
00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.330
with many other of great name and worth,

942
00:49:32.330 --> 00:49:35.170
and towards London do they bend their power

943
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.130
if by the way, they be not fought withal.

944
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.530
O, hie thee to thy lord.

945
00:49:38.530 --> 00:49:39.630
I kiss his hand.

946
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:42.030
My letter will resolve him of my mind.

947
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:43.530
Farewell.

948
00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:55.830
