00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870


2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.970
Will you think so?

3
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.100
Think so, Iago!

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.900
What, To kiss in private?

5
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.370
An unauthorized kiss.

6
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.270
Or to be naked with her friend in bed

7
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.000
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.170
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!

9
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.570
It is hypocrisy against the devil:

10
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.630
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,

11
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.000
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

12
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.030
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:

13
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.570
But if I give my wife a handkerchief--

14
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.070
What then?

15
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.970
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,

16
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.830
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

17
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.170
She is protectress of her honour too:

18
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.600
May she give that?

19
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.100
Her honour is an essence that is not seen;

20
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.700
They have it very oft that have it not:

21
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.970
But, for the handkerchief--

22
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.200
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.

23
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.600
Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,

24
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.970
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,

25
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.230
Boding to all--

26
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.630
he had my handkerchief.

27
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.770
Ay, what of that?

28
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.770
That's not so good now.

29
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.930
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?

30
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.830
Or heard him say-- as knaves be such abroad,

31
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.730
Who having, by their own importunate suit,

32
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.770
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,

33
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.100
Convinced or supplied them, well, they cannot choose

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.670
But they must blab--

35
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.830
Hath he said any thing?

36
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130
He hath, my lord; but be well assured,

37
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.230
No more than he'll unswear.

38
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.600
What hath he said?

39
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.270
Faith, that he did-- I know not what he did.

40
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.370
What? What?

41
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.500
Lie--

42
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.600
With her?

43
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.870
With her, on her; what you will.

44
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.770
Lie with her! Lie on her!

45
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.730
We say lie on her, when they belie her.

46
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.970
Lie with her!

47
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.270
Zounds. That's fulsome.

48
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.070
Handkerchief--confessions- - handkerchief!--

49
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.330
To confess, and be hanged for his labour--

50
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.230
first, to be hanged, and then to confess.

51
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.700
I tremble at it.

52
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.300
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion

53
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.600
without some instruction.

54
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.970
It is not words that shakes me thus.

55
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.100
Pish!

56
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.400
Noses, ears, and lips.

57
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.670
Is't possible?

58
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.330
Confess--handkerchief!-- O devil!--

59
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.230
Work on, My medicine, work!

60
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.670
Thus credulous fools are caught;

61
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.300
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,

62
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.630
All guiltless, meet reproach.

63
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.630
What, ho! My lord!

64
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.770
My lord, I say.

65
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.800
Othello.

66
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.130
How now, Cassio.

67
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.430
What's the matter?

68
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.870
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:

69
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.670
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

70
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.830
Rub him about the temples.

71
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.270
No, forbear;

72
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.030
The lethargy must have his quiet course:

73
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.400
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by

74
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.000
Breaks out to savage madness.

75
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.100
Look he stirs:

76
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.930
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,

77
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.800
He will recover straight: when he is gone,

78
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.670
I would on great occasion speak with you.

79
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.930
How is it, general?

80
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.200
Have you not hurt your head?

81
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.730
Dost thou mock me?

82
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.070
I mock thee?

83
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.230
No, by heaven.

84
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.370
Would you would take your fortune like a man!

85
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.230
A horned man's a monster and a beast.

86
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.400
There's many a beast then in a populous city,

87
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.730
And many a civil monster.

88
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.770
Did he confess it?

89
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.500
Good sir, be a man;

90
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.700
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked

91
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.670
May draw with you: there's millions now alive

92
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.800
That nightly lie in those improper beds

93
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.330
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.

94
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.230
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,

95
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.230
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,

96
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.270
Oh no, let me know;

97
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.030
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

98
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.930
Nay, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

99
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.870
Stand you awhile apart;

100
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.300
Confine yourself but in a patient list.

101
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.900
While you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--

102
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.930
A passion most unsuiting such a man--

103
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.130
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,

104
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.330
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,

105
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.800
Bade him anon return and here speak with me.

106
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.170
Do but encave yourself,

107
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.970
And mark the fleers, the gibes, the notable scorns,

108
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.170
That dwell in every region of his face;

109
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.930
For I will make him tell the tale anew,

110
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.000
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when

111
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.070
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:

112
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.270
Hurry, I say, but mark his gesture.

113
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.770
Marry, patience;

114
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.230
Or else I shall say you are all in all in spleen,

115
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.530
And nothing of a man.

116
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.930
Dost thou know, Iago?

117
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.800
I will be most cunning in my patience;

118
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.130
But--dost thou hear?-- most bloody.

119
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.470
That's not amiss;

120
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.030
Yet keep time in all.

121
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.470
Will you withdraw?

122
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.600
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,

123
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.400
A housewife that by selling her desires

124
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.230
Buys herself bread and clothes:

125
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.330
it is a creature

126
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.870
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague

127
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.170
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:

128
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.100
He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain

129
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.770
From an excess of laughter.

130
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.270
Here he comes:

131
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.830
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad.

132
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.170
His unbookish jealousy must construe

133
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.030
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,

134
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.330
Quite in the wrong.

135
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.070
How do you now, lieutenant?

136
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.870
The worser that you give me the addition

137
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.130
Whose want even kills me.

138
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.800
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.

139
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.800
Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's dower,

140
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.030
How quickly should you speed!

141
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.030
Alas, poor caitiff!

142
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.670
I never knew woman love man so.

143
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:46.930
Alas, poor rogue!

144
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.570
I think, i' faith, she loves me.

145
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.800
Do you hear, Cassio?

146
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.930
She gives it out that you shall marry hey:

147
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.030
Do you intend it?

148
00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.870
Ha, ha, ha!

149
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.130
I marry her!

150
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.230
What?

151
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.330
A customer!

152
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.730
Prithee, bear some charity to my wit:

153
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.070
don't think it so unwholesome.

154
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.730
The cry goes that you shall marry her.

155
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.870
Prithee, say true.

156
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.000
I am a very villain else.

157
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.200
This is the monkey's own giving out:

158
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.470
she is persuaded I will marry her,

159
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.830
out of her own love and flattery,

160
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.730
not out of my promise.

161
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.830
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.

162
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.270
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank

163
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.000
with certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,

164
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.430
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

165
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.700
So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me;

166
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.930
so hales, and pulls me.

167
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.400
Oh, well, I must leave her company.

168
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.570
Before me!

169
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.670
Look, where she comes.

170
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.770
'Tis such another fitchew!

171
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.870
Marry a perfumed one.

172
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.400
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

173
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.970
Let the devil and his dam haunt you!

174
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.600
What did you mean by that same handkerchief

175
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.800
you gave me even now?

176
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.200
I was a fine fool to take it.

177
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.600
I must take out the whole work?

178
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.400
A likely piece of work, that you should

179
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.800
find it in your chamber, and know not who left it there!

180
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.400
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work?

181
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.170
There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever you had it,

182
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.430
I'll take out no work on't.

183
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.630
An you'll come to supper to-night, you may;

184
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.870
an you will not,

185
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:15.000
come when you are next prepared for.

186
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.530
After her, after her.

187
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.030
'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

188
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.200
Will you sup there?

189
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.570
'Faith, I intend so.

190
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.200
Well, I may chance to see you;

191
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.430
for I would very fain speak with you.

192
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.230
Prithee, come; will you?

193
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.700
Go to; say no more.

194
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.700
How shall I murder him, Iago?

195
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.370
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

196
00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:58.800
O Iago!

197
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.430
And did you see the handkerchief?

198
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.630
Was that mine?

199
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:04.600
Yours by this hand:

200
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.600
and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife!

201
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.370
She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.

202
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.600
I would have him nine years a-killing.

203
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.270
A fine woman!

204
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.330
A fair woman! A sweet woman!

205
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.000
Nay, you must forget that.

206
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.770
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;

207
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:28.400
for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to stone;

208
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.970
I strike it, and it hurts my hand.

209
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:38.030
O, the world hath not a sweeter creature:

210
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.970
she might lie by an emperor's side

211
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:41.670
and command him tasks.

212
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.800
Nay, that's not your way.

213
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.170
Hang her!

214
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.270
I do but say what she is: so delicate with her needle:

215
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.400
an admirable musician:

216
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.470
O!

217
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:56.270
She will sing the savageness out of a bear:

218
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.770
of so high and plenteous wit and invention--

219
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:00.870
She's the worse for all this.

220
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:02.570
Ay, a thousand and thousand times:

221
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.130
and then, of so gentle a condition!

222
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.800
Ay, too gentle.

223
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.600
Nay, that's certain: and yet the pity of it, Iago!

224
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:18.100
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

225
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.370
If you be so fond over her iniquity,

226
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.870
give her patent to offend; If it touch not you,

227
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.230
it comes near nobody.

228
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.230
I chop her into messes: cuckold me!

229
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.330
O, 'tis foul in her.

230
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.530
With mine officer!

231
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.530
That's fouler.

232
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.270
Get me some poison this night, Iago.

233
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:36.770
I'll not expostulate with her,

234
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.800
lest her beauty and body unprovide my mind again:

235
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.370
this night, Iago.

236
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:41.930
Do it not with poison,

237
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.000
strangle her in her bed,

238
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.230
even the bed she hath contaminated.

239
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.330
Good: the justice of it pleases me:

240
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:57.570
good, very good.

241
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.530
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker:

242
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.500
you shall hear more by midnight.

243
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.800
Excellent good.

244
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.500
What trumpet is that same?

245
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.930
Warrant something from Venice.

246
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.800
'Tis Lodovico.

247
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.500
This comes from the duke: see, your wife is with him.

248
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.430
God save thee, worthy general!

249
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.200
With all my heart, sir.

250
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.400
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.

251
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.470
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

252
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.430
What's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

253
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.200
I am very glad to see you, signior.

254
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.500
Welcome to Cyprus.

255
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.830
I thank you.

256
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.030
How does Lieutenant Cassio?

257
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.070
Lives, sir.

258
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:48.300
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord

259
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.270
A most unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

260
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.370
Are you sure of that?

261
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.530
My lord?

262
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:54.930
'This fail you not to do, as you will--'

263
00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:56.200
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.

264
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.170
Is there division 'twixt thy lord and Cassio?

265
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.770
A most unhappy one: I would do much

266
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.170
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

267
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.270
Fire and brimstone!

268
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.470
My lord?

269
00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.830
Are you wise?

270
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.170
What, is he angry?

271
00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:11.300
May be the letter moved him;

272
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.230
For, as I think, they do command him home,

273
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.430
Deputing Cassio in his government.

274
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:17.400
By my troth, I am glad on't.

275
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.730
Indeed!

276
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.830
My lord?

277
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:21.330
I am glad to see you mad.

278
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.430
Why, sweet Othello--

279
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.470
Devil!

280
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.630
I have not deserved this.

281
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.670
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,

282
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.930
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:

283
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.570
Make her amends; she weeps.

284
00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.500
O devil, devil!

285
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.700
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,

286
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.230
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.

287
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.570
Out of my sight!

288
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.030
I will not stay to offend you.

289
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.630
Truly, an obedient lady:

290
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.270
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

291
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.270
Mistress!

292
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.870
My lord?

293
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.200
What would you with her, sir?

294
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.500
Who, I, my lord?

295
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:09.000
Ay; you did wish that I should make her turn:

296
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.330
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,

297
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.230
And turn again;

298
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.170
and she can weep, sir, weep;

299
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.330
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,

300
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.430
Very obedient.

301
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:21.930
Proceed you in your tears.

302
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.800
Concerning this, sir,--

303
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.870
O well-painted passion!--

304
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.270
I am commanded home.

305
00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.430
Get you away; I'll send for you anon.

306
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.570
Sir, I obey the mandate,

307
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.070
And will return to Venice.

308
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.630
Hence, avaunt!

309
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.700
Cassio shall have my place.

310
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.630
Sir,

311
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:13.470
tonight, I do entreat that we may sup together:

312
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:17.370
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus--

313
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.200
Goats and monkeys!

314
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.530
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate

315
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.200
Call all in all sufficient?

316
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.300
Is this the nature

317
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.830
Whom passion could not shake?

318
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.030
Whose solid virtue

319
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.230
The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,

320
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.200
Could neither graze nor pierce?

321
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.500
He is much changed.

322
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.230
Are his wits safe?

323
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.400
Is he not light of brain?

324
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.730
He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure

325
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.730
What he might be: if what he might he is not,

326
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.830
I would to heaven he were!

327
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.100
What, strike his wife!

328
00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.270
'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew

329
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.700
That stroke would prove the worst!

330
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.170
Is it his use?

331
00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.800
Or did the letters work upon his blood,

332
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.030
And new-create this fault?

333
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.130
Alas, alas!

334
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:04.900
It is not honesty in me to speak

335
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.100
What I have seen and known.

336
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.900
You shall observe him,

337
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.000
And his own courses will denote him so

338
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.170
That I may save my speech: will you go after,

339
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.230
And mark how he continues.

340
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.030
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

341
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.670
So you have seen nothing then?

342
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.370
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

343
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:49.630
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

344
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.430
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard

345
00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.600
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

346
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.530
What, did they never whisper?

347
00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.900
Never, my lord.

348
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.070
Nor send you out o' the way?

349
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.430
Never.

350
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.730
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

351
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.030
Never, my lord.

352
00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:09.800
That's strange.

353
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:14.270
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,

354
00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.700
Lay down my soul at stake:

355
00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:18.770
if you think other,

356
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.930
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.

357
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.900
If any wretch have put this in your head,

358
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.000
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!

359
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.900
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,

360
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.470
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives

361
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.930
Is foul as slander.

362
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.130
Bid her come hither: go.

363
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.270
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd

364
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.330
That cannot say as much.

365
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.270
This is a subtle whore,

366
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.730
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets

367
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.300
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

368
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:16.500
My lord, what is your will?

369
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.530
I pray you, chuck, come hither.

370
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:26.270
What is your pleasure?

371
00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.470
Let me see your eyes;

372
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.470
Look in my face!

373
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.600
What horrible fancy's this?

374
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.270
Some of your function, mistress;

375
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.600
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;

376
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.970
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:

377
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:47.970
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.

378
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:57.130
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?

379
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.570
I understand a fury in your words.

380
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:01.600
But not the words.

381
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.500
Why, what art thou?

382
00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.330
Your wife, my lord; your true

383
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.700
And loyal wife.

384
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.530
Come, swear it, damn thyself

385
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:18.930
Lest, like being one of heaven, the devils themselves

386
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.800
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:

387
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.930
Swear thou art honest.

388
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.030
Heaven doth truly know it.

389
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.370
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

390
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.530
To whom, my lord?

391
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.800
With whom?

392
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.170
How am I false?

393
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.200
Desdemona!

394
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.300
Away!

395
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.330
Away!

396
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.170
Alas the day!

397
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.930
Why do you weep?

398
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.000
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?

399
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.470
If haply you my father do suspect

400
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.170
An instrument of this your calling back,

401
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.930
Lay not your blame on me:

402
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.630
If you have lost him,

403
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.470
Why, I have lost him too.

404
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.600
Had it pleased heaven

405
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.070
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd

406
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.370
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.

407
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.070
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,

408
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.800
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,

409
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.300
I should have found in some place of my soul

410
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:35.000
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me

411
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.730
A fixed figure for the time of scorn

412
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.600
To point his slow unmoving finger at!

413
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.030
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:

414
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:55.570
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,

415
00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:58.830
Where either I must live, or bear no life;

416
00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.030
The fountain from the which my current runs,

417
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:07.630
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!

418
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.530
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads

419
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:12.670
To knot and gender in!

420
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.130
Turn thy complexion there,

421
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.570
Ay, patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin--

422
00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.870
Ay, there, look grim as hell!

423
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.370
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

424
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:33.100
O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,

425
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.030
That quicken even with blowing.

426
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.470
O thou weed,

427
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.670
Who art so lovely fresh and smell'st so sweet

428
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.370
That the sense aches at thee,

429
00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.070
would thou hadst ne'er been born!

430
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.700
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

431
00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:58.430
Alack, was this fair paper, this most goodly book,

432
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.400
Made to write 'whore' upon?

433
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.430
What committed!

434
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.570
Committed!

435
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.600
O thou public commoner!

436
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.770
I should make very forges of my cheeks,

437
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.830
That would to cinders burn up modesty,

438
00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:12.970
Did I but speak thy deeds.

439
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.470
What committed!

440
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.830
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,

441
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.700
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets

442
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.070
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth

443
00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:24.430
And will not hear it.

444
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.430
What committed!

445
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.800
Impudent strumpet!

446
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.900
By heaven, you do me wrong.

447
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.170
Are you not a strumpet?

448
00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.570
No, as I am a Christian:

449
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.330
If to preserve this vessel for my lord

450
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.130
From any other foul unlawful touch

451
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.000
Be not to be a strumpet, why, I am none.

452
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.300
What, not a whore?

453
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.570
No, as I shall be saved.

454
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:47.570
Is't possible?

455
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.200
O, heaven forgive us!

456
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.170
I cry you mercy, then:

457
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.170
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice

458
00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.870
That married with Othello.

459
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:06.800
You, mistress,

460
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.670
That have the office opposite Saint Peter,

461
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.870
And keeps the gate of hell!

462
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:13.500
You, you, ay, you!

463
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.730
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:

464
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.630
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

465
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.100
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?

466
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.600
How do you, madam?

467
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.630
How do you, my good lady?

468
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.730
'Faith, half asleep.

469
00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.570
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

470
00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:02.100
With who?

471
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.270
Why, with my lord, my lady.

472
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.700
Who is thy lord?

473
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.600
He that is yours, sweet lady.

474
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600
I have none:

475
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.330
do not talk to me, Emilia;

476
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.500
I cannot weep; nor answers have I none,

477
00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:26.100
As I should go by water.

478
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.230
I prithee, tonight

479
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.970
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;

480
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.130
And call thy husband hither.

481
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.700
Here's a change indeed!

482
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.130
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.

483
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.570
How have I been behaved, that he should stick

484
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:09.930
The small'st opinion on my great'st abuse?

485
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.830
What is your pleasure, madam?

486
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.130
How is't with you?

487
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.200
I cannot tell.

488
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:31.870
Those that do teach young babes

489
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.630
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:

490
00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.670
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,

491
00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:43.670
I am a child to chiding.

492
00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:46.200
What is the matter, lady?

493
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.230
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.

494
00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.300
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,

495
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.670
As true hearts cannot bear it.

496
00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.770
Am I that name, Iago?

497
00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:57.130
What name, fair lady?

498
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.900
Such as she says my lord did say I was.

499
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.200
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink

500
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.300
Would not have laid such terms upon his callat.

501
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.030
Why did he so?

502
00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.770
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

503
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.170
Do not weep, do not weep.

504
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:12.430
Alas the day!

505
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.870
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,

506
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.370
Her father and her country and her friends,

507
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.600
To be call'd whore?

508
00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.900
Would it not make one weep?

509
00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.270
It is my wretched fortune.

510
00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:23.830
Beshrew him for't!

511
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.270
How comes this trick upon him?

512
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.100
Nay, heaven doth know.

513
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.870
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,

514
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.800
Some busy and insinuating rogue,

515
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.700
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,

516
00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.700
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

517
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.770
There is no such man; it is impossible.

518
00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.230
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

519
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.770
A halter pardon him!

520
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.730
And hell gnaw his bones!

521
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.600
Why should he call her whore?

522
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.130
What keeps her company?

523
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.230
What time? What place? What form?

524
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.500
What likelihood?

525
00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.270
The Moor's abused by some egregious knave,

526
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.770
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.

527
00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:07.070
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,

528
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.070
And put in every honest hand a whip

529
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.130
To lash the rascals naked through the world

530
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.300
Even to the east to the west!

531
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.670
Speak within door.

532
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.430
O, fie upon them!

533
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:18.670
Some such squire he was

534
00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.530
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,

535
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.330
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

536
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:23.770
You are a fool; go to.

537
00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.370
O good Iago,

538
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.930
How shall I win my lord again?

539
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.330
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,

540
00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.070
I know not how I lost him.

541
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.600
Here I do kneel:

542
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.630
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,

543
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.970
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,

544
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.200
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,

545
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.970
Delighted them in any other form;

546
00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.330
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.

547
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.630
And ever will-- though he do shake me off

548
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.600
To beggarly divorcement-- love him dearly,

549
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.130
Comfort forswear me!

550
00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.130
Unkindness may do much;

551
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.970
And his unkindness may defeat my life,

552
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.100
But never taint my love.

553
00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.330
I cannot say 'whore:'

554
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.730
It does abhor me now I speak the word;

555
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.430
To do the act that might the addition earn

556
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:19.570
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

557
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:26.400
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:

558
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.730
The business of the state does him offence,

559
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:29.930
And he doth chide with you.

560
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.030
If 'twere no other--

561
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.630
'Tis but so, I warrant.

562
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:37.400
Hark, how these instruments summon you to supper!

563
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.770
Boo, boo, boo, boo.

564
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.930
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;

565
00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:48.230
Go in, and weep not; all things will be well.

566
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.530
Boo, boo, boo, boo.

567
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.270
Come on.

568
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.830
Boo, boo, boo, boo.

569
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.030
Doo, roo, doo, roo.

570
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.630
How now, Roderigo!

571
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.500
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

572
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.730
What in the contrary?

573
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.170
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;

574
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.670
and rather, as it seems to me now,

575
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.570
keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me

576
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.100
with the least advantage of hope.

577
00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:21.400
I will indeed no longer endure it,

578
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.370
nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace

579
00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.730
what already I have foolishly suffered.

580
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.600
Will you hear me, Roderigo?

581
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.630
'Faith, I've heard too much, for your words

582
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.930
and performances are no kin together.

583
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.030
You charge me most unjustly.

584
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.900
With nought but truth.

585
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.300
I have wasted myself out of my means.

586
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.930
The jewels you've had from me to deliver to Desdemona

587
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.070
would half have corrupted a votarist:

588
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:46.200
you've told me she hath received them

589
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.970
and returned me expectations and comforts

590
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.570
of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.

591
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:51.800
Well; go to; very well.

592
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.900
Very well!

593
00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.030
Go to!

594
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.400
I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well:

595
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.600
By this hand, I say it is scurvy,

596
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.530
and begin to find myself fobbed in it.

597
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.630
Very well.

598
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.400
I say 'tis not very well.

599
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.170
I will make myself known to Desdemona:

600
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:10.930
if she'll return me my jewels,

601
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.730
I'll give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation;

602
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:19.370
if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.

603
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:20.900
You have said now.

604
00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.030
Ay, and said nothing

605
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.870
but what I protest intendment of doing.

606
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:31.470
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee,

607
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:34.900
and even from this instant to build

608
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.870
a better opinion of thee than ever before.

609
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:42.470
Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken against me

610
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:43.970
a most just exception;

611
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.200
but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly

612
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.300
in thy affair.

613
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.970
It hath not appeared.

614
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:53.900
I grant indeed it hath not appeared,

615
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.970
and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.

616
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:01.900
But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed,

617
00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.930
which I have greater reason to suspect now than ever,

618
00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.270
why, I mean purpose,

619
00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:16.630
courage, valour, this night show it:

620
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.030
if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,

621
00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:22.530
take me from this world with treachery,

622
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.730
devise engines for my life.

623
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:27.830
Well, what is it?

624
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.570
Is it within reason and compass?

625
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:35.430
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice

626
00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.930
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

627
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:39.230
Is that true?

628
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.970
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.

629
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.900
O, no; he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him

630
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.270
the fair Desdemona, unless his abode

631
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.800
be lingered here by some accident:

632
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.430
whereto none can be so determinate

633
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.900
as the removing of Cassio.

634
00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:59.630
How do you mean, removing of him?

635
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.900
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;

636
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:07.200
knocking out his brains.

637
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.700
And that you would have me to do?

638
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:16.200
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.

639
00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.570
He sups to-night with a harlotry,

640
00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.300
and thither will I go to him:

641
00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.200
he knows not yet of his honorable fortune.

642
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.730
If you will watch his going thence,

643
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.130
which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,

644
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.000
you may take him at your pleasure:

645
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.970
I'll be near by to second thy attempt,

646
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:35.130
and he shall fall between us.

647
00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:38.200
Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me;

648
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:43.230
I will show you such a necessity in his death

649
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:47.530
that you will think yourself bound to put it on him.

650
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.870
It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste:

651
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:51.100
about it.

652
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.630
I will hear further reason for this.

653
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.500
And you shall be satisfied.

654
00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:22.070
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

655
00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.070
O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.

656
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.730
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

657
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.770
Your honour is most welcome.

658
00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:40.630
So will you walk?

659
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.730
O--Desdemona--

660
00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.230
My lord?

661
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:53.230
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith:

662
00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.500
dispatch your attendant there: look it be done.

663
00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.470
I will, my lord.

664
00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.230
How goes it now?

665
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.570
He looks gentler than he did.

666
00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.970
He says he will return incontinent:

667
00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.000
He hath commanded me to go to bed,

668
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.100
And bade me to dismiss you.

669
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.300
Dismiss me!

670
00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.800
That was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia.

671
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.100
Give me my nightly wearing:

672
00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.900
We must not now displease him.

673
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.470
I would you had never seen him!

674
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:19.230
So would not I my love doth so approve him,

675
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.500
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--

676
00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:26.670
Prithee, unpin me-- have grace and favour in them.

677
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.530
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

678
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:33.570
All's one.

679
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.530
Good faith, how foolish are our minds!

680
00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:51.000
If I should die before thee prithee, shroud me

681
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.730
In one of those same sheets.

682
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.170
Oh, come, come you talk.

683
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:27.470
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:

684
00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.730
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad

685
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:38.230
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'

686
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.100
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,

687
00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.670
And she died singing it:

688
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.270
that song to-night

689
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:53.670
Will not go from my mind;

690
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.000
I have much to do,

691
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.030
But go hang my head all on one side,

692
00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.970
And sing it like poor Barbara.

693
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.630
Prithee, dispatch.

694
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.930
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

695
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.000
No, no, no, unpin me here.

696
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.130
This Lodovico is a proper man.

697
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:19.470
A very handsome man.

698
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.830
He speaks well.

699
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.030
I know a lady in Venice would have walked

700
00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:28.130
barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

701
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:46.530
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,

702
00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:51.930
Sing all a green willow:

703
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:57.300
Sing willow, willow, willow:

704
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:05.370
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,

705
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:10.000
Sing all a green willow.

706
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.530
Sing willow, willow, willow.

707
00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:24.700
The fresh stream ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;

708
00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:29.470
Sing willow, willow, willow;

709
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:37.570
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;

710
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:43.200
Sing willow, willow, willow;

711
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.530
Lay by these--

712
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:55.530
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.

713
00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.430
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon--

714
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.800
Let nobody blame him--

715
00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.870
No, that's not next.

716
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.170
Hark! Who is't that knocks?

717
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.900
It's the wind.

718
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:28.770
I call'd my love false love; and what said he then?

719
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:37.270
Sing willow, willow, willow; Sing all a green willow.

720
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:46.630
If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!

721
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:52.670
Sing willow, willow, willow.

722
00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.230
So, get thee gone; good night

723
00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.570
Oh, mine eyes do itch;

724
00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:12.270
Doth that bode weeping?

725
00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.400
'Tis neither here nor there.

726
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.770
Oh, I have heard it said so.

727
00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.870
O, these men, these men!

728
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.330
Dost thou in conscience think-- tell me, Emilia--

729
00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:33.370
That there be women do abuse their husbands

730
00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.730
In such gross kind?

731
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.930
There be some such, no question.

732
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:43.470
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

733
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.870
Why, would not you?

734
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.870
Nay, by this heavenly light!

735
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.970
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;

736
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.330
I might do't as well i' the dark.

737
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:58.800
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

738
00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.400
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price

739
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:04.930
For a small vice.

740
00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.270
Good troth, I think thou wouldst not.

741
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:15.400
By my troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had done it.

742
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.330
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring,

743
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.930
nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns and petticoats,

744
00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:28.430
nor caps, nor for any petty exhibition;

745
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.830
but for all the whole world--

746
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.870
pity what woman would not make her husband a cuckold

747
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.070
to make him a monarch?

748
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.070
I should venture purgatory for't.

749
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.370
Beshrew me, if I should do such a wrong

750
00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:45.400
For the whole world.

751
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.200
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world:

752
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.400
and having the world for your labour,

753
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.270
tis a wrong in your own world,

754
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:54.370
and you might quickly make it right.

755
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.300
I do not believe there is any such woman.

756
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:02.070
Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage

757
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.500
as would store the world they played for.

758
00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.600
But I do think it is their husbands' faults

759
00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.600
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,

760
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.930
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,

761
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.130
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,

762
00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.370
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,

763
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:26.600
Or scant our former having in despite;

764
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.470
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,

765
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.200
Yet have we some revenge.

766
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.630
Let husbands know

767
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:41.170
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell

768
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.170
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,

769
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:44.230
As men have.

770
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.030
What is it that they do

771
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.830
When they change us for others?

772
00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.970
Is it sport?

773
00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:02.630
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?

774
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:07.700
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?

775
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.930
It is so too: and have not we affections,

776
00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:18.100
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?

777
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:23.070
Then let them use us well: else let them know,

778
00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:25.800
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

779
00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.070
Good night, good night:

780
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.130
God me such uses send,

781
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:50.900
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

782
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:32.870
