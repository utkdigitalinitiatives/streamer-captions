WEBVTT

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
MICHAEL, WE LOVE YOU.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
WE WANT TO CONVEY THAT TO YOU.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
IF YOU LIVE LIKE THE DEVIL,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AND GO

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
MY SISTER CALLED AND SAID I

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
DON'T KNOW IF YOU PRAY TO GOD,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
BUT YOU BETTER START.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
WHEN I SAW THE FLYER, I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A HOAX.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
THIS CHURCH HAS A WEBSITE

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
CALLED GOD HATES FAGS.COM.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
THE PEOPLE OF SAND SPRINGS,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
OKLAHOMA HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
QUITE LIKE IT.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
TO SEE MY SON'S NAME ON FLYER

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I COULDN'T BEAR IT.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
IT IS A SIN.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
BECAUSE GOD DID CREATE ADAM AND

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
EVE.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'M KNOWN AS THE FAG, THAT

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
GAY KID.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I DREADED EVERY DAY.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
IT OPENED MY EYES TO HOW MUCH

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
DISCRIMINATION WE DO HAVE.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
TONIGHT, THE MIRACLE.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
ONE TOWN'S STRUGGLE WITH GOD,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
GAYS, BIGOTRY AND COMPASSION.

TONIGHT'S BROADCAST, YOU WILL,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
NO DOUBT, FIND A WAY.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
PERHAPS, IN FACT, THERE IS NO

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
WAY OF DEALING WITH THE STRUGGLE

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
OF A YOUNG HOMOSEXUAL IN THE

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
HEART OF OKLAHOMA'S BIBLE BELT

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
WITHOUT OFFENDING SOMEONE AND

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
WHAT IS "NIGHTLINE" AFTER ALL IF

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
NOT A MEDIA OUTLET.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
INDEED, IT'S WORSE THAN YOU

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
THINK.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
ALL OF THE ORIGINAL REPORTING

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000

YOU CAN BET WHERE THIS STORY IS

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
COMING FROM.

MINUTES.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
DAN MORRIS DID RELY HEAVILY ON

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
ANN HALL'S REPORTING WHICH

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
SPREAD OVER MUCH OF 2004 BUT

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
MOST OF THIS STORY IS TOLD

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
THROUGH THE VOICES OF THE DEEPLY

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
RELIGIOUS DAP TIFT FAMILY.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
THE PASTOR OF THEIR LOCAL CHURCH

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
COMMUNITY, ALL OF THEM TRYING TO

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
DESPERATELY TO RECONCILE THEIR

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
PROFOUND BELIEF THAT

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN AGAINST

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
GOD AND A LOVE AND COMPASSION

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000

IN WHAT YOU FEEL *

* LOOKING FOR A PLACE

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
TO CALL HOME **

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
MY MOM AND SISTER, THEY HAD

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
NO CLUE.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
MEL HAGGARD WAS MY FAVORITE.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
MY FIRST CAR WAS A TRUCK.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
AN OLD BROWN TRUCK.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I LOVE MY TRUCK.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
IT'S MY BABE.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
**

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I'D BE PLAYING MERLE HAGGARD

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
AND THEY'D HAVE NO CLUE.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THAT'S WHY THEY COULDN'T

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, WHAT WENT

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
WRONG?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
THEY SAID I'M A MAN.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Reporter:.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
IT WAS SHATTERING.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
IT SCARED ME.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
IT HURT.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
OF COURSE, WITH MY RELIGIOUS

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
BELIEFS, IT WAS SOMETHING THAT

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
JUST WAS NOT, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
DIDN'T DO, YOU KNOW?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
AND I HAD READ THE VERSES THAT,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
YOU KNOW, THAT SAID HOMOSEXUALS

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
WILL NOT INHERIT IN HEAVEN.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I THOUGHT IT WAS DISGUSTING

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
AT FIRST.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
IT MADE ME FEEL -- IT'S LIKE I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
KNEW MY BROTHER GROWING UP MY

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
ENTIRE LIFE AND NOW I DIDN'T

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
KNOW HOW TO TALK TO HIM.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
IT WAS GROSS TO THINK, YOU KNOW,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
OH, MY GOSH, THAT'S MY BROTHER.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I TOLD HIM MANY TIMES THROUGH

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
LOTS OF TEARS THAT I THINK THE

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
ONE THING, ESPECIALLY A MOTHER,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I SAID, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
TO GET TO HEAVEN, AT THE END OF

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
THIS LIFETIME AND YOU NOT BE

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
THERE WITH ME.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
AND THAT, IN ITSELF, HURTS MORE

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
THAN ANYTHING.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
THAT'S THE BIGGEST FEAR.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
SAND SPRINGS IS SEVEN MILES

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
FROM TULSA, BUT IN MANY WAYS,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
IT'S A LOT FARTHER.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
IT REALLY IS A SMALL TOWN.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I CAME TO SAND SPRINGS TO WRITE

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF A YOUNG

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
GAY PERSON COMING OF AGE IN THE

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
BIBLE BELT IN THE YEAR 2004,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
WHICH THE TOPIC OF HOMOSEXUALITY

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
AND SAME SEX MARRIAGE WAS VERY

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
MUCH IN THE NATIONAL

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
CONVERSATION.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF OKLAHOMA'S

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
2004 LEGISLATIVE SESSION, TEN

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.000
AIN'T-GAY BILLS WERE INTRODUCED

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
INTO THE LEGISLATURE.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
THERE WAS A HUGE DEBATE GOING ON

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
ABOUT SAME SEX MARRIAGE AND ITS

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.000
STATE.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
ONE OF THE FIERCEST IN THE WHOLE

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
COUNTRY.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
**

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I WOULD SAY, OVERALL, THAT IN

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
SAND SPRINGS, WE ARE MUCH LIKE

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
THE STATE, THAT WE ARE VERY

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
CONSERVATIVE AND THE VIEW OF

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
HOMOSEXUALITY IS ONE THAT IT'S A

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
SIN.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
IT IS WRONG IN THAT IT IS A

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
SIN.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
AND I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
MARRIED OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
BECAUSE GOD DID CREATE ADAM AND

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
EVE AND THAT'S JUST WHAT I

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
BELIEVE.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I SENT HIM TO A PSYCHIATRIC

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
CENTER.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000
AND, AT THAT TIME, BELIEVING

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
THAT HOMOSEXUALITY WAS A DISEASE

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
AN ABNORMALITY.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I THOUGHT I COULD GET HELP FOR

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.000
HIM THERE.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
AT FIRST, I WAS NERVOUS,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
BECAUSE I THOUGHT MY MOM IS

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
GOING TO TRY TO HAVE THEM CHANGE

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
ME, BUT THEN IT WAS A SAFE

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.000
PLACE.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I GOT TO BE MYSELF.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
IT WASN'T AN ISSUE THERE.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
BUT THE PROBLEM WAS IS THAT

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
THEY WERE ACCEPTING OF THIS WHAT

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I CALL CHOSEN BEHAVIOR.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I GOT VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
PSYCHIATRIC FIELD.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000

CHARLES PAIGE HIGH SCHOOL.

THE ONE HIGH SCHOOL IN SAND

SPRINGS.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
FOR MICHAEL, THE SCHOOL

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
ATMOSPHERE GOT PRETTY TENSE LAST

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
YEAR.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I WAS KNOWN AS THE FAG, THAT

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
GAY KID.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I'D MAKE SURE TO WALK IN THE

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
HALLS WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.000
AROUND.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I NEVER WENT TO THE BOOTH ROOM.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
NOT EVEN -- I JUST WAS AFRAID TO

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
I DREADED EVERY DAY.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I'D PULL UP IN THE PARKING LOT

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
AND JUST SIT THERE FOR A MINUTE

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
AND TRYING TO PRAY, BUT IT'S NOT

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
AS BAD, MAYBE THEY'LL JUST LEAVE

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
ME ALONE.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Reporter: AFTER MICHAEL HAD

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
BEEN GAY FOR SOME MONTHS, JANICE

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
WENT TO HER PASTOR, BILL EUBANKS

AT CORNER STONE CHURCH AND

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
TALKED TO BILL ABOUT WHAT THEY

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
COULD DO TO MICHAEL AND BRING

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
MICHAEL BACK TO THE HETEROSEXUAL

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.000
WAY OF LIVING.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
WITHOUT HIM, WE ARE NOTHING.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Reporter: AS MICHAEL

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
CONTINUED TO GO TO CHURCH, THE

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000
ATMOSPHERE IN OKLAHOMA BECAME

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
MORE CHARGED OF THE POLITICAL

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
SEASON.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
PRESIDENT BUSH CAME OUT AND

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
CALLED FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
AMENDMENT ON BANNING GAY

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.000
MARRIAGE.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
SO PASTOR EUBANKS NEEDED TO

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
ADDRESS THIS FROM THE PULPIT IN

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
SOME WAY.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
BUT HE WENT UP TO JANICE BEFORE

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
THE CHURCH SERMON THIS ONE

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
SUNDAY WHEN HE WAS GOING TO

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.000
PREACH ABOUT IT.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I SAID, "JANICE, I JUST WANT

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF THIS, THAT

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I'LL BE SPEAKING ABOUT THIS

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
ISSUE."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
AND I'M NOT POINTING FINGERS.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I'M NOT TRYING TO JUMP DOWN

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
ANYONE'S THROAT OR ANYTHING TO

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
CONDEMN, BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEED

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
TO SPEAK THIS TRUTH.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Reporter: EUBANKS PROCEEDED

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
TO SAY FROM THE PULPIT WHAT HE

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
THOUGHT ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE AND

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
HOMOSEXUALITY AS THE BIBLE

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
TAUGHT IT AND JANICE WAS

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.000
MORTIFIED.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
SHE THOUGHT THE WHOLE CHURCH,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
THERE WAS PROBABLY 500 PEOPLE IN

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
CHURCH THAT DAY THAT WAS

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
THINKING THAT EUBANKS WAS

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
DIRECTING A SERMON AT JANICE AND

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
MICHAEL.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
ONE WEEKEND, IT WAS A COLD

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
FEBRUARY WEEKEND, MICHAEL

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
PAINTED FLAMES ON THE FRONT OF

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
HIS CHEVY SHY ENTRUCK.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
HE THOUGHT IT WAS SOMETHING HE

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
HAD SEEN IN THE STOCK CAR RACES.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I TOOK SO MUCH PRIDE IN THAT.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF WITH

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.000
MASKING TAPE.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I WAS SO PROUD GOING TO SCHOOL

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
THAT DAY WITH MY LITTLE FLAMES.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
IT WAS QUICKLY SHOT DOWN.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
THEY WERE POINTING, LAUGHING,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000
FLIPPING ME OFF.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
SAYING THAT NOW I'M A FLAMING

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
HOMO, FLAMING FAG.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
AND A QUEER.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
SO I JUST KEPT DRIVING.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
DROVE HOME.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
WHEN WE COME BACK, "THE

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
WASHINGTON POST" SERIES ON

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
MICHAEL IMPROVES HIS LIFE

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
DRAMATICALLY AND CHANGES LIFE IN

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
A SMALL TOWN IN WAYS IT COULD

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
NEVER HAVE IMAGINED.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I SAW THE FLYER.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A HOAX.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I THOUGHT THIS CANNOT BE REAL.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
IT WAS FIRST A SHOCK TO SEE

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
MICHAEL'S PICTURE ON THE FRONT

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.000
PAGE.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I MEAN, THAT WAS SOMETHING.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
WHAT I FELT, AS I WAS READING IT

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
"THE WASHINGTON POST" ARTICLE, I

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000
WAS READING IT AND IT WAS LIKE

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
MY LIFE LAID OUT THERE.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
YOU KNOW, I'M READING ABOUT

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
MYSELF, ABOUT MY FAMILY.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Reporter: IT'S HARD FOR SOME

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
HERE YOU HAD A MOM WHO HADN'T

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
TOLD ANYBODY THAT SHE HAD A GAY

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
SON AND, YET, SHE'S WILLING TO

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
TALK TO "THE WASHINGTON POST"

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
AND JANICE REALLY BELIEVED THERE

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
WAS A PUBLIC SERVICE ELEMENT TO

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
THIS.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
SHE FELT LIKE THERE WERE OTHER

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
MOTHERS AND OTHER PARENTS

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
PROBABLY GOING THROUGH THIS VERY

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
ISOLATING, LONELY, TERRIFYING

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
EXPERIENCE, AND SHE FELT IF

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
THERE WAS ONE OTHER PERSON WHO

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
MIGHT READ THIS STORY, IT WOULD

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
BE WORTH ANY RISK.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT WAS

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
OH, MY GOODNESS, COULD WE NOT

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
HAVE USED LAST NAMES?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
THAT WAS -- I WAS A LITTLE

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
FEARFUL WITH THAT.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I LEARNED THINGS ABOUT MICHAEL

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
AND THAT WAS HARD.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I DON'T WANT TO READ STUFF LIKE

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
THAT.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW SOME THINGS

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.000
THINGS.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
IT BROUGHT TEARS, YOU KNOW?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I CRIED.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
BUT IT WAS VERY ACCURATE.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
EVERYTHING THAT WAS SAID THAT I

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
DID, YOU KNOW, WITH QUOTING

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
SCRIPTURES AND PRAYING OVER HIS

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
ROOM, EVERYTHING WAS ACCURATE.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I DID THAT.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Reporter: HE RECEIVED

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
HUNDREDS OF LETTERS FROM READERS

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
AROUND THE COUNTRY, MANY OF THEM

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
MEN WHO HAD GROWN UP IN RURAL

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
AMERICA IN THE HEARTLAND, IN

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
FARMING REGIONS AND HAD HAD

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
MICHAEL'S EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I GOT THIS BIG PACKAGE IN THE

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
MAIL.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
IT SAID FROM TED AND I HAD NO

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
IDEA WHO TED ALLEN WAS.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I OPENED IT AND THERE WAS A BOOK

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:59.000
A NEW BOOK CALLED "QUEER GUY."

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
AND I READ THE BOOK AND AMAZING

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THE SUPPORT FROM HIM.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
IT WAS PROBABLY -- I CAN'T

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.000
REMEMBER.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
MAYBE TWO WEEKS AFTER "THE

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
WASHINGTON POST" ARTICLE, OUR

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
PASTOR CALLED ME AT WORK AND

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
SAID THAT HE'D RECEIVED A FAX

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
FROM A WESTBORO BAPTIST CHURCH.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
WHEN I SAW THAT FLYER, I WAS

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
SHOCKED, A LITTLE BIT ANGRY.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
HOW DARE THEY.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
MY SISTER CALLED AND SAID, "I

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
DON'T KNOW IF YOU PRAY TO GOD,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
BUT YOU BETTER START."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
IT WAS LIKE WHY?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
SHE WAS LIKE, "WELL, PEOPLE ARE

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
GOING TO COME PROTEST OUR CHURCH

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
BECAUSE OF YOU."

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I HAD WALKED INTO MY JOB AND

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
A LADY, TWO OF THE LADIES THERE

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
WERE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT'

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
MOOP.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
AND I SAID, "WHAT?"

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
THEY SAID, "YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.000
FLYER?"

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
WHEN I SAW THE FLYER, I

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
REALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A HOAX.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I THOUGHT THIS CANNOT BE REAL.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
AND I PULL UP THE WEBSITE.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I BEGAN TO READ AND IT BECAME

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:03.000
UNBELIEVABLE.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
AND I STARTED HAVING THIS ALMOST

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
SICKENING FEELING ABOUT THIS CAN

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
THIS BE REAL?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Reporter: WEST BORO BAPTIST

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
CHURCH IS RUN BY A MINISTER

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
NAMED FRED PHELPS AND HE HAS A

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
WEB SIDE CALLED GOTHATESFADS.COM

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
AND THEIR MISSION IS TO TARGET,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.000
HUMILIATE GAY PEOPLE.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
WHEN THE GAY MARRIAGE SPLIT

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
HAPPENED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR, THE

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
PHELPS CREW FLEW OUT THERE TO

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
PROTEST ON THE STEPS OF CITY

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
THEATER AND HUMILIATION AND GAYS

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
ARE THEIR TARGET.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
AFTER I DID SOME RESEARCH ON

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
THEM ON THE INTERNET, THEN I

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
FOUND OUT WHO THEY WERE AND THEN

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I THOUGHT, OKAY, HERE WE GO.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I WAS SO UPSET, I WAS SO

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
ANGRY, I COULDN'T EVEN -- I

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000
COULD NOT EVEN SPEAK.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I WAS SO UPSET.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
IT THAT SOMEBODY COULD WRITE

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
THAT ABOUT MY BABY BROTHER.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
ON THESE FLYERS, THERE IS A

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
PICTURE OF MICHAEL SHACKELFORD

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000

GOSPEL IN SAND SPRINGS AND

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
BROKEN ARROW TO TELL MICHAEL

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
SHACKELFORD THAT SODOMY IS A

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
MONSTER SIN AGAINST GOD THAT

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
WILL DESTROY THE LIFE AND DAMN

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.000
THE SOUL?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
I WAS NOT WORRIED ABOUT

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
PROTEST, BUT ABOUT MY MOM.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
TO SEE MY SON'S NAME ON A

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
FLYER, HIS PICTURE AND TO SAY

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
GOD HATES MICHAEL SHACKELFORD, I

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
COULDN'T BEAR IT.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000
AND SO I WAS GOING TO GO PICK UP

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
THIS FLYER AND LOOK AT IT.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
AS I WAS LEAVING MY FIRST JOB,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
MY BROTHER IS WAITING FOR ME.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
MY BROTHER AND MY SIDE OF THE

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
FAMILY DID NOT KNOW ABOUT

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
MICHAEL.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
MY BROTHER GOES TO THE COFFEE

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
SHOP AND IS PRESENTED THIS FLYER

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
AND SO HE MEETS ME AND ASKED ME

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
IF I HAD SEEN THE FLYER, AND I

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
JUST -- WE SAT THERE IN THE

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
TRUCK AND CRIED TOGETHER.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
HE SAID, "I THINK IT'S TIME TO

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
TELL YOUR FAMILY."

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
WHEN WE COME BACK, A TENSE

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
CONVERSATION OVER MICHAEL AND A

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
SURPRISING REACTION IN HIS

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
HOMETOWN.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
IF YOU LIVE LIKE THE DEVIL,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
YOU'RE GOI TO DIE AND GO

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Reporter: THE MORNING OF

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
CHURCH THAT SUNDAY MORNING, I

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
GUESS WE WERE PREPARED.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
WE KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
TO BE LINED UP AT THE ENTRANCE

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
TO THE CHURCH.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
SPECIFICALLY AT THIS CHURCH

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
OR IN THIS EVIL TOWN TODAY

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
BECAUSE HIS LIFE STYLE IS TOUTED

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
AS MERELY AN INNOCENT ALTERNATE

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
LIFE STYLE THAT SOME PEOPLE IN

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
THE BIBLE BELT MIGHT STRUGGLE

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
WITH FROM TIME TO TIME.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I WENT BECAUSE I WANTED TO

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.000
SEE.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
ON AND SEE THEIR SIGNS AND SEE

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
WHO THEY WERE.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
AND SEE IF THE CHURCH'S

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.000
REACTION.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I WANTED TO BE THERE SINCE I

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
FELT LIKE I WAS THE CAUSE OF IT.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I FELT KIND OF BAD.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
IT WAS VERY SHOCKING BECAUSE

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
NOT ONLY WERE THE SIGNS

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
DEROGATORY TOWARDS HOMOSEXUALS,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
YOU KNOW, THERE WERE THINGS LIKE

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
YOUR PREACHER IS LYING TO YOU.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
THANK GOD FOR 9/11, THEY WERE

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
DRAGGING THE AMERICAN FLAG AND

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
WALKING ON IT.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I DID GET THE CHURCH READY.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I SPOKE WITH THEM THAT THEY WERE

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
COMING AND I ASKED THE CHURCH TO

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
FAST AND PRAY.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
WHICH THEY DID.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I ALSO KNEW THAT THE SCRIPTURE

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
SAYS YOU DO NOT RETURN EVIL FOR

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
EVIL.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
SO, TO ME, IF WE WERE TO STEP

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
ASIDE AND TRY TO TAKE THEM ON,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
THAT WOULD DISTRACT FROM WHO WE

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
ARE.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
WE'RE COMING TO WORSHIP GOD.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Reporter: THAT SUNDAY MORNING

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
AT CORNERSTONE, 300 TO 400 FOLKS

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
ARRIVED FOR CHURCH AND PASSING

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
THROUGH THE GAUNTLET OF

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.000
PROTESTERS.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
ONCE THEY WERE IN THE DOORS OF

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
THE CHURCH, IT WAS VIBRANT AND

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
PEOPLE WERE PRAISING IN A HIGH

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
FASHION AND EUBANKS SAID FROM

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
THE PULPIT THAT "GOD LOVES US

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
ALL."

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
AND THERE WAS APPLAUSE AND THEN

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
HE SAYS, "GOD LOVES US ALL!"

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
AND THE PLACE WAS ON ITS FEET.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
THERE WAS EXCITEMENT AND

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
INTENSITY WITH THE PEOPLE.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
BECAUSE THEIR PLANS, THEIR

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
PRAYERS WAS TO WALK IN VICTORY.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
AS I WALKED INTO CHURCH, OF

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000
COURSE, I HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
COME UP AND GIVE ME A HUG.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
SUPPORTING MICHAEL, THEY WERE

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
SUPPORTING SHELLEY, THAT WAS

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
FAMILY MEMBERS SUPPORTING ME.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
AND I THINK PEOPLE THAT JUST

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000
WERE CURIOUS.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
A GUY CAME UP TO MICHAEL,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
CREW CUT, BLUE JEANS HOLDING HIS

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
OWN BIBLE AND HE SAID, "MAN, YOU

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000
BE WHO YOU ARE.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
WE GOT YOUR BACK."

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I FELT PRETTY BAD AND I TOLD

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
HIM IT OPENED MY EYES TO HOW

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
MUCH DISCRIMINATION WE DO HAVE.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
EVERYBODY CAME UP TO ME AND

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000
WERE SUPPORTIVE.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000
WHILE WE WERE STANDING UP THERE,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
A GUY DROVE BY AND GAVE ME A

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
THUMB'S UP.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Reporter: MICHAEL WAS

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
OVERCOME BY THE SUPPORT.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
HE COULDN'T BELIEVE THEY WERE

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:45.000
STANDING BEHIND HIM.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
IN THE CONGREGATION, AS I

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
SAID, "MICHAEL, WE LOVE YOU,"

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
THEY BURST OUT IN APPLAUSE,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
BECAUSE THEY DO.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
AND IF YOU WERE TO ASK THEM WHAT

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
THEIR FEELINGS ARE ABOUT

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
HOMOSEXUALITY, THEY BELIEVE IT'S

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
A SIN.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
BUT THEY LOVE MICHAEL.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
YOU'RE DESPERATE.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
YOU'RE SICK!

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
THE TOWN REALLY WAS OUTRAGED

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
WHEN PHELPS ARRIVED.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
THE DAY OF THE PROTESTS AT THE

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
SCHOOL, LOTS OF PARENTS AND KIDS

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
HAD PAINTED THEIR CARS WITH

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
THEIR OWN SLOGANS TO COUNTER THE

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
VILE CLOGAN -- SLOGANS ON THE

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
PHELPS SIGNS SO IT WAS A CLASH

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
OF SENSIBILITIES AND IT WAS ALL

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
PLAYED OUT ON THE GROUND OF THE

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
SCHOOL.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.000
YOU'RE EVIL!

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
THIS ONE GIRL HAD A BACKPACK

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
ON AND WAS A STUDENT AT CHARLES

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
PAIGE.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
SHE TURNED AROUND TO THE

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
PROTESTERS AND SAID, "LEAVE OUR

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
HOMOS ALONE."

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
IT'S A LITTLE FUNNY, BUT I THINK

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
IT'S HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
TOWN FELT.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
MICHAEL SHACKELFORD MIGHT BE A

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
SINNER, BUT HE'S OUR SINNER AND

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
HOW DARE YOU COME HERE AND

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
QUESTION OUR GODLINESS.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000
MICHAEL LOVES OKLAHOMA.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
IT'S THE ONLY PLACE HE'S EVER

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
WANTED TO LIVE.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
HE LOVES RIDING IN HIS TRUCK ON

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
A SUMMER NIGHT WITH THE WINDOWS

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000
ROLLED DOWN AND RIDING ACROSS

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
THE ARKANSAS RIVER, BUT HE'S NOT

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
SURE THIS PLACE WILL ACCEPT HIM

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
AND HE CAN LIVE A LIFE HERE AS

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
HE REALLY IS.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
I'M KIND OF TOSSED UP ON

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
THAT.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
NOT FEELING WELCOME.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
AND THE RECEPTION THAT I GET IS

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
WONDERFUL, BUT, STILL, IT'S JUST

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
ONE OF THOSE SINS THAT PEOPLE

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
KEEP LOOKING DOWN UPON, SO I

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
STILL JUST FEEL OUT OF PLACE.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I DON'T THINK HARASSMENT WILL

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
EVER GO AWAY FOR ANYONE,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
ESPECIALLY IN SUCH A TOUCHY

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
SUBJECT AS HOMOSEXUALITY.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
THERE IS SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
SO AGAINST IT.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA WHERE WE

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
LIVE AND WHAT WE CALL THE BIBLE

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000
BELT.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
HOMOSEXUALITY IS JUST ALMOST

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
FORBIDDEN, AND IF YOU GO TO MORE

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
LIBERAL STATE, I DON'T THINK

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
THAT HE WOULD GET AS HARASSED.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
I DON'T THINK I WOULD STICK

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.000
AROUND HERE.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I THINK THAT IF I WERE GAY, YOU

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
KNOW, I'D PROBABLY MOVE TO A

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
MORE LIBERAL STATE WHERE I WOULD

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
BE MORE LIKELY TO BE ACCEPTED.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I'D PROBABLY HEAD FOR
