00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400


2
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.930


3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.500
Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays the thing we sue for.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.030
I shall do well.

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.700
The people love me, and the sea is mine.

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.770
My powers are crescent,

7
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.000
and my auguring hope says it will come to the full.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.570
Mark Antony in Egypt sits at dinner

9
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.130
and will make no wars without doors.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.930
Caesar gets money where he loses hearts.

11
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.300
Lepidus flatters both, of both is flattered,

12
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.270
but he neither loves nor either cares for him.

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.700
Caesar and Lepidus are in the field.

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.200
A mighty strength they carry.

15
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.800
Where have you this? 'Tis false.

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.300
From Silvius, sir.

17
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.600
He dreams.

18
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.270
I know they are in Rome together looking for Antony.

19
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.170
But all the charms of love salt Cleopatra,

20
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900
soften thy waned lip.

21
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.570
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both.

22
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.330
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts.

23
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.800
Keep his brain fuming.

24
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.330
Epicurean cooks sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite,

25
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.630
that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honor

26
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.270
even till a lethe'd dullness.

27
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.600
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome expected.

28
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.900
Since he went from Egypt, 'tis a space for further travel.

29
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.830
I did not think this amorous surfeiter

30
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.100
would have donned his helm for such a petty war.

31
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.600
His soldiership is twice the other twain,

32
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
but let us rear the higher our opinion

33
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.030
that our stirring can from the lap of Egypt's widow

34
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.830
pluck the never-lust-wearied Antony.

35
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.900
I cannot hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together.

36
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.600
Were it not that we stand up against them all,

37
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.170
'twere pregnant they should square between themselves,

38
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.500
for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords.

39
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.200
But how the fear of us may cement their division

40
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.200
and bind up the petty difference we yet not know.

41
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.530
Be it as our gods will have it.

42
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.670
It only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands.

43
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.330
Good Enobarbus,

44
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.600
'tis a worthy deed and shall become you well

45
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.630
to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech.

46
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.670
'Tis not a time for private stomaching.

47
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.870
Every time serves for the matter that is then born in it.

48
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.700
But small to greater matters must give way.

49
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.230
Not if the small come first.

50
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.530
Your speech is passion,

51
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.930
but, pray you, stir no embers up.

52
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.830
Here comes the noble Antony.

53
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.730
Noble friends,

54
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.100
that which combined us was most great,

55
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.830
and let not a leaner action rend us.

56
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.570
What's amiss, may it be gently heard.

57
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.400
When we debate our trivial difference loud,

58
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.800
we do commit murder in healing wounds.

59
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.530
Then, noble partners,

60
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.630
the rather, for I earnestly beseech,

61
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.200
touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms

62
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.230
nor curstness grow to the matter.

63
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.400
'Tis spoken well.

64
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.000
Were we before our armies and to fight, I should do thus.

65
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.430
Welcome to Rome.

66
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.130
Thank you.

67
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.230
Sit.

68
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.370
Sit, sir.

69
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.370
Nay, then.

70
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.900
I learn, you take things ill which are not so

71
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.830
or being concern you not.

72
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.800
I must be laughed at, if or for nothing or a little,

73
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.430
I should say myself offended,

74
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.230
and with you chiefly in the world.

75
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.300
My being in Egypt, Caesar, what was it to you?

76
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.670
No more than my residing here at Rome might be to you in Egypt.

77
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.070
Yet if you there did practice on my state,

78
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.530
your being in Egypt might be my question.

79
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.630
How intend you, practiced?

80
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.630
You may be pleased to catch at mine intent

81
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.700
by what did here befall me.

82
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.270
Your wife and brother made wars upon me,

83
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.630
and their contestation was theme for you.

84
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.330
You were the word of war.

85
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.300
You do mistake your business.

86
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.870
My brother never did urge me in his act.

87
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.530
Of this my letters before did satisfy you.

88
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.030
If you'll patch a quarrel,

89
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.730
as matter whole you have not to make it with,

90
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.130
it must not be with this.

91
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.830
As for my wife,

92
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.430
I would you had her spirit in such another.

93
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.600
The third of the world is yours,

94
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.670
which with a snaffle you may pace easy

95
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.370
but not such a wife.

96
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.630
So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar,

97
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.970
made out of her impatience,

98
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.270
which not wanted shrewdness of policy too.

99
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.330
I grieving grant did you too much disquiet.

100
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.830
For that, you must but say, I could not help it.

101
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.970
I wrote to you;

102
00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.030
when rioting in Alexandria you did pocket up my letters

103
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.070
with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience.

104
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.900
Sir, he fell upon me ere admitted then.

105
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.400
Three kings I had newly feasted

106
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.900
and did want of what I was in the morning.

107
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.300
But next day I told him of myself,

108
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.670
which was as much as to have asked him pardon.

109
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.830
Let this fellow be nothing of our strife.

110
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.430
If we contend out of our question, wipe him.

111
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.970
You have broken the article of your oath,

112
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.230
which you shall never have tongue to charge me with.

113
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.230
Soft, Caesar.

114
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.670
No, Lepidus, let him speak.

115
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.100
The honor is sacred which he talks on now,

116
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.530
supposing that I lacked it.

117
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.830
But on, Caesar.

118
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.400
The article of my oath.

119
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.130
To lend me arms and aid when I required them,

120
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.100
the which you both denied.

121
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.830
Neglected, rather,

122
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.430
and then when poisoned hours had bound me up

123
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.070
from mine own knowledge.

124
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.330
As nearly as I may, I'll play the penitent to you.

125
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.670
But mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness

126
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.700
nor my power work without it.

127
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.330
Truth is, that Fulvia,

128
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
to have me out of Egypt, made wars here,

129
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.530
for which myself, the ignorant motive,

130
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.970
do so far ask pardon as befits mine honor

131
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.500
to stoop in such a case.

132
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.630
'Tis noble spoken.

133
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.830
If it might please you,

134
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.930
to enforce no further the griefs between ye,

135
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.330
to forget them quite,

136
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.570
and to remember that the present need

137
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.000
speaks to atone you.

138
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.630
Worthily spoken.

139
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.230
Or if you borrow one another's love for the instant,

140
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.830
you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey,

141
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.230
return it again.

142
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.900
You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

143
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.430
Thou art a soldier only; speak no more.

144
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.900
That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

145
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.970
You wrong this presence, therefore, speak no more.

146
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.430
Go to then your considerate stone.

147
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.700
I do not much dislike the matter

148
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.970
but the manner of his speech.

149
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:55.000
For it cannot be we shall remain in friendship,

150
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.970
our conditions so differing in their acts.

151
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.630
Yet if I knew what hoop should hold us staunch,

152
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.530
from edge to edge of the world I would pursue it.

153
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:09.530
Give me leave, Caesar.

154
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.730
Speak, Agrippa.

155
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.570
Thou hast a sister by the mother's sideó

156
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.100
admired Octavia.

157
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.670
Great Mark Antony is now a widower.

158
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.300
Say not so, Agrippa.

159
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.830
If Cleopatra heard you,

160
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.630
your reproof were well deserved of rashness.

161
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.530
I am not married, Caesar.

162
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.500
Let me hear Agrippa further speak.

163
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.900
To hold you in perpetual amity, to make you brothers,

164
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.170
and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot,

165
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.870
take Antony Octavia to his wife,

166
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.200
whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men,

167
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.500
whose virtue and whose general graces speak that

168
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.130
which none else can utter.

169
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.500
By this marriage,

170
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.630
all little jealousies, which now seem great,

171
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.230
and all great fears, which now import their dangers,

172
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.800
would then be nothing.

173
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.770
Truths would be tales where now half tales be truths.

174
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.800
Her love to both would,

175
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:59.900
each to other and all loves to both, draw after her.

176
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.870
Pardon what I have spoke,

177
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:03.370
for 'tis a studied,

178
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:09.130
not a present thought by duty ruminated.

179
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.430
Will Caesar speak?

180
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.900
Not till he hears how Antony is touched with what is spoke already.

181
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.630
What power is in Agrippa?

182
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.130
If I would say, "Agrippa, be it so," to make this good?

183
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.970
The power of Caesar and his power unto Octavia.

184
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.170
May I never,

185
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.200
to this good purpose that so fairly shows,

186
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.300
dream of impediment!

187
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.470
Let me have your hand further this act of grace

188
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.300
and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves

189
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.330
and sway our great designs.

190
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.430
There is my hand.

191
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.500
A sister I bequeath you,

192
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.170
whom no brother did ever love so dearly.

193
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.370
Let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts

194
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.530
and never fly off our loves again.

195
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:23.000
Happily, amen!

196
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.470
I did not think to draw my sword against Pompey,

197
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.570
for he hath laid strange courtesies

198
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.500
and great of late upon me.

199
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.930
I must thank him only

200
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.000
lest my remembrance suffer ill report.

201
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.770
At heel of that, defy him.

202
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.230
Time calls upon us.

203
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.800
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,

204
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.470
or else he seeks out us.

205
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.970
Where lies he?

206
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.930
About the mount Misenum.

207
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.000
What is his force by land?

208
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.430
Great and increasing,

209
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.670
but by sea, he's an absolute master.

210
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.930
So is the fame.

211
00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.370
Would we had spoke together.

212
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:02.700
Haste we for it.

213
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.530
Yet ere we put ourselves in arms,

214
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.570
dispatch we the business we have talked of.

215
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.770
With most gladness

216
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.530
and do invite you to my sister's view.

217
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.830
Whither straight I'll lead you.

218
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.200
Let us, Lepidus, not lack your company.

219
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.430
Noble Antony, not sickness should detain me.

220
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.830
Welcome from Egypt, sir.

221
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.330
Good Enobarbus!

222
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.300
We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested.

223
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.600
You stayed well by it in Egypt.

224
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.730
Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance

225
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.730
and made the night light with drinking.

226
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.430
Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast

227
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:47.070
and but twelve persons there, is this true?

228
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.470
This was but as a fly by an eagle.

229
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.330
We had much more monstrous matter of feast,

230
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.970
which worthily deserved the noting.

231
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:01.570
She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to her.

232
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:05.530
When she first met Mark Antony,

233
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.970
she pursed up his heart upon the river of Cydnus.

234
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:10.170
There she appeared indeed,

235
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.870
or my reporter devised well for her.

236
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.400
I'll tell you.

237
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:26.430
The barge she sat in, like a burnished throne,

238
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:28.600
burned on the water.

239
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.330
The poop was beaten gold.

240
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.970
Purple the sails and so perfumed

241
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.770
that the winds were love-sick with them.

242
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.530
The oars were silver,

243
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:44.770
which to the tune of flutes kept stroke,

244
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.430
and made the water, which they beat to follow faster,

245
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.370
as amorous of their strokes.

246
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:59.300
For her own person, it beggared all description.

247
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.500
She did lie in her pavilion,

248
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.800
cloth-of-gold of tissue,

249
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.900
over-picturing that Venus

250
00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:11.030
where we see the fancy outwork nature.

251
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.530
On each side her stood pretty dimpled boys,

252
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:17.930
like smiling Cupids with divers-colored fans,

253
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.600
whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks

254
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.500
which they did cool and what they undid did.

255
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.830
O, rare for Antony.

256
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.130
Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,

257
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:36.600
so many mermaids, tended her in the eyes

258
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.630
and made their bends adornings.

259
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.430
At the helm a seeming mermaid steers.

260
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.070
The silken tackle swell with the touches

261
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.430
of those flower-soft hands

262
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.330
that yarely frame the office.

263
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:57.600
From the barge, a strange invisible perfume

264
00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
hits the sense off the adjacent wharfs.

265
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.730
The city cast her people out upon her;

266
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.070
and Antony, enthroned in the marketplace,

267
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.000
did sit alone, whistling to the air,

268
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.300
which, but for vacancy, had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too

269
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.700
and made a gap in nature.

270
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.900
Rare Egyptian!

271
00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.000
Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,

272
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.770
invited her to supper.

273
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:24.430
She replied it should be better he became her guest,

274
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.030
which she entreated.

275
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.100
Our courteous Antony,

276
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.100
whom never the word of "no" woman heard speak,

277
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.330
being barbered ten times over,

278
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.070
goes to the feast,

279
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.970
and for his ordinary,

280
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.930
pays his heart for what his eyes eat only.

281
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.270
Royal wench.

282
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.630
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed.

283
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.130
He plowed her, and she cropped.

284
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.400
I saw her once hop forty paces

285
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.200
through the public street,

286
00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.500
and having lost her breath, she spoke and panted

287
00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.230
that she did make defect perfection.

288
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.600
And, breathless, power breathe forth.

289
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.270
Now Antony must leave her utterly.

290
00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.770
Never; he will not.

291
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.070
Age cannot wither her,

292
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:25.770
nor custom stale her infinite variety.

293
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.170
Other women cloy the appetites they feed,

294
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:33.570
but she makes hungry where most she satisfies,

295
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.430
for vilest things become themselves in her

296
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.030
that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish.

297
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.430
If beauty, wisdom, modesty,

298
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.230
can settle the heart of Antony,

299
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.200
Octavia is a blessed lottery to him.

300
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.600
The world and my great office

301
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.730
will sometimes divide me from your bosom.

302
00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.470
All which time before the gods

303
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.230
my knee shall bow my prayers to them for you.

304
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.400
Good night, sir.

305
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:09.130
My Octavia, read not my blemishes in the world's report.

306
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.230
I have not kept my square,

307
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:17.170
but that to come shall all be done by the rule.

308
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.770
Good night, dear lady.

309
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.100
Good night, sir.

310
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.070
Good night.

311
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.100
Now, sirrah, you do wish yourself in Egypt?

312
00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.170
Would I had never come from thence, nor you thither.

313
00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.630
If you can, your reason?

314
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.370
I see it in my motion, have it not in my tongue,

315
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.200
but yet hie you to Egypt again.

316
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.630
Say to me,

317
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.400
whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?

318
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.500
Caesar's.

319
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.370
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side.

320
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.000
Thy demon that's thy spirit which keeps thee

321
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.130
is noble, courageous, high, unmatchable,

322
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:08.970
where Caesar's is not.

323
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.930
But near him, thy angel becomes a fear as being overpowered.

324
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.370
Therefore, make space enough between you.

325
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.770
Speak this no more.

326
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.770
If thou dost play with him at any game, thou art sure to lose.

327
00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.300
And of that natural luck, he beats thee against the odds.

328
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.100
Thy luster thickens when he shines by.

329
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.370
I say again, thy spirit is all afraid to govern thee near him,

330
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.970
but he away, 'tis noble.

331
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.330
Get thee gone.

332
00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.670
Say to Ventidius I would speak with him.

333
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:44.230
He shall to Parthia.

334
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.570
Be it art or hap, he hath spoken true.

335
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.370
The very dice obey him.

336
00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:00.400
And in our sports, my better cunning faints under his chance.

337
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.530
If we draw lots, he speeds.

338
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.800
His cocks do win the battle still of mine

339
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.470
when it is all to naught,

340
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.770
and his quails ever beat mine, inhooped, at odds.

341
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.530
I will to Egypt.

342
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.530
And though I make this marriage for my peace,

343
00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.770
in the east my pleasure lies.

344
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.970
O, come, Ventidius; you must to Parthia.

345
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.300
Your commission's ready. Follow me and receive it.

346
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.770
Give me some music.

347
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:45.170
Music, moody food of us that trade in love.

348
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.300
Let it alone.

349
00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.630
Let's to billiards. Come, Charmian.

350
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.530
My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

351
00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:59.800
As well a woman with an eunuch played as with a woman.

352
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.070
Come, you'll play with me, sir?

353
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.630
As well as I can, madam.

354
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.030
And when goodwill is showed, though it come too short,

355
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.000
the actor may plead pardon.

356
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.900
I'll none now.

357
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.170
Give me mine angle.

358
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.000
We'll to the river.

359
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.900
There, my music playing far off,

360
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.770
I will betray tawny-finned fishes.

361
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.100
My bended hook shall pierce their slimy jaws.

362
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.370
And as I draw them up,

363
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.900
I'll think them every one an Antony

364
00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.770
and say, "Ah, ha! You're caught."

365
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.000
'Twas merry when you wagered on your angling.

366
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.170
When your diver did hang a salt-fish on his hook,

367
00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.770
which he with fervency drew up.

368
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.070
That timeóO times!

369
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.530
I laughed him out of patience.

370
00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.330
And that night, I laughed him into patience.

371
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.730
And next morn, ere the ninth hour,

372
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.130
I drunk him to his bed,

373
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.130
then put my tires and mantles on him,

374
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.930
whilst I wore his sword Philippan.

375
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.330
O, from Italy.

376
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.530
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears

377
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.670
that long time have been barren.

378
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.800
Madam, madamó

379
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.670
Antony is dead.

380
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.230
If thou say so, villain, I'll kill'st thy mistress.

381
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.300
But well and free, if thou so yield him, there is gold.

382
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.430
And here my bluest veins to kiss,

383
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.430
a hand that kings have lipped and trembled kissing.

384
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.130
First, madam, he is well.

385
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.470
Why, there's more gold.

386
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:33.330
But, sirrah, mark, we use to say the dead are well.

387
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.300
Bring it to that, the gold I give thee will I melt

388
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.000
and pour down thy ill-uttering throat.

389
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.200
Good madam, hear me.

390
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.270
Well, go to, I will.

391
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:42.130
but there's no goodness in thy face.

392
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.100
If Antony be free and healthful,

393
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.670
why so tart a favor to trumpet such good tidings?

394
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:51.430
If not well, thou shouldst come like a fury crowned with snakes,

395
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.670
not like a formal man.

396
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.200
Will it please you hear me?

397
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.700
I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st.

398
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.230
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,

399
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.700
or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,

400
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.000
I'll set thee in a shower of gold

401
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.200
and hail rich pearls upon thee.

402
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.430
Madam, he's well.

403
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:11.270
Well said.

404
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.430
And friends with Caesar.

405
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.900
Thou art an honest man.

406
00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:15.630
Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

407
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.070
Make thee a fortune from me.

408
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.600
But yet, madamó

409
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.030
I do not like "but yet."

410
00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.200
It does allay the good precedence.

411
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.270
Fie upon "but yet."

412
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:30.400
"But yet" is as a jailer to bring forth some monstrous malefactor.

413
00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:33.200
Prithee, friend, pour out the pack of matter to mine ear.

414
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.530
The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar,

415
00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:37.430
in state of health thou say'st,

416
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.500
and thou say'st free.

417
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:40.570
Free, madam, no; I make no such report.

418
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.600
He's bound unto Octavia.

419
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.270
For what good turn?

420
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:48.270
For the best turn in the bed.

421
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.130
I am pale, Charmian.

422
00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.670
Madam, he's married to Octavia.

423
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.530
The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

424
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.670
Good madam, patience.

425
00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.070
What say you?

426
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.170
Hence, horrible villain,

427
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.030
or I'll spurn thine eyes like balls before me.

428
00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:09.170
I'll unhair thy head.

429
00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.770
Thou shalt be whipped with wire, stewed in brine,

430
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.100
smarting in lingering pickle.

431
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.430
Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match.

432
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:23.030
Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee

433
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:25.100
and make thy fortunes proud.

434
00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.970
The blow thou hadst shall make thy peace for moving me to rage.

435
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.530
And I will boot thee with what gift beside thy modesty can beg.

436
00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.130
He's married, madam.

437
00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.070
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.

438
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.170
Nay, then I'll run.

439
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.530
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.

440
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.400
Good madam, keep yourself within yourself. The man is innocent.

441
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.770
Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.

442
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.770
Melt Egypt into Nile,

443
00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:54.730
and kindly creatures turn all to serpents!

444
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.830
Call the slave again.

445
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.700
Though I am mad, I will not bite himócall!

446
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.900
He is afeard to come.

447
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.170
I will not hurt him!

448
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.770
These hands do lack nobility

449
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.870
that they strike a meaner than myself

450
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.900
since I myself have given myself the cause.

451
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.270
Come hither, sir.

452
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.470
Though it be honest, it is never good to bring bad news.

453
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:28.900
Give to a gracious message an host of tongues,

454
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.400
but let ill tidings tell themselves when they be felt.

455
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.500
I have done my duty.

456
00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.030
Is he married?

457
00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:38.970
I cannot hate thee worser than I do if thou again say "yes."

458
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.230
He's married, madam.

459
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.500
The gods confound thee!

460
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.870
Dost thou hold there still?

461
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.030
Should I lie, madam?

462
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.500
O, I would thou didst,

463
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.730
so half my Egypt were submerged

464
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.430
and made a cistern for scaled snakes!

465
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.070
Go, get thee hence.

466
00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.800
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face,

467
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.600
to me, thou wouldst appear most ugly.

468
00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.700
He is married?

469
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:00.970
I crave your highness' pardon.

470
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.430
He is married?

471
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.400
Take no offense that I would not offend you.

472
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.830
To punish me for what you make me do seems much unequal.

473
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.800
He is married to Octavia.

474
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.570
O, that his fault should make a knave of thee

475
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.730
that art not what thou art sure of.

476
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.230
Get thee hence.

477
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.670
The merchandise that thou hast brought from Rome

478
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:21.970
are all too dear for me.

479
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.470
Lie they upon my hand and be undone by 'em.

480
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.700
Good Your Highness, patience.

481
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:48.170
In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.

482
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.730
Many times, madam.

483
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:58.270
I am paid for it now.

484
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:02.770
Lead me from hence. I faint.

485
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.670
O Iras!

486
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.500
Charmian!

487
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.030
'Tis no matter.

488
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:26.330
Go to the fellow, good Alexas.

489
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:30.000
Bid him report the feature of Octaviaó

490
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.100
her years, her inclination.

491
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.800
Let him not leave out the color of her hair.

492
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.500
Bring me word quickly.

493
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.430
Let him forever go.

494
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.370
Let him not.

495
00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:57.230
Charmian, though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,

496
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.270
the other way's a Mars.

497
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.770
Bid you, Alexas, bring me word how tall she is.

498
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.500
Pity me, Charmian,

499
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.370
but do not speak to me.

500
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.330
To you all three,

501
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:25.270
the senators alone of this great world,

502
00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:28.300
chief factors for the gods,

503
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.770
I do not know wherefore my father should revengers want,

504
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.830
having a son and friends,

505
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.370
since Julius Caesar,

506
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.330
who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,

507
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.470
there saw you laboring for him.

508
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.370
What was it that moved pale Cassius to conspire?

509
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.230
And what made the all-honored, honest Roman Brutus,

510
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.930
with the armed rest, courtiers of beauteous freedom,

511
00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.630
to drench the capitol?

512
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.970
But that they would have one man but a man?

513
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.170
And that is it hath made me rig my navy

514
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.100
at whose burden the angered ocean foams,

515
00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.970
with which I meant to scourge the ingratitude

516
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.530
that despiteful Rome cast on my noble father.

517
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.100
Take your time.

518
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.430
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails.

519
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:14.970
We'll speak with thee at sea.

520
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.600
At land, thou know'st how much we do overcount thee.

521
00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.900
At land, indeed,

522
00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:21.900
thou dost overcount me of my father's house.

523
00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.200
But since the cuckoo builds not for himself,

524
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.500
remain in it as thou mayst.

525
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.300
Be pleased to tell usó

526
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.970
for this is from the presentó

527
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.870
how you take the offers we have sent you.

528
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:31.870
There's the point.

529
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.670
Which do not be entreated to,

530
00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.930
but weigh what it is worth embraced.

531
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.470
And what may follow, to try a larger fortune.

532
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.100
You have made me offer of Sicily, Sardinia,

533
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.030
and I must rid all the sea of pirates,

534
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.930
then to send measures of wheat to Rome.

535
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.730
This agreed upon to part with unhacked edges

536
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:54.930
and bear back our targes undinted.

537
00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:56.930
That's our offer.

538
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.530
Know, then, I came before you here

539
00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:05.930
a man prepared to take this offer,

540
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.100
but Mark Antony put me to some impatience.

541
00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.200
Though I lose the praise of it by telling, you must know,

542
00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.000
when Caesar and your brother were at blows,

543
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.100
your mother came to Sicily and did find her welcome friendly.

544
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.130
I have heard it, Pompey,

545
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.770
and am well studied for a liberal thanks,

546
00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.900
which I do owe you.

547
00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.500
Let me have your hand.

548
00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.000
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

549
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.430
The beds in the east are soft,

550
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.870
and thanks to you that called me timelier than my purpose hither,

551
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.900
for I have gained by it.

552
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.530
Since I saw you last, there is a change upon you.

553
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.830
Well, I know not what counts

554
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.500
harsh fortune casts upon my face,

555
00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.270
but in my bosom shall she never come

556
00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:50.700
to make my heart her vassal.

557
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.230
Well met here.

558
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.070
I hope so, Lepidus.

559
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:56.470
Thus we are agreed.

560
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.400
I crave our composition may be written and sealed between us.

561
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.230
That's the next to do.

562
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.100
We'll feast each other ere we part.

563
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.600
And let's draw lots who shall begin.

564
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.630
That will I, Pompey.

565
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:07.030
No, Antony, take the lot.

566
00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.130
But, first or last,

567
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.770
your fine Egyptian cookery shall have the fame.

568
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:16.030
I have heard Julius Caesar grew fat with feasting there.

569
00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.370
You have heard much.

570
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:18.670
I have fair meanings, sir.

571
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.370
And fair words to them.

572
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.330
Then so much have I heard.

573
00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:24.470
And I have heard, Apollodorus carriedó

574
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.130
No more of that: he did so.

575
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.470
What, I pray you?

576
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.800
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

577
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:36.770
I know thee now; how farest thou, soldier?

578
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.300
Well, and well am like to do,

579
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.600
for I perceive four feasts are toward.

580
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.730
Let me shake thy hand.

581
00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:45.970
I've never hated thee.

582
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.130
I have seen thee fight, when I have envied thy behavior.

583
00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:52.030
Sir, I never loved you much, but I have praised you

584
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:55.570
when you have well deserved ten times as much as I have said you did.

585
00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.070
Enjoy thy plainness.

586
00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:58.800
It nothing ill becomes thee.

587
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.330
Will you lead, lords?

588
00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:11.470
You and I have known, sir.

589
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.730
At sea, I think.

590
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:14.800
We have, sir.

591
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.330
You have done well by water.

592
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.030
And you by land.

593
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.770
I will praise any man that will praise me,

594
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.630
though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.

595
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.070
Nor what I have done by water.

596
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:30.170
Yes, something you can deny for your own safety.

597
00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.670
You have been a great thief by sea.

598
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.130
And you by land.

599
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:35.630
There I deny my land service.

600
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.000
But give me your hand, Menas.

601
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.270
If our eyes had authority,

602
00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:49.930
here they might take two thieves kissing.

603
00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:54.070
All men's faces are true whatsome'er their hands are.

604
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.870
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

605
00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:02.100
No slander; they steal hearts.

606
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.770
We came hither to fight with you.

607
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.300
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.

608
00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:11.130
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

609
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:15.930
If he do, sure, he cannot weep it back again.

610
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.000
You've said, sir.

611
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.500
We looked not for Mark Antony here.

612
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.270
Pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

613
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.900
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

614
00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.670
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

615
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.970
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

616
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.070
Pray ye, sir?

617
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.730
'Tis true.

618
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:40.300
Then is Caesar and he forever knit together.

619
00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.570
If I were bound to divine of this unity,

620
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:45.870
I would not prophesy so.

621
00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:48.670
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage

622
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.030
than the love of the parties.

623
00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:51.470
I think so too.

624
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.830
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together

625
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.600
will be the very strangler of their amity.

626
00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:03.700
Octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.

627
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.970
Who would not have his wife so?

628
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:10.270
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.

629
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.870
He will to his Egyptian dish again.

630
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.070
Then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar.

631
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.970
And as I said before,

632
00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:22.330
that which is the strength of their amity

633
00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:27.200
shall prove the immediate author of their variance.

634
00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.500
Antony will use his affection where it is.

635
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.170
He married but his occasion here.

636
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.530
And thus it may be.

637
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.130
Thus do they, sir.

638
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.700
They take the flow of the Nile

639
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.800
by certain scales in the pyramid.

640
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.870
They know by the height, the lowness, or the mean

641
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.830
if dearth or foison follow.

642
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.770
The higher Nilus swells, the more it promises.

643
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:58.470
As it ebbs, the seedsman, upon the slime and ooze,

644
00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:02.470
scatters his grain and shortly comes to harvest.

645
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.970
You have strange serpents there.

646
00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:06.130
Ay, Lepidus.

647
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:10.700
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud

648
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.730
by the operation of your sun.

649
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:17.170
So is your crocodile.

650
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:18.730
A health to Lepidus!

651
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:25.500
I am not so well as I should be,

652
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.630
but I'll ne'er out.

653
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.730
Not till you have slept;

654
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.270
I fear me you'll be in till then.

655
00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:35.930
Nay, certainly, I have heard

656
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:41.100
the Ptolemies' pyramises are very goodly things.

657
00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:45.730
Without contradiction, I have heard that.

658
00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:46.930
Pompey, a word.

659
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.370
Say in mine ear; what is it?

660
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.670
Forsake thy seat, I do beseech thee, Captain, and hear me speak a word.

661
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:51.770
Forbear me till anon.

662
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.400
This wine for Lepidus!

663
00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.200
What manner of thing is your crocodile?

664
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:06.430
It is shaped, sir, like itself.

665
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.230
And it is as broad as it hath breadth.

666
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.630
It is just so high as it is

667
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.170
and moves with its own organs.

668
00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.330
It lives by that which nourisheth it,

669
00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:23.400
and the elements, once out of it,

670
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.670
it transmigrates.

671
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:31.000
What color is it of?

672
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.470
Of its own color too.

673
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.630
'Tis a strange serpent.

674
00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:41.470
'Tis so, and the tears of it are wet.

675
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:43.200
Will this description satisfy him?

676
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.900
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a very epicure.

677
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.570
Go hang, sir, hang!

678
00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:50.700
Tell me of that? Away!

679
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.000
Do as I bid you.

680
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.770
Where's this cup I called for?

681
00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.500
If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me,

682
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.670
rise from thy stool.

683
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:58.100
I think thou art mad.

684
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.070
These quicksands, Lepidus, keep off them, for you sink.

685
00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.970
The matter?

686
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:08.070
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

687
00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.630
Thou hast served me with much faith.

688
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:10.630
What else to say?

689
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.230
Be jolly, lords.

690
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.200
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

691
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.470
What sayest thou?

692
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.200
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world that's twice?

693
00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.400
How should that be?

694
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.430
But entertain it, and though thou think me poor,

695
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:23.800
I am the man will give thee all the world.

696
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.600
Hast thou drunk well?

697
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.470
Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.

698
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:29.370
Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove.

699
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.030
Whatever the ocean pales or sky inclips is thine if thou wilt have it.

700
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.000
Show me which way.

701
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.130
These three world-sharers, these competitors are in thy vessel.

702
00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.500
Let me cut the cable and, when we are put off,

703
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.570
fall to their throatsó all there is thine.

704
00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:46.500
Ah, this thou shouldst have done

705
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.000
and not have spoke on it!

706
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.700
In me, 'tis villainy; in thee, it had been good service.

707
00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.300
Thou must know 'tis not my profit that doth lead mine honor.

708
00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.730
Mine honor, it.

709
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.500
Repent that e'er thy tongue hath so betrayed thine act.

710
00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.370
Being done unknown,

711
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.570
I should afterwards have found it well done

712
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.630
but must condemn it now.

713
00:35:07.470 --> 00:35:10.900
Desist and drink.

714
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.470
For this, I'll never follow thy palled fortunes more.

715
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:16.530
Who seeks and will not take when once 'tis offered

716
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.270
shall never find it more.

717
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.170
This health for Lepidus!

718
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.470
Bear him ashore.

719
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.800
I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

720
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.570
Here's to thee, Menas!

721
00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.670
Enobarbus, welcome!

722
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.070
Fill till the cup be hid.

723
00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.800
There's a strong fellow, Menas.

724
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.000
Why?

725
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.200
A' bears the third part of the world in arms, man;

726
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.330
see'st not?

727
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.830
The third part then is drunk.

728
00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.230
Would it were all that it might go on wheels.

729
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.100
Drink thou; increase the reels.

730
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:50.130
Come.

731
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.700
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

732
00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.130
It ripens towards it.

733
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:55.870
Strike the vessels, ho?

734
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.070
Here's to Caesar!

735
00:35:58.070 --> 00:35:59.330
I could well forbear it.

736
00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:01.230
It's monstrous labor when I wash my brain

737
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.870
and it grows fouler.

738
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.930
Be a child of the time.

739
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.830
Possess it, I'll make answer.

740
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.230
But I'd rather fast from all four days

741
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.430
than drink so much in one.

742
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:14.900
Ha, my brave emperor!

743
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.270
Shall we dance now the Egyptian bacchanals

744
00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:19.770
and celebrate our drink?

745
00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.670
Let's have it, good soldier.

746
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.200
Come, let's all take hands

747
00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.100
till that the conquering wine hath steeped our sense

748
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.030
in soft and delicate Lethe.

749
00:36:28.030 --> 00:36:29.270
All take hands.

750
00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:34.830
Make battery to our ears with the loud music.

751
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.970
What would you more?

752
00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.530
Pompey, good night.

753
00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:03.500
Good brother, let me request you off.

754
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.900
Our graver business frowns at this levity.

755
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.600
Gentle lords, let's part.

756
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.800
You see we have burnt our cheeks.

757
00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.930
Strong Enobarb is weaker than the wine.

758
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.170
And mine own tongue splits what it speaks.

759
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.330
The wild disguise hath almost anticked us all.

760
00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:25.430
What needs more words?

761
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:26.900
Good night.

762
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.570
Good Antony, your hand.

763
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.070
I'll try you on the shore.

764
00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.730
And shall, sir; give us your hand.

765
00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:45.630
O Antony, you have my father's house.

766
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.870
But, what? We are friends.

767
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:53.270
Come, down into the boats.

768
00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.630
Take heed you fall not.

769
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.730
Menas!

770
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:11.030
Menas!

771
00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.970
I'll not on shore.

772
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.600
No, to my cabin.

773
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.400
These drums, these trumpets, flutes!

774
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.430
What!

775
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:25.070
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell

776
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.570
to these great fellows.

777
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.930
