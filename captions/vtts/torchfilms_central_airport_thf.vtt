1
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.720
&lt;i&gt;My first day in Berlin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;left such an impression on me.&lt;/i&gt;

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.840
&lt;i&gt;I still remember the Christmas lights&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and the street decorations.&lt;/i&gt;

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.520
&lt;i&gt;These first few hours after I arrived&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;were full of joy.&lt;/i&gt;

4
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.560
&lt;i&gt;I never want to forget that day.&lt;/i&gt;

5
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.960
&lt;i&gt;- Central Airport -&lt;/i&gt;

6
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.720
If we look closely
at the history of this airport,

7
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.960
its creation
actually dates back to 1923.

8
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.600
It was planned
as Berlin's first central airport,

9
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.760
replacing the smaller ones
on the city's outskirts.

10
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.080
But even before its completion,
this airport was too small.

11
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.480
In its first year of service, 1924,

12
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.320
it welcomed 1,700 passengers
throughout the whole year.

13
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.840
Just ten years later
there were 81,000 passengers.

14
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.080
Adolf Hitler proposed a plan

15
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.800
to make it "the world's biggest
and most beautiful airport".

16
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.320
He also saw the construction
of the new airport terminal

17
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.360
as part of the rearmament programme.

18
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.240
The other side of the building
is actually below the ground.

19
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.040
That's where
the air raid shelters used to be.

20
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.040
They were used during World War II
when the city was bombed.

21
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.680
Of course they're out of use today.

22
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.040
And that's how the airport,

23
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.920
after firstly being occupied
by the Soviets,

24
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.080
was then taken over
by the Americans in July 1945.

25
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.320
And they installed their airbase

26
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.680
and continued
with the extension of the airport.

27
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640
The first important task
was the Berlin Airlift

28
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.600
in the divided city in 1948 and 1949.

29
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.040
Could you please repeat that?

30
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.280
No, first he has to go

31
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.000
to the State Office for Refugees.

32
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.920
Located at ICC Messe/Nord.

33
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.320
Exactly. And once
he's been registered in his shelter

34
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.680
he can request
a certificate of residence.

35
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.560
<v ->June -</v>

36
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.120
&lt;i&gt;My name is&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Ibrahim Al Hussein.&lt;/i&gt;

37
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.440
&lt;i&gt;I was born in Syria.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I am 18 years old.&lt;/i&gt;

38
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.080
&lt;i&gt;My room used to be on the second floor.&lt;/i&gt;

39
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.240
&lt;i&gt;I used to wake up every day&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to Fairuz's songs&lt;/i&gt;

40
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.120
&lt;i&gt;and the smell of fresh coffee&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;made by my mum every morning.&lt;/i&gt;

41
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.000
&lt;i&gt;I miss everything there&lt;/i&gt;

42
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.680
&lt;i&gt;and always try to remember everything.&lt;/i&gt;

43
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.720
&lt;i&gt;My room now,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the way I left it the last time I saw it.&lt;/i&gt;

44
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.440
&lt;i&gt;My village was located&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the suburbs of Manbej city,&lt;/i&gt;

45
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.760
&lt;i&gt;very close to the border of Turkey,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in the far north of Syria.&lt;/i&gt;

46
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.560
&lt;i&gt;My village was like any other village.&lt;/i&gt;

47
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.680
&lt;i&gt;Its inhabitants were mostly farmers&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and some tradesmen.&lt;/i&gt;

48
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.080
&lt;i&gt;The town had 3,000 inhabitants&lt;/i&gt;

49
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.240
&lt;i&gt;and everybody knew each other.&lt;/i&gt;

50
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.040
&lt;i&gt;Peace be upon you!&lt;/i&gt;

51
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.000
&lt;i&gt;For those&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;who haven't been vaccinated yet,&lt;/i&gt;

52
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.160
&lt;i&gt;they can do so at our clinic today.&lt;/i&gt;

53
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:31.680
&lt;i&gt;The medical teams&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;will be there after 2 p.m.&lt;/i&gt;

54
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.800
&lt;i&gt;We are also offering flu vaccinations.&lt;/i&gt;

55
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.400
&lt;i&gt;The vaccinations&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;will take place after 2 p.m.&lt;/i&gt;

56
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.400
&lt;i&gt;in Hangar 7 near the entrance.&lt;/i&gt;

57
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.000
&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;

58
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.640
&lt;i&gt;- Announcement in Russian -&lt;/i&gt;

59
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.840
Who was that?
<v ->It's an Afghan family.</v>

60
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.800
The father is in Frankfurt
and the mother arrived here yesterday.

61
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.840
Just yesterday?
<v ->Yes, with her two kids.</v>

62
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.920
They seem to have some money.

63
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.840
And he keeps calling because
he wants to reunite his family.

64
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.120
But she's in Berlin now.
And he wants her in Frankfurt.

65
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.000
No can do.

66
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.400
Are we going?

67
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.400
&lt;i&gt;The last news I heard about my village&lt;/i&gt;

68
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.240
&lt;i&gt;is that it had become a shelter&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for displaced people&lt;/i&gt;

69
00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.400
&lt;i&gt;because of the war.&lt;/i&gt;

70
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.760
Is the situation any better?

71
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.200
No, I was just worried.

72
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.080
Every time I called it just wouldn't
connect and the line seemed busy.

73
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.720
I'm following the news, of course.

74
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.680
It might also have
an impact on my status.

75
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.640
&lt;i&gt;- Federal Republic of Germany -&lt;/i&gt;

76
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:47.920
&lt;i&gt;Summers in Syria are generally very hot.&lt;/i&gt;

77
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:53.320
&lt;i&gt;Usually the temperatures range&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from between 30 to 40 degrees.&lt;/i&gt;

78
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.480
&lt;i&gt;My last summer in Syria&lt;/i&gt;

79
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.040
&lt;i&gt;was very different&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to all the summers before.&lt;/i&gt;

80
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.200
&lt;i&gt;We weren't even able&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to visit the Euphrates River&lt;/i&gt;

81
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.480
&lt;i&gt;because all the roads&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;had been sealed off.&lt;/i&gt;

82
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.840
&lt;i&gt;Because of all the problems over there.&lt;/i&gt;

83
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.960
&lt;i&gt;I actually spent&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;my whole last summer at home.&lt;/i&gt;

84
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.280
<v ->July -</v>

85
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.920
&lt;i&gt;- Translator -&lt;/i&gt;

86
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.920
Did she already have chickenpox or not?

87
00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.400
Do you remember?
<v ->I don't know.</v>

88
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.360
Yes, I think so.

89
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.920
With red pimples?
<v ->No.</v>

90
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.640
I need your hangar card.

91
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.880
No, I need the one for Samira.

92
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.440
This one says "Samir".
<v ->It's hers.</v>

93
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.160
But here it says "Samir".
<v ->It's a mistake.</v>

94
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.640
Yes, they make mistakes sometimes.

95
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.200
So she gets a vaccination.
<v ->Yes.</v>

96
00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.480
Come back in a month
to get a vaccination.

97
00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.920
My other concern is
that we still don't have doors.

98
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.240
We can't install doors and you know why.
It's in case there's a fire.

99
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.920
That's why.

100
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.760
And the curtains are all fireproof.

101
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.600
Do you understand?

102
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.920
They call it Brandschutz in German.
Brandschutz means "to protect from fire".

103
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.400
And in case of fire, God forbid,
you can get out easily.

104
00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.920
You understand this, right?
<v ->Yes. But it's annoying.</v>

105
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.920
Yes. How many people are in the room?

106
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.240
There are five of us.

107
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.640
And you annoy each other when you study?
<v ->After a while, yes.</v>

108
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.000
The room is neither
specially for them nor for me.

109
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.160
Sometimes people
don't understand each other's needs.

110
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.760
That's right.

111
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.720
I departed from Spandau...
"Away... from."

112
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.920
... and arrived in Tempelhof.

113
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.920
And it was cold.

114
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.440
What do you need to do first?

115
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.840
Here you have an axe.

116
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.000
And with the axe you cut down a tree.

117
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.920
And then you have...
<v ->Wood.</v>

118
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.960
Then you have to cut it
into small pieces.

119
00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.240
So that you can make a fire.

120
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.480
For your wife
who can then prepare dinner.

121
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.880
But we don't do that anymore.
<v ->Not anymore?</v>

122
00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.480
So what do men do nowadays?

123
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.120
Today the man...

124
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.160
... doesn't have to...

125
00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.760
... to "cute" a tree.
<v ->"Cut" a tree.</v>

126
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.360
Because today we have...

127
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.240
electricity and even gas.

128
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.280
We have...
<v ->OK.</v>

129
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.160
We don't need it.

130
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.520
Can I light it up?
<v ->No, shame on you.</v>

131
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.920
I'm your guest tonight.
<v ->No way, he's not our guest.</v>

132
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.800
But it's my first time.

133
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:06.560
No dude,
you're the shisha bitch tonight.

134
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.440
You're firing the coal for us.
Blow it up!

135
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.840
I'll put mint in the shisha head.
It'll taste perfect.

136
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.040
Yes, please do.

137
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.320
Take this.
<v ->Put it in my mouth?</v>

138
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.800
Want some gum too?
<v ->No, thanks.</v>

139
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.520
But it tastes good.
No, really. Thanks.

140
00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.800
But it's mint! It's mint!

141
00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.400
It will be even more fun.

142
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.560
Enjoy!

143
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.240
Will we have to move out this month?
<v ->Well, a friend of mine said no.</v>

144
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.600
Who?
<v ->She said we'll all leave Hangar 6 and 7</v>

145
00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.280
and move somewhere else.

146
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.600
So where will we move?

147
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.720
Sorry?
<v ->Where?</v>

148
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.360
The company Tamaja
has two more shelters ready for us.

149
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.880
I swear to God that this time
we're moving to a sports hall!

150
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.720
A sports hall!

151
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:30.880
Guys, where do you find a view like that?
<v ->Yeah, it's grand.</v>

152
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.240
Really, the best view ever.

153
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.920
Tempelhof?
<v ->Man, I wish we had a car</v>

154
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.200
and could drive around Tempelhof park.

155
00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:42.720
Even if they pay me 400 euros,
I won't leave Tempelhof.

156
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.960
Their shitty food is still better
than cooking yourself.

157
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.160
<v ->August -</v>

158
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.760
&lt;i&gt;I was living on a big farm in Syria.&lt;/i&gt;

159
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.600
&lt;i&gt;On our farm&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;we had more than 1,000 trees:&lt;/i&gt;

160
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:24.520
&lt;i&gt;apple trees,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;olive trees, pistachio trees,&lt;/i&gt;

161
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.880
&lt;i&gt;plum trees, pomegranate trees, fig trees&lt;/i&gt;

162
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.120
&lt;i&gt;and walnut trees.&lt;/i&gt;

163
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.840
&lt;i&gt;Our farm wasn't surrounded&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;by any other houses.&lt;/i&gt;

164
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:42.120
&lt;i&gt;Our closest neighbour&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;was about one kilometer away.&lt;/i&gt;

165
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.080
&lt;i&gt;I loved the isolation.&lt;/i&gt;

166
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.160
&lt;i&gt;I miss the country life a lot.&lt;/i&gt;

167
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.640
How did they get over the fence?
<v ->They climbed over it.</v>

168
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.160
Security guards!

169
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.320
Pick that up.
<v ->Pick it up. Save it!</v>

170
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.800
That showered over my head.
Thank you very much.

171
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:26.040
Do you know these guys?
<v ->No.</v>

172
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.320
Holy shit!

173
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.000
That was nice.
<v ->Where did you go?</v>

174
00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.480
What?
There's nothing sinister about it.

175
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.400
If they'd caught us
and asked what we were doing:

176
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.000
"I'm still high on drugs.

177
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.920
And weed and things."

178
00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.120
You were supposed to down that, mate.

179
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.120
See ya guys.
Take care!

180
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.520
Will we be famous one day?
Will we be famous?

181
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.560
Play the other song.
<v ->No.</v>

182
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.600
Come on! Let me do it.
<v ->What do you want?</v>

183
00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
And that's why I put it
on our priority list for today.

184
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.720
I think we should contribute
to the new cleaning policy.

185
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:11.640
Before you start something new,
make sure everything's in order.

186
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.280
&lt;i&gt;My village was divided by a river,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;between south and north.&lt;/i&gt;

187
00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.880
&lt;i&gt;I lived in the south.&lt;/i&gt;

188
00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.440
&lt;i&gt;My memories of home&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;are vanishing more and more.&lt;/i&gt;

189
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.480
&lt;i&gt;I only remember them&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;when I call my friends&lt;/i&gt;

190
00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.560
&lt;i&gt;or see my family pictures on the phone.&lt;/i&gt;

191
00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.120
<v ->September -</v>

192
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:59.720
It's getting cold again.

193
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.680
Good evening!
<v ->Good evening.</v>

194
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.440
You're about to leave?
<v ->Yes!</v>

195
00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.600
We just wanted to take a short cut
and were wondering why it's still open.

196
00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.360
At least you wondered...
<v ->Is it still open?</v>

197
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.000
No, it's closed from 7 p.m.

198
00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.040
Generally?
<v ->It closes once it gets dark.</v>

199
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.080
That's easy to remember.
<v ->Yes.</v>

200
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:25.000
Have a nice evening!
<v ->You just need...</v>

201
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:27.120
Pardon?
<v ->We have to take a right?</v>

202
00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:31.560
No, the door is already closed.
Just continue till Tempelhofer Damm.

203
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.680
OK.
<v ->Ciao.</v>

204
00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.280
Have a good one!

205
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.240
They were really understanding.

206
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.040
Look! A fox!

207
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.600
When everybody is gone,
the foxes come out.

208
00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.560
Looking for food.
<v ->Now he's sitting down.</v>

209
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.280
Wait, I'll chase him...
<v ->I'll be back soon.</v>

210
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.400
Another one.
<v ->There are plenty.</v>

211
00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.440
Last year they counted 84.

212
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.280
I got accepted at a school in Spandau.

213
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.200
In Spandau?
<v ->There's good infrastructure.</v>

214
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.320
Yes, Spandau is massive.
<v ->I wish I could move there.</v>

215
00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.600
Today they told me I had to move.
<v ->You got rejected?</v>

216
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.560
Where is it?
<v ->I don't know.</v>

217
00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.920
They told me there were daily meals,
so I asked why I had to leave Tempelhof.

218
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.680
I would just be moving
from one shithole to another.

219
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.120
But they told me they already
printed it out and prepared everything.

220
00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.880
So I said, "I'm not moving out."
<v ->They can't force you.</v>

221
00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.960
I'm not gonna sign anything.

222
00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.480
I said I'd prefer
to stay at the airport.

223
00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.120
In the end they'll tell us
it wasn't built to live in.

224
00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.680
We have no choice.

225
00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.560
We've been in this crisis situation
for a year and a half. We're used to it.

226
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.600
I don't think
it's a crisis situation.

227
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.160
But we're used to this place now.

228
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.760
&lt;i&gt;There's a day&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that will stick in my mind forever.&lt;/i&gt;

229
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:28.920
&lt;i&gt;Because I'd never experienced&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;danger like that before.&lt;/i&gt;

230
00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.880
&lt;i&gt;The hours I spent at sea&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;were so terrifying.&lt;/i&gt;

231
00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.920
&lt;i&gt;I recall arriving in complete darkness&lt;/i&gt;

232
00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.280
&lt;i&gt;on a Greek island at 5 in the morning.&lt;/i&gt;

233
00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.080
&lt;i&gt;I'll always remember&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;when the sun finally rose.&lt;/i&gt;

234
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.480
&lt;i&gt;We were feeling unbelievably happy.&lt;/i&gt;

235
00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.960
&lt;i&gt;Finally, the hardest part&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;of our journey was over.&lt;/i&gt;

236
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.120
<v ->October -</v>

237
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.400
You should enrol her at a school.

238
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.360
And you should hurry up
and get a place there.

239
00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.120
Where is it located?
<v ->I'll check for you.</v>

240
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.200
Choose one close by.
<v ->We don't have a bus ticket.</v>

241
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.160
Why don't you have a bus ticket?
<v ->I don't want to buy one. It's 30 euros.</v>

242
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:41.920
But the school
can't give you a bus ticket.

243
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.960
How much is it?

244
00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.440
It costs 36 euros.
<v ->Yes. 36 euros.</v>

245
00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.120
Would you prefer to work on the story?

246
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.200
What should I do?
<v ->Build sentences and write them down.</v>

247
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.320
If you know how to do that.

248
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.280
You simply have to

249
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.160
tell me what you're seeing here.

250
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.000
There are children.

251
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.440
Yes, how many children?
<v ->Three.</v>

252
00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.960
Boys or girls?
<v ->Boys.</v>

253
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.960
Three boys. What are they doing?
<v ->Three boys are playing.</v>

254
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.080
Could you write that down?

255
00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.720
If you look at the clothes down here...

256
00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.480
... you have to connect the syllables.

257
00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.720
The Trou-...
<v ->The Trousers.</v>

258
00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.360
Connect them with a line.

259
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.600
Just connect them:
Trou-sers. A line.

260
00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.200
What are the children doing?

261
00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.840
They're playing.

262
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.600
Playing...
<v ->Write down "playing".</v>

263
00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.440
And what is this called?
<v ->A duck.</v>

264
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.880
And this one?
<v ->Son.</v>

265
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:28.680
Son?
This is her son?

266
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.240
Yes, her son. And this one?
<v ->The daughter of the duck.</v>

267
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.280
And where do they come from?

268
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.760
They are from...

269
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.400
Where are mother
and daughter duck from?

270
00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.520
From her heart?
<v ->From where?</v>

271
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.320
Her heart!
<v ->No, I mean from which place?</v>

272
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.320
From which city?

273
00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.360
Where are you from?
From which city?

274
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.760
From...

275
00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.800
From Syria.

276
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:06.320
From...
<v ->You're from Aleppo, right?</v>

277
00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:07.760
I can't remember.

278
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.720
You were young.
<v ->Yes.</v>

279
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.120
I can only remember
my grandmother in the summer.

280
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.440
Are you playing with your friends here?
<v ->I don't have any friends.</v>

281
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.760
No?
<v ->I had one, but he left.</v>

282
00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:27.920
Where did he go?
<v ->He went to a hotel.</v>

283
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.480
He went to a hotel.

284
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.160
And you stayed here in the shelter?
<v ->Yes.</v>

285
00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.480
He didn't go to a hotel.
He went to the Job Center.

286
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.160
What camp?
<v ->The Job Center?</v>

287
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.600
We're talking about Hussein!

288
00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.040
And now we're looking for a proper home.

289
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.440
I hope you find something.

290
00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.720
And when you came to Tempelhof,

291
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.160
how did you end up in the hangar?

292
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.000
In the hangar?
<v ->Yes, how did you get there?</v>

293
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.800
They sent us back.
<v ->They sent you back?</v>

294
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.720
They brought us here first,
to the hangar.

295
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.160
Who brought you here?

296
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.520
The sheriff?
<v ->The sheriff?</v>

297
00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.800
The police.

298
00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.360
Move up the bed a bit.

299
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.400
Now lie down.

300
00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.160
Does he have diarrhoea
or anything like that?

301
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.440
But he only eats what I cook for him.

302
00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:20.440
Even if I buy ready-made food,
he won't eat it.

303
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.440
How long have you been here?

304
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.440
For four months.

305
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.960
&lt;i&gt;I sometimes wish&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I could go back to my school days,&lt;/i&gt;

306
00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.120
&lt;i&gt;because honestly,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;they were the best days of my life.&lt;/i&gt;

307
00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.640
&lt;i&gt;How can I forget&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the days I spent at school?&lt;/i&gt;

308
00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.280
&lt;i&gt;Because they were&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the biggest part of my life.&lt;/i&gt;

309
00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:05.120
&lt;i&gt;The school I went to&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;for more than ten years.&lt;/i&gt;

310
00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:10.640
&lt;i&gt;And my friends at school&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;who became like brothers to me.&lt;/i&gt;

311
00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.440
&lt;i&gt;But now, life has changed.&lt;/i&gt;

312
00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.600
&lt;i&gt;It's not like that anymore.&lt;/i&gt;

313
00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:25.840
&lt;i&gt;Some of us, like myself,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;fled from the region.&lt;/i&gt;

314
00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.000
&lt;i&gt;Some of us stayed there.&lt;/i&gt;

315
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.600
&lt;i&gt;And some of us died&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;because of the war.&lt;/i&gt;

316
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:40.720
<v ->November -</v>

317
00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.800
&lt;i&gt;We are coming back, oh love&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;we are coming back&lt;/i&gt;

318
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.920
&lt;i&gt;Oh flower of the poor unfortunate ones&lt;/i&gt;

319
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.640
&lt;i&gt;We're back, oh love, to the fire of love&lt;/i&gt;

320
00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:33.880
&lt;i&gt;We bid farewell to time&lt;/i&gt;

321
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.120
&lt;i&gt;We bid farewell to time&lt;/i&gt;

322
00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.000
&lt;i&gt;It makes us forget&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the land of forgetting&lt;/i&gt;

323
00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:47.880
&lt;i&gt;We say we're going&lt;/i&gt;

324
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.040
&lt;i&gt;To be coming back to the home of love&lt;/i&gt;

325
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.360
&lt;i&gt;Without knowing&lt;/i&gt;

326
00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.200
<v ->December -</v>

327
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:25.760
Afternoon! You have to keep your dog
on a leash on the runways.

328
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.400
I was about to go to the dog zone.

329
00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.920
Please keep it on its leash
on the way there.

330
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.640
Good. Thank you.

331
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.320
&lt;i&gt;The holidays in Syria are as important&lt;/i&gt;

332
00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:57.920
&lt;i&gt;as Sundays are important in Germany.&lt;/i&gt;

333
00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.720
&lt;i&gt;I would usually sleep&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;until at least noon.&lt;/i&gt;

334
00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.240
&lt;i&gt;And then I would spend&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the whole day with my family.&lt;/i&gt;

335
00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.800
&lt;i&gt;Sometimes I would go&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to one of my friend's places.&lt;/i&gt;

336
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.280
&lt;i&gt;Or they would come&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to visit me at my place.&lt;/i&gt;

337
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:17.960
&lt;i&gt;Then we'd spend&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the whole night having fun.&lt;/i&gt;

338
00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.440
Enjoy the evening.

339
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:41.280
Merry Christmas!
<v ->Same to you.</v>

340
00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.000
And how old are you?

341
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:48.160
22.
<v ->I see.</v>

342
00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:55.920
The Afghani guy over there
just got his status!

343
00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.480
Which one?
<v ->Don't know.</v>

344
00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.040
Are you visiting relatives
for New Year's Eve?

345
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:08.200
Yes, my uncle for 10 days.

346
00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.360
I see, for 10 days.
<v ->10 Tage.</v>

347
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.600
10 Tage.

348
00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.440
When they said party,
I thought it would be a big one.

349
00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:46.200
With dancing and everything.

350
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.560
But this is really nothing.

351
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.400
It's for the kids, not us.

352
00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.080
Let me see it. Let me see it.

353
00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:05.320
Look, it's the toes.
<v ->Yes, let me look at it.</v>

354
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.680
Here?

355
00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:17.520
If this heals, my soul will heal.
<v ->Yes.</v>

356
00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.600
Germans don't know how to lie.

357
01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.120
These two things stick in my mind.

358
01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.320
If they owe you a cent
they'll go to the bank

359
01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:10.440
and bring it to you.

360
01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.240
And they don't lie.
They just don't know how to lie.

361
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.320
Honestly! I swear to God.

362
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.000
What else do you want?
I couldn't be more thankful.

363
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.920
I feel like I'm
on a different planet here. In heaven.

364
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.200
It's like retiring and finding
everything in front of you.

365
01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.520
Abu Khalil, come to Hangar 5,
near the aeroplane.

366
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.400
The fireworks are about to start there.

367
01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:49.440
Bring the others and hurry up.

368
01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.360
This is our "Chef" Knut.
This is the boss.

369
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.760
This is our second year in Tempelhof!

370
01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:15.400
<v ->January -</v>

371
01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.880
&lt;i&gt;Everyone was happy.&lt;/i&gt;

372
01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.840
&lt;i&gt;Lights and noise everywhere.&lt;/i&gt;

373
01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:04.560
&lt;i&gt;The fireworks brought back&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;memories of war.&lt;/i&gt;

374
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.640
&lt;i&gt;The fireworks and war&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;almost sound identical.&lt;/i&gt;

375
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:13.240
&lt;i&gt;And it reminded me how the violence&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;had taken away our lives in Syria.&lt;/i&gt;

376
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.480
&lt;i&gt;Dear ladies.&lt;/i&gt;

377
01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.440
&lt;i&gt;Today we're meeting&lt;/i&gt;

378
01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:44.520
&lt;i&gt;at 3 p.m. in Hangar VII.&lt;/i&gt;

379
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.760
&lt;i&gt;You can have your hair cut&lt;/i&gt;

380
01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.760
&lt;i&gt;at our salon.&lt;/i&gt;

381
01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.480
&lt;i&gt;We can take care of your kids&lt;/i&gt;

382
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.440
&lt;i&gt;or they can join you for supper.&lt;/i&gt;

383
01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.160
&lt;i&gt;We're also offering a shuttle&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to bring you to Hangar 3 for this.&lt;/i&gt;

384
01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.440
&lt;i&gt;Thank you.&lt;/i&gt;

385
01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:11.880
I have to push this button
and keep it pressed down?

386
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.640
&lt;i&gt;Today is my birthday&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;and I'm officially 19 years old.&lt;/i&gt;

387
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.240
&lt;i&gt;My birthday is on 4 January.&lt;/i&gt;

388
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.520
&lt;i&gt;This is my second birthday in Germany.&lt;/i&gt;

389
01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.440
&lt;i&gt;It was a normal birthday,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;without a party.&lt;/i&gt;

390
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.920
&lt;i&gt;Because firstly, I'm far away&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;from my family and my home.&lt;/i&gt;

391
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:15.760
&lt;i&gt;And secondly, because no one here knows&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;when my birthday is.&lt;/i&gt;

392
01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:18.240
&lt;i&gt;Except my close friends.&lt;/i&gt;

393
01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.040
<v ->February -</v>

394
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:41.440
Look. You're getting an upgrade
to refugee status.

395
01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.920
That's very good news.
Yes, that's great.

396
01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:47.080
The Federal Office
for Migration and Refugees

397
01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.640
granted you refugee status
instead of "protection".

398
01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.240
You've got refugee status
for three and a half years.

399
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.280
It's better than "protection".
<v ->By the way, this is the first letter</v>

400
01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.240
I've ever got from the Federal Office.

401
01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.560
I didn't get any mail from them before.
<v ->No letters?</v>

402
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.160
No, so shall I wait
for another letter or...

403
01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:10.080
No, the office doesn't
deal with you besides this.

404
01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.640
But the Foreigners' Office does?
<v ->Yes.</v>

405
01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:14.800
And they'll give me an appointment?

406
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.160
Yes, because now you're protected.

407
01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.840
Did they send you the papers
for your integration classes and school?

408
01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.240
Yes, I think so.
But a long time ago.

409
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:28.680
Hello, Abu Hassan.
Where is my mom?

410
01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.240
Please let me talk to her.

411
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.800
No, I need my mom.
I'm only going to tell her.

412
01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:56.120
Dude, come on.
Give me my mom.

413
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.440
I'm fine.
How are you?

414
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:12.800
Siham, please shut up
so I can talk.

415
01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.000
OK, so listen:
I just got the status, thank God!

416
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.520
Refugee status
for three and a half years.

417
01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.400
It's refugee status, not "protection"!

418
01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.800
And this is...

419
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.720
I mean...

420
01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.600
This is the best status I can get.
It's not like "protection" status.

421
01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.240
With "protection" status
I could get sent back to Syria.

422
01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.600
But refugee status allows me to stay
for three and a half years.

423
01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:55.280
Three and a half years.
Yes. I'll start all the procedures

424
01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:58.480
to get the German ID and passport.

425
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.400
I've waited for so long,

426
01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.520
but I got it!
This is the best status I can get really.

427
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.520
What's up?

428
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.760
Hello, Jihad.
<v ->Hello.</v>

429
01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.520
What's up?
<v ->Hello, my dear. Sit.</v>

430
01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.600
Then make some space.
<v ->Just give me a minute.</v>

431
01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.200
Yes, Mom.

432
01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.800
Yes.

433
01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.560
OK.

434
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.800
Yes, I just told her a minute ago.

435
01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.920
Yes, I told her.

436
01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.600
Alright. I need to go.
Let's talk later.

437
01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.440
Alright. Bye.

438
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.280
Who was that?

439
01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.680
My family.
<v ->How many minutes do you have left?</v>

440
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.040
Can I smoke?
<v ->Of course.</v>

441
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.840
Then let's smoke.
<v ->You're sitting on my packet.</v>

442
01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.560
No, I have mine.

443
01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:19.480
Are you smoking Marlboro?
No, it's Pueblo.

444
01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.480
Is it under the pillow?
<v ->No.</v>

445
01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:25.920
It's fine. I brought mine.
Here, take it.

446
01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.880
Today I went to
my fingerprint appointment.

447
01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.960
They postponed it again.
<v ->Again?</v>

448
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:43.640
But that's not a problem.
<v ->Why is it not a problem?</v>

449
01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:47.480
They gave me a small document.
A temporary permit.

450
01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.640
And is it "protection" or refugee status?
<v ->"Protection".</v>

451
01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.560
I just got refugee status
for three and a half years!

452
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.760
Where's the cake?
<v ->Later.</v>

453
01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.600
I want it right now.
<v ->I don't have it yet.</v>

454
01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.680
I want the cake right now.
Here in front of the camera.

455
01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.880
Come on.
<v ->Do you want a kiss or something?</v>

456
01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.720
Some German music?
<v ->No, Arabic.</v>

457
01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.320
Here we go.

458
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.960
&lt;i&gt;I remember how shortly&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;after my arrival in Tempelhof,&lt;/i&gt;

459
01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:34.960
&lt;i&gt;I was told a story about some people&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;who were shocked when they arrived.&lt;/i&gt;

460
01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.920
&lt;i&gt;They truly believed they would&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;be deported to Turkey or Syria.&lt;/i&gt;

461
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.240
&lt;i&gt;When they saw the old planes parked&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;outside for the first time.&lt;/i&gt;

462
01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:50.080
&lt;i&gt;I think this is the funniest thing&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;that happened to us&lt;/i&gt;

463
01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.320
&lt;i&gt;at Tempelhof Airport.&lt;/i&gt;

464
01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.360
<v ->March -</v>

465
01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:54.000
And is it an old or a new building?

466
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.720
Is it just for students?

467
01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.240
Yes, there are just students.

468
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.560
So tomorrow
I'll have to leave Tempelhof.

469
01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.880
We've no problem with that, huh? Great!

470
01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.960
So tomorrow is my last day.

471
01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.640
This means your costs aren't covered?
<v ->Yes.</v>

472
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.840
Since yesterday.

473
01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.440
Super!

474
01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.440
So how long have you been here now?

475
01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:28.160
At the airport?

476
01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:31.480
For one year and three months.

477
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.520
For one year and three months!

478
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.840
I mean if you think about...
<v ->Since 4 January 2016.</v>

479
01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.320
Crazy!
And the idea was that

480
01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.280
you would live here
for six weeks at most.

481
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.320
That's the idea of an emergency shelter.
<v ->I don't believe that.</v>

482
01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.640
I don't believe that.

483
01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.520
A friend of mine was
at the LAGeSo office yesterday

484
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:58.400
and they said his costs would be covered
for another six months.

485
01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:02.640
You mean they extended the cover?
<v ->Yes, for another six months.</v>

486
01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:08.720
Yes, but the idea of the airport was...
<v ->I know, I know...</v>

487
01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:13.320
It's the idea.
But they need more time.

488
01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.200
Yes, they need a lot of time.

489
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.280
You'll enrol on an integration course?
<v ->Yes.</v>

490
01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.440
It takes a long time, no?
600 hours?

491
01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.840
Yes, it's 600.
And B1 level language class.

492
01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:34.320
And after that?

493
01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.360
I'll do a training course afterwards.

494
01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.160
And improve my German to B2 level.

495
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.040
I'd like to train as a car mechanic.

496
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.760
And how about yourself?
<v ->What?</v>

497
01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.640
If you stay in Germany.

498
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.320
Do you know why
I wanted to come to Germany?

499
01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:58.520
I dreamed of becoming a doctor.

500
01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.520
I worked at a hospital in Iraq
and couldn't finish...

501
01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.280
But this dream...

502
01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:08.440
You know...
<v ->It's complicated.</v>

503
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.600
Some refugees are going to Canada now.

504
01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.320
&lt;i&gt;My first day at the airport&lt;/i&gt;

505
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.600
&lt;i&gt;was on 4 January 2016.&lt;/i&gt;

506
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.720
&lt;i&gt;I remember how we arrived&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;at Tempelhof on a bus.&lt;/i&gt;

507
01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:50.200
&lt;i&gt;It was only then that I actually realised&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;it used to be an airport.&lt;/i&gt;

508
01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:53.800
&lt;i&gt;I was shocked because I knew&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I would live there.&lt;/i&gt;

509
01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:58.120
&lt;i&gt;Tomorrow will be my first day&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;living outside of the airport.&lt;/i&gt;

510
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.600
<v ->April -</v>

511
01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:31.200
130 to 90.
<v ->Got it. 130 to 90.</v>

512
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.880
Doctor. And church.

513
01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.560
PTS.
<v ->Posttraumatic Syndrome.</v>

514
01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:02.040
PTS. He's on medication.

515
01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:07.360
His pulse is 120 beats per minute.
<v ->120.</v>

516
01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:18.840
Temperature.

517
01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.960
36 degrees.

518
01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.320
Scratching?

519
01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.680
Allergy.
<v ->Allergy.</v>

520
01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.800
Yes... 2 months...

521
01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.160
Coming back?
<v ->Yes.</v>

522
01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.920
&lt;i&gt;Peace be upon you!&lt;/i&gt;

523
01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:37.080
&lt;i&gt;For those&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;who haven't been vaccinated yet,&lt;/i&gt;

524
01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.360
&lt;i&gt;you can get vaccinated at our clinic.&lt;/i&gt;

525
01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:50.960
&lt;i&gt;The medical teams&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;will be here after 2 p.m.&lt;/i&gt;

526
01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.360
&lt;i&gt;We are also offering flu vaccinations.&lt;/i&gt;

527
01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.760
Ahmed?

528
01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:18.520
Did you get vaccinated
in the last four weeks?

529
01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.120
No.
<v ->Good.</v>

530
01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.640
Are you allergic to eggs?
<v ->No.</v>

531
01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:29.200
Did you ever have problems
after a vaccination?

532
01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.040
Do you accept the vaccination?
<v ->I accept.</v>

533
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:44.760
Here you are.

534
01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.320
Suzanne.
Hurry up!

535
01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:00.200
And what about you?
Still no interview yet?

536
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:05.000
You should have an answer by now.

537
01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.800
Today, tomorrow
or the day after tomorrow.

538
01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:09.200
God willing.
<v ->Yes.</v>

539
01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:18.680
Or maybe next month.

540
01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.320
Tomorrow maybe!

541
01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:28.520
And most importantly: a positive answer!
And not: "Goodbye!"

542
01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.200
<v ->May -</v>

543
01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.440
&lt;i&gt;- Bee Garden -&lt;/i&gt;

544
01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:33.920
&lt;i&gt;The worst day of my whole life&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;happened in Syria.&lt;/i&gt;

545
01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.000
&lt;i&gt;It was the day before I left.&lt;/i&gt;

546
01:31:41.240 --> 01:31:46.240
&lt;i&gt;When I didn't know&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;if I would ever return.&lt;/i&gt;

547
01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.120
&lt;i&gt;Or if I'd ever be able&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;to see my family again.&lt;/i&gt;

548
01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.360
&lt;i&gt;I remember the way&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;my dear mother looked at me,&lt;/i&gt;

549
01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:59.200
&lt;i&gt;always with tears in her eyes.&lt;/i&gt;

550
01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:02.920
&lt;i&gt;I tried to comfort her and joke,&lt;/i&gt;

551
01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:08.520
&lt;i&gt;but deep inside&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I could feel an incredible sadness.&lt;/i&gt;

552
01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.240
&lt;i&gt;It was a terrible day,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;my last day in Syria.&lt;/i&gt;

553
01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:21.480
&lt;i&gt;But sometimes I think&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I might see my family again.&lt;/i&gt;
