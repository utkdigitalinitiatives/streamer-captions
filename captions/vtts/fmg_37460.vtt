00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
THE YEARS FROM THE MID
60'S TO THE EARLY 80'S

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
MARKED A TUMULTUOUS TIME
- AN ERA OF REVOLUTION

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
AND ENCROACHING CYNICISM,
A TRANSITION FROM

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
EARNEST IDEALISM TO
TRENCHANT NARCISSISM.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
IN LATIN AMERICA,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
THIS PERIOD ALSO
BROUGHT WITH IT

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
SOCIAL CHANGE AND
CULTURAL STRESS,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
AND THE LITERATURE
OF THE PERIOD

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
REFLECTED THESE
DYNAMIC TENSIONS.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
DEFINING THE LITERATURE
FROM THIS TIMEFRAME

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
EMBODIES ALL THE
DIFFICULTIES OF

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
DEFINING ANY ERA AS
THERE ARE SO MANY FACTORS

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
COMPETING FOR
ATTENTION:

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
EVOLVING AESTHETICS AND NEW
THEORETICAL APPROACHES;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
POLITICAL
POLEMICS AND THE

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
CHANGING ROLE OF THE
WRITER AS AN INTELLECTUAL;

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
EVEN PERSONAL GRUDGES
COME INTO PLAY.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
AND PROMINENT
AMONG THESE FACTORS

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
IS THE EXPLODING ROLE
OF THE MASS MEDIA

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
- AND IN PARTICULAR
TELEVISION -

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
IN THE EBB AND FLOW
OF CULTURAL EXPRESSION.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
THIS WAS A TIME WHEN
THE WORLD WAS BECOMING

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
MORE INTERCONNECTED.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
EVENTS ACROSS THE
CONTINENT AND THE WORLD

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
WERE HAVING A PROFOUND
EFFECT ON THE MOOD

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
AND DIRECTION OF
LATIN AMERICA;

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
EVENTS SUCH AS THE MAY
'68 STRIKES IN FRANCE

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
THAT NEARLY BROUGHT THE
GOVERNMENT TO ITS KNEES;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
THE RIOTS IN MEXICO
LEADING UP TO

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
THE TLATELOLCO MASSACRE,
WITH AT LEAST 300 DEAD;

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
THE SPREAD OF ARMED
AND GUERRILLA WARFARE

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
THROUGHOUT
LATIN AMERICA;

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
AND THE
CONTINUING ECHOES

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
OF THE CUBAN
REVOLUTION OF 1959.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
AS DIVISIVE AND
CONTROVERSIAL AS THESE

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
EPISODES WERE, THE
ARTISTIC RESPONSE TO

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
SIMMERING REVOLUTION
WAS JUST AS INTENSE.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
NEVER WAS THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN LITERATURE

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
AND POLITICS SO
CLOSELY INTERWOVEN,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
OR SO CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
THE REVOLUTION WAS LIVE,
AND IT WAS TELEVISED.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:50.000
*

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:02.000
*

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
LITERARY CRITICS GENERALLY
IDENTIFY AS A DISTINCT

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
LITERARY PERIOD THE TIME
FROM THE 1960'S UP UNTIL

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
THE FALL OF SALVADOR
ALLENDE'S GOVERNMENT

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
IN CHILE IN 1973, OR TO
THE RAPID PROLIFERATION OF

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS
IN AROUND 1976.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
THE ENORMOUS IMPACT OF
THESE POLITICAL FACTS

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
IN DEFINING
LITERARY PERIODS

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
HIGHLIGHTS THE COVALENT
BOND BETWEEN POLITICS

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
AND LATIN AMERICAN
POETRY AND PROSE.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
WHICH IS NOT TO SAY
THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
WAS SOMETHING NEW.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
ON THE CONTRARY, THIS
LINK CHARACTERIZES

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
MUCH OF THE
CONTINENT'S LITERATURE

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
IN THE CENTURIES AFTER
THE SPANISH CONQUEST.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
HOWEVER, DURING THIS
TIME THE CONVERGENCE OF

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
POLITICS,
INTELLECTUAL TRENDS,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
AND AESTHETICS
COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURED

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
THE INSTITUTIONS
OF LITERATURE.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
HOW WORKS WERE PRODUCED,
READ, AND INTERPRETED

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
WAS FOREVER AND
IRREVOCABLY CHANGED.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
THERE WAS A STRONG SENSE
THAT REVOLUTION IS

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
IMMINENT, AND OF THE
INEVITABILITY OF

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
SIGNIFICANT SOCIAL
TRANSFORMATION.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
THIS WAS TO BE A
TRANSFORMATION IN WHICH

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
INTELLECTUALS WERE CALLED
UPON - OBLIGATED, IN FACT

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
- TO PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE,
BECOMING INVOLVED IN EVERY

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
STRATA OF SOCIETY,
FROM THE AESTHETIC

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
TO THE POLITICAL, WITH
ALL STOPS IN BETWEEN.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
THE LATE 60'S AND EARLY
70'S SET THE STAGE

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
FOR THIS CULTURAL
MAKEOVER.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
THE LATIN
AMERICAN BOOM -

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
A LITERARY PHENOMENON
THAT WAS EQUAL PARTS

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
INNOVATIVE WRITING AND
AGGRESSIVE MARKETING -

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
HAD USHERED IN THE ERA
OF THE SUPERSTAR AUTHOR:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
WRITERS LIKE
JORGE LUIS BORGES,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
GABRIEL GARCIA
MARQUEZ,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
AND CARLOS FUENTES
BECAME HOUSEHOLD NAMES.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
YET AS THEY THRIVED, OTHER
EQUALLY TALENTED WRITERS

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
TOILED IN ANONYMITY.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
AS A RESULT, A CHASM
APPEARED BETWEEN THOSE

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
WHO ACHIEVED FAME,
INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURE,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
AND SUCCESS - AND
THOSE WHO DID NOT.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
THIS DYNAMIC GENERATED
AESTHETIC AND POLITICAL

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
DISPUTES AS WELL AS
INTENSE PERSONAL FEUDS.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
DURING THE BOOM IN LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
THE NOVEL
REIGNED SUPREME,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
DEMONSTRATING ITS ALMOST
LIMITLESS CAPACITY

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
FOR EXPERIMENTATION,
TRANSFORMATION,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
AND THE REINVENTION
OF CULTURAL TRADITIONS.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
HOWEVER, AS THE 1960'S
GAVE WAY TO THE 70'S,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
THE CONTRADICTIONS
BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
AND THE TONE OF LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
BECAME MORE URGENT.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
BY 1970, THE RACE
WAS ON TO DEVELOP NEW

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
LITERARY FORMATS AND
GENRES THAT GAVE VOICE TO

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THE PREVAILING SENSE
OF SOCIAL CRISIS.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
WRITERS TOOK UP
THEIR PENS TO WRITE

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
PERSONAL TESTIMONIALS,
POLITICAL POETRY,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
AND SONGS OF PROTEST.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
AT THAT TIME, THERE
IS A GENRE STRUGGLE.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
THERE IS AN INITIAL
GAMBLE ON THE NOVEL

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
AS A POLITICAL GENRE,
OR ONE LIABLE TO BECOME

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
POLITICIZED, TO BE
INVESTED WITH POLITICS.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
ONCE THE INTELLECTUAL
FRONT IS FRACTURED

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
AND THE MARKETPLACE IS
SEEN AS ANTIPOLITICAL,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
ATTENTION TURNS TO POETRY,
WHICH HAS INITIALLY BEEN

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
DISCARDED AS TOO
LYRICAL, TOO PERSONAL,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
TOO INDIVIDUALISTIC, BUT
POETRY SUDDENLY EMERGES

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
IN CONNECTION WITH THE
ADVENT OF THE PROTEST SONG.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
SUDDENLY, LITERATURE WAS
NOT JUST A LUXURY OF THE

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
INTELLIGENTSIA - IT WAS
A CULTURAL NECESSITY,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
A COMMUNAL
SEARCH FOR TRUTH

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
IN MORALLY
AMBIGUOUS TIMES.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
WRITERS SUCH AS THE
URUGUAYAN EDUARDO GALEANO

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
AND ARGENTINEAN RODOLFO
WALSH ANNOUNCED THAT THE

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
NOVEL - THE SUPERSTAR OF
THE BOOM - WAS IN CRISIS.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
THE REASON?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
ITS SEEMING
RELUCTANCE,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
IN THE HANDS OF
LATIN AMERICAN AUTHORS,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
TO CONFRONT THE
REALITY OF SOCIAL CHANGE.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
THE TIME WAS RIGHT
TO CREATE NEW FORMS

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
SUCH AS THE TESTIMONIAL
AND TO REINTERPRET

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
INDIGENOUS FORMS
SUCH AS THE CRONICA.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
AND, TRADITIONAL GENRES
SUCH AS THE SHORT STORY,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
THE NOVEL, AND IN
PARTICULAR POETRY WERE

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
REFOCUSED TO ECHO THE
CONCERNS AND CONTROVERSIES

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
OF THE 60'S,
70'S, AND 80'S.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
HOWEVER, AS THE
70'S PROGRESSED,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
THE POLITICAL CLIMATE
BECAME INCREASINGLY DARK.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
COUPS D'ETAT
WERE COMMONPLACE,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
AS WERE
HAM-FISTED DICTATORS

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
AND RAMPANT POLITICAL
PERSECUTION.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
LITERATURE WAS TORN
ASUNDER BY EXILE,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
DISAPPEARANCE,
SILENCE, AND DEATH.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
LITERARY EXPRESSION
BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
SHIFTING TOWARDS SUGGESTION,
METAPHOR, AND IMPLICATION.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
SIMPLE DECLARATIVE
SENTENCES BECAME

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS,
AND EXCEEDINGLY RARE.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
IN LATIN AMERICA,
THE CRONICA IS A

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
WELL-ESTABLISHED GENRE
WHOSE ORIGINS CAN BE

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
TRACED BACK TO THE
CRONISTAS OF THE INDIES.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
THE TURN-OF-THE-CENTURY
MOVEMENT KNOWN AS

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
MODERNISMO HAD GIVEN RISE
TO A NEW KIND OF CRONICA -

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
A UNIQUE GENRE OF SHORT
PROSE THAT COULD BE EITHER

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
FICTION OR HISTORY
AND WHICH RETAINS

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
ITS POPULARITY TO THIS
DAY IN LATIN AMERICA.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
THIS UNUSUAL HYBRID OF
LITERATURE AND JOURNALISM

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
TYPICALLY NARRATES THE
EVENTS OF CONTEMPORARY

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
CITY LIFE AND ATTEMPTS
TO CAPTURE THE ESSENCE

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
OF A PARTICULAR
MOMENT IN TIME.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
THIS DYNAMIC TENSION
BETWEEN TWO DISTINCT

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
GENRES IS IDEALLY SUITED
TO INVESTIGATING SOCIAL

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
CHANGE, EXPLOSIVE URBAN
GROWTH, AND INTENSE

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
DEBATES ABOUT THE ROLE
OF THE INTELLECTUAL.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
AND, THE CRONICA IS
NOT ONLY A FORUM FOR

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS,
BUT ALSO A NARRATIVE FORM

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE
SUBJECTIVITY OF THE AUTHOR.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
THE URBAN CRONICA
PRESENTS THE POSSIBILITY

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
OF TELLING A
STORY IN A NEW WAY,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
BY RECOUNTING
EVENTS AS THEY OCCUR

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
WITH JOURNALISTIC AND
HISTORICAL OBJECTIVITY.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
THIS STANCE BECOMES
PROBLEMATIC, HOWEVER,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
WHEN THE TOPIC IS
POPULAR CULTURE -

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
THE MINUSCULE DISTANCE
BETWEEN SUBJECTIVITY

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
AND OBJECTIVITY
PROMOTES CONTAMINATION

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
BETWEEN THE CRONISTA
AND HIS SUBJECT MATTER.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
THE MEXICAN WRITER AND
ESSAYIST CARLOS MONSIVAIS

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
WAS ONE OF THE MAJOR
CRONISTAS OF THE CONTINENT

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
AND AN INTELLECTUAL FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
FOR THE LAST
THIRTY YEARS.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
IN HIS WORKS HE RECREATES
THE CHAOS OF THE

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
URBAN EXPERIENCE BY
INTERWEAVING WORDS

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
AND PHOTOGRAPHS INTO
A NARRATIVE COLLAGE.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
IN PERHAPS ONE OF HIS
MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
DAYS TO REMEMBER,
HE INVESTIGATES

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
THE TLATELOLCO
MASSACRE OF 1968.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
THE YEAR 1968 IN GENERAL,
AND OCTOBER 2 IN PARTICULAR,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
MARK A TURNING POINT IN
THE HISTORY OF MEXICO

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
BECAUSE IT DESTROYED
MIDDLE CLASS CONFIDENCE

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
IN NEVER-ENDING
PROGRESS.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
BECAUSE IT LAID BARE THE
CRIMINAL ASPECTS OF A

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
REGIME THAT, IN THE END,
ENDURED FOR 71 YEARS.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
BECAUSE IT GAVE A
GENERATION THE CHANCE

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
TO CONFRONT ITS
MORAL STANDARDS

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
AND IT GAVE
THAT GENERATION

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO EMBRACE ETHICS,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
WHICH PREVIOUSLY
HAD BEEN UNKNOWN.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
BECAUSE IT CAUSED THE
MEMBERS OF THAT GENERATION

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
WHO WADED INTO THE
FRAY TO FEEL GUILTY,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
WHICH WAS A FEELING THEY
HADN'T FELT BEFORE.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
AND BECAUSE IT SHOWED
THE POWER OF MEMORY.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
IT IS THE ONLY EVENT
LIKE IT THAT I KNOW OF

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
IN THE HISTORY
OF MEXICO.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
IN A VERY PROFOUND WAY -
WITH DISDAIN, CONDEMNATION,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
AND EXTRAORDINARY CRITICISM
OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE -

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THAT RELIES ENTIRELY
ON THE LABOR OF MEMORY

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
THROUGH BOOKS, ARTICLES,
DISCUSSIONS, DEMONSTRATIONS.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
IT IS A TRIUMPH
OF MEMORY,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
AND THAT DOES MARK
A TURNING POINT.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
THIS EVENT WAS THE CLIMAX
OF POLITICAL UNREST

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
LEADING UP TO THE
MEXICO CITY OLYMPICS,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
IN WHICH BETWEEN 200 AND
300 PROTESTERS WERE KILLED.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
THE BOOK RECOUNTS
THE CLASHES BETWEEN

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
THE POLICE, THE
MILITARY, AND STUDENTS

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
IN VARIOUS PARTS
OF THE CITY.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
SHE LEADS THE FUNERAL.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
THIN FACE, HARDENED
THROUGH THE LONG

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
FAMILIARITY WITH
BLIND CIRCUMSTANCES,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
WITH THE SUFFOCATING
SHADOWS OF POVERTY,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
A FACE WHOSE
FIRMNESS IS TOLD BY

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
ITS UTTER LACK
OF IMPATIENCE,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
A FACE SHAPED
BY MOURNING,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
EVEN BEFORE
ANYBODY HAD DIED.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
HER CONCENTRATED
EXPRESSION IS THE SUMMARY

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
OF CENTURIES THAT TRUSTED
IN A BRIGHT FUTURE,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
AN INSTRUMENT OF
RETRIBUTION AND REPAIR

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
THAT NOBODY HAS
YET TO UNDERSTAND.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
THE CITY DEPICTED IN
MONSIVAIS' CRONICAS

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
IS THE PEOPLE'S CITY,
HOME TO THE OUTCAST,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
THE SHADY CHARACTER,
THE BIT PLAYER -

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
A PLACE WHERE THE ICONS
OF THE CULTURAL FACTORIES

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
SEEM TO OFFER A
SYMBOL OF NATIONHOOD,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
OF "MEXICANNESS".

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
ANOTHER IMPORTANT
BOOK IN THIS VEIN IS

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
THE NIGHT OF TLATELOLCO,
PUBLISHED IN 1971,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
BY THE MEXICAN WRITER
AND JOURNALIST

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
ELENA PONIATOWSKA.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
IN IT SHE RELATES HER
INTERVIEWS WITH THOSE

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
WHO WERE THERE AS
THE TRAGEDY UNFOLDED,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
AND WITH THE FAMILIES
OF THOSE WHO DIED.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
HER WORK IS A KIND
OF PROSE TAPESTRY,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
A COLLECTIVE
TESTIMONY

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
COMPRISED OF
MANIFOLD VOICES.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
HER TECHNIQUE ENTICES THE
READER TO INSERT MEANING

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
INTO THE SPACES BETWEEN
THE TESTIMONIALS.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
THE READER CREATES
THE COLLAGE;

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
PONIATOWSKA ARTFULLY
ASSEMBLES THE TILES.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
THERE ARE THE VOICES
OF THE STUDENTS,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
THE PROFESSORS,
THE PARENTS:

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
THEY RECOUNT THEIR
OWN PARTICIPATION

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
IN THE MARCHES AND
THEY PASS JUDGMENT

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
- BOTH POSITIVE
AND NEGATIVE -

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
ON THE MOVEMENT.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
IT IS A BOOK WHICH BANKS
ON THE POWER OF THE

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
WRITTEN WORD TO PRESERVE
AND DISSEMINATE

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
A MANY-SIDED
MEMORY OF AN EVENT

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
THAT OTHERWISE WOULD
HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARED

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
FROM THE COLLECTIVE
SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
PEOPLE CAME TO SEE ME TO
TELL ME THINGS THAT I

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
COULDN'T BELIEVE WERE
HAPPENING IN MY COUNTRY.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I WAS VERY EMBARRASSED
AND HORRIFIED BY THEM.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I HAD TO VERIFY THEM.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
BUT I DIDN'T GO ON MY OWN
INITIATIVE, TO TLATELOLCO.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
I WENT THERE BECAUSE
I DIDN'T THINK

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
WHAT I HEARD
WAS BELIEVABLE.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I WAS TOLD THERE WAS BLOOD
SMEARED ON THE WALLS,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
THAT THERE WERE
THOUSANDS OF SHOES LEFT

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
IN THE STONE CORRIDORS FROM
PEOPLE WHO HAD RUN AWAY,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
THAT THERE WERE
WOMEN'S SHOES,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
THAT I SHOULD
GO AND SEE THEM,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
THAT THERE WERE MACHINE
GUN BULLET HOLES

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
IN ALL THE ELEVATORS
AROUND TLATELOLCO SQUARE

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
IN THE HOUSING COMPLEX,
SO OF COURSE I WENT.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
"SINCE THEN I CANNOT
SEE A HELICOPTER

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
WITHOUT MY
HANDS SHAKING.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
MANY MONTHS AFTER I'D SEEN
IT - AND THAT, FROM MY CAR

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
- THE HELICOPTER SHOOTING
ON THE MULTITUDE,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I COULD NOT WRITE BECAUSE
OF MY SHAKING HANDS".

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
- MARTA ZAMORA
VERTIZ, SECRETARY.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
"IT WAS A MASS OF PEOPLE
RUNNING HERE AND THERE

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
AND FALLING AND GOING
AWAY AND FALLING AGAIN.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I THOUGHT THAT THE
LOGICAL THING TO DO

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
WAS TO GO WHERE THERE
WAS NO SHOOTING.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
NOW I KNOW THAT THEY WERE
ALSO SHOOTING AT THEM

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
FROM THAT SIDE".

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
- MARGARITA NOLASCO,
ANTHROPOLOGIST.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
THE NIGHT OF TLATELOLCO
IS CLOSELY RELATED

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
TO ANOTHER IMPORTANT
GENRE OF THIS PERIOD -

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
THE NON-FICTION
TESTIMONIAL.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
ONE OF THE PRIMARY
EXPONENTS OF THIS FORM

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
WAS THE ARGENTINEAN
RODOLFO WALSH,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
WHO WAS ASSASSINATED IN
1977 BY A QUASI-MILITARY

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
GROUP WITH TIES TO THE
ARGENTINEAN DICTATORSHIP.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
WALSH WAS THE AUTHOR OF
INCISIVE TEXTS SUCH AS

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
THE SATANOWSKY CASE,
 WHO KILLED ROSENDO?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AND OPERATION MASSACRE.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
IN HIS WORKS, WALSH
PROPOSED AN ENTIRELY

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
FRESH APPROACH
TO LITERATURE.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
THIS NEW TEXTUALITY
WAS TO BE OPEN, POROUS,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
AND PURPOSELY AT ODDS WITH
TRADITIONAL JOURNALISM

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
AND HISTORY WRITING.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
HIS WORKS WERE OFTEN
DELIBERATELY UNFINISHED,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
LEAVING THEMSELVES OPEN
TO NEW TESTIMONIALS,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000
ARGUMENTS, AND CORRECTIONS
TO THE CENTRAL THESIS.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
ANOTHER POTENT FEATURE
IN THESE NOVELS

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
IS FRAGMENTATION.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000
THIS TOO IS DUE TO
THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
THAT REPRESENTATION
CANNOT BE TOTAL,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
THAT REPRESENTATION
INVOLVES CLIPPING

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:56.000
AND IS THEREFORE
PARTIAL AND FRACTURED.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
THE USE OF ELLIPSIS
FOLLOWS THIS SAME LOGIC.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THERE IS ALSO A RUPTURE
OF THE IDEA OF GENRE.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
THERE ARE TRANSFERS
BETWEEN GENRES,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
FOR INSTANCE IN
THE CASE OF WALSH,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
WHO ESTABLISHES A VERY
INTERESTING CROSSROADS

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
BETWEEN LITERATURE
AND JOURNALISM.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
THE CASE OF WALSH IS NOT
MERELY THAT OF SOMEONE

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
WHO WRITES LITERATURE
AND DEFENDS THE GENRE OF

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
TESTIMONY, AND NOT JUST
SPURRED ON BY THE MOMENT,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
BUT OF SOMEONE WHO
PUBLISHES A UNION

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
NEWSPAPER AND
ACTIVELY INTERVENES

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
AS AN INTELLECTUAL
THROUGH LETTERS

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
IN THE ACTIVITIES OF
THE MILITARY JUNTA.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
OPERATION MASSACRE WAS
PRESENTED IN VARIOUS

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
EDITIONS THAT MODIFIED
AND, OVER TIME,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
RADICALIZED THE PIECE.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
THE FIRST EDITION
OF THE WORK

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
HAD A HIGHLY
EMOTIONAL AFFECT;

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
LATER EDITIONS BECAME
INCREASINGLY IRONIC.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
WITHIN THIS
COMPLEX DYNAMIC,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
THE BODY OF TESTIMONIALS
LAYS ITS BETS

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
ON THE EXISTENCE OF SOME
KIND OF ABSOLUTE TRUTH,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
A PLACE WHERE
RELATIVISM IS BANISHED.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
DON HORACIO IS SO CONFUSED
THAT HE DOES NOT TRY

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
TO CLOSE THE BAG.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
HE RUNS, TURNS THE
KEY IN THE LOCK,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
AND BEFORE HE FINISHES
REMOVING THE CHAIN,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
THE DOOR IS SHATTERED
VIOLENTLY FROM OUTSIDE,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
THE LOCK COLLAPSES AND
HE IS CARRIED ALONG

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
BY THE BUSTLE
OF POLICEMEN

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
AND CIVILIANS WITH
LONG AND SHORT GUNS.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
EVERYTHING HAPPENS
WITH THE SPEED

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
OF A LIGHTNING BOLT.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
THE TALL, STOUT MAN
WITH THE BROWN MOUSTACHE

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
LEADS THE GROUP.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
IN HIS RIGHT HAND HE HOLDS
A 45 CALIBER PISTOL.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
HE SHOUTS, WITH A
HOARSE AND DOUGHY VOICE

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
THAT SOMETIMES SOUNDS
SLURRED WITH DRINK.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
HE WEARS OLIVE LIGHT
TROUSERS AND A SHORT JACKET:

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
IT IS THE UNIFORM
OF THE ARGENTINE ARMY.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
DON HORACIO BACKS
DOWN, FRIGHTENED.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
HE TRIES TO RAISE HIS
HANDS WITHOUT LETTING GO

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
OF THE HOT WATER BAG THAT
IS BURNING HIS FINGERS.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
THE HEAD OF THE
GROUP IS NOT AMUSED.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000
"WHERE IS TANCO?"
HE SHOUTS.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
BEGINNING IN THE 1960'S,
THE BRIGHT LINE BETWEEN

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
LITERATURE AND POPULAR
CULTURE BECAME

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
INCREASINGLY MORE
DIFFICULT TO DISCERN.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
IN ARGENTINA, THE CULTURE
OF THE MASSES BECAME

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
HEAVILY POLITICIZED
THROUGH THE ICONIC FIGURES

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
OF JUAN PERON AND
HIS WIFE, EVA.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
AS THE CRITIC PABLO
ALABARCES HAS NOTED,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
THIS COMMINGLING LED TO
A DISTINCT SET OF THEMES

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
IN THE WORK OF
RODOLFO WALSH.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
IN HIS BEST-KNOWN PIECES
OF FICTION, SUCH AS THE

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
SHORT STORY ENTITLED "THAT
WOMAN", WALSH EXAMINED

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
THE INTELLECTUAL WHO
TURNS TO POPULAR CULTURE

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
TO DISCERN THE TRUTH OF
HIS NATION'S TEMPERAMENT.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
THROUGH THIS CHARACTER THE
AUTHOR ENGAGES THE STATE

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
IN A POINTED CONVERSATION
ABOUT ITS FUTURE, ITS

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
FICTION, AND THE SEMIOTICS
OF ITS NATIONAL SYMBOLISM.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
ANOTHER DEBATE THAT
DEFINES THIS PERIOD

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
REVOLVES AROUND REALISM,
THE AESTHETIC MOVEMENT

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
DEDICATED TO WHAT THE
ITALIAN FILM DIRECTOR

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
ROBERTO
ROSSELINI CALLED

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
"THE ARTISTIC SHAPE
OF THE TRUTH".

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
AS REALISM ENTERED
THE LATTER HALF OF

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
THE 20TH CENTURY, IT
BECAME INTERTWINED WITH

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
MARXIST CONCEPTIONS OF
CULTURE AND REVOLUTION.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
SEEN IN THIS LIGHT,
LITERATURE COULD BECOME

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
A MEANS TO AN END, A
MECHANISM THAT GENERATES

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000
SOCIAL CHANGE AND AWAKENS
SLUMBERING CONSCIENCES.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000
LATIN AMERICAN
WRITERS WERE INSPIRED

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
IN PARTICULAR
BY THE FRENCH:

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
JEAN PAUL SARTRE'S
EXISTENTIALIST WORLDVIEW,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
MICHEL FOUCAULT'S
POSTMODERNIST

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
INTERPRETATIONS OF THE
MAY '68 UPRISING IN PARIS,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
AND BY THE FRENCH
GOVERNMENT'S BRUTAL

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
RESPONSE TO ALGERIA'S
BID FOR INDEPENDENCE.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
IN PERU, MIGUEL GUTIERREZ
AND OSWALDO REYNOSO

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
FOUNDED A GROUP
CALLED NARRATION,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
AND PUBLISHED A
JOURNAL OF THE SAME NAME.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
NARRATION CARRIED ON A
TRADITION OF DISCUSSION

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
AND DEBATE THAT CAN
BE TRACED BACK TO THE

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
ORIGINS OF MODERNISMO,
IF NOT EARLIER.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
IN THE 70'S, HOWEVER,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
JOURNALS BECAME
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
THEY CHAMPIONED
WHAT THEY TERMED

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
"COMPROMISED" LITERATURE,
EXEMPLIFIED BY WORKS

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
SUCH AS THE OLD SAURIAN
 RETIRES BY MIGUEL GUTIERREZ

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
OR IN OCTOBER THERE
 ARE NO MIRACLES

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
AND THE SCARAB AND THE
 MAN BY OSWALDO REYNOSO.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
WHEN CONTEMPLATING LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE FROM

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
THIS PERIOD, NO ONE WRITER
PERSONIFIES THE TENSIONS

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
AND CONFLICTING AGENDAS
THAT BESET AUTHORS OF THE

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
ERA BETTER THAN THE
ARGENTINEAN NOVELIST

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000
JULIO CORTAZAR.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
AS A RENOWNED AND HIGHLY
VISIBLE INTELLECTUAL,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
CORTAZAR PLAYED OUT HIS
CAREER IN A STATE OF

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
TENSION BETWEEN
AESTHETICS AND POLITICS.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000
AN ANTI-PERONIST, HE
EMIGRATED TO FRANCE

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
IN THE EARLY 1950'S.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
IN HIS LATER YEARS,
CORTAZAR BECAME ACTIVELY

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
ENGAGED WITH LEFTIST
CAUSES IN LATIN AMERICA,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
SUPPORTING BOTH THE
CUBAN REVOLUTION AND THE

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
SANDINISTA GOVERNMENT
IN NICARAGUA.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
YET HE ALWAYS STROVE TO
ENDOW HIS WRITING WITH A

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
DEGREE OF AUTONOMY
FROM HIS POLITICS.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
HOWEVER, OVER THE
COURSE OF HIS CAREER

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
IT IS CLEAR THAT HIS
THEMES WERE SHIFTING,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
GRADUALLY, TO
TOPICS ANCHORED IN

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
CONTEMPORARY LATIN
AMERICAN REALITY.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
AFTER THE IMPACT OF HIS
BREAKOUT NOVEL HOPSCOTCH,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
WHICH ELECTRIFIED THE
LITERARY WORLD IN THE 60'S,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
HE REMAINED HIGHLY PROLIFIC,
PUBLISHING NOVELS,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
PLAYS, AND POEMS RIGHT UP
UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1984.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
IN 1982 HE PUT OUT
 UNREASONABLE HOURS,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
HIS FINAL VOLUME OF
STORIES, WHICH INCLUDES

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
TALES THAT ARE OVERTLY
POLITICAL IN NATURE.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
AMONG THEM IS A STORY
ENTITLED "MEETING",

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
WHICH FEATURES CHE
GUEVARA, FIDEL CASTRO,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
AND THE LANDING
THAT LAUNCHED

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
THE CUBAN REVOLUTION.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
THE WORK IS REMARKABLE AS
MUCH FOR ITS POLITICAL

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
BRAVADO AS IT IS FOR
CORTAZAR'S SEEMINGLY

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
EFFORTLESS MASTERY
OVER HIS CRAFT.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
CORTAZAR HAS ONLY ONE
STORY IN HIS ENTIRE

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
COLLECTION THAT HAS TO
DO WITH THE REVOLUTION.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000
JUST ONE.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I'M REFERRING TO THE
CUBAN REVOLUTION.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
HE HAS ANOTHER STORY ABOUT
THE NICARAGUAN REVOLUTION.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
BUT EXCEPT
FOR THOSE TWO,

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
NO STORY OF HIS DEALS
DIRECTLY WITH REVOLUTION.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
THAT IS TO SAY, FROM THE
LITERARY POINT OF VIEW,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
THERE WAS
NO INFLUENCE.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000
THE INFLUENCE
WAS IDEOLOGICAL,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
BUT IT ISN'T
MANIFESTED

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
IN ANY OF THEM,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
PRECISELY BECAUSE
THESE WRITERS THINK

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000
- AND IN THIS THEY
DO MAKE A BREAK

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
WITH THE
PREVIOUS GENERATION -

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
THAT POLITICAL THOUGHT
IS NOT TO BE EXPRESSED

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
STRAIGHTFORWARDLY
THROUGH LITERATURE.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
AT LEAST WE WERE NO
LONGER IN THE DAMN BOAT,

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
BETWEEN SICKNESS
AND WAVES,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
STROKES AND PIECES
OF WET COOKIES,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
BETWEEN MACHINE GUNS AND
DRIBBLES, SOAKING WET,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
COMFORTING EACH OTHER,
WHEN WE COULD, WITH THE

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
LITTLE TOBACCO THAT WAS
LEFT DRY BECAUSE LUIS

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
(WHOSE NAME WASN'T LUIS,
BUT WE HAD SWORN NOT TO

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
REMEMBER OUR NAMES
UNTIL THE DAY ARRIVED)

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
HAD HAD THE GOOD IDEA
TO PUT IT IN A TIN BOX

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
THAT WE OPENED
MORE CAREFULLY

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
THAN IF IT WAS
FULL OF SCORPIONS.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
WAVE GOES AND
WAVE COMES,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
THE BUCKETS
SKINNING OUR HANDS,

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
ME WITH MY DAMNED ASTHMA
AND ALMOST EVERYBODY ILL,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
BENDING THEMSELVES
TO VOMIT

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
AS IF THEY WOULD SPLIT
THEMSELVES IN TWO.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
UNTIL, ON THE SECOND
NIGHT, A GREEN BILE

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
TOOK FROM LUIS THE DESIRE
TO LAUGH, BETWEEN THAT

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000
AND THE NORTH THAT DID
NOT LET US SEE THE LIGHT

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000
OF CABO CRUZ, A DISASTER
THAT NOBODY HAD IMAGINED.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
ALWAYS A BELLWETHER OF
CHANGE, LATIN AMERICAN

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
POETRY REINVENTED ITSELF
IN THE LATE 20TH CENTURY.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
POETS STEEPED
THEIR WORK

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
IN THE BRUTE
EXPERIENCE OF REALISM

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
AND GOT THEIR HANDS DIRTY
WITH POLITICAL ACTIVISM.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
SOME OF THE BIGGEST
NAMES ON THE CONTINENT

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.000
FIRST MADE THEIR MARK
IN THE 60'S AND BECAME

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
POETIC FIXTURES IN
THE 70'S AND LATER:

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
THE URUGUAYANS
MARIO BENEDETTI

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000
AND EDUARDO GALEANO,

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
THE ARGENTINEANS
PACO URONDO

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
AND JUAN GELMAN,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000
THE CHILEAN
ARIEL DORFMAN.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
OTHER, MORE
ESTABLISHED WRITERS,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
ALSO FLOURISHED
AT THIS TIME,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
SUCH AS PABLO NERUDA
- WHO DIED IN 1973 -

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
OR GONZALO ROJAS,
AMONG OTHERS.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
THE POET OF THIS
PERIOD WAS A KIND OF

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
SHARPSHOOTER, PICKING
OFF CULTURAL AND

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000
SOCIAL TARGETS WITH
HEARTLESS ACCURACY.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
IN HIS POEM PRACTICAL
 SEMANTICS, MARIO BENEDETTI

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
PINPOINTS HIS VICTIMS WITH
CHARACTERISTIC PRECISION:

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
THEY WANT ME TO SHELTER
MYSELF WITHIN YOU

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
SOFT WORD
SILASILLY...

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
THE TEMPTATION OR THE
ORDER IS TO WATCH YOU,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
SO I FORGET ABOUT THOSE
WHO DO TO YOU AND UNDO YOU

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
THEY FORGE YOU AND
THEY LIQUEFY YOU

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
THEY GOT TO
SAY THAT YOU WERE

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
HEAR THIS GENTLEMEN,
THE GREAT PROTAGONIST

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
FROM WHERE
SOFT SILASILLY.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
YOUR ONLY SALVATION IS
TO BE OUR INSTRUMENT.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
CARESS SCALPEL METAPHOR
GUN HOOK OSCILLATORIA

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
BLASPHEMY LOCK
ETC. YOU'LL SEE.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
THE SAME KIND OF QUIET
LYRICISM INFORMS THE WORK

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
OF THE URUGUAYAN WRITER
EDUARDO GALEANO.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
IN THE EARLY 80'S
HE PUBLISHED HIS

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
MEMORIA DEL FUEGO,
OR MEMORY OF FIRE,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
A TRILOGY THAT REVISITS
THE LATIN AMERICAN PAST,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
BOTH RECENT
AND DISTANT.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
THE CHARACTERS THAT
POPULATE MEMORY OF FIRE

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
ARE PLUCKED FROM THE
PAGES OF HISTORY:

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:47.000
GENERALS, ARTISTS,
REVOLUTIONARIES, WORKERS,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
CONQUERORS AND
THE CONQUERED -

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
ALL ARE PORTRAYED IN
BRIEF EPISODES THAT

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
ENCAPSULATE THE COLONIAL
HISTORY OF THE CONTINENT.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
THE STORY BEGINS AT THE
BEGINNING, RECOUNTING

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
PRE-COLUMBIAN CREATION
MYTHS, AND IT ENDS IN

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
WHAT WAS THEN THE PRESENT
DAY - THE 1980'S.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000
GALEANO IS FASCINATED
WITH THE SEEMINGLY

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
INDEFATIGABLE URGE TO
RESIST COLONIAL OPPRESSORS,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
AND HIGHLIGHTS BOTH
MASS REVOLUTIONARY

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
MOVEMENTS AND INDIVIDUAL
ACTS OF HEROISM.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
THE INEVITABILITY OF
DEFEAT IS PALPABLE

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
THROUGHOUT, HOWEVER;
NO SOONER HAD THE

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
OLD COLONIAL OVERLORDS
BEEN CLEARED OUT

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
THAN NEW DICTATORSHIPS
AND PERSECUTION AROSE,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
SPREADING DEATH AND
CRUSHING THE WRITTEN WORD.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
THERE IS A NEED THAT HAS A
LOT TO DO WITH POLITICS,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
ALTHOUGH IT DEPENDS
ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
IT'S A NEED TO
RECOVER WORDS.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
MY TRADE, AFTER ALL, IS
THE TRADE OF THE WRITER.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
AND I FEEL THAT WITH THE
WAY THE POLITICS OF POWER

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
ARE HANDLED IN THE
WORLD NOWADAYS,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
THERE IS A SULLYING
OF WORDS GOING ON.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
AND I FEEL THAT AS A
WRITER I CAN HELP A LITTLE

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
WITH THEIR RECOVERY, OR
AT LEAST TRY TO DO SO.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000
WE HAVE THE JOY
OF OUR PAINS BECAUSE

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT
THE PAINLESS LIFE

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
THAT SOCIETY OF CONSUMPTION
SOLD IN SUPERMARKETS;

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
WE HAVE THE JOY
OF OUR MISTAKES,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
TUMBLES THAT
PROVE TO US

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
THE PASSION OF WALKING
AND THE LOVE TO THE WAY;

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
AND WE HAVE THE
JOY OF OUR DEFEATS

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
BECAUSE THE FIGHT FOR
JUSTICE AND BEAUTY,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
IT IS WORTH IT
ALSO WHEN IT IS LOST.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
THE NICARAGUAN POET
ERNESTO CARDENAL IS,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
TO NORTH AMERICAN
SENSIBILITIES,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
A STUDY
IN CONTRASTS.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
BORN INTO A WEALTHY
FAMILY, HE ESCHEWED THE

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
HIGH LIFE AND, AFTER A
FAILED REVOLUTIONARY

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
COUP D'ETAT LEFT MANY
FRIENDS AND COMRADES DEAD,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
HE ENTERED THE TRAPPIST
MONASTERY AT GETHSEMANE

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
TO BE UNDER THE
TUTELAGE OF THE FAMOUS

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
POET-PRIEST
THOMAS MERTON.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
HE WAS ORDAINED A
CATHOLIC PRIEST IN 1965

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
AND CONTINUED HIS
ACTIVITIES AS A

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
POLITICAL REVOLUTIONARY
AND VISIONARY POET.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
HE ALLIED HIMSELF
WITH THE SANDINISTAS,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000
A LEFT-WING NICARAGUAN
POLITICAL PARTY, AND

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
ESTABLISHED A RELIGIOUS
AND ARTISTIC COMMUNITY

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
ON THE SOLENTINAME ISLANDS
IN LAKE COCIBOLCA.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
AS A PRIEST HE WAS A
SEMINAL THINKER IN THE

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
LIBERATION THEOLOGY
MOVEMENT, WHICH LINKS

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
ACTIVE FAITH IN GOD
WITH AN IMPERATIVE FOR

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
SOCIAL ACTION IN
THE COMMUNITY.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
AS A POET HE WAS NO
LESS REVOLUTIONARY,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
PRODUCING POEMS THAT
ISSUE A CALL TO ACTION

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
WITHOUT DEVOLVING
INTO STRIDENCY,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
THAT ARE IMBUED WITH
SIMPLICITY AND WONDER,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
NARRATED BY THE VOICES
OF EVERYDAY FOLK.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
TO GO ON
TRAVELING.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
AND THAT
FUCKED UP TRIP.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
THE UNEXPECTED PHONE CALL
FROM MANAGUA TO THE LAST

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
ISLAND OF THE ANTILLES:
"ERNESTO, LAUREANO DIED".

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
IN THE
TRINIDAD-BARBADOS-JAMAICA-

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
HAVANA-MANAGUA FLIGHT
WATCHING SEA,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
AND SEA, I COULD NOT
THINK IN ANYTHING ELSE.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
SINCE WE HAVE BEEN BORN
WITH A BAD PROGNOSIS

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
THE BEST THING TO DO
IS TO DIE AS A HERO

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
AND A MARTYR
AS YOU DIED.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
OF COURSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER IF YOU NEVER DIED,

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
PROVIDED THAT YOUR WIFE
AND YOUR CHILDREN

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
AND YOUR FRIENDS AND THE
ENTIRE WORLD NEVER DIED.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000
PARTNER! SUB-COMMANDER
LAUREANO,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
CHIEF OF THE
FRONTIER POLICE:

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
I SAY ALONG WITH YOU, THAT
WE GIVE A SHIT ABOUT DEATH.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
IN ARGENTINA, MIXING
POETRY WITH MILITANT

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
POLITICS CAME AT
CONSIDERABLE PERIL.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
JUAN GELMAN IS ONE OF HIS
NATION'S LEADING POETS,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
BUT WAS FORCED INTO
POLITICAL EXILE IN 1976.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
HIS SON, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW,
AND GRANDCHILD ARE AMONG

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
THE "DESAPARECIDOS" -
THE "DISAPPEARED ONES",

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
VICTIMS OF THE
GOVERNMENT'S SO-CALLED

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
"WAR AGAINST SUBVERSION",
MANY OF WHOM WERE

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
DRUGGED AND DUMPED FROM
AIRCRAFT INTO THE SEA.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
THESE POEMS, THIS
COLLECTION OF PAPERS,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
THIS HERD OF PIECES THAT
ARE TRYING TO BREATHE,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
THESE ROUGH SMOOTH
WORDS GATHERED BY ME,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000
THEY ARE GOING TO
COST MY SALVATION.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
SOMETIMES THEY ARE
WORSE THAN FACTS OR,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
MORE ACCURATE, TIME PASSING
DOES NOT SHARPEN THEM

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
DOES NOT GET THEM PRETTIER;
IT DISCOVERS ITS CRACKS,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
ITS ABRADED WALLS, THE
CEILING SINKS AND RAINS.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
THE POET, PLAYWRIGHT
AND JOURNALIST

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
FRANCISCO "PACO"
URONDO ALSO DARED

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000
CONFRONT HIS COUNTRY'S
RULING MILITARY JUNTA.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
JUAN GELMAN SAID OF HIM
THAT "THERE WAS NO ABYSS

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
BETWEEN EXPERIENCE AND
POETRY FOR URONDO".

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
HE WAS ASSASSINATED
IN 1975.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
THE WORK OF
BOTH THESE POETS

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
DISPLAYS AN
INESCAPABLE TENSION

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
BETWEEN DESIRE
AND DESPAIR.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
CRUELTY DOES NOT SCARE
ME AND I ALWAYS LIVED

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
DAZZLED BY
THE PURE ALCOHOL,

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
THE WELL WRITTEN BOOK,
THE PERFECT FLESH.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I'M USED TO TRUSTING MY
STRENGTH AND MY HEALTH AND

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
MY DESTINY AND GOOD LUCK:
I KNOW THAT I WILL GET TO

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
SEE THE REVOLUTION, THE
FEARED AND CARESSED JUMP,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
STRIKING THE DOOR
OF OUR LAZINESS.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
I AM SURE TO GET TO LIVE
IN THE HEART OF A WORD;

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
TO SHARE THIS HEAT, THIS
FATALITY THAT HAS NO USE

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
WHEN IT IS STILL
AND ROTTEN.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
TO BE SPEAKING, TO HOLD
THIS VICTORY, THIS FIST;

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
TO SAY GOODBYE,
TO DISMISS.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
HUMBLY I CAN SAY THAT LIFE
IS THE BEST THING I KNOW.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
REFLECTION ON THE MEANING
OF THE WRITTEN WORD

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
RUNS THROUGH THE WORK OF
ANOTHER OF THE CONTINENT'S

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
MOST IMPORTANT
POETS:

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
THE MEXICAN
JOSE EMILIO PACHECO.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
PACHECO'S TALENT WAS
APPARENT FROM AN EARLY AGE,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
AND WHILE STILL
IN HIS TWENTIES

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
HE WAS ALREADY
KEEPING COMPANY

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000
WITH THE GREAT WRITERS
OF LATIN AMERICA.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
IN ADDITION TO HIS POETRY,
HE HAS PUBLISHED AND

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
SUPPORTED THE WORKS OF
MANY LESSER KNOWN POETS,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
AND IS A RESPECTED
SCHOLAR.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
HERE COMES THE IDENTICAL
RAIN AND ITS ANGRY WEEDS

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
- THE SALT, THE
UNDONE SEA.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
THE PREVIOUS
DEED IS ERASED,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
IT IS WRITTEN
AFTERWARDS.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
THIS CONVEX SEA,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
ITS MIGRATORY AND
ROOTED CUSTOMS.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
IT WAS ALREADY USED BEFORE
TO MAKE A THOUSAND POEMS.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000
(THE INFECTED DOG, THE
POETRY WITH SCABIES,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000
A LAUGHABLE VARIETY
OF NEUROSIS,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
PRICE THAT SOME MEN PAY FOR
NOT KNOWING HOW TO LIVE.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
THE SWEET, ETERNAL,
ENLIGHTENING POETRY.)

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN BOOM
HAD DOMINATED LITERATURE

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
IN THE 1960'S, BUT AS
THE PHENOMENON MATURED

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
IT BECAME ENMESHED IN
CRITICAL REFORMULATIONS

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
AND ARTISTIC
REFUTATIONS.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
AS THE BOOM'S ECHOES BEGAN
TO FADE, THERE AROSE WHAT

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
HAS COME TO BE CALLED THE
"NEW HISTORICAL NOVEL",

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
A GENRE WHICH INCLUDES
SOME OF THE MOST

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
IMPORTANT TEXTS FROM
THE LAST THIRTY YEARS.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
WORKS THAT FALL UNDER
THIS RUBRIC INCLUDE

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
A HALLUCINATING WORLD

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000
BY THE CUBAN WRITER
REINALDO ARENAS;

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.000
I, THE SUPREME

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000
BY AUGUSTO ROA
BASTOS OF PARAGUAY;

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
BAROQUE CONCERT BY ALEJO
CARPENTIER OF CUBA;

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
VIEW OF DAWN
 IN THE TROPICS

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
BY GUILLERMO CABRERA
INFANTE, ALSO FROM CUBA;

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
AND TERRA NOSTRA BY MEXICAN
AUTHOR CARLOS FUENTES.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
ALL THESE NOVELS
DISPLAY SIMILAR FAMILY

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
CHARACTERISTICS: MANY
USE FAMOUS HISTORICAL

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000
CHARACTERS AS
PROTAGONISTS; THEY PRESENT

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
LAYERED NARRATIVES WITH
MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
ON PAST EVENTS;

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
AND THEY ARE BITING BUT
AFFECTIONATE PARODIES

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY
CRITIQUE

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
AND PAY HOMAGE TO
THEIR SUBJECTS.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
ANOTHER PHENOMENON THAT
ARISES WHEN THE NOVEL

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
LOSES ITS POLITICIZING
IDEAL - BECAUSE WRITERS

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
HAVE BEEN CO-OPTED
BY THE MARKETPLACE,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
ALREADY GAINED ACCLAIM,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
BECAUSE IN THEORY THEY DO
NOT CARE ANY MORE ABOUT

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
CONTRIBUTING TO THE
RADICALIZATION OF SOCIETY

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
- THERE IS A GAMBLE
ON A NEW GENRE,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
THE GENRE
OF TESTIMONY.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
SOME NEW HISTORICAL NOVELS
TAKE UP GREAT FIGURES

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
FROM THE PAST IN
ORDER TO CUT AWAY

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000
THE MYTHOLOGIES THAT
HAVE BUILT UP AROUND THEM.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000
NO ONE IS SACRED: NOT THE
SPANISH KING PHILIP II

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
FROM THE COLONIAL
PERIOD; NOT MAXIMILIAN,

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
THE EMPEROR OF MEXICO
FROM THE HAPSBURG FAMILY,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
NOR HIS WIFE THE
ARCHDUCHESS CHARLOTTE;

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000
NOT EVEN CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS HIMSELF.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
OTHER WORKS
REPRISE BASIC TEXTS

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
FROM THE
AMERICAN ARCHIVE.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
FOR EXAMPLE, REINALDO
ARENAS, IN HIS BOOK

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
A HALLUCINATING WORLD,
REINVENTED THE

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
MEMOIRS OF FRAY
SERVANDO TERESA DE MIER,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
A MEXICAN WHOSE
CHRONICLE OFFERED READERS

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
A BOTTOM-UP HISTORY
OF THE NEW WORLD.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
WITH FRAY SERVANDO,
EUROPEANS GOT THEIR FIRST

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
GLIMPSE OF LATIN AMERICA
WITHOUT THE FILTER OF

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
COLONIALISM, AND LATIN
AMERICANS BEGAN TO

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
THINK OF THEMSELVES
AS A DISTINCT ENTITY

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
DEFINED BY
SHARED HISTORY.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
NOTHING IS HEARD HERE.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
YOU CANNOT EVEN SEE
THE FIELDS OR THE SEA.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
PEOPLE DIE HERE IN
SILENCE MADE FOR SADNESS.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000
I HAVE TO LEAVE YOU
HERE ALONE IN THIS PLACE

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000
WHERE I WOULD NOT KNOW
WHAT TO DO OR TO THINK,

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
OR HOW TO ESCAPE.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
BUT YOU ARE ALREADY
COMING UP WITH

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
THOUSANDS OF SOLUTIONS;
YOU HAVE A PLAN

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.000
AND THAT IS ALL YOU
WILL THINK ABOUT.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
AND YOU WRITE
HUNDREDS OF LETTERS

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
THAT THEY WILL
NOT SEND ANYWHERE.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
BUT YOU WRITE, WITH A
PEN OF BIRD'S FEATHER

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
AND A STICK TO
FEND OFF THE RATS.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
IT IS GETTING DARK AND
THERE IS NOT A CANDLE.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
THE ONLY
WAY TO WRITE

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
IS BY THE SHINING
EYES OF THE RATS.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
AND WITH THAT
CLARITY, YOU WRITE.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
JUST AS ARENAS REFERRED TO
THE WORK OF FRAY SERVANDO,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
THE BRAZILIAN WRITER
SILVIANO SANTIAGO'S NOVEL

IN FREEDOM, FROM
1981, BUILDS UPON

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
GRACILIANO RAMOS'
 MEMORIES OF PRISON,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
WHICH WAS
PUBLISHED IN 1953.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
THE 1970'S SAW THE
PUBLICATION OF A SERIES

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
OF NOVELS ON DICTATORSHIPS
AND DICTATORS

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
WRITTEN BY SOME OF THE BEST
KNOWN AUTHORS OF THE BOOM:

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
CONVERSATION
 IN THE CATHEDRAL

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
AND THE AUTUMN
 OF THE PATRIARCH

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
BY GABRIEL GARCIA
MARQUEZ IN 1975.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
AT THE SAME TIME, THE FIGURE
OF THE REVOLUTIONARY

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
COMES UNDER THE SCRUTINY
OF NOVELISTS SUCH AS

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
JULIO CORTAZAR IN HIS
WORK A MANUAL FOR MANUEL

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
AND MANUEL PUIG IN THE
 KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
THEY TOUCH GOBLETS
AND DRINK WITHOUT

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
SAYING ANOTHER WORD,
JUST HOLDING HANDS.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE
LETS GO OF HIS HAND;

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
SHE'S SEEN SOMEONE
COMING OVER TO THE TABLE.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
IT'S A WOMAN, BEAUTIFUL
LOOKING AT FIRST GLANCE,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
BUT A SECOND LATER
YOU NOTICE SOMETHING

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000
STRANGE ABOUT HER FACE,
SOMETHING FRIGHTENING

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
AND YET IT'S HARD
TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
BECAUSE IT'S
A WOMAN'S FACE

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
BUT ALSO THE
FACE OF A CAT.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
THE EYES SLANT UP,
AND SO PECULIAR,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU,

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
SHE HAS NO
WHITES IN HER EYES,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
HER EYES ARE COMPLETELY
GREEN IN COLOR,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
WITH BLACK PUPILS AT THE
CENTER, AND NOTHING ELSE.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
THE PERIOD 1973 AND 1976
SAW THE RISE OF BRUTAL

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
MILITARY DICTATORSHIPS
THROUGHOUT THE CONTINENT,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
POISONING THE ATMOSPHERE
WITH PERSECUTION, EXILE,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
AND ASSASSINATION.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
THE UTTER DESPAIR CAUSED
BY THIS REPRESSION

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
BROUGHT ABOUT A
RADICAL REFORMULATION

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
OF LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
WRITERS SOUGHT OUT A NEW
VOICE, ONE THAT COULD

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000
DESCRIBE HUMILIATING
DEFEAT ON THE ONE HAND,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000
AND THE HEARTBREAK
OF DISAPPEARANCE,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
FEAR, OR EXILE,
ON THE OTHER.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
AUTHORS AROSE WHO, WHILE
DENOUNCING THE HORROR OF

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000
WHAT WAS HAPPENING, WERE
ABLE TO FILE THEIR REPORTS

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
THROUGH ELLIPSIS,
INFERENCE, AND METAPHOR.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
SOME KEY FIGURES
FROM THIS PERIOD

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
ARE THE ARGENTINEANS
HECTOR TIZON,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
DANIEL MOYANO,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
LUISA VALENZUELA,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
GRISELDA GAMBADO,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
RICARDO PIGLIA,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
AND DANIEL
FREIDEMBERG;

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
AND THE CHILEANS
ARIEL DORFMAN,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
DIAMELA ELTIT,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
GONZALO ROJAS,

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
AND OMAR LARA.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
THERE IS AN IDEA THAT
CERTAIN GENRES ARE MORE

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
LIABLE TO BE POLITICIZED
AT CERTAIN TIMES,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
AND IT MIGHT BE TRUE.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000
IT IS NOT REALITY
THAT DEMANDS IT.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000
IT IS THE REALM OF
CULTURE FIELD THAT DOES.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
IT IS NOT THAT A NOVEL
CANNOT BE WRITTEN,

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
BUT THE NOVEL APPEARS
TO BE DEVALUED,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
AND THEREFORE THE
INVESTMENT IN TESTIMONY

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
BECOMES MORE MASSIVE AND
IS EXERCISED MORE OFTEN.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.000
WHAT REALITY IS ACTUALLY
DEMANDING FOR A LOT OF

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
PEOPLE IS THAT THE
IMMINENCE OF REVOLUTION,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
IN ORDER TO
BECOME REAL,

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
CEASE BEING AN
ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
WHAT REALITY IS
DEMANDING IS THAT

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
THE REVOLUTION
ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
MANY WORKS WERE
WRITTEN BY WRITERS

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
EXILED IN EUROPE
OR MEXICO.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
FROM THIS DISTANCE,
AUTHORS FELT SAFE ENOUGH

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
TO GIVE DIRECT TESTIMONY
ABOUT THE ATROCITIES

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
OF THIS PERIOD.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
SUCH IS THE CASE FOR TEJAS
 VERDES BY HERNAN VALDES.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
ONE OF THE MOST
INTERESTING WORKS

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
IN THIS VEIN IS THE NOVEL
 THE HOUSE AND THE WIND

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
BY THE ARGENTINEAN
WRITER HECTOR TIZON.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
WRITTEN DURING TIZON'S
FORCED EXILE IN MADRID,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
THE HOUSE AND THE WIND WAS
COMPOSED BY A MAN WHO WAS

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
UNDER THE PERMANENT AND
INTOLERABLE CERTAINTY

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
THAT HE HAS LOST HIS
COUNTRY, HIS HOME.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
THIS SENSE OF LOSS
GIVES WAY TO AN

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
INCONSOLABLE EXPERIENCE OF
WRETCHEDNESS AND DESPAIR.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
TO EVOKE SUCH MISERY, TO
BRING THE PAST TO A CLOSE

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
IN ORDER TO MAKE LIFE
ONCE AGAIN BEARABLE,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
TIZON CRAFTED A
NOVEL OF REMEMBRANCE

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
WHICH IS BOTH
A LONG GOODBYE

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
AND AT THE SAME TIME
A KIND OF HOMECOMING.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
WHEN I DECIDED TO GO,
TO LEAVE WHAT I LOVED

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
AND WAS MINE, I KNEW
THAT IT WAS FOREVER.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.000
IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE
A SIMPLE ABSENCE BUT AN

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
IRREPARABLE AND SHAMELESS
ACT, LIKE RUNNING AWAY.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
IN FACT, I THINK ALL
LEAVINGS WERE ESCAPES.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
I THINK THAT IT IS THE
ONLY FORM OF DEPARTING.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
BUT BEFORE FLEEING I
WANTED TO SEE WHAT I WAS

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
LEAVING BEHIND, TO FILL
MY HEART WITH IMAGES

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
TO RECOUNT MY LIFE NOT IN
YEARS BUT IN MOUNTAINS,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
IN GESTURES, IN INFINITE
FACES; NEVER IN NUMBERS

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
BUT IN TENDERNESS, IN
RAGES, PAINS AND JOYS.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
ANOTHER CRUCIAL NOVEL
FROM THIS PERIOD

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000
IS ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION
BY RICARDO PIGLIA,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
A WORK THAT HAS HAD
A TREMENDOUS IMPACT

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
ON SUBSEQUENT
LITERATURE.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.000
THE INSIDE COVER OF THE
NOVEL OFFERS CLUES TO THE

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
MEANING OF ITS TITLE,
ALLUDING OMINOUSLY TO

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
"DARK TIMES IN WHICH
MEN SEEM TO NEED

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
BOTTLED AIR
TO SURVIVE".

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
IN CIRCUMSPECT FASHION,
 ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
DENOUNCES CRIMES COMMITTED
DURING THE ARGENTINEAN

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, BUT
CONCEALS ITS TRUE INTENT

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
SO AS TO CONFUSE
THE CENSORS.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
AS SUCH, THE WORK IS IN
MANY WAYS A MEDITATION

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
ON THE NATURE OF
REALITY, LITERALNESS,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
AND TREACHERY.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
AS IN OTHER FOUNDATIONAL
LATIN AMERICAN NOVELS,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
SUCH AS JORGE LOUIS BORGES'
 THE GARDEN OF FORKING PATHS,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
ARTIFICIAL
 RESPIRATION TAKES A

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
LABYRINTHINE TRAIL
TOWARDS THE TRUTH.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000
PIGLIA IS THE GREAT WRITER
OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:12.000
"HOW TO UNDERSTAND
ARGENTINA", RIGHT?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
ONE QUESTION THAT APPEARS
IN ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
IS THE FOLLOWING:

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
"WHO AMONG US WILL
WRITE FACUNDO ?"

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
IN PIGLIA THERE IS AN
OBSESSION WITH REVEALING

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
THE POLITICAL STRUCTURES
WITHIN THE STORY,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000
ABOUT WRITING
POLITICAL FICTION,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
ABOUT EXPLORING
THE BORDERS BETWEEN

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.000
CIVILIAN PARANOIA
AND STATE TERRORISM.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
IS THERE A STORY?

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
IF THERE IS A STORY IT
STARTS THREE YEARS AGO.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
IN APRIL OF 1976, WHEN MY
FIRST BOOK IS PUBLISHED,

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
HE SENDS ME A LETTER.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000
WITH THE LETTER THERE
IS A PHOTOGRAPH WHERE HE

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
HAS ME IN HIS ARMS:
NAKED, I AM SMILING,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I AM THREE MONTHS OLD
AND I LOOK LIKE A FROG.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
HOWEVER, HE LOOKS GOOD
IN THAT PHOTOGRAPH:

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
DOUBLE BREASTED SUIT,
FEDORA HAT, FRANK SMILE:

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
A MAN OF 30 YEARS OLD
WHO LOOKS AT THE WORLD

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
WITH HIS CHIN UP.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
AT THE BOTTOM, BLURRED
AND ALMOST OUT OF FOCUS,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
MY MOTHER APPEARS,
SO YOUNG THAT

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
I COULD HARDLY
RECOGNIZE HER.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
OTHER KEY TEXTS ALSO
ADDRESSED THE MISERY

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
OF LIFE UNDER THE
DICTATORSHIPS,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
PARTICULARLY IN THE
SOUTHERN CONE REGION

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
ENCOMPASSING ARGENTINA,
CHILE, URUGUAY,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
AND PARAGUAY.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
THESE WORKS INCLUDE NOVELS
SUCH AS RIVER OF GRIEF

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
BY LIBERTAD
DEMITROPULOS

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
AND OTHER WEAPONS AND BLACK
 NOVEL WITH ARGENTINES,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
BOTH BY LUISA
VALENZUELA.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
VALENZUELA IS ONE OF
THE MOST WIDELY READ

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
FEMALE WRITERS FROM LATIN
AMERICA, AN AUTHOR WHO HAS

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
CRAFTED NARRATIVES THAT
DRAW PARALLELS BETWEEN

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
AUTHORITARIAN POLITICAL
RULE AND PATRIARCHAL

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
DOMINATION IN RELATIONS
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
SOMEBODY PUT INTO
HER A SEED OF TERROR.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
OR IS IT HER SEED
AND IT HAS GROWN?

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
IF IT IS SO, IF FEAR
DOES NOT COME TO ME

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
FROM THE OUTSIDE,
I SAY TO MYSELF

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
"THIS IS ME: MY FEAR. MY
FEAR IS A PART OF ME

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
AND THERE IS NO
NEED TO BE SCARED".

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
AGUSTIN, AGUSTIN, THIS
FEAR THAT IS PART

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
OF ONESELF IS THE
WORST OF THE FEARS.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
IT CAN HAVE
YOU KILLED

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.000
WHEN YOU TRY TO
SUPPRESS IT, THE FEAR.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
THE CHILEAN AUTHOR
DIAMELA ELTIT

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
BEGAN HER WRITING CAREER
UNDER THE DICTATORSHIP OF

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.000
GENERAL AUGUSTO PINOCHET,
WHO HAD COME TO POWER

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
IN A COUP THAT OUSTED
THE SOCIALIST GOVERNMENT

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000
OF SALVADOR ALLENDE.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000
PINOCHET'S DETRACTORS
DENOUNCED HIM

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
FOR DESTROYING
CHILE'S DEMOCRACY,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
SPONSORING
STATE-SUPPORTED TERRORISM

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
THAT KILLED AND
TORTURED THOUSANDS,

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
AND CATERING
TO THE WEALTHY

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
AT THE EXPENSE OF
THE LOWER CLASSES.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
ELTIT'S WRITING
SUCCESSFULLY FUSES

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
POLITICS WITH THE DICTATES
OF LITERATURE IN PROTEST

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
AGAINST PREVAILING
SOCIAL STRUCTURES.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
SHE IDENTIFIES THE
OBJECT OF OPPRESSION

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000
IN HER SOCIETY AS
THE 'FEMININE',

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000
THOUGH HER DEFINITION
OF THIS TERM IS BROAD,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
AND ENCOMPASSES MORE
THAN JUST THE FEMALE.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
"IF THE FEMININE IS
THAT WHICH IS OPPRESSED

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
BY THE CENTRAL SYSTEM
OF DOMINATION",

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
SHE WRITES "WE CAN, SAY,
THINK OF ETHNIC GROUPS,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
SEXUAL MINORITIES AND
EVEN WHOLE COUNTRIES

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
AS THE FEMININE".

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
ELTIT WAS A FOUNDER OF THE
GROUP THAT CALLED ITSELF

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
CADA, THE COLECTIVO
DE ACCIONES DE ARTE

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000
OR COLLECTIVE OF
ARTISTIC ACTIONS.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
THE GROUP'S AIM WAS TO
PRACTICE TOTAL SOCIAL

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
COMMITMENT, BRINGING
TOGETHER THE DISPARATE

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
ELEMENTS OF ART,
LIFE AND POLITICS.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
IN 1981, CADA SHOWERED
THE CITY OF SANTIAGO

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000
WITH PAMPHLETS THROWN
FROM AN AIRPLANE.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
THE PAMPHLETS DECLARED
THAT, "THE WORK OF

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
IMPROVING THE ACCEPTED
STANDARD OF LIVING

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
IS THE ONLY
VALID ART FORM".

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
ELTIT WROTE BOTH UNDER THE
PINOCHET DICTATORSHIP

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
AND DURING THE PERIOD
OF REDEMOCRATIZATION.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.000
ONE OF HER MOST SUGGESTIVE
NOVELS IS THE FOURTH WORLD.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
I WAS INVADED
THAT MORNING

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
BY AN INSANE
AND CHAOTIC MOOD.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
THE INTERFERENCE
WITHIN MY SPACE

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
BECAME UNBEARABLE
TO ME, BUT I HAD TO

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000
MAKE PEACE WITH
THE UNBEARABLE FACT.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
AT FIRST IT WAS
RELATIVELY PLACID,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
IN SPITE OF THE VAGUE
SICKNESS THAT SURROUNDED ME

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
AND THAT I NEVER
MANAGED TO SURPASS.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000
WE WERE JUST LARVAE
TAKEN BY WATERS,

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
HANDLED BY TWO CORDS
THAT WERE ABLE TO

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
KEEP US IN ALMOST
INDEPENDENT SPACES.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
LATIN AMERICA CAME ROARING
OUT OF THE 1960'S -

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
ITS CULTURAL OUTPUT
WAS IN ASCENDANCY,

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000
AND POLITICALLY
AND ECONOMICALLY

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
THE REGION WAS POISED
TO FINALLY TAKE

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE
ON THE WORLD STAGE.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.000
THE "BOOM" WAS NOT JUST
A LITERARY PHENOMENON -

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
IT WAS AN EXPRESSION OF
COLLECTIVE CONFIDENCE

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
AND OPTIMISM.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
FINALLY, ITS
TIME HAD COME.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
HOWEVER, THE DECADES
THAT FOLLOWED

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
DID NOT GO
AS PLANNED.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000
DICTATORS FLOURISHED,
ECONOMIES STRUGGLED,

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
AND THE ATTENTION OF
THE WORLD'S READERSHIP

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000
GRADUALLY DRIFTED
ELSEWHERE.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
CONFIDENCE TURNED INTO
ANXIETY AND OFTEN DESPAIR.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000
MASS MEDIA AROSE,
GENERATING A CONFUSING

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
KALEIDOSCOPE OF
VIEWPOINTS AND IMAGES.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
YET THIS PERIOD
OF UNCERTAINTY

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
AND ANGUISH WAS,
IRONICALLY,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
WILDLY PRODUCTIVE FOR
LATIN AMERICAN WRITERS.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
AS THEIR SENSIBILITIES
MATURED, AUTHORS DOVE INTO

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
THE TENSIONS OF THEIR
TIMES, REDEFINING THE

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
POLITICAL DEBATES AND
OFFERING THEMSELVES

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
IN SERVICE OF
REVOLUTIONARY PROJECTS.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
AND, AS NEVER BEFORE,
THE RANKS OF POETS,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000
NOVELISTS, AND ESSAYISTS
INCORPORATED NUMEROUS

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
AND DIVERSE
POPULAR VOICES.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
AS DEATH, EXILE,
AND IMPOSED SILENCE

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
HAVE GIVEN WAY TO AN
UNEASY STATUS QUO,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
THE WRITERS OF
LATIN AMERICA

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
HAVE BLAZED A NEW
PATH TO THE FUTURE,

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
CONFIDENT IN THEIR
ABILITY TO REFLECT

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
AND REFORM THEIR
CULTURAL HARVEST.
