00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.130


2
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.730
Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand

3
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.170
Within the arras: when I strike my foot

4
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.100
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,

5
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.000
And bind the boy which you shall find with me

6
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.530
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.

7
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.030
I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.230
Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.

9
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.400
Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.

10
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.600
Good morrow, Hubert.

11
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.530
Good morrow, little prince.

12
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.270
As little prince, having so great a title

13
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.130
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.

14
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.730
Indeed, I have been merrier.

15
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.970
Mercy on me!

16
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.670
Methinks no body should be sad but I:

17
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.700
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,

18
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.470
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,

19
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.670
Only for wantonness.

20
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.300
If I talk to him, with his innocent prate

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.630
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:

22
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.300
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.

23
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.130
Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:

24
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.900
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,

25
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.230
That I might sit all night and watch with you:

26
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.670
I warrant I love you more than you do me.

27
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.930
His words do take possession of my bosom.

28
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.770
Read here, young Arthur.

29
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.970
How now, foolish rheum!

30
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.300
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!

31
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.700
I must be brief, lest resolution drop

32
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.070
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.

33
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.970
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?

34
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.470
Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:

35
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.870
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?

36
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.170
Young boy, I must.

37
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.900
And will you?

38
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.200
And I will.

39
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.700
Have you the heart?

40
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.230
I have sworn to do it;

41
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.130
And with hot irons must I burn them out.

42
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.970
An if an angel should have come to me

43
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.130
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,

44
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.570
I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.

45
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.530
Come forth.

46
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.200
Do as I bid you do.

47
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.730
O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out

48
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.970
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.

49
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.400
Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.

50
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.600
Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?

51
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.970
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.

52
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.270
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!

53
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.600
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,

54
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.430
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;

55
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.870
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,

56
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.900
Nor look upon the iron angerly:

57
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.430
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,

58
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.700
Whatever torment you do put me to.

59
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.430
Go, stand within; let me alone with him.

60
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.800
I am best pleased to be from such a deed.

61
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.900
Alas, I then have chid away my friend!

62
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.530
He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:

63
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.430
Let him come back, that his compassion may

64
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.000
Give life to yours.

65
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.570
Come, boy, prepare yourself.

66
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.670
Is there no remedy?

67
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.330
None, but to lose your eyes.

68
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.030
O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,

69
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.230
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,

70
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.130
Any annoyance in that precious sense!

71
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.430
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,

72
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.570
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.

73
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.070
Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.

74
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.530
Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues

75
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.000
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:

76
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.570
Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;

77
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.070
Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,

78
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.500
So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.

79
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.270
Though to no use but still to look on you!

80
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.300
Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold

81
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.800
And would not harm me.

82
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.970
I can heat it, boy.

83
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.770
No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,

84
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.970
Being create for comfort, to be used

85
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.470
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;

86
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.430
There is no malice in this burning coal;

87
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.330
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out

88
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.130
And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.

89
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.330
But with my breath I can revive it, boy.

90
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.500
An if you do, you will but make it blush

91
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.600
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:

92
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.530
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;

93
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.930
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,

94
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.830
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.

95
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.530
Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye

96
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.330
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:

97
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.070
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,

98
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.670
With this same very iron to burn them out.

99
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.570
O, now you look like Hubert! all this while

100
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.000
You were disguised.

101
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.930
Peace; no more. Adieu.

102
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.970
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;

103
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.070
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:

104
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.500
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,

105
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.630
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,

106
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.730
Will not offend thee.

107
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.470
O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.

108
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.570
Silence; no more: go closely in with me:

109
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.800
Much danger do I undergo for thee.

110
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.830
(♪ horns play for scene break)

111
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.570
Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,

112
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.630
And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.

113
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.930
This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,

114
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.000
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,

115
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.230
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,

116
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.970
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;

117
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.370
Fresh expectation troubled not the land

118
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.930
With any long'd-for change or better state.

119
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.100
Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,

120
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.530
To guard a title that was rich before,

121
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.630
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,

122
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.030
To throw a perfume on the violet,

123
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.270
To smooth the ice, or add another hue

124
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.300
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light

125
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.530
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,

126
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.470
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.

127
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.170
But that your royal pleasure must be done,

128
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.230
This act is as an ancient tale new told,

129
00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.930
And in the last repeating troublesome,

130
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.930
Being urged at a time unseasonable.

131
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.170
In this the antique and well noted face

132
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.530
Of plain old form is much disfigured;

133
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:09.230
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,

134
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.500
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,

135
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.570
Startles and frights consideration,

136
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.400
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,

137
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.170
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.

138
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.700
When workmen strive to do better than well,

139
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.670
They do confound their skill in covetousness;

140
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.230
And oftentimes excusing of a fault

141
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.330
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,

142
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.000
As patches set upon a little breach

143
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.230
Discredit more in hiding of the fault

144
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.870
Than did the fault itself before it was so patch'd.

145
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.830
To this effect, before you were new crown'd,

146
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.330
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness

147
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.070
To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,

148
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.530
Since all and every part of what we would

149
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.300
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.

150
00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.430
Some reasons of this double coronation

151
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.670
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;

152
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.230
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,

153
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:09.170
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask

154
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.870
What you would have reform'd that is not well,

155
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.130
And well shall you perceive how willingly

156
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.230
I will both hear and grant you your requests.

157
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.430
Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,

158
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.100
To sound the purpose of all their hearts,

159
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.630
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,

160
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.270
Your safety, for the which myself and them

161
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:39.170
Bend their best studies, heartily request

162
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:45.930
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint

163
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.600
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent

164
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.370
To break into this dangerous argument,--

165
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:58.030
If what in rest you have in right you hold,

166
00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.970
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend

167
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:04.430
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up

168
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.030
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days

169
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.570
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth

170
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.430
The rich advantage of good exercise?

171
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.330
That the time's enemies may not have this

172
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.230
To grace occasions, let it be our suit

173
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.430
That you have bid us ask his liberty;

174
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.870
Which for our goods we do no further ask

175
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.130
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,

176
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.530
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.

177
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.630
Let it be so: I do commit his youth

178
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.670
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?

179
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.900
This is the man should do the bloody deed;

180
00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.230
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:

181
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.370
The image of a wicked heinous fault

182
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.400
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his

183
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.530
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;

184
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:13.970
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,

185
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.730
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.

186
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.270
The colour of the king doth come and go

187
00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.770
Between his purpose and his conscience,

188
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.200
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:

189
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.000
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.

190
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.500
And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence

191
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.770
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.

192
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.330
We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:

193
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.130
Good lords, although my will to give is living,

194
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.100
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:

195
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.900
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.

196
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.530
Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.

197
00:10:56.530 --> 00:11:00.630
Indeed we heard how near his death he was

198
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.800
Before the child himself felt he was sick:

199
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:08.970
This must be answer'd either here or hence.

200
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.070
Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?

201
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:29.770
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?

202
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.930
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?

203
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.700
It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame

204
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.470
That greatness should so grossly offer it:

205
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.370
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.

206
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.370
Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,

207
00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.370
And find the inheritance of this poor child,

208
00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:02.400
His little kingdom of a forced grave.

209
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.430
That blood which owed the breadth of all this land,

210
00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:12.300
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!

211
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:19.100
This must not be thus borne: this will break out

212
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.930
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.

213
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.400
They burn in indignation. I repent:

214
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.030
There is no sure foundation set on blood,

215
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.830
No certain life achieved by others' death.

216
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:48.830
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood

217
00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.930
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?

218
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.400
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:

219
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.430
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?

220
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.030
From France to England. Never such a power

221
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.070
For any foreign preparation

222
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.470
Was levied in the body of a land.

223
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.530
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;

224
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.830
For when you should be told they do prepare,

225
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.430
The tidings come that they are all arrived.

226
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.300
O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?

227
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.330
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,

228
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.100
That such an army could be drawn in France,

229
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.600
And she not hear of it?

230
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.100
My liege, her ear

231
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.770
Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died

232
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:37.070
Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,

233
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.530
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died

234
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.400
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue

235
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.470
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.

236
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.230
Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!

237
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.600
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased

238
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.730
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!

239
00:13:53.730 --> 00:14:00.800
How wildly then walks my estate in France!

240
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.030
Under whose conduct came those powers of

241
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.870
Thou for truth givest out are landed here?

242
00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.670
Under the Dauphin.

243
00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.700
Thou hast made me giddy

244
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.000
With these ill tidings.

245
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.130
Now, what says the world

246
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.700
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff

247
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.130
My head with more ill news, for it is full.

248
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.800
But if you be afeard to hear the worst,

249
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.830
Then let the worst unheard fall on your head.

250
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:27.870
Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed

251
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.970
Under the tide: but now I breathe again

252
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.200
Aloft the flood, and can give audience

253
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.970
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.

254
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:37.500
How I have sped among the clergymen,

255
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.670
The sums I have collected shall express.

256
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.930
But as I travell'd hither through the land,

257
00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:44.800
I find the people strangely fantasied;

258
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.900
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,

259
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.870
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:

260
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.000
And here a prophet, that I brought with me

261
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.470
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found

262
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.130
With many hundreds treading on his heels;

263
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:59.330
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,

264
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.730
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,

265
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.030
Your highness should deliver up your crown.

266
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.730
Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?

267
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.530
Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.

268
00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:24.170
Hubert, away with him; imprison him;

269
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.030
And on that day at noon whereon he says

270
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:29.630
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.

271
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.700
Deliver him to safety; and return,

272
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.970
For I must use thee.

273
00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.670
O my gentle cousin,

274
00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.470
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?

275
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.570
The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:

276
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.000
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,

277
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.030
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,

278
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.300
And others more, going to seek the grave

279
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.670
Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night

280
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:56.830
On your suggestion.

281
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.170
Gentle kinsman, go,

282
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:01.770
And thrust thyself into their companies:

283
00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.200
I have a way to win their loves again;

284
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.000
Bring them before me.

285
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:11.530
I will seek them out.

286
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.170
Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.

287
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.530
O, let me have no subject enemies,

288
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.730
When adverse foreigners affright my towns

289
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.870
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!

290
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:26.600
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,

291
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.570
And fly like thought from them to me again.

292
00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.500
The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.

293
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.800
Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.

294
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.270
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need

295
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.800
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;

296
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.070
And be thou he.

297
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:41.630
With all my heart, my liege.

298
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.930
My mother dead!

299
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:49.800
My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;

300
00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.570
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about

301
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.230
The other four in wondrous motion.

302
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:55.900
Five moons!

303
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.600
Old men and beldams in the streets

304
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.130
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:

305
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.870
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:

306
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.470
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads

307
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.630
And whisper one another in the ear;

308
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.630
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,

309
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.200
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,

310
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.970
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.

311
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.300
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,

312
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.100
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,

313
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.800
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;

314
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.230
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,

315
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.830
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste

316
00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.470
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,

317
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.770
Told of a many thousand warlike French

318
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.700
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:

319
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.730
Another lean unwash'd artificer

320
00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:42.630
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.

321
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:50.700
Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?

322
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.530
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?

323
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:56.770
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause

324
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.330
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.

325
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:01.730
No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?

326
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.430
It is the curse of kings to be attended

327
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.600
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant

328
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.100
To break within the bloody house of life,

329
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.070
And on the winking of authority

330
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.430
To understand a law, to know the meaning

331
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.670
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns

332
00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:20.770
More upon humour than advised respect.

333
00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:27.930
Here is your hand and seal for what I did.

334
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.130
O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth

335
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.900
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal

336
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.570
Witness against us to damnation!

337
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:44.430
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds

338
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:48.630
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,

339
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:51.400
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,

340
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.730
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,

341
00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:58.630
This murder had not come into my mind:

342
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:02.300
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,

343
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.430
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,

344
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.670
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,

345
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:09.170
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;

346
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.400
And thou, to be endeared to a king,

347
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.070
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.

348
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.030
My lord--

349
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.770
Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause

350
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.370
When I spake darkly what I purposed,

351
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.500
As bid me tell my tale in express words,

352
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.100
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,

353
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:31.130
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:

354
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.500
But thou didst understand me by my signs

355
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.900
And didst in signs again parley with sin;

356
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.670
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,

357
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.600
And consequently thy rude hand to act

358
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.170
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.

359
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.100
Out of my sight, and never see me more!

360
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.700
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,

361
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.730
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:

362
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.330
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,

363
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.700
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,

364
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.200
Hostility and civil tumult reigns

365
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:13.530
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.

366
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.900
Arm you against your other enemies,

367
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.600
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.

368
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.800
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine

369
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.470
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,

370
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.730
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.

371
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.570
Within this bosom never enter'd yet

372
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.830
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;

373
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.770
And you have slander'd nature in my form,

374
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.530
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,

375
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.870
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind

376
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:54.200
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.

377
00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:02.970
Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,

378
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.770
Throw this report on their incensed rage,

379
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:06.970
And make them tame to their obedience!

380
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.900
Forgive the comment that my anger made

381
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.500
Upon thy feature; for my passion was blind,

382
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:14.400
And foul imaginary eyes of blood

383
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.500
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.

384
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.430
O, answer not, but to my closet bring

385
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.930
The angry lords with all expedient haste.

386
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.870
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.

387
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:50.570
The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:

388
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.030
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!

389
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.530
There's few or none do know me: if they did,

390
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.130
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.

391
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.270
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.

392
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.230
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,

393
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.700
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:

394
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:19.100
As good to die and go, as die and stay.

395
00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:25.800
(♪ suspenseful music)

396
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:37.870
O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:

397
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:43.130
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!

398
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:08.470
Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:

399
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.670
It is our safety, and we must embrace

400
00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.670
This gentle offer of the perilous time.

401
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:16.230
Who brought that letter from the cardinal?

402
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.130
The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,

403
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.100
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love

404
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.600
Is much more general than these lines import.

405
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.100
To-morrow morning let us meet him then.

406
00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.670
Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be

407
00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:34.070
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.

408
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:40.270
Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!

409
00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:43.370
The king by me requests your presence straight.

410
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:48.170
The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:

411
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:49.970
We will not line his thin bestained cloak

412
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.430
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot

413
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:54.730
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.

414
00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.870
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.

415
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:02.130
Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.

416
00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:04.400
Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.

417
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.730
But there is little reason in your grief;

418
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.530
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.

419
00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:10.500
Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.

420
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:12.570
'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.

421
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:20.800
This is the prison. What is he lies here?

422
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:39.000
O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!

423
00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:46.800
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.

424
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.530
Murder, as hating what himself hath done,

425
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.030
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.

426
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:58.430
Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,

427
00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:02.870
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.

428
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:07.100
Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,

429
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.400
Or have you read or heard? or could you think?

430
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.300
Or do you almost think, although you see,

431
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.930
That you do see? could thought, without this object,

432
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.770
Form such another? This is the very top,

433
00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:24.630
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,

434
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.400
Of murder's arms: this is the wildest savagery,

435
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.530
the vilest stroke,

436
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.200
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage

437
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:37.070
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.

438
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:43.330
All murders past do stand excused in this:

439
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.000
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,

440
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.030
Shall give a holiness, a purity,

441
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.430
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;

442
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:58.730
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,

443
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:03.970
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.

444
00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:09.330
It is a damned and a bloody work;

445
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.970
The graceless action of a heavy hand,

446
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:16.530
If that it be the work of any hand.

447
00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.670
If that it be the work of any hand!

448
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.530
We had a kind of light what would ensue:

449
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.000
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;

450
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.630
The practise and the purpose of the king:

451
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.630
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,

452
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.430
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,

453
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:40.600
And breathing to his breathless excellence

454
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.500
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,

455
00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.270
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,

456
00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:48.400
Never to be infected with delight,

457
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.470
Nor conversant with ease or idleness,

458
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:53.970
Till I have set a glory to this hand,

459
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:58.030
By giving it the worship of revenge.

460
00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.370
Our souls religiously confirm thy words.

461
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:07.170
Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:

462
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.930
Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.

463
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.970
O, he is bold and blushes not at death.

464
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:18.330
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!

465
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.630
I am no villain.

466
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.730
Must I rob the law?

467
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.730
Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.

468
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.830
Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.

469
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.600
Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;

470
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.100
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:

471
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.270
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,

472
00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.330
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;

473
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.230
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget

474
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.670
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.

475
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:53.800
Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?

476
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.600
Not for my life: but yet I dare defend

477
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.900
My innocent life against an emperor.

478
00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.230
Thou art a murderer.

479
00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.800
Do not prove me so;

480
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.930
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,

481
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:09.900
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.

482
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.300
Cut him to pieces.

483
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.700
Keep the peace, I say.

484
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.000
Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.

485
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.800
Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:

486
00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.200
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,

487
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.530
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,

488
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:28.800
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;

489
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.400
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,

490
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.100
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.

491
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.800
What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?

492
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.500
Second a villain and a murderer?

493
00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.500
Lord Bigot, I am none.

494
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.570
Who kill'd this prince?

495
00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:09.200
'Tis not an hour since I left him well:

496
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:16.530
I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep

497
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:22.670
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.

498
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.700
Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,

499
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.200
For villany is not without such rheum;

500
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.500
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem

501
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.330
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.

502
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.100
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor

503
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.170
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;

504
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:47.870
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.

505
00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:53.630
Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!

506
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.030
There tell the king he may inquire us out.

507
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:27.770
Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?

508
00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:29.530
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach

509
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:31.870
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,

510
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.930
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.

511
00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:33.870
Do but hear me, sir.

512
00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.530
Ha! I'll tell thee what;

513
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:41.800
Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;

514
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.800
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:

515
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.270
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell

516
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.030
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.

517
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:50.030
Upon my soul--

518
00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.730
If thou didst but consent

519
00:30:52.730 --> 00:31:01.930
To this most cruel act, do but despair;

520
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.070
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread

521
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:05.770
That ever spider twisted from her womb

522
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.030
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam

523
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.930
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,

524
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:13.200
Put but a little water in a spoon,

525
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.570
And it shall be as all the ocean,

526
00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:19.630
Enough to stifle such a villain up.

527
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:23.370
I do suspect thee very grievously.

528
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:30.700
If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,

529
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.670
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath

530
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:38.470
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,

531
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.700
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.

532
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.700
I left him well.

533
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:53.100
Go, bear him in thine arms.

534
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.870
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way

535
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.900
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.

536
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.570
How easy dost thou take all England up!

537
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:08.830
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,

538
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:11.500
The life, the right and truth of all this realm

539
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.570
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left

540
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.900
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth

541
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:21.830
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.

542
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.370
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty

543
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.300
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest

544
00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.100
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:

545
00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.100
Now powers from home and discontents at home

546
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.670
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,

547
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.570
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,

548
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:42.130
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.

549
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:43.500
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can

550
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.500
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child

551
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.000
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:

552
00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.730
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,

553
00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.170
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.

554
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.630
