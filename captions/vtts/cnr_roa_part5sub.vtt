WEBVTT

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.930
Narrator:
We've long known that

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.366
what happens to us in childhood

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.427
can leave a lasting imprint
on the adults we become.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.671
The places we live.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:44.639
The people we know.

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.146
The best of times...

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.518
and the worst.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:58.485
They all somehow
become part of us.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.663
Now, a new science is telling us

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:06.826
that our experiences go even
deeper than we thought.

00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:11.571
It happens on the genetic level.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.407
Experiences,
scientists have learned,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:18.078
can leave chemical marks
on our DNA.

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:21.848
Those marks can switch
genes on or off,

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:25.910
changing the way our bodies
and our brains function.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.490
The changes can prime us
to thrive,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.293
or they can impede development

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.830
affecting health
and well-being for life.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.819
Woman:
We're talking about

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.867
processes here that
are at a biological level.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:45.134
It just gets under the skin
in a variety of ways.

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.974
Narrator:
These chemical tags are set

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:52.378
in place during critical periods
of biological change.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:53.680
Woman:
There's these special

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.883
vulnerabilities in utero,
during pregnancy,

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:00.376
in infancy, in early childhood.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.288
Narrator:
Everything in

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:06.593
an infant's experience
can help or hinder-

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.288
diet...

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:11.429
environmental toxins...

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:14.734
housing, safety...

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:18.433
even the parents' stress levels.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:21.875
These new discoveries

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.145
have profound social
and political implications.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:29.382
Because if social influences can
alter the way our genes work,

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:30.884
then early environments

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:34.547
can result in biological
obstacles to success.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.793
Woman:
The poorest kids in our society,

00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.696
not surprisingly, are
the most vulnerable

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:46.966
to just about every health
outcome we can measure.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:50.370
These are fairly healthy young
children who, with time,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.572
are going to suffer
the consequences

00:02:52.572 --> 00:02:54.631
of their social class.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.277
Narrator:
New evidence shows

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.379
that social
and economic stressors

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.081
can affect children in infancy,

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.784
causing changes
in gene expression,

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.344
changes that may last
a lifetime.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.088
Woman:
It affects

00:03:09.088 --> 00:03:10.089
their way of thinking,

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.691
it affects their views
of themselves,

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.352
it affects their social
relationships.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.095
Narrator:
But along with

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:17.427
a new understanding

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.733
of how early experience
influences development,

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.134
this science brings hope.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:28.174
Improved social conditions,
the evidence shows,

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:31.344
can actually provide
the biological foundation

00:03:31.344 --> 00:03:35.338
for lives that are healthier,
and more likely to thrive.

00:03:37.984 --> 00:03:39.952
Woman:
The science is clear about this.

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:44.390
What we need is for the policy
to follow the science

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.950
and get us to more protective
environments for children.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.509
Narrator:
Some of the first clues

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.811
that our lived
experience could alter

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.613
the way our genes work

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.815
came from a set of experiments

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.618
involving some genetically
identical mice,

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:48.144
that somehow weren't identical.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:51.891
Dolinoy:
The brown pseudo Agouti mouse

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:54.093
weighs around 27 grams.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:58.155
Here is the yellow mouse
that weighs around 52 grams.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.002
Narrator:
How could it be that some mice

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:07.407
are brown and thin,
others yellow and obese,

00:05:07.407 --> 00:05:10.865
when they all share
the exact same DNA?

00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:15.982
It's what their mothers were fed
while they were pregnant.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:19.185
Some were fed pellets
rich in methyl groups,

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:23.489
a molecule commonly found
in fruits and vegetables.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:28.394
Those mice were more likely to
give birth to brown skinny pups.

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:31.698
But mothers fed a diet
with fewer methyl groups

00:05:31.698 --> 00:05:34.100
were more likely
to give birth to pups

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.863
that were yellow and obese.

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.305
Whoops! Tipped the scale.

00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:40.206
Narrator:
These studies

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:42.809
were first conducted
at Duke University

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.011
under biologist Randy Jirtle.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.980
Jirtle's team,
including Dana Dolinoy,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.748
zeroed in on one particular gene
in search of an explanation.

00:05:55.488 --> 00:05:59.092
The Agouti gene codes
for yellow fur.

00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:02.425
Curiously, it's also related
to obesity.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.399
Jirtle's team found
that the methyl groups

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.101
fed to the pregnant mothers

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.470
passed through to
the developing pups

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.564
and attached to
their Agouti genes.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:17.110
It's a process called
methyl ati on.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.312
Dolinoy:
DNA methylation is the addition

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.414
of a single carbon
in the form of a methyl group.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:23.282
So this is a carbon
and three hydrogens

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:26.218
that sits down on DNA
and shuts genes off.

00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:34.794
Narrator:
With the gene on, or active,

00:06:34.794 --> 00:06:39.959
more mice were born
yellow and grew obese.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.602
With the gene silenced,

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:46.163
more mice were born
brown and remained thin.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:51.967
Same genes,
very different results.

00:06:55.014 --> 00:06:57.244
The difference is whether
particular genes

00:06:57.316 --> 00:07:01.845
are switched on or off,
expressed or silenced.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.458
The genes we inherit
are fixed for life.

00:07:08.995 --> 00:07:11.697
But there's an entire
network of molecules

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:14.394
that influences which
genes are expressed

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:18.062
by making them active,
or shutting them down,

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:21.107
like a volume control
or a dimmer switch.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:24.210
It's called the epigenome.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.611
Well, literally it just means

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.375
"in addition to,"
or "above" the genome.

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:31.643
Narrator:
The epigenome.

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:33.986
It's a system
of molecular switches

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.989
that interacts with our genes.

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:38.591
Scientists are only
just beginning

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.253
to understand
how it functions.

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:48.601
Some epigenome molecules
sit literally on top of genes,

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:51.404
fixed like barnacles
on the hull of a ship,

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:54.669
working to switch
genes on or off.

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:57.710
When we talk about epigenetics,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.813
we're talking a collection
of biochemical signals

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:04.884
that control the way in
which the genome operates.

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:07.186
We each have our own
genetic make-up.

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:10.556
That's fixed from the time
we're conceived forever.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:13.549
What changes though
is the activity of genes.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.697
Narrator:
The pattern of gene activity

00:08:17.697 --> 00:08:21.601
can be absolutely critical,
even producing differences

00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:23.865
in the form and
function of cells.

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:26.506
Meaney:
If you think about it,

00:08:26.506 --> 00:08:30.169
your body is made up of
over 200 different cell types.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.512
But they all have exactly
the same DNA.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.614
The same genes
are in your liver cell,

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:37.344
brain cell, your muscle cells.

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:39.485
So something has to happen

00:08:39.485 --> 00:08:42.288
to allow these cells
to become specialized

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:44.290
to do what they're supposed
to do in your body.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.952
And that's where epigenetics
comes in.

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.698
Narrator:
Epigenetic signals also turn on

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.400
and off some of the genes

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.104
that are constantly active
throughout our lives,

00:08:58.104 --> 00:09:04.810
like those involved in appetite,
disease-fighting, fear, focus,

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.474
elation, even love.

00:09:11.817 --> 00:09:12.985
n the mice,

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:16.489
the Agouti gene influences
not only fur color,

00:09:16.489 --> 00:09:19.592
but also body size and shape.

00:09:19.592 --> 00:09:23.696
Different epigenetic settings
result in different appetites,

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:26.566
metabolic rates,
and fat storage.

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:29.057
That accounts for the radically
different weights.

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:34.807
It's a revolution in thinking
about how genes work.

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:38.869
DNA, it turns out,
is not the master blueprint.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.214
So now you start thinking of DNA

00:09:42.214 --> 00:09:45.241
not just as an inevitable
bank of information,

00:09:45.318 --> 00:09:46.586
but you start thinking
of it as a molecule

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:50.590
like any other molecule,
that can be more or less active.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.192
Narrator:
If gene activity is so sensitive

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:55.394
to a naturally
occurring molecule,

00:09:55.394 --> 00:09:57.196
like a methyl group,

00:09:57.196 --> 00:10:00.600
could the synthetic substances
of our modern world

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.160
be affecting the genome as well?

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:06.939
In a follow-up experiment,

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:11.744
Dolinoy fed her pregnant
Bisphenol A, or BPA.

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:14.947
It's a chemical commonly
found in plastics,

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:19.185
and associated with adverse
health effects in humans.

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:22.188
This time, she found
less methylation,

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.523
more active Agouti genes

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:30.896
and more yellow obese pups
born to mice fed BPA.

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:33.799
And these pups had
a host of health problems.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.301
Dolinoy:
These epigenetic changes

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:38.464
were also correlated with
an increased risk of things

00:10:38.537 --> 00:10:40.406
like heart disease
and metabolic syndrome

00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:41.771
and obesity later in life.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.811
Narrator:
Then Dolinoy wanted to see

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.315
if she could protect the mice
from the effects of BPA.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.341
So she exposed pregnant
mice to both BPA

00:10:52.418 --> 00:10:55.388
and a diet rich
in methyl groups.

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:58.357
Again, the genome responded.

00:10:59.692 --> 00:11:03.151
The mice were born
brown and skinny.

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.266
This showed,
at least in a mouse model,

00:11:07.266 --> 00:11:09.101
that nutritional interventions

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:11.468
could counteract
the effects of toxicants.

00:11:13.406 --> 00:11:16.208
This also shows, at least
in this experiment,

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.310
that theepigenome
is quite plastic

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.939
and adaptable
during development.

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.425
Narrator:
The idea that the epigenome,

00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:34.527
and therefore gene expression,

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.263
could be modified
by environment

00:11:37.263 --> 00:11:40.099
was a radical finding.

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.300
But the Agouti mice

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.204
were studied under controlled
laboratory conditions.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:48.572
Human environments
are far more complex.

00:11:50.109 --> 00:11:54.774
A child's environment is
everything in his or her world.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:56.215
Woman:
Neighborhoods are

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.249
defining for them.

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:58.451
It's where they live.

00:11:58.451 --> 00:12:00.386
It's where they go
outside and play.

00:12:00.386 --> 00:12:03.289
It's where they see
their friends.

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:06.192
The amenities, the good things,
the local park,

00:12:06.192 --> 00:12:08.794
the sidewalks that you
can ride your bike on

00:12:08.794 --> 00:12:11.997
are really wonderful
things for children.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:15.434
The disamenities,
things like litter

00:12:15.434 --> 00:12:19.105
and abandoned vehicles
and overgrown lots and crime,

00:12:19.105 --> 00:12:22.768
those have an equally
important effect on children.

00:12:30.516 --> 00:12:31.347
Narrator:
It's not just

00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.185
the physical environment.

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:34.386
For a young child,

00:12:34.386 --> 00:12:39.154
the social and economic
environment is also key.

00:12:41.093 --> 00:12:42.925
Personal relationships...

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.656
exposure to stressors...

00:12:47.233 --> 00:12:49.802
feelings of safety
or insecurity...

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:51.668
(baby crying)

00:12:53.506 --> 00:12:56.771
all of these can get
under the skin.

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:04.016
An adverse social environment,
the science indicates,

00:13:04.016 --> 00:13:09.648
can change a baby's epigenome
just as toxic chemicals can.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.166
In the early 1990s

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:22.501
at McGill University
in Montreal,

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:25.704
neurobiologist Michael Meaney
set out to understand

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:27.973
how stressful conditions
in early life

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:31.307
could have effects
that last a lifetime.

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.212
Meany:
The first thing we wanted to do

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:35.014
is to look at
an environmental influence

00:13:35.014 --> 00:13:37.216
that we know
has a profound effect.

00:13:37.216 --> 00:13:38.684
So we looked at maternal care.

00:13:39.785 --> 00:13:41.053
Narrator:
Meaney and his team,

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:43.756
including then-doctoral
student Darlene Francis,

00:13:43.756 --> 00:13:45.691
observed that some adult rats

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:47.893
seemed to be more
skittish and fearful,

00:13:47.893 --> 00:13:50.496
more stressed, than others.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:51.497
(thump)

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.032
They went looking for factors

00:13:53.032 --> 00:13:55.034
in the rats' early
social environment

00:13:55.034 --> 00:13:57.102
that might be a clue
to the difference.

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:59.405
Francis:
We observed hundreds of litters,

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:01.507
hundreds of different
types of behaviors.

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:03.909
And then when you put
all of the data together,

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:07.179
the most powerful
predictor of stress profiles

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:09.248
in those babies growing up

00:14:09.248 --> 00:14:11.517
was the amount
of licking and grooming

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.848
they had received
from their mothers.

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.391
Narrator:
Rat mothers typically lick

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:20.893
and groom their pups.

00:14:20.893 --> 00:14:23.596
But some do it more
than others.

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:25.965
And the difference between
high-licking mothers

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.666
and low-licking mothers

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:30.966
was reflected in their pups'
behavior as adults.

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:34.707
The team found that rat pups

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:36.508
that were licked
and groomed more

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:40.212
grew up to approach the
world with greater confidence.

00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.014
Francis:
So these animals we put them

00:14:42.014 --> 00:14:46.285
in a little bit scary,
big empty open tub.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:48.487
They explore
the outer perimeter,

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:50.089
they explore
the inner perimeter,

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:53.354
they're doing what rats do,
which is explore.

00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:59.158
Narrator:
Not so for the low-licked rats.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.001
Francis:
Animals that were raised

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:06.071
in low licking and grooming
environments, hug the walls,

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.774
they don't explore so much.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:12.611
They have significantly
impaired exploration profiles

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:13.812
or behaviors.

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:15.178
We don't want
to stress them out.

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:17.516
Narrator:
The low-licked pups

00:15:17.516 --> 00:15:18.617
grew up to be vigilant

00:15:18.617 --> 00:15:21.587
and hypersensitive to
noise or movement,

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:27.355
on constant alert for threats,
even when there were none.

00:15:30.396 --> 00:15:32.598
n both rats and humans,

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:36.502
the stress response evolved
to help us survive danger.

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:39.438
It begins with stress hormones
like Cortisol,

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:44.009
flooding the brain in response
to threats and challenges.

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:47.546
A cascade of changes puts
the body on red-alert,

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:52.985
and we're prepared to fight
or flee on a moment's notice.

00:15:52.985 --> 00:15:54.820
When the threat has passed,

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.557
specialized proteins called
glucocorticoid receptors

00:15:58.557 --> 00:16:01.727
bind with the Cortisol,
neutralizing it

00:16:01.727 --> 00:16:04.958
and shutting down
the stress response.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.467
But the low-licked rats
seemed unable to calm down.

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:15.107
Meaney's team
wanted to know why.

00:16:15.107 --> 00:16:17.943
So they looked at the regions
of the rats' brains

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:19.968
that process stress.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:22.014
Woman:
So we're looking at

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:26.246
rat brain sections, and we're
slicing hippocampus sections.

00:16:29.288 --> 00:16:30.789
Narrator:
When the team compared

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:33.726
glucocorticoid receptors
in the brains of high

00:16:33.726 --> 00:16:37.396
and low-licking rats,
they had an answer.

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:39.164
Francis:
The red represents expression

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:41.567
of the glucocorticoid
receptor message.

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:43.402
You can see with
the naked eye,

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:47.206
significantly less expression
of the glucocorticoid receptor

00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.907
in offspring raised
in low-licking

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.209
and grooming environments.

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:54.613
And that's crucial
for dampening down

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:56.479
further activation
of the stress response.

00:16:58.817 --> 00:17:01.587
Narrator:
Despite being genetically identical,

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:03.889
the pups that
had been licked less

00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:07.860
had fewer glucocorticoid
receptors.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.862
With fewer receptors,

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.898
their stress response
remained high.

00:17:12.898 --> 00:17:16.664
These rats stay on a fight
or flight hair trigger.

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:20.806
Meaney turned to a second
research group

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:25.471
to study the genes responsible
for producing these receptors.

00:17:26.512 --> 00:17:28.113
n the low-licked rats,

00:17:28.113 --> 00:17:32.151
they found that methyl groups
had attached to many genes,

00:17:32.151 --> 00:17:33.285
covering them up

00:17:33.285 --> 00:17:36.388
and preventing them
from doing their work.

00:17:36.388 --> 00:17:39.992
The genes themselves
hadn't changed.

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:42.227
But with methyl groups
in place,

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:46.031
the genes can't produce as
many glucocorticoid receptors

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:49.558
and the result
is ongoing stress.

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:53.605
This enduring physical change

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.707
in the brain structure
of the rats

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:58.710
was brought about
by purely social factors

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:03.315
in early life-
less licking and grooming.

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.651
Meaney and his colleagues
found that the changes

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:08.787
typically last for
the lifetime of the rats.

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:11.090
And they went far beyond
the hypervigilance

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.148
he initially observed.

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:14.693
Meaney:
You can see changes

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:18.097
in the actual metabolic
function of the animals.

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:20.065
For example, animals
that are licked more

00:18:20.065 --> 00:18:21.934
are less likely
to become obese.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:23.402
And we know that in part

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:25.404
that's because
of the way the brain

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.873
is then guiding
the endocrine systems

00:18:27.873 --> 00:18:29.541
that determine
metabolic health.

00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.210
So mother's licking

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.146
is actually shaping
an enormous array of traits

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:37.416
that are then
established in the pup

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:38.884
and carried into adulthood.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:42.020
Narrator:
Another group of researchers

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.523
wanted to know
why some rat mothers

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:47.458
might provide less care
than others.

00:18:49.495 --> 00:18:51.964
And it turned out that
a social condition

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:55.161
could influence
that difference as well.

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:58.804
Francis:
We're watching this mother

00:18:58.804 --> 00:19:00.305
do the best that she can.

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:03.108
Her stress hormone levels
are through the roof.

00:19:03.108 --> 00:19:04.977
Woman:
It's like trying to build a nest

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.444
in the middle of the desert.

00:19:06.578 --> 00:19:09.172
Not the most
hospitable place.

00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:12.684
Narrator:
Rat mothers like to build nests

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:15.387
for their pups
with soft materials.

00:19:15.387 --> 00:19:18.290
But these moms have
only been given hard,

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:21.894
scratchy, inferior
building supplies.

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:23.862
It's a demonstration
of an experiment

00:19:23.862 --> 00:19:26.198
first conducted by David Swett.

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:27.399
Francis:
They really devote

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:30.536
a lot of resources
to trying to build nests,

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:32.704
because we took their
nesting materials away,

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:34.104
horrible researchers
that we are.

00:19:36.408 --> 00:19:39.912
I think it's obvious that
she's trying really hard,

00:19:39.912 --> 00:19:41.213
and she's tried really hard

00:19:41.213 --> 00:19:44.979
to provide as much of a nest
as she can to her litter.

00:19:48.086 --> 00:19:49.087
Narrator:
The stressed mothers

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:52.591
spend as much time with
their pups as unstressed moms.

00:19:52.591 --> 00:19:55.356
But they lick and groom
far less.

00:19:57.396 --> 00:20:00.899
The strain of providing
shelter with few resources

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:05.604
impeded the rats' efforts
to care for their young.

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:06.805
Francis:
It wasn't a time issue,

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:08.807
but the quality of
what they were doing

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:11.777
and how they were interacting
with their pups was different,

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:14.213
and we were able
to identify that

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:18.081
that directly related to
measures of the stress response.

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:24.389
Narrator:
A stressful environment led

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:27.192
to a low-licking mother.

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:29.895
That low-licking mother
produced offspring

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:33.031
that had trouble turning
their stress response off.

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.600
And this triggered a cascade

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.660
of health
and behavioral effects.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:44.409
But laboratory rats
are one thing.

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:48.574
Would the same pattern
hold true for humans?

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:56.855
Many American families face
an increasing load of stressors.

00:20:56.855 --> 00:20:59.291
More demands
from their employers.

00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.194
Less job security.

00:21:02.194 --> 00:21:03.295
Less time.

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:05.897
Living paycheck to paycheck.

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:07.661
Anxiety about the future.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.471
Could these growing stressors
affect not only the parents,

00:21:12.471 --> 00:21:15.873
but their children as well?

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:30.789
In 1990, a team of researchers
at the University of Wisconsin

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.991
began to measure
the stress levels

00:21:32.991 --> 00:21:36.595
in working families that
were about to have children.

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.898
Some were well paid
and relatively comfortable,

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:42.301
others less so.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.102
But the strain of coping

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:47.105
with an increasingly
precarious middle class life

00:21:47.105 --> 00:21:50.409
was taking a toll on many.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:51.710
Woman:
They were stressed, you know,

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.247
economically, they were stressed
by having to work two jobs,

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:58.016
just on and on and on
with the stresses

00:21:58.016 --> 00:21:59.450
those families
were experiencing.

00:21:59.518 --> 00:22:00.285
So we turned to them

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:02.549
to looking at the long-term
development on the children.

00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:05.290
Narrator:
Might parental stress

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:08.851
alter the developmental paths
of their young children?

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:13.298
Essex and her team
followed the families

00:22:13.298 --> 00:22:15.701
for more than two decades,

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:20.238
charting stress levels,
behaviors, school performance,

00:22:20.238 --> 00:22:23.608
and other indicators
in the children.

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:27.045
Stress was measured both
by what the families reported

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:29.114
and by the level
of stress hormones

00:22:29.114 --> 00:22:31.276
in their blood and saliva.

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:36.288
The results were clear -

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:40.225
the higher a parent's stress
early in a child's life,

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:42.594
the more stressed
the children became

00:22:42.594 --> 00:22:46.656
and the more that showed up
in their behavior later in life.

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:48.567
Essex:
If you imagine a child

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.469
that you're looking at
in a kindergarten class,

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:54.139
it's that child that, you know,
is kind of anxious,

00:22:54.139 --> 00:22:56.007
isn't interacting
with kids very well,

00:22:56.007 --> 00:22:58.340
but is aggressive
and is impulsive.

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:00.612
Narrator:
As the kids grew,

00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:03.181
their stress levels
remained high,

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:05.946
even if their parents'
stress level had fallen.

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:08.487
n adolescence,

00:23:08.487 --> 00:23:13.792
their lives still reflected
their early life experience.

00:23:13.792 --> 00:23:14.593
Essex:
They have worse

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:15.594
peer relationships.

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:17.262
They have more problems
with their teachers.

00:23:17.262 --> 00:23:20.298
So that is all kind of part
of the package.

00:23:20.298 --> 00:23:22.701
I mean it has very
long-term consequences

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.202
that can go into adulthood.

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:27.866
I mean the development of
substance use, teen pregnancies.

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:35.914
Narrator:
How was it that

00:23:35.914 --> 00:23:38.383
the early experience
of their parents' stress

00:23:38.383 --> 00:23:41.649
had such a lasting impact
on the children?

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.758
The answer was hiding
in their epigenome.

00:23:52.697 --> 00:23:55.600
Essex had been
collecting cheek swabs

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.870
and saliva samples from
her subjects for many years

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.305
so she could test
for stress hormones.

00:24:02.607 --> 00:24:05.744
A leading molecular biologist
heard about her work

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:08.079
and realized
that those samples

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.682
also contained a
treasure trove of genetic

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:13.174
and epigenetic evidence.

00:24:15.587 --> 00:24:16.388
Man:
She had done

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:19.858
absolutely fascinating and
groundbreaking work.

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:22.994
And so we teamed up
and we got enough money

00:24:22.994 --> 00:24:27.299
to epigenetically profile
100 children in her cohort.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.400
What we found is that

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.270
in these sixteen-year-old
kids or adolescents,

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.540
their dimmer switch pattern
could be correlated

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.774
to the level of maternal
stress during infancy.

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:43.715
Narrator:
Koborhad discovered

00:24:43.715 --> 00:24:46.150
epigenetic patterns
in the teenagers

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:48.553
that corresponded
to the amount of stress

00:24:48.553 --> 00:24:52.854
their parents had experienced
15 years earlier.

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:57.662
This was a first -

00:24:57.662 --> 00:25:01.600
hard evidence that simply
living in a home full of stress

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.204
could modify the epigenome
of infants.

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:08.974
The second-hand stress
they experienced as infants

00:25:08.974 --> 00:25:13.070
had increased their risk for
long-term behavioral problems.

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:18.550
The struggles of working
families in America,

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:19.818
the study showed,

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:23.288
had exacted a price on
the lives of their children

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:26.519
through changed
epigenetic settings.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.967
It was an eerie replay of
the earlier study of rats.

00:25:35.967 --> 00:25:37.335
n both cases,

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:41.172
severe and consistent
maternal stress in infancy

00:25:41.172 --> 00:25:45.410
had resulted in persistent
epigenetic changes in offspring.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.747
And the children suffered the
same host of knock-on effects

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:51.011
as the rats.

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:53.485
Essex:
Over a lifetime

00:25:53.485 --> 00:25:55.921
it wears and tears
on your system.

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:58.657
You end up with association
with cardiovascular problems,

00:25:58.657 --> 00:26:00.992
with all kinds of psychiatric
problems, with obesity,

00:26:00.992 --> 00:26:04.861
and a wide range of health and
mental health kinds of problems.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:10.402
Narrator:
If the development

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:12.437
of the mostly
middle class children

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:15.168
of the Wisconsin study
can be altered...

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:18.710
what about the millions
of American children

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.975
further down the
socio-economic pyramid?

00:26:34.392 --> 00:26:36.895
In societies around the globe,

00:26:36.895 --> 00:26:39.364
researchers have found
a correlation

00:26:39.364 --> 00:26:43.101
between family wealth
and well-being.

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:47.105
The more affluent and high
status the families, on average,

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:50.442
the fewer adversities their
children are exposed to,

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:52.877
and the better their outcomes.

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:58.183
While many factors contribute
to this wealth-health gradient,

00:26:58.183 --> 00:27:00.885
the Wisconsin study
raises the question

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.988
of whether epigenetic changes

00:27:02.988 --> 00:27:05.724
might occur throughout
the population

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:07.692
on the same sliding scale

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:12.858
that connects wealth, power
and status to well-being.

00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:19.904
The idea is unproven
but provocative.

00:27:19.904 --> 00:27:22.607
Because if social
and economic adversities

00:27:22.607 --> 00:27:24.342
can alter theepigenome

00:27:24.342 --> 00:27:28.613
along a continuum
corresponding to social status,

00:27:28.613 --> 00:27:30.615
then addressing
social conditions

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:32.982
becomes not just
a moral question,

00:27:34.185 --> 00:27:38.054
but a necessity for the success
of our society.

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:44.162
Twenty-five percent
of U.S. children,

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:48.690
one out of every four,
are born into poverty.

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:51.836
They live with food
and housing insecurity

00:27:51.836 --> 00:27:54.906
and with safety concerns.

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:58.343
They are exposed not only to
more environmental hazards,

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:03.515
but more noise, more hardship,
more violence,

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:07.918
and more social stressors
than their wealthier peers.

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:09.921
And in the middle class,

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:13.925
so many families are
increasingly pressed for time,

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:18.263
for money,
and for resources.

00:28:18.263 --> 00:28:22.333
Could the epigenomes
of these children be modified

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.903
by their social and
economic conditions

00:28:24.903 --> 00:28:28.306
just as those of the Wisconsin
children were?

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:31.142
Are they too being
biologically primed

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:33.475
for more difficulties in life?

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:40.107
And if they are,
what can be done?

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.503
Humans are resilient organisms

00:28:58.503 --> 00:29:02.407
and studies show that
negative epigenetic effects

00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:05.610
need not be permanent.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.312
Dolinoy:
Unlike a genetic mutation,

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:09.371
which we can do
nothing about,

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:11.449
an epigenetic change

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:13.577
we may be able to
do something about.

00:29:15.386 --> 00:29:16.688
Narrator:
When Dana Dolinoy

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:20.492
fed her pregnant yellow
obese mice an enriched diet,

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:24.596
they gave birth to healthy,
brown slender pups.

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:28.066
The right environment
was able to reverse the effects

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:31.365
of a chemically induced
epigenetic change.

00:29:33.605 --> 00:29:36.174
And Michael Meaney
was able to reverse

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:40.076
the epigenetic effects of his
nervous, low-licked rat pups.

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:42.514
Meaney:
At the time of weaning,

00:29:42.514 --> 00:29:44.949
we put them into
enriched circumstances

00:29:44.949 --> 00:29:47.252
similar to a daycare
environment.

00:29:47.252 --> 00:29:49.988
And we then studied
these animals in adulthood

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:50.889
and when we looked,

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:55.349
we found that in fact, there was
a huge effect of enrichment.

00:29:56.995 --> 00:29:58.396
Narrator:
The low-licked rats

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:01.766
in this study behaved more
like high-licked rats,

00:30:01.766 --> 00:30:03.802
exploring their surroundings

00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:07.071
with more assurance
and less fear.

00:30:07.071 --> 00:30:09.440
The enriched environment

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.177
induced new changes
to the epigenome,

00:30:12.177 --> 00:30:13.611
which overcame the effects

00:30:13.611 --> 00:30:16.706
of their early epigenetic
programming.

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:21.352
The research led to a key
new understanding

00:30:21.352 --> 00:30:23.855
of how the genome works.

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:25.857
While genes never change,

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:29.027
the epigenome can,
at key points in life,

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:31.262
be remarkably plastic,

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:33.765
adapting to individual
experiences

00:30:33.765 --> 00:30:36.257
and changing social conditions.

00:30:51.616 --> 00:30:55.787
Epigenetic changes have been
linked to adverse environments

00:30:55.787 --> 00:30:58.957
associated with
a host of ill effects -

00:30:58.957 --> 00:31:00.720
anxiety...

00:31:01.492 --> 00:31:03.154
depression...

00:31:05.496 --> 00:31:07.294
poor learning...

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:10.859
obesity and even cancers.

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:14.538
They can change
the course of a child's life.

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:20.411
a growing number
of scientists,

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:23.779
the implications
of these findings are clear.

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:26.584
Miranda:
At some point or another

00:31:26.584 --> 00:31:28.586
we need to decide
as a country

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:31.189
that we will not tolerate one
out of five children

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:32.590
growing up in poverty.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.659
That we have to invest
in our children.

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:37.195
We do have
the responsibility

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:39.186
to try to mitigate
against these effects.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:41.599
I think it means strengthening
our schools.

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:44.335
I think it means
universal pre-K.

00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:46.137
We have got to do something

00:31:46.137 --> 00:31:49.596
to create more protective
environments for our children.

00:31:53.811 --> 00:31:55.380
Narrator:
The evidence from Wisconsin

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:58.616
and other studies suggests
that children do better

00:31:58.616 --> 00:32:01.449
when their families
and communities do better.

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:09.460
Assuring all children safe,
stable and nurturing conditions

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.530
could leave a profound
biological imprint,

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:14.766
increasing their chances
for better mental

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:16.301
and physical health

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:19.668
and for more resilient
and successful lives.

00:32:20.905 --> 00:32:22.407
Meaney:
We know, for example,

00:32:22.407 --> 00:32:23.738
that when populations move

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:25.643
into more favorable
circumstances,

00:32:25.643 --> 00:32:28.313
when populations are freed
somewhat from oppression,

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:30.975
politically and socially,
that they become healthier.

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:37.488
Narrator:
The question

00:32:37.488 --> 00:32:39.657
for the United States is -

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:41.893
how can we create
environments

00:32:41.893 --> 00:32:44.662
that enrich the lives
of all young children,

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:48.599
and their families, allowing
them the opportunity

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:52.161
to realize their full
human potential?

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:56.441
Miranda:
Our obligation in this situation

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:58.443
is to be optimistic,

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:01.913
to say the science is helping us
to understand this better.

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:04.415
The science is giving us
more opportunities

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:06.250
for creative interventions

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.586
that can lead to better
outcomes for children,

00:33:08.586 --> 00:33:10.488
and you just have to keep
working at it,

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:12.190
and working at it,
and working at it

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:14.359
and trying to be optimistic

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:16.554
that we can change outcomes
for children.

00:33:24.902 --> 00:33:25.803
Meany:
There are going

00:33:25.803 --> 00:33:26.566
to be constraints.

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:30.508
But in large measure,

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:34.612
we can engineer environments
that make individuals healthier,

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:37.673
happier, more prosperous
and more productive.

00:33:39.917 --> 00:36:25.708
And there's a very
real biology to that.
