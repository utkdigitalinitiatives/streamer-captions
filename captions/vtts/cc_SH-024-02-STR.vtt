00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800


2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.230


3
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.500
Whither wander you?

4
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.130
Over hill, over dale, thoroughbush, thorough brier,

5
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.700
over park, over pale, thoroughflood, thorough fire,

6
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.800
I do wander everywhere swifterthan the moon's sphere.

7
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.270
And I serve the fairy queen, todew her orbs upon the green.

8
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.370
The cowslips tall her pensionersbe.

9
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.300
In their gold coats spots yousee.

10
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.630
Those be rubies, fairy favours.

11
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.570
In those freckles live theirsavours.

12
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.130
I must go seek some dewdropshere

13
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.270
and hang a pearl in everycowslip's ear.

14
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.970
Farewell, thou lob of spirits.

15
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.170
I'll be gone.

16
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.500
Our queen and all her elves comehere anon.

17
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.570
The king doth keep his revelshere to-night.

18
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.330
Take heed the queen come notwithin his sight,

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.930
for Oberon is passing fell andwrath,

20
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.100
because that she as herattendant

21
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.970
hath a lovely boy stolen from anIndian king.

22
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600
She never had so sweet achangeling.

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.500
And jealous Oberon would havethe child knight of his train

24
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.230
to trace the forests wild,

25
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.000
but she perforce withholds theloved boy,

26
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.130
crowns him with flowers andmakes him all her joy.

27
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.030
Either I mistake your shape andmaking quite,

28
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.300
or else you are that shrewd andknavish sprite

29
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.530
called Robin Goodfellow.

30
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.630
Thou speakest aright.

31
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.400
I am that merry wanderer of thenight.

32
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.700
I jest to Oberon and make himsmile

33
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
when I a fat and bean-fed horsebeguile,

34
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.100
neighing in likeness of a fillyfoal.

35
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.930
And sometimes lurk I in agossip's bowl,

36
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.230
in very likeness of a roastedcrab.

37
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.330
And when she drinks, against herlips I bob

38
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.730
and on her withered dewlap pourthe ale.

39
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.070
The wisest aunt, telling thesaddest tale,

40
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.800
sometime for three-foot stoolmistaketh me.

41
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470
Then slip I from her bum.

42
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.600
Down topples she.

43
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.930
But, room, fairy, here comesOberon.

44
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.470
Ill met by moonlight, proudTitania.

45
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.700
What?

46
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.970
Jealous Oberon.

47
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.630
Fairies, skip hence.

48
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.230
I have forsworn his bed andcompany.

49
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.670
Tarry, rash wanton.

50
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.500
Am not I thy lord?

51
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.170
Then I must be thy lady,

52
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.600
but I know when thou hast stolenaway from fairy land

53
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.300
and in the shape of Corin satall day playing on pipes of corn

54
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.930
and versing love to amorousPhillida.

55
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.600
Why art thou here, come from thefarthest steppe of India,

56
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.970
but that, forsooth, the bouncingAmazon,

57
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.100
your buskin'd mistress and yourwarrior love

58
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.770
to Theseus must be wedded,

59
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.930
and you come to give their bedjoy and prosperity.

60
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.970
How canst thou thus for shame,Titania,

61
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.400
glance at my credit withHippolyta,

62
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.070
knowing I know thy love toTheseus?

63
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.500
Didst thou not lead him throughthe glimmering night

64
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.430
from Perigenia, whom heravished?

65
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.800
And make him with fair Aeglebreak his faith,

66
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.100
with Ariadne and Antiopa?

67
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.300
These are the forgeries ofjealousy.

68
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.570
And never, since the middlesummer's spring,

69
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.870
met we on hill, in dale, forestor mead,

70
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.900
by paved fountain or by rushybrook,

71
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.630
or in the beached margent of thesea,

72
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.700
to dance our ringlets to thewhistling wind,

73
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.230
but with thy brawls thou hastdisturbed our sport.

74
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.730
Therefore, the wind, piping tous in vain as in revenge,

75
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.200
have sucked up from the seacontagious fogs,

76
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.570
which falling in the land,

77
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.730
have every pelting river made soproud

78
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.530
that they have overborne theircontinents.

79
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.930
The ox hath therefore stretchedhis yoke in vain,

80
00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.330
the ploughman lost his sweat,

81
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.630
and the green corn hath rottedere his youth attained a beard.

82
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.970
The fold stands empty in thedrowned field,

83
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.200
and crows are fatted with themurrion flock.

84
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.200
The nine men's morris is filledup with mud,

85
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.130
and the quaint mazes in thewanton green for lack of tread

86
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.570
are undistinguishable.

87
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.170
The human mortals want theirwinter cheer.

88
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.730
No night is now with hymn orcarol blessed.

89
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.700
Therefore, the moon, thegoverness of floods,

90
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.070
pale in her anger, washes allthe air

91
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.200
that rheumatic diseases doabound.

92
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.030
And thorough this distemperaturewe see the seasons alter,

93
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.100
hoary-headed frosts far in thefresh lap of the crimson rose,

94
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.070
and on old Hiems' thin and icycrown,

95
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.770
an odorous chaplet of sweetsummer buds

96
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.800
is, as in mockery, set.

97
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.930
The spring, the summer, thechilding autumn,

98
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.370
angry winter, change theirwonted liveries,

99
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.230
and the mazed world, by theirincrease,

100
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.300
knows not now which is which.

101
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.000
And this same progeny of evilscomes from our debate,

102
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.100
from our dissension.

103
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.730
We are their parents andoriginal.

104
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.030
Do you amend it then?

105
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.530
It lies in you.

106
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.870
Why should Titania cross herOberon?

107
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.430
I do but beg a little changelingboy to be my henchman.

108
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.970
Set your heart at rest.

109
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.300
The fairy land buys not thechild of me.

110
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.300
His mother was a votaress of myorder.

111
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.900
And, in the spiced Indian air bynight,

112
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.030
full often hath she gossiped bymy side

113
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.030
and sat with me on Neptune'syellow sands,

114
00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.270
marking the embarked traders onthe flood

115
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.170
where we have laughed to see thesails

116
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.230
conceive and grow big-belliedwith the wanton wind, which she,

117
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.070
with pretty and with swimminggait following--

118
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.600
her womb then rich with my youngsquire--

119
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.970
would imitate and sail upon theland

120
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.230
to fetch me trifles and returnagain as from a voyage,

121
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.130
rich with merchandise.

122
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.600
But she, being mortal, of thatboy did die.

123
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.630
And for her sake do I rear upher boy.

124
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.400
And for her sake, I will notpart with him.

125
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.430
Give me that boy.

126
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.430
Not for thy fairy kingdom.

127
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.230
Fairies, away.

128
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.870
We shall chide downright if Ilonger stay.

129
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.270
Well, go thy way.

130
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.530
Thou shalt not from this grovetill I torment thee for thisinjury.

131
00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:46.570
My gentle Puck, come hither.

132
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.330
Thou rememberest since once Isat upon a promontory

133
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.630
and heard a mermaid on adolphin's back

134
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.370
uttering such dulcet andharmonious breath

135
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.630
that the rude sea grew civil ather song

136
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.300
and certain stars shot madlyfrom their spheres

137
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.870
to hear the sea-maid's music.

138
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:01.970
I remember.

139
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.830
That very time I saw, but thoucouldst not,

140
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.170
flying between the cold moon andthe earth,

141
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.200
Cupid all armed.

142
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.100
A certain aim he took at a fairvestal throned by the west

143
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.730
and loosed his love-shaftsmartly from his bow

144
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.170
as it should pierce a hundredthousand hearts.

145
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.530
But I might see young Cupid'sfiery shaft

146
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.770
quenched in the chaste beams ofthe watery moon,

147
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:30.000
and the imperial votaress passedon, in maiden meditation,

148
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.330
fancy-free.

149
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.730
Yet marked I where the bolt ofCupid fell.

150
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:37.530
It fell upon a little westernflower,

151
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.130
before milk-white, now purplewith love's wound.

152
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.230
And maidens call itlove-in-idleness.

153
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.970
Fetch me that flower, the herb Ishewed thee once.

154
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.830
The juice of it on sleepingeyelids laid

155
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.570
will make all man or woman madlydote

156
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.500
upon the next live creature thatit sees.

157
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.670
Fetch me this herb, and be thouhere again

158
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:57.500
ere the leviathan can swim aleague.

159
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.370
I'll put a girdle round aboutthe earth in forty minutes.

160
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.570
Having once this juice,

161
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.270
I'll watch Titania when she isasleep

162
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.070
and drop the liquor of it in hereyes.

163
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:11.700
The next thing then she wakinglooks upon,

164
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.530
be it on lion, bear, or wolf, orbull,

165
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.130
on meddling monkey, or on busyape,

166
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.170
she shall pursue it with thesoul of love.

167
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.200
And ere I take this charm fromoff her sight,

168
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.000
as I can take it with anotherherb,

169
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.500
I'll make her render up her pageto me.

170
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.000
Who comes here?

171
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.470
I am invisible, and I willoverhear their conference.

172
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:38.070
Where is Lysander and fairHermia?

173
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.630
Thou toldest me they were stolenunto this wood.

174
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.130
Hence, get thee gone and followme no more.

175
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.530
Do I entice you?

176
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.330
Do I speak you fair?

177
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.170
Or rather, do I not, in plainesttruth,

178
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.000
tell you I do not, nor I cannot,love you?

179
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.200
And even for that do I love youthe more.

180
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.400
I am your spaniel.

181
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.870
And, Demetrius, the more youbeat me,

182
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:25.370
I will fawn on you.

183
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.300
Use me but as your spaniel;spurn me; strike me;

184
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.970
neglect me; lose me.

185
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:34.300
Only give me leave, unworthy asI am, to follow you.

186
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.370
What worser place can I beg inyour love--

187
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.630
and yet a place of high respectwith me--

188
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.770
than to be used as you use yourdog?

189
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.500
Tempt not too much the hatred ofmy spirit,

190
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.570
for I am sick when I do look onthee.

191
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.900
And I am sick when I look not onyou.

192
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.630
You do impeach your modesty toomuch

193
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.400
to leave the city and commityourself

194
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.270
into the hands of one that lovesyou not,

195
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.430
to trust the opportunity ofnight and the ill counsel of adesert place

196
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.270
with the rich worth of yourvirginity.

197
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.870
Your virtue is my privilege.

198
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.330
For that it is not night when Ido see your face.

199
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:09.200
Therefore, I think I am not inthe night,

200
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.130
nor doth this wood lack worldsof company,

201
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.170
for you, in my respect, are allthe world.

202
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.670
Then how can it be said I amalone

203
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.330
when all the world is here tolook on me?

204
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.370
I will not stay thy questions.

205
00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.530
Let me go.

206
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.270
Or, if thou follow me, do notbelieve

207
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.130
but I shall do thee mischief inthe wood.

208
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.330
Ay, in the temple, in the town,the field, you do me mischief.

209
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.700
Fie, Demetrius!

210
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.830
Your wrongs do set a scandal onmy sex.

211
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.770
We cannot fight for love as menmay do.

212
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.730
We should be wooed and were notmade to woo.

213
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.800
I'll run from thee, and hide mein the breaks,

214
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.670
and leave thee to the mercy ofwild beasts.

215
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.500
I'll follow thee and make aheaven of hell,

216
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.000
to die upon the hand I love sowell.

217
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.430
Fare thee well, nymph.

218
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.070
Ere he do leave this grove,

219
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.630
thou shalt fly him, and he shallseek thy love.

220
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.300
Hast thou the flower there?

221
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.100
Welcome, wanderer.

222
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.670
Ay, there it is.

223
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.730
I pray thee, give it me.

224
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.100
I know a bank where the wildthyme blows,

225
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.030
where oxlips and the noddingviolet grows

226
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.470
quite over-canopied withluscious woodbine,

227
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:21.600
with sweet musk-roses and witheglantine.

228
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.230
There sleeps Titania sometime ofthe night,

229
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:27.700
lulled in these flowers withdances and delight.

230
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.300
And there the snake throws herenamelled skin,

231
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:35.230
weed wide enough to wrap a fairyin.

232
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.530
And with the juice of this, I'llstreak her eyes

233
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.970
and make her full of hatefulfantasies.

234
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.370
Take thou some of it and seekthrough this grove.

235
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.370
A sweet Athenian lady is in lovewith a disdainful youth.

236
00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.500
Anoint his eyes,

237
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.430
but do it when the next thing heespies may be the lady.

238
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:57.100
Thou shalt know the man by theAthenian garments he hath on.

239
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.100
Effect it with some care,

240
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.470
that he may prove more fond onher

241
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.070
than she upon her love.

242
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.370
Sing me now asleep

243
00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:17.030
then to your offices and let merest.

244
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:28.130
You spotted snakes with doubletongue.

245
00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:37.470
Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen.

246
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:46.870
Newts and blind-worms, do nowrong.

247
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:51.870
Come not near our fairy queen.

248
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.470
Come not near our fairy queen,

249
00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:01.200
our fairy queen.

250
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:08.070
Philomel, with melody, sing inour sweet lullaby.

251
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:11.400
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla,lulla, lullaby.

252
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.570
Never harm, nor spell nor charm,

253
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.470
come our lovely lady nigh.

254
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.300
So good night with lullaby.

255
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.170
So good night with lullaby.

256
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.070
So good night with lullaby.

257
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.500
So good night

258
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.100
with lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.

259
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:30.570
Weaving spiders, come not here.

260
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.900
Hence, you long-legged spinners,hence.

261
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:43.330
Beetles black, approach notnear.

262
00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:52.470
Worm nor snail, do no offense.

263
00:13:52.830 --> 00:14:00.630
Worm nor snail, do no offense.

264
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.200
Philomel, with melody, sing inour sweet lullaby.

265
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.800
Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla,lulla, lullaby.

266
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.670
Never harm, nor spell nor charm,

267
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.630
come our lovely lady nigh.

268
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.500
So good night with lullaby.

269
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.500
So good night with lullaby.

270
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.330
So good night with lullaby.

271
00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.830
So good night

272
00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.930
with lullaby, lullaby, lullaby.

273
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.700
Hence, away.

274
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.570
Now all is well.

275
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.830
One aloof stand sentinel.

276
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.300
What thou seest when thou dostwake,

277
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.200
do it for thy true-love take,

278
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.470
love and languish for his sake,

279
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.400
be it ounce, or cat, or bear,pard,

280
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.970
or boar with bristled hair

281
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.530
in thy eye that shall appearwhen thou wakest,

282
00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.670
it is thy dear.

283
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.170
Wake when some vile thing isnear.

284
00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.730
Fair love, you faint withwandering in the wood.

285
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.430
And to speak troth, I haveforgot our way.

286
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.100
We'll rest us, Hermia, if youthink it good,

287
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.570
and tarry for the comfort of theday.

288
00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.300
Be it so, Lysander.

289
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.030
Find you out a bed, for I uponthis bank will rest my head.

290
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.300
One turf shall serve as pillowfor us both,

291
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.500
one heart, one bed, two bosomsand one troth.

292
00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.470
Nay, good Lysander,

293
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.100
for my sake, my dear, liefurther off.

294
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.500
Do not lie so near.

295
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:55.400
Oh, take the sense, sweet, of myinnocence.

296
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.070
Love takes the meaning in love'sconference.

297
00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:01.630
I mean, that my heart unto yoursis knit

298
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.770
so that one heart we can make ofit,

299
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.570
two bosoms interchained with anoath

300
00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:13.770
so then two bosoms and a singletroth.

301
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:16.000
Then by your side no bedroom medeny.

302
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.700
For lying so, Hermia, I do notlie.

303
00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.700
Lysander riddles very prettily.

304
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.130
Now much beshrew my manners andmy pride

305
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.170
if Hermia meant to say Lysanderlied.

306
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:31.670
But, gentle friend, for love andcourtesy lie further off.

307
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:33.300
In human modesty,

308
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.730
such separation as may well besaid

309
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.370
becomes a virtuous bachelor anda maid.

310
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.770
So far be distant.

311
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:44.930
And, good night, sweet friend.

312
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:50.030
Thy love ne'er alter till thysweet life end.

313
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:04.770
Amen, amen to that fair prayer,say I.

314
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.400
So end life when I end loyalty.

315
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.630
Here is my bed.

316
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.400
Sleep give thee all his rest.

317
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.600
With half that wish, thewisher's eyes be pressed.

318
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.900
Through the forest have I gone,

319
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.400
but Athenian found I none onwhose eyes I might approve

320
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.000
this flower's force in stirringlove.

321
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.970
Night and silence.

322
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.100
Who is here?

323
00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.830
Weeds of Athens he doth wear.

324
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:52.970
This is he, my master said,despised the Athenian maid.

325
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:58.400
And here the maiden sleepingsound on the dank and dirtyground.

326
00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.700
Pretty soul,

327
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:04.100
She durst not lie near thislack-love, this kill-courtesy.

328
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:10.130
Churl, upon thy eyes I throw allthe power this charm doth owe.

329
00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:13.430
When thou wakest, let loveforbid.

330
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.170
Sleep his seat on thy eyelid.

331
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.170
So awake when I am gone, for Imust now to Oberon.

332
00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:24.100
Stay, though thou kill me, sweetDemetrius.

333
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.730
I charge thee, hence, and do nothaunt me thus.

334
00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.300
Oh, wilt thou darkling leave me?

335
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.500
Do not so.

336
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.000
Stay, on thy peril.

337
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.670
I alone will go.

338
00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:58.500
Oh, I am out of breath in thisfond chase.

339
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:01.500
The more my prayer, the lesseris my grace.

340
00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.000
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er shelies,

341
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.570
for she hath blessed andattractive eyes.

342
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.330
How came her eyes so bright?

343
00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.370
Not with salt tears.

344
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.630
If so, my eyes are oftenerwashed than hers.

345
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:36.230
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear.

346
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.900
For beasts that meet me run awayfor fear.

347
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.030
Therefore no marvel thoughDemetrius do

348
00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.930
as a monster fly my presencethus.

349
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.370
What wicked and dissemblingglass of mine

350
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.300
made me compare with Hermia'ssphery eyne?

351
00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.230
But who is here?

352
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.870
Lysander on the ground!

353
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.430
Dead?

354
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.230
Or asleep?

355
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.930
I see no blood, no wound.

356
00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.470
Lysander, if you live, good sir,awake.

357
00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:16.700
And run through fire will I forthy sweet sake.

358
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.230
Transparent Helena!

359
00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.470
Nature shows art,

360
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.630
that through thy bosom makes mesee thy heart.

361
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.830
Where is Demetrius?

362
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.170
Oh, how fit a word is that vilename to perish on my sword.

363
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.900
Do not say so, Lysander.

364
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:40.500
Say not so what though he loveyour Hermia?

365
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.870
Lord, what though?

366
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:45.070
Yet Hermia still loves you, thenbe content.

367
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.130
Content with Hermia.

368
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:54.730
No, I do repent the tediousminutes I with her have spent.

369
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.400
Not Hermia but Helena I love.

370
00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.600
Who will not change a raven fora dove?

371
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.330
The will of man is by his reasonswayed.

372
00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:08.300
And reason says you are theworthier maid.

373
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.100
Things growing are not ripeuntil their season,

374
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.270
so I, being young, till now ripenot to reason.

375
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:18.200
And touching now the point ofhuman skill,

376
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.300
reason becomes the marshal to mywill

377
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.870
and leads me to your eyes,

378
00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:31.630
where I o'erlook love's storieswritten in love's richest book.

379
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:37.930
Wherefore was I to this keenmockery born?

380
00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.800
When at your hand did I deservethis scorn?

381
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.230
It's not enough-- it's notenough, young man,

382
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.330
that I did never, no, nor nevercan,

383
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.730
deserve a sweet look fromDemetrius' eye,

384
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.070
but you must flout myinsufficiency?

385
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.370
Good troth, you do me wrong.

386
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.630
Good sooth, you do, in suchdisdainful manner me to woo.

387
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.370
But fare you well.

388
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:04.770
Perforce, I must confess

389
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:10.730
I thought you lord of more truegentleness.

390
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.470
Oh, that a lady, of one manrefused

391
00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:16.200
should of another therefore beabused.

392
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.100
She sees not Hermia.

393
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.600
Hermia, sleep thou there

394
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.600
and never mayst thou comeLysander near.

395
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.230
For all my powers, address yourlove and might

396
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.970
to honour Helen and to be herknight.

397
00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.700
Ay me, for pity!

398
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.800
What a dream was here.

399
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.230
Lysander, look how I do quakewith fear.

400
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:53.770
Methought a serpent ate my heartaway

401
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:58.700
and you sat smiling at his cruelpray.

402
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.400
Lysander?

403
00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.570
What, removed?

404
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.500
Lysander!

405
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.670
Lord!

406
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.870
What, out of hearing?

407
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.270
Gone?

408
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.700
No sound,

409
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.230
no word?

410
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.770
Alack, where are you?

411
00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.970
Speak, and if you hear,

412
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.230
speak, of all loves.

413
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.000
I swoon almost with fear.

414
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.170
No?

415
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:51.930
Then I well perceive you are notnigh.

416
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:59.300
Either death or you I'll findimmediately.

417
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.800
