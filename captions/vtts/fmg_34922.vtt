00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Narrator:
 IT'S A NEW WORLD
 FOR FATHERS THESE DAYS.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
RULES ARE
 CHANGING RAPIDLY.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
- COME ON!
- TODAY, A DIFFERENT
  KIND OF DAD...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
MY DAD'S TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING THERE IS FOR
A TEENAGER TO KNOW ABOUT LIFE.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Narrator:
 ...AND NEW FINDINGS
  ABOUT FATHERS.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
THERE ARE UNIQUE THINGS
THAT DADS DO WITH
THEIR CHILDREN

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
THAT ARE VERY VALUABLE TO THEM
AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
HE DOESN'T RESPOND
ON THE FIRST OR SECOND
OR THIRD REQUEST.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
YOU'RE VERY SMART
TO FACE IT RIGHT NOW.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Narrator:
 "BRAZELTON ON PARENTING"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
A FATHER'S ROLE HAS
TRADITIONALLY BEEN

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
LIKE A SUPPORTING CHARACTER
IN A PLAY.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
MOM HAS ALWAYS
BEEN REGARDED AS THE STAR

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
AND USUALLY TAKES THE BOWS

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
WHEN THE KIDS TURN OUT
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
BUT FOR A LONG TIME,
MEN HAVE HUNGERED FOR
A MORE IMPORTANT ROLE.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
AND NEW RESEARCH
HAS SHOWN THAT FATHERS REALLY
ARE MUCH MORE CRITICAL

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
TO THEIR CHILDREN'S' DEVELOPMENT
THAN ANYONE EVER IMAGINED.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
TODAY, WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A FRESH LOOK AT FATHERS

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
STARTING WITH A PORTRAIT
OF A YOUNG MAN

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
ON THE CUTTING-EDGE OF
THE CHANGING DEFINITION OF DAD.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Woman over PA:
 On behalf of the staff,
 we'd like to wish...

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Brazelton:
 A BIRTHDAY WITH THE EGGLESTONS
 FROM COATESVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Woman:
 Happy Birthday, Jennay.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Brazelton:
 SEVEN-YEAR-OLD JENNAY
 IS THE BIRTHDAY GIRL.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
THERE'S ALSO
 AMBER, 17; TORY, NINE;

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
JEDDA,
 A YEAR AND A HALF;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
AND MARTY, FATHER
 OF THE FOUR GIRLS.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
All sing:
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO YOU... *

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Brazelton:
 THE EGGLESTONS ARE
 A TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY...

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
WELL, ALMOST.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I PRAY THAT MY MOMMY
WILL COME BACK

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
- AND I PRAY THAT I'LL HAVE
 A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
- All: AMEN.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Brazelton:
 THE FAMILY STORY
 BEGAN IN EUROPE

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
WHERE MARTY SPENT YEARS
 AS A PRO-BASKETBALL STAR.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Marty:
 I PLAYED IN AUSTRIA,
 SOUTH AMERICA,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
IN URUGUAY.
 I PLAYED IN POLAND
 FOR FOUR YEARS.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
AND, YOU KNOW,
I JUST BOUNCED ALL
OVER EUROPE

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
AND I ENJOYED IT.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Brazelton:
 BUT THEN, A SERIOUS INJURY

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
WHICH SHATTERED MORE
 THAN JUST A CAREER.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
UNFORTUNATELY,
MY WIFE AND I SEPARATED,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
AND WE JUST DECIDED
AS A COUPLE

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF THE CHILDREN
STAYED WITH ME.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
- BOO-BOO, WE'RE
 GOING STRAIGHT AHEAD.
- OKAY.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Brazelton:
 MARTY MOVED BACK HOME
 TO COATESVILLE WITH THE GIRLS.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
WHAT DO
WE WANT, BOO?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Brazelton:
 FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
HE'S BEEN
 BOTH DAD AND MOM.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
- THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE.
- YES, THERE WAS.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
- WE SHOULD HAVE
 WROTE IT DOWN.
- ( both laugh )

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
AS SOLE CAREGIVER
FOR MY KIDS,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'VE LEARNED THAT
MY KIDS REALLY NEED ME.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
LET ME
WASH YOUR FACE.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Marty:
 I KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW
 I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
AND I REALLY HAVE TO
 FOCUS ON MY KIDS

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
IN ORDER FOR THEM
 TO BE OKAY.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Brazelton:
 ANYONE WOULD WONDER:
 CAN A MAN DO IT?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Marty:
HEY, AMBER, CAN YOU BRING ME
A DIAPER, PLEASE?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Brazelton:
 WELL, THOSE WHO KNOW MARTY
 THINK SO.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Alice Eggleston:
 HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN ACTIVE
 FATHER WITH THE GIRLS, ALWAYS.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
HE DIDN'T JUST JUMP IN
AND IT HAPPENED.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
HE'S BEEN DOING IT
ALL ALONG,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT
A LOT EASIER

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
FOR THE TRANSITION
OF THE GIRLS.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
( singing )

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Marty:
 I HAVEN'T REALLY
 CHANGED ANYTHING.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I'VE ONLY ADDED
 TO WHAT I WAS ALREADY DOING.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I'M MUCH MORE
 INVOLVED IN THEIR LIFE.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
DADDY, HOW DO YOU
ROLL THE NAPKINS?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Brazelton:
 MARTY HAS A GAME PLAN.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Marty:
 I REALLY STRESS
 TEAM SPIRIT AT MY HOUSE.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
- Jedda: HELLO!
- HELLO.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
PLAYING WITH EACH OTHER'S TOYS
 OR SHARING A SKIRT

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
OR WHATEVER THE CASE
 MAY BE.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Brazelton:
 THE RESULT:
 WONDERFUL GIRLS.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
- DADDY.
- YES.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Amber:
 DAD DOES A LOT
 OF STUFF AROUND HERE.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
WE JUST GOTTA
 HELP HIM OUT.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
WE HAVE TO COOPERATE.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO
TELL EACH OTHER,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
YOU KNOW,
"PICK UP YOUR COAT.
PUT YOUR SHOES AWAY.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
MAKE SURE YOUR BAG'S PUT AWAY.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK."

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I'M KNOWN AS
"MOUTH ALMIGHTY."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
OKAY, WELL, BE KNOWN
AS "GIVE ME YOUR PLATE"
AND LET'S EAT.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Jennay:
 HE'S A NORMAL DAD,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
BUT HE'S THE ONLY PARENT
I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
SO I NEED
TO HELP HIM OUT

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
A LOT MORE
THAN NORMAL.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Brazelton:
 IT HASN'T BEEN EASY
 FOR MARTY OR THE KIDS,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
BUT MARTY'S HAD
 THE SUPPORT OF HIS FAITH
 AND HIS FAMILY

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
AND THE STRONG ROLE MODEL
 OF HIS OWN FATHER,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
A BAPTIST PASTOR.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Marty:
 MY DAD HAS TAUGHT ME
 A LOT OF THINGS:

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
RESPECT, DISCIPLINE.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
AND NOW THOSE THINGS ARE
HELPING ME TO RAISE MY KIDS.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Marty:
 GIVE PAPA A KISS
 AND LET'S GO BYE-BYE.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Gradis Eggleston Jr:
 MARTY CAME FROM A HOME

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
WHERE LOVE WAS 
FIRST PRIORITY.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
AND HE COULD NOT
LEAVE THAT STRUCTURE

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
AND TAKE
ANY OTHER AVENUE

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
BUT THE ONE THAT HAD BEEN
INSTILLED WITHIN HIM.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Brazelton:
 MARTY SHARED HIS LESSONS
 WITH OTHERS.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
HE RUNS
 "FATHERS' INITIATIVE,"
 A SOURCE OF SUPPORT

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
FOR DADS IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Marty:
 I CAME HERE...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
WE'RE GONNA GO
SEE THE BABIES.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
...JUST TO KINDA
 ADD TO MY OWN SKILLS

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
AND LEARN SOME
 FATHERING TECHNIQUES

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
AND I FELL IN LOVE
 WITH IT.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
YOU DON'T WANNA GET
CHANNELED INTO THAT

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
POLICEMAN ROLE
WITH YOUR KIDS.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
AND SO IT'S OUR JOB
NOT TO BULLY THEM,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
AND NOT TO SAY,
"HEY, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,"

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
- BUT TO GUIDE THEM.
- A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
THAT AS FATHERS, AS MEN,
WE DON'T WANNA BE BOTHERED
WITH THEM.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
- RIGHT.
- AND THEY'RE WRONG.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
IT'S NATURAL
TO BE ABLE TO CARE.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I MEAN, WE HAVE THOSE
INSTINCTS THAT ARE BUILT
WITHIN JUST LIKE MOMS DO.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
BUT WE HAVE TO STEP UP
AND MAKE SURE WE TAKE
OUR POSITION

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
IN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN
AND NOT TAKE THAT BACK SEAT.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO
IS UNDERSTAND

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
THAT WE HAVE TO
BE THERE FOR THEM.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT YOU
TELL YOUR SON RIGHT NOW

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
OR TELL YOUR DAUGHTER
RIGHT NOW WILL LAST LONGER
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
WHOA, LET DADDY
HELP YOU, OKAY, MISS LADY?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Brazelton:
 MARTY'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR HIM
TO UNDERSTAND GIRLS BECAUSE
HE'S NOT A GIRL.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
- WHO IS THAT?
- Jedda: DADDY!

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
- IT'S DADDY.
- AH!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Marty:
 ALL THESE VARIOUS THINGS

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
THAT COME UP FOR GIRLS...

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
LET'S GET
SOME MACARONI.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
...I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO LEARN
 AS THEY COME ALONG.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
JUST A LOT OF
 LITTLE GIRL THINGS...

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
DAD, I GOT THE BOOK!

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
...THAT USUALLY DADS
 DON'T DEAL WITH.  I JUST
 KIND OF TAKE THEM IN STRIDE.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I DO ASK MY MOM.
I ASK OTHER WOMEN.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I READ BOOKS.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
AND SO I TRY TO BE
AS HELPFUL AND AS OPEN
AS POSSIBLE.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
- DADDY!
- YES.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
MY DAD'S TAUGHT ME JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING THERE IS

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
FOR A TEENAGER
TO KNOW ABOUT LIFE.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
- WEE!
- ( screams )

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Amber:
 IT DOESN'T MATTER
 IF WE'RE FALLING OFF A BIKE

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
OR WHETHER THERE'S
 A SCHOOL PROBLEM.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
YOU KNOW,
 HE'S ALWAYS THERE
 TO HANDLE THE SITUATION FOR US.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Brazelton:
 IT'S ONLY BEEN
 A FEW MONTHS,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
BUT YOU KNOW,
 IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Marty:
 BEING A PARENT,
 YOU KNOW, IS A JOB

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
THAT I SIGNED ON FOR.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
AND WHEN I SIGNED ON,
 I SIGNED FOR THE DURATION.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
- DADDY!
- THERE WE GO.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
WE ARE
 A WINNING TEAM.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
JOINING ME TODAY
IS CRYSTAL HOLMES,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM I.B.M.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
YOU KNOW, CRYSTAL,
FATHERS WANT TO BE
MORE INVOLVED TODAY.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
IS THERE ANY HELP FOR THEM
ON THE INTERNET?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
BERRY, THERE'S A LOT
OF VALUABLE INFORMATION
ON THE INTERNET

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
FOR FATHERS WHO
MAY BE EXPERIENCING MANY
DIFFERENT ROLES AS A FATHER.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
PERHAPS THERE ARE
 FATHERS THAT ARE

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
STAYING AT HOME WITH THE KIDS
 WHILE MOM GOES TO WORK,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
OR FATHERS THAT ARE TAKING CARE
 OF NEW STEPCHILDREN,
 OR JUST NEW DADS.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
ONE SITE IS THE NATIONAL
 FATHERHOOD INITIATIVE.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
AND HERE, FATHERS CAN
 GET ON THE SITE, BROWSE IT.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
THEY CAN ACTUALLY
 SEE TIPS FOR FATHERS.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
AND THERE'S
 ANOTHER SITE WE'LL LOOK AT
 THAT I THINK IS VERY USEFUL.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
IT'S THE NATIONAL CENTER
 FOR FATHERING.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
AND HERE THERE'S A CHAT ROOM
 AND THERE'RE BULLETIN BOARDS
 AND LINKS.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
AND THE REAL VALUE
 IS THE ABILITY

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
TO CONNECT
 TO OTHER FATHERS

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
THAT MAY BE GOING
 THROUGH THE SAME PARENTING
 EXPERIENCES THAT YOU ARE.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
YOU CAN READ
WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
POST YOUR ISSUES

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
AND SEE IF THERE'S
SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE
DONE WONDERFULLY.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I THINK THE INTERNET CAN
 BE A VALUABLE RESOURCE

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
JUST TO SHARE EXPERIENCES 
AND TO SEE IF WE CAN LEARN
FROM EACH OTHER.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
BERRY, OUR INTERNET
QUESTION TODAY

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
COMES FROM VICTOR IN
SANTA ROSA, CALIFORNIA.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
HIS QUESTION IS,
 "I LOVE SPENDING TIME
 WITH MY DAUGHTER, TAYLOR.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
HOWEVER, WHENEVER MY WIFE
 COMES INTO THE ROOM

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
TAYLOR, OUR ONE-YEAR-OLD,
 SEEMS TO FORGET THAT
 I'M EVEN AROUND.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
IF GINA, MY WIFE,
 LEAVES THE ROOM,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
TAYLOR CRIES
 AND BECOMES ANXIOUS.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
HOW CAN I STRENGTHEN THE BOND
 I HAVE WITH MY DAUGHTER

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
SO THAT SHE FEELS
 CONFIDENT WITH ME, TOO?"

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE
ASKING THAT QUESTION

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
AND IT SHOWS HOW MUCH
YOU WANT HER TO TURN TO YOU.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
AND SHE WILL
SOONER OR LATER

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
BECAUSE EVERY TIME
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BE
WITH HER ALONE

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
AND GET RESPONSES
FROM HER,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
YOU'RE PUTTING THEM
IN THE BANK FOR THE FUTURE.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
SOONER OR LATER
SHE'LL TURN TO YOU

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
JUST LIKE SHE HAS
TO YOUR WIFE.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000

 PRESENTED BY

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
DR. KYLE PRUETT,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
AT THE YALE CHILD
STUDIES CENTER

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
HAS BEEN STUDYING FATHERS
 AND THEIR EFFECT

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
ON CHILDREN
FOR A LONG TIME.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
KYLE, YOU KNOW,
WE KEEP HEARING THAT

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
MOTHERS HAVE
SOMETHING SPECIAL
TO OFFER KIDS.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
AND IT PUTS FATHERS,
IT SEEMS TO ME,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
AT A VERY BIG
DISADVANTAGE.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A WAY
TO MAKE UP FOR THAT
IN FATHERS' MINDS?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT I'M TRYING TO DO
WITH MY OWN WORK

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
HAS BEEN TO TELL
 FATHERS THEY TOO HAVE
 SOMETHING QUITE SPECIAL.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
WE NOW KNOW THAT
THERE ARE UNIQUE,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
IDIOSYNCRATIC THINGS
THAT DADS DO WITH
THEIR CHILDREN

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
THAT ARE VERY VALUABLE TO THEM
AND THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
THEY PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
THEY HOLD THEM
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
AND WHAT'S INTERESTING
IS THAT WE NOW KNOW THAT
THE BABIES RESPOND TO THAT.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
BABIES SIX WEEKS OLD

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
ARE ALREADY ADJUSTING
THEIR BODIES

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
TO BE HELD BY FATHERS
AS OPPOSED TO BEING
HELD BY MOTHERS.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
FATHERS,
WHEN THEY'RE WITH A BABY

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
THAT'S FUSSY,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
THEY TEND NOT
TO HOLD THEM CLOSER.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
THEY TEND TO CHANGE
THEIR POSITION AROUND,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
SHOW THEM
SOMETHING IN THE WORLD,
HOLD THEM UPRIGHT.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
AND THEY KIND OF TAKE
THEM INTO THE WORLD

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
RATHER THAN OUT OF THE WORLD
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
THEY USE THE WORLD
AROUND THEM A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT WAY THAN MOTHERS.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
- FASCINATING.
- FOR SOME BABIES, OF COURSE,
 THAT CAN BE JUST THE TICKET.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
FOR OTHER BABIES,
THAT MAY NOT BE 
JUST THE TICKET.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
THEY MAY NEED
 THAT HOLD, THAT CLOSENESS
 AND THAT TOUCH.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
DOES A FATHER THEN
PICK THAT UP AND ADJUST
TO IT, DO YOU THINK?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
YES, THEY DO.
THERE'S INTERESTING RESEARCH

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
THAT SAYS THE PHYSIOLOGIC
RESPONSE OF A FATHER
TO A CRYING BABY

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
IS IDENTICAL
TO THE PHYSIOLOGIC RESPONSE

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
OF A MOTHER TO A CRYING BABY

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
IF YOU GIVE THE FATHER
THE CHANCE TO SORT OF
BE THERE AND RESPOND.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU NEED TO BACK UP
A FATHER FOR HIS ROLE...

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
- VERY MUCH SO.
- ...AND GIVE HIM PERMISSION.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
SUPPOSE HE RUNS INTO
WHAT I CALL "GATE-KEEPING."

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
THE MOTHER SAYS,
"OH, YOU'RE NOT
DOING IT RIGHT.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THIS IS THE WAY
WE DO IT, DEAR."

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
- WHAT HAPPENS?
- THERE'S A GATE
 AROUND EVERY MOTHER.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
AND IT'S CULTURAL,
AND IT SAYS,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
"THIS IS YOUR JOB 
AND YOU BETTER NOT
MESS IT UP.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT THINGS
YOU'LL EVER DO."

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
SO IT'S HARD FOR A MOTHER,
PARTICULARLY A NEW MOTHER,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
TO SHARE THE NURTURING DOMAIN
WITH HER SPOUSE.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
AND YET, IT'LL BE
A WONDERFUL THING

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
FOR HER DOWN THE ROAD
 IF SHE DOES.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
CHILDREN WITH
INVOLVED FATHERS
STAY IN SCHOOL LONGER.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
THEY HAVE LESS TO DO WITH
THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
AND WHEN THEY MARRY,
THEY TEND TO STAY
MARRIED LONGER.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I HEAR ALSO THEY'RE NOT
AS OPEN TO PEER PRESSURE.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
THE HAVE AN INNER SENSE
OF SORT OF COMPETENCE

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE
A LITTLE LESS MANIPULATABLE.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
KYLE, WHAT ARE SOME THINGS
THAT THE FATHERS

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
CAN DO TO STAY CLOSE
TO THEIR KIDS?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
 IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
BE PRESENT.
TAKE YOUR TURN WITH
THE NIGHTTIME FEEDINGS,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
THE GETTING UPS.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
TAKE YOUR TURN
AT THE DIAPERING TABLE.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
AS YOUR CHILD GETS OLDER,
MAKE SURE THAT YOU STAY
IN THEIR LIFE.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
ADOLESCENCE--
 A TIME, BERRY,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
WHEN A LOT OF FATHERS
 BACK AWAY BECAUSE
 THEY'RE NOT SURE.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
DON'T BACK AWAY.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME
THEY NEEDED YOU, IT IS NOW.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
THEY NEED YOUR STRENGTH,
YOUR AUTHORITY.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
HOW ABOUT SPECIAL TIMES
WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
- YOU KNOW,
 QUALITY TIME?
- I KNOW WE DO, BERRY.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
CHILDREN ARE RAISED
IN ORDINARY TIME, BERRY.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
YOU TAUGHT ME THAT
AND I WANNA REMIND YOU
THAT YOU TAUGHT ME THAT.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
NOT QUALITY TIME.
 QUALITY TIME IS A MYTH

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
BECAUSE OUR CHILDREN
MAY NOT BE READY WHEN WE ARE

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
AND WE MAY NOT BE READY
WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
SO IT HAS TO BE REGULAR.
THAT'S NOT TO SAY

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
THAT SPECIAL TIME
WITH YOUR CHILD CAN'T
BE WONDERFUL,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE
THE ONLY KIND OF TIME
YOU HAVE WITH YOUR CHILD.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Man:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
- Brazelton:
  WOW, THAT'S GREAT.
- THANK YOU.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
MY NAME IS MIKE.
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
MY OLDEST IS 12
AND I BELIEVE HE'S
GIVEN ME A PREVIEW

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
ON WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO CARE FOR A TEENAGER.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WHEN I ASK
HIM TO DO SOMETHING

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
OR I NEED HIM TO DO
A FAVOR OR GO DO SOMETHING,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
HE DOESN'T RESPOND
ON THE FIRST OR SECOND
OR THIRD REQUEST.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
- YEAH.
- IT'S USUALLY
 THE FOURTH AND BEYOND,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
AND IT'S CRACKING MY PATIENCE,
IT REALLY IS.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
AND I'M LOOKING FOR IDEAS

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
IN TRYING TO REGAIN

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
WHAT I USED TO HAVE
 WHEN HE WAS HALF THAT AGE,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
WHERE IT TOOK
ONE OR TWO REQUESTS
AND THE TASK GOT DONE.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
WELL, YOU KNOW
 WHAT I THINK YOU'RE
 GOING THROUGH

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
IS SEPARATION ISSUES.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
IT'S REALLY HARD TO GIVE UP
THAT LITTLE BOY

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
- THAT YOU WERE SO CLOSE TO
 AT SIX, WASN'T IT?
- OH YES.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
AND NOW THAT
 HE'S 12 AND YOU FEEL
 SO TURNED AGAINST...

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
- MM-HMM.
- ...BY THIS KIND
 OF BEHAVIOR,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
- YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
 HAVING TO GIVE HIM UP.
- RIGHT.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
AND IT FRIGHTENS YOU
 BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
 WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
TO TRY TO GET HIM BACK

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
OR GET ANGRY WITH HIM
OR WHATEVER.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
- PROBABLY VIOLENT EMOTIONS
 COME UP, DON'T THEY?
- YES.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
- YEAH.
- ( chuckles )

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
AND I THINK THIS IS
WHAT A TEENAGER DOES
TO A PARENT

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
- IN THE SERVICE
 OF BECOMING INDEPENDENT.
- MM-HMM.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO
IS GIVE THAT 12-YEAR-OLD

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
A SENSE THAT YOU'RE STILL
RIGHT WITH HIM,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
THAT YOU TRUST HIM,
THAT WHEN YOU SAY SOMETHING
REALLY MEANING IT,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
YOU KNOW
HE'S GONNA DO IT.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
AND I WOULD BE CAREFUL
 TO USE IT JUST FOR
 IMPORTANT THINGS

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
SO YOU DON'T SET OFF
THIS NEGATIVISM
ANY OTHER TIME.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
AND GIVE HIM
 BACK A FEELING THAT YOU
 STILL FEEL CLOSE TO HIM.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
AND I'D SURE FIND SOME TIMES
TO BE CLOSE TO HIM ALONE.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
THAT MEANS NOT GOING
 WITH YOUR WIFE

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
OR WITH THE OTHER CHILD,
 BUT WITH HIM,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
AND FINDING OUT
 WHAT'S ON HIS MIND

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
WITHOUT BEING INTRUSIVE,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
BUT LETTING HIM KNOW
WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR YOU

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
AT THE AGE
OF 15 OR 16

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
BECAUSE 12-YEAR-OLDS
TODAY ARE MORE LIKE 
15- OR 16-YEAR-OLDS

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
- IN THE OLD DAYS.
- THAT'S VERY TRUE.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
AND SO I WOULD
 REALLY WORK ON IT.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I THINK YOU'RE VERY SMART
TO FACE IT RIGHT NOW

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
'CAUSE YOU GOT SOME
TOUGH TIMES AHEAD--
HE DOES TOO.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
- SO HE NEEDS YOU.
 ( chuckles )
- GREAT.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
HI, MY DAUGHTER IS THREE

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
AND MY HUSBAND TRAVELS
QUITE A BIT FOR WORK.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I WORK FULL TIME.
WE DON'T HAVE LOCAL FAMILY.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
AND HE WAS ALWAYS
VERY VERY INVOLVED,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
PARTICULARLY WHEN SHE
WAS BORN AND I HAD TO
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
HE TOOK PATERNITY LEAVE
FOR A WHILE, SPENT A LOT
OF TIME WITH HER.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
- WONDERFUL.
- AND WHEN HE'S IN TOWN,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
HE TRIES TO SCHEDULE
CALLS IN THE EVENING
SO HE CAN COME HOME.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
AND EVEN IF HE CAN'T
MAKE IT FOR DINNER,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
TO BE THERE
WHEN SHE GOES TO BED
OR THAT KIND OF THING.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
REALLY VERY INVOLVED.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
SO WHAT SHE DOES
WHEN HE'S AWAY--

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
THERE'S A LOT
OF "I WANT DADDY.
I JUST WANT DADDY.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I DON'T WANT YOU.
I WANT DADDY."

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
AND SOMETIMES IT'S PURELY
ANOTHER TACTIC FOR CONTROL.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK
THERE'S SOMETHING TRULY THERE.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
AND WE'VE ALWAYS
WORRIED ABOUT IT EVEN
BEFORE SHE EXPRESSED THAT.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
FROM BEFORE SHE
COULD EVEN UNDERSTAND,
WHEN SHE WAS A BABY

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
WHENEVER HE WOULD
GO AWAY, HE WOULD SAY
TO HER, "I'M GOING ON A TRIP

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
- AND I'LL BE BACK
 ON FRIDAY--
- GREAT.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
--OR I'LL BE BACK
 ON THURSDAY."

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
SO SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHICH DAYS COME WHEN.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
BUT SHE KNOWS
IF TODAY IS THAT DAY
THAT HE'S COMING HOME.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
REALLY? SHE'S ALREADY
DEVELOPED A SENSE OF TIME

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
WHICH IS REALLY REMARKABLE,
ISN'T IT?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
YES, SHE HAS.
BUT THIS IS HER FOCUS.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
SHE'S VERY INTERESTED IN DAYS
'CAUSE ON CERTAIN DAYS
DADDY COMES HOME.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
YOU MIGHT MAKE A CALENDAR
IN WHICH EACH DAY

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
SHE CAN
PUT A CROSS IN IT.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
YOU KNOW, HELP HER
 WITH THIS SENSE OF TIME.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
AND THEN ANOTHER THING
I WOULD SUGGEST IS MAKE
SOME VIDEOTAPES.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AND HE READS HER
 A BEDTIME STORY

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
FOR EACH DAY
 THAT HE'S GONE.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
AND YOU PLAY IT
AND BOTH YOU SIT THERE
AND MOURN.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
( all laughing )

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
- WELL, WE DO THAT.
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE MOURNING TOO.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
WELL, THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
I'LL SAY TO HER WHEN
SHE SAYS TO ME,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
"I WANT DADDY."
I SAY, "WELL, I WANT
DADDY TOO.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
NOW WE NEED TO PUT YOUR SHOES
ON AND GO TO PRESCHOOL."

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
BUT BOTH OF YOU
ARE MOURNING,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
AND I'LL BET HE IS.
I'LL BE HE'S MOURNING
AT THE OTHER END.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
SHE SAYS, "I WANT DADDY."
AND THEN WHEN HE TELEPHONES,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
SHE WON'T ACTUALLY TALK
 TO HIM ON THE PHONE.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
SHE'LL TALK TO HIM ON HER
BANANA PHONE IN THE CAR.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
AND SHE'LL SHOW HIM
THE BANANA ON THE PHONE.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
BUT SHE'LL TALK
 INTO THE BANANA.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
I THINK SHE DOESN'T WANNA RISK
TALKING TO HIM IF HE DOESN'T SAY
WHAT SHE WANTS HIM TO SAY.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S
GOING ON THERE.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
YES, YOU ARE.
WHAT IS IT?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
IT'S TOO PAINFUL.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
AND SHE MISSES HIM
TOO MUCH TO WANT TO
HEAR HIS VOICE.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
AND SO SHE CAN
TALK TO HIM WHEN
IT'S JUST PLAY-ACTING,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
OR WHEN
IT'S IN FANTASY.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
BUT THE REALITY 
 COMES TOO CLOSE.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
I HOPE HE KNOWS THAT.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
- I DON'T KNOW IF HE DOES.
- WELL, YOU TELL HIM.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
HE'D BETTER KNOW IT.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
ARE THERE ANY OTHER THINGS
I CAN DO TO HELP HER BESIDES--

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
- I MEAN, THIS BEDTIME STORY--
- I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE
  YOU'RE DOING A LOT,

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
PREPARING HER AHEAD OF TIME.
I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE TELLS
HER WHEN HE'S GOING.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
A LOT OF PARENTS
WON'T DO THAT

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
BECAUSE IT'S SO PAINFUL
FOR THEM TO LEAVE.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
AND SO THEY DON'T
PREPARE THE CHILD

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
AND THEY DON'T DO
ANOTHER THING:

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
WHEN THEY GET HOME SAY,
"REMEMBER I TOLD YOU I WAS
COMING ON THIS DAY

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
AND HERE I AM."

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
BUT IT ALL SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE HANDLING IT VERY WELL.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
IT'S VERY TOUGH
THESE DAYS.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000
BUT VIDEOTAPES HELP,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
WHEN SHE CAN SEE HIM

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
AND HE CAN SING TO HER
OR READ TO HER.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
- OKAY, WE'LL TRY THAT.
- GREAT.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
- THANK YOU.
- OKAY.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000

PRESENTED BY

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
I HOPE YOU'VE SEEN
HOW IMPORTANT

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
FATHERS ARE IN
THE LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
AND I HOPE YOU COME
TO APPRECIATE

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
HOW MEN
FROM EVERY GENERATION

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
WANT SO MUCH TO BE CLOSE

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
TO THEIR SONS
AND DAUGHTERS.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
FATHERS ROLES ARE CHANGING,

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I THINK FOR THE BETTER.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
IT'S UP TO ALL OF US,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
MOTHERS AND FATHERS
TO SUPPORT THAT CHANGE.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
FATHERS HAVE TO JUMP IN

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
AND MOTHERS HAVE
TO LET THEM IN.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
BECAUSE IN THE END
A MORE COMMITTED FATHER

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
MEANS A MORE
COMMITTED FAMILY.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
