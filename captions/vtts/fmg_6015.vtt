WEBVTT

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.200
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT
A MOTHER HEARS HER BABY.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.400
SOON SHE'LL HEAR THE
BABY A LOT AS HE DEMANDS

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.000
TO BE FED, BUT THESE EARLY
SOUNDS ARE A LONG WAY

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.100
FROM THE CONVERSATIONS
SHE WILL HAVE WITH HIM

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.230
WHEN HE GETS TO SCHOOL AGE
AND WANTS A NEW FOOTBALL.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.130
IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S GOING
TO DEVELOP LANGUAGE.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:17.800
THIS VIDEO WILL SHOW
YOU HOW THIS HAPPENS.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.400
THE FIRST STAGE IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.130
IS KNOWN AS THE PRE-VERBAL
STAGE WHICH INVOLVES

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.260
THE PRODUCTION OF
A RANGE OF NOISES.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.530
NONE OF WHICH ARE
RECOGNIZABLE AS WORDS,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.560
BUT STILL MANAGE
TO COMMUNICATE

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.130
THE BABY'S NEEDS.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.860
THIS SAD SOUND IS
THAT OF A HUNGRY BABY.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.900
HE'S LEARNING THAT
MAKING A NOISE

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.030
BRINGS LOVE, COMFORT,
AND SOMETHING TO EAT.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.630
IN PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS,
THE CONSEQUENCES OF YELLING

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.660
ARE REWARDED AS THE BABY
LEARNS THAT MAKING SOUNDS

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.260
PRODUCES AN EFFECT ON
THE WORLD AROUND HIM,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.830
AND HE BEGINS
TO COMMUNICATE.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.200
DOES THAT FEEL
BETTER NOW?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.500
BUT OF COURSE, EVEN
FROM THE BEGINNING,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.330
COMMUNICATION IS A TWO-WAY
PROCESS AND BABIES ARE

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.000
LISTENING TO THEIR
MOTHER'S VOICES.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.930
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT
BABIES MAY LEARN

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.100
TO RECOGNIZE THEIR
PARENTS' VOICES

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.830
FROM WITHIN THE
WOMB BEFORE BIRTH.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.860
CERTAINLY BABIES ARE
READY TO RESPOND TO THEIR

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.360
MOTHER'S VOICE AND THE
SOUND OF THEIR OWN NAME

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.500
FROM AN EARLY AGE.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.030
BABIES INCREASINGLY
PAY ATTENTION TO LOUD

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:38.460
OR INTERESTING SOUNDS
IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.830
ALMOST FROM BIRTH BABIES
ARE READY TO INTERACT

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.830
WITH ANOTHER
HUMAN BEING.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.000
PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DESCRIBED
THE ROUTINES OF TURN-TAKING

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.530
IN CONVERSATIONS
BETWEEN MOTHER AND BABY.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.530
THIS IS
CALLED A "DANCE"

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.230
BECAUSE OF ALL
THE STEPS INVOLVED.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.060
COHN  and  TRONICK
FOUND THAT OFTEN

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.700
THE BABY
GIVES THE LEAD.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.000
NOTICE HERE HOW
CALLUM, AGE 13 WEEKS,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.500
AND HIS MOTHER SEEM
TO TAKE TURNS TO TALK

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.000
AS IN ADULT CONVERSATION,
AND THAT CALLUM

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.500
SEEMS TO HAVE AS MUCH TO
CONTRIBUTE AS HIS MOTHER.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:20.060
(BABY GURGLING)

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.860
I LOVE YOUR STORIES.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.830
CAN YOU TELL ME
SOME MORE STORIES?

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:37.830
(BABY GURGLING)

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.260
IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY
HOSTELTLER THAT MOTHERS

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.600
CAN TELL WHAT THEIR
BABIES MEAN; FOR EXAMPLE,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.660
WHETHER THEY'RE AFRAID,
HUNGRY, BORED, OR IN PAIN.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.060
DO PARENTS UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEIR BABIES MEAN

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.900
BY THE SOUNDS
THEY MAKE?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.900
WE WENT OUT ONTO THE
STREETS TO FIND OUT.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.330
...DIFFERENT
TYPES OF CRYING;

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.660
HE KIND OF WAILS IF HE
WANTS SOMETHING TO EAT.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.830
OTHERWISE HE
JUST MOANS,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.200
BUT HE DOESN'T MAKE A LOT
OF NOISE AT THE MOMENT.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.960
JUST CRYING WHEN HE
WANTS SOMETHING TO EAT

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.760
AND THAT'S ABOUT
IT AT THE MOMENT.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.900
BUT HE'S ONLY
A WEEK OLD.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.000
WITHIN A FEW HOURS YOU
CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.900
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL
YOUR BABY'S CRY FROM ANY

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.560
OTHER BABY WITHIN A FEW
HOURS OF IT BEING BORN.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.530
DIFFERENT CRIES - HE HAS
ANGRY CRIES, FRUSTRATED

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.660
CRIES, HUNGRY CRIES,
I-WANT-ATTENTION CRIES.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:36.000
YOU CAN TELL
BY THE PITCH.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.630
SHE'S GOT LIKE
A HYENA LAUGH

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.260
- NOT LAUGH, A HYENA CRY -
WHENEVER SHE'S HUNGRY,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.330
SO WE ALWAYS KNOW
WHEN SHE'S HUNGRY.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.930
AND WHEN SHE'S TIRED
IT'S JUST MORE OF A...

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.830
MOAN.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.430
...A MOAN, ISN'T
IT REALLY?

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.000
OOH, DIFFICULT.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.900
I JUST TRY THINGS,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.800
IF I THINK SHE'S HUNGRY
I TRY TO FEED HER.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.430
BUT IT'S JUST A GUESS,
JUST GUESS WORK.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.860
SHE SORT OF SCREAMS
IF SHE'S HUNGRY.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.900
IF SHE'S HUNGRY SHE JUST
SORT OF WHIMPS, OOH, OOH.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.500
I THINK A MOTHER
JUST KNOWS.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.530
I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.660
I MEAN, IF HE'S JUST
WHINGING, YOU KNOW,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.260
MAYBE HE JUST WANTS A CUDDLE
OR IF HE'S REALLY CRYING

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.100
WITH TEARS, YOU KNOW, HE'S
EITHER TEETHING OR HUNGRY.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.460
OR A NAPPY.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.430
OR A NAPPY, YEAH.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.000
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF YOU
FED THEM AND CHANGED

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.860
THEIR NAPPY AND THEY'RE
STILL SCREAMING?

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.200
WE HAVEN'T
A CLUE THEN.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.060
GET THE OLD
TEETHING GEL OUT.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.900
HE'S GOT WHAT I CALL AN
"ALARM" CRY WHERE HE'S

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.100
UH, UH, UH, WHICH MEANS
HE'S JUST TIRED BASICALLY

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.300
AND YOU'VE JUST GOT TO
LIE HIM DOWN AND JUST

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.430
LEAVE HIM AND QUIETEN
HIM DOWN SOMEWHERE.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.460
AND IF HE WANTS
SOMETHING BADLY

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.530
THEN HIS ARMS START
GOING LIKE THIS.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.560
SO THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW
IF HE WANTS SOMETHING,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.960
IF HE'S SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE A MUG

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.530
OR SOMETHING BRIGHTLY
COLORED THAT HE WANTS.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.200
THEN THAT'S
WHAT IT IS.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.600
NOW SEE IF YOU CAN
TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.400
TO THESE FOUR BABIES
BY THE SOUNDS THEY MAKE.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:24.200
(BABY LAUGHING)

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:34.500
(BABY STARTING TO CRY)

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:41.060
(BABY PUFFING)

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:48.660
(BABY PUFFING)

00:06:48.660 --> 00:07:01.500
(BABY CRYING)

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:10.030
BETHAN WAS ENJOYING
BEING CHASED.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.760
IT WASN'T EASY TO GUESS WHAT
BEN WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.200
OH, DEAR. IT'S THOSE
TEETH, ISN'T IT?

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.300
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS THAT YOUR TEETH HURT?

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.300
YES.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:33.230
BRANDON WAS STRUGGLING
TO MOVE AROUND.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.830
AMBER WAS VERY
TIRED AND OBJECTING

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:41.960
TO HAVING HER
NAPPY CHANGED.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.430
GRADUALLY BABIES COME TO
EXPRESS THEIR EMOTIONS

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.730
MORE CLEARLY.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.400
INSTEAD OF BEING ASLEEP,
PEACEFULLY AWAKE,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.200
OR AGITATED, THEY SHOW
INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZABLE

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.060
EMOTIONS DURING
THE FIRST YEAR.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.400
HERE ARE SOME RECOGNIZABLE
STEPS IN THE DEVELOPMENT

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.630
OF DIFFERENT EMOTIONAL
STATES IN BABIES.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.030
YOU CAN FIND A COPY OF THIS
TABLE IN THE USER'S GUIDE.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.660
FROM BIRTH BABIES SHOW
GENERAL DISTRESS -

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.830
CRYING WITH THEIR
EYES TIGHTLY SHUT.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.560
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN
THEY'RE IN PAIN.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.800
AT TWO MONTHS
THEY SHOW ENJOYMENT

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.000
WITH A SMILING MOUTH
AND WIDENING EYES,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.830
PERHAPS WHEN SEEING
THEIR MOTHER.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.330
BY THREE MONTHS THEY
SHOW A SENSE OF FUN,

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.300
AS SHOWN BY LAUGHING
PERHAPS WHEN TICKLED.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:33.230
ANGER IS SEEN AT AROUND
THREE TO FOUR MONTHS.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.060
THE BABY CRIES WITH
OPEN EYES WHEN ANNOYED;

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.700
FOR EXAMPLE, IF HE
CAN'T REACH A TOY.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.860
BY SIX MONTHS BABIES CAN
BE SEEN TO ENJOY A JOKE;

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.230
PERHAPS BY SHOWING
AMUSEMENT WHEN A PARENT

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.060
DOES SOMETHING UNUSUAL.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.600
THEY ALSO SHOW
WARINESS AT SIX MONTHS.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.330
THE BABY QUIETENS, STARES,
FROWNS, AND MAY TURN AWAY;

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:58.330
FOR EXAMPLE, IF A
STRANGER APPROACHES.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:00.160
AT AROUND NINE MONTHS

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.200
EXPRESSIONS OF
FEAR ARE SEEN.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.000
THE BABY STARES,
FROWNS, PULLS HIS MOUTH

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.930
STRAIGHT BACK, AND
FREEZES WHEN CONFRONTED,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.500
FOR EXAMPLE, WITH
HEIGHTS OR A BIG DROP.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.960
AS WITH ADULTS, SOME
COMMUNICATION INVOLVES

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.500
NON-VERBAL MEANS
AS WELL AS SPOKEN.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.360
LET'S TAKE SMILING
AND LAUGHING

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.230
AS SIGNS OF PLEASURE.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.830
BEFORE EIGHT WEEKS, BABIES
SMILE AT ALL HUMAN FACES.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.830
BUT THEN THEY SEEM TO
LEARN WHAT THEIR FAMILY

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.130
LOOK LIKE AND WILL OVER THE
NEXT FEW MONTHS TEND TO

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.630
SMILE MOST READILY AT
PEOPLE THEY KNOW AND LIKE.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.130
IN FACT, AS ATTACHMENT
DEVELOPS THEY OFTEN LOOK

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.660
UNHAPPY AT THE SIGHT OF
A STRANGER'S FACE AND

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.630
PROTEST AT SEPARATION
FROM THE PARENT.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.200
LAUGHTER DEVELOPS
AT ABOUT 14 WEEKS,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.260
AND THERE MAY BE HINTS
OF INCIPIENT LAUGHTER

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.700
IN THE PRECEDING WEEKS.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.600
LET'S ASK SOME PARENTS
WHAT BABIES FIND FUNNY.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.130
STUPID THINGS. YEAH, YOU
JUST PULL FACES AT HIM

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.260
AND HE GIGGLES
LIKE ANYTHING.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:05.060
THIS BABY LOVES TO
EAT ALL THE TIME.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.160
IF I SAY "WOOF,
WOOF, WOOF".

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.530
IF I TICKLE HIM UNDER THE
ARMPITS OR BITE HIS FEET.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.660
WHAT MAKES YOU LAUGH?

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.830
BEING TICKLED MAINLY.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.000
UM, HE'S QUITE
GIGGLY AND LAUGHS AT

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.230
A LOT OF THINGS LATELY;
JUST SILLY THINGS.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.860
HOW DO YOU MAKE
JACOB LAUGH?

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:28.260
IF I THROW SOMETHING OR IF
I WHISTLE HE MIGHT LAUGH.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.800
WHEN YOU WHISTLE,
SOMETIMES HE DOES LAUGH

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.700
WHEN YOU BLOW
THE WHISTLE.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.500
OR SOMETIMES IF YOU
JUMP UP AND DOWN

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.500
HE LAUGHS, DOESN'T HE?

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.960
ESPECIALLY IF
IT'S ON YOUR BED.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.100
BABBLING EMERGES DURING
THE PRE-VERBAL STAGE.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.160
FROM ABOUT THREE MONTHS TO
12-MONTHS-OLD, BABIES BEGIN

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.200
TO EXPERIMENT WITH ALL
THE SOUNDS THEY CAN MAKE.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.760
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF
BABBLING ARE SINGLE VOWEL

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.360
AND CONSONANT SOUNDS
REPEATED OVER AND OVER,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.460
WITH VARYING INTONATION.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.660
BAH-BAH-BAH.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.530
BAH-BAH-BAH.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.330
BABIES WHO WILL
EVENTUALLY SPEAK

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.300
ENGLISH, FRENCH,
OR CHINESE

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.760
ALL SOUND THE SAME AT
THE START OF THIS STAGE.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.200
IT'S NOT A REFLECTION
OF THE SOUNDS THEY HEAR

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.030
AROUND THEM, BUT
MORE A PRACTICING

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:20.130
OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.060
(BABBLING)

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.860
THE BABBLING OF THIS
EIGHT-MONTH OLD

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.260
SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR
TO OTHER BABIES.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.130
ONE WOULDN'T KNOW
FROM HIS BABBLING

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.260
THAT HIS MOTHER
SPEAKS CHINESE TO HIM.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.930
BUT IN A FEW MONTHS TIME
HIS BABBLING WILL REFLECT

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.700
THE SOUNDS OF HIS
NATIVE LANGUAGE.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.330
DEAF CHILDREN ALSO
BABBLE, BUT IT'S DELAYED.

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:43.400
THE ABILITY TO HEAR
THEMSELVES MAKE SOUNDS

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.160
SEEMS TO
CONTRIBUTE TO

00:11:45.160 --> 00:12:10.330
BABIES' LANGUAGE
DEVELOPMENT.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.560
SINCE ALL OF THESE THINGS
TEND TO HAPPEN TO

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.330
ALL BABIES IN THE SAME
SEQUENCE, IT APPEARS THAT

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.600
EARLY LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT
IS A MATURATION PROCESS.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.630
BABIES CAN NOW USE SOUNDS
AS WELL AS ACTIONS

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.930
TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED
EFFECT IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.160
MOVING OUT OF THE
PRE-VERBAL STAGE,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.530
MANY BABIES PRODUCE
A FAIRLY RECOGNIZABLE

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.130
FIRST WORD BY ABOUT
TEN MONTHS OF AGE.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.530
THERE'S QUITE A WIDE AGE
RANGE FOR THIS AND THE

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.430
AVERAGE AGE FOR FIRST
WORDS IS 13.6 MONTHS.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:45.130
"LOOK AND LISTEN",

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.300
OH, THIS IS OUR
FAVORITE BOOK, ISN'T IT?

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.860
WHAT ARE BABY'S
FIRST WORDS?

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.130
IT'S INTERESTING TO MAKE
A COLLECTION OF THEM.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.060
YOU'LL FIND THAT THEY'RE
USUALLY THE NAMES

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.000
FOR FAMILIAR
OBJECTS OR PEOPLE.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.160
DE VILLIERS GAVE TWO
CRITERIA FOR FIRST WORDS.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.000
FIRSTLY THEY MUST
APPROXIMATE TO THE

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.260
ADULT WORD, AND SECONDLY
THEY MUST BE USED

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:14.130
CONSISTENTLY IN
SIMILAR SITUATIONS.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.560
THERE IS A PERIOD NOW
TO AROUND A YEAR OLD

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.230
WHEN BABIES TEND TO LEAVE
LANGUAGE FOR A WHILE

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.900
TO CONCENTRATE ON OTHER
ASPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT.

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.900
PAUSE THE VIDEO AND
CONSIDER WHAT OTHER

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.130
ASPECTS OF DEVELOPMENT
ONE-YEAR-OLD MICHAEL

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:37.030
WILL BE
CONCENTRATING ON.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.530
SOON AFTERWARDS, THE
SINGLE WORD SENTENCE

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.230
STAGE ARRIVES
WHERE CHILDREN

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.300
PUT ALL THE MEANING
THEY NEED INTO ONE WORD.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.760
ONE WORD MAY
MEAN MANY THINGS.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.500
FOR EXAMPLE, "DADDY" CAN
MEAN "THERE IS DADDY"

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.460
OR "I WANT TO
GO TO DADDY".

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.860
ACCORDING TO WHICH
WORDS WERE USED FIRST,

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.730
NELSON DESCRIBED CHILDREN
AS "EXPRESSIVE"

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.460
OR "REFERENTIAL".

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.100
EXPRESSIVE CHILDREN USED
MOSTLY WORDS WHICH REFERRED

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.000
TO SOCIAL SITUATIONS SUCH
AS "BYE BYE" OR "STOP IT",

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.760
WHEREAS REFERENTIAL
CHILDREN USED THE NAMES

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.500
OF OBJECTS, FOR
EXAMPLE "CAT", "BOOK".

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.600
THIS APPEARED TO DEPEND
ON WHETHER THE PARENTS

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.060
PRIMARILY USED LANGUAGE
IN A SOCIAL CONTEXT

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.160
OR IN A COGNITIVE
CONTEXT.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.430
CHILDREN ALSO OVER
GENERALIZE AND MAY,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.400
FOR INSTANCE, CALL ALL
FOUR-LEGGED ANIMALS DOGS,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.300
OR CAUSE
EMBARRASSMENT BY

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.960
CALLING EVERY MAN
THEY MEET DADDY.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.560
DADDY.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.660
I'M NOT DADDY, I'M
THE CAMERA MAN.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:44.160
THE SIMPLE COMMUNICATION
OF BODILY STATES

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.630
IS LIKE THAT OF
ANY OTHER ANIMALS.

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.230
BUT WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT
OF WORDS, BABIES LEAVE

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.600
THIS STAGE AND MOVE INTO
THE REALMS OF SYMBOLISM.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.430
A WORD CAN BE USED TO
STAND FOR AN OBJECT,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.930
AND REFER TO IT
IN ITS ABSENCE.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:04.600
WORDS CAN BE USED TO TALK
ABOUT YESTERDAY, TOMORROW,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.700
AND WHAT MAY HAPPEN, AND NOT
JUST IN THE HERE AND NOW.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:12.100
WITH THIS SYMBOLIC
FUNCTION ESTABLISHED

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:21.560
CHILDREN NOW GO ON TO FULL
LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.500
IT'S THE SYMBOLIC
NATURE OF LANGUAGE

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.560
THAT IS ONE OF THE
UNIQUE FEATURES

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.730
THAT SETS US APART
FROM OTHER ANIMALS.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.360
SOME ANIMALS CAN
UNDERSTAND A FEW WORDS,

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.530
BUT THEY CAN'T DISCUSS
ABSTRACT IDEAS WITH US.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.500
THERE ARE MANY
EXAMPLES OF COMPLEX

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.400
PATTERNS OF COMMUNICATION
IN OTHER SPECIES.

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.760
FOR EXAMPLE, VON FRISCH
IN 1955 THOUGHT THAT

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.760
WHEN WORKER BEES HAVE FOUND
A GOOD SOURCE OF FOOD

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.330
THEY RETURNED TO THE HIVE
AND EXPLAINED THE LOCATION

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.560
AND DISTANCE AWAY
TO THE OTHER BEES

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.260
THROUGH AN
ELABORATE VARIATION

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.000
OF BODY POSITIONS
AND FLYING MOVEMENTS.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.500
THIS IS NOT NOW THOUGHT
TO BE THE WHOLE STORY,

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.760
BUT NEVERTHELESS SUGGESTS
THAT EVEN THE MOST

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.360
PRIMITIVE CREATURES HAVE
A LANGUAGE OF SOME KIND.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.560
MANY OTHER SPECIES
HAVE BEEN STUDIED

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.560
BUT NONE APPEAR TO HAVE
THE SOPHISTICATION

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.200
OF HUMAN LANGUAGE.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.100
MOST STUDIES HAVE
CONCENTRATED ON OUR

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.500
NEAREST RELATIVES, THE
APES, WHO COMMUNICATE

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:21.660
IN THE WILD THROUGH
SOUNDS AND VISUAL SIGNALS.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.730
IT'S OBVIOUS, EVEN IF YOU
ARE A JUNGLE BOOK FAN,

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.200
THAT OTHER ANIMALS HAVE
NOT GOT THE VOCAL CHORDS

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.760
REQUIRED FOR HUMAN SPEECH,
AND FOR THIS REASON EARLY

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.260
ATTEMPTS TO TEACH PRIMATES
TO SPEAK WERE A FAILURE.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.630
HOWEVER, MORE RECENT
RESEARCH HAS LOOKED AT THE

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:39.030
QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY
COULD UNDERSTAND AND USE

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:42.460
HUMAN LANGUAGE IF THEY WERE
TAUGHT BY OTHER MEANS.

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.500
MANY ATTEMPTS HAVE
BEEN MADE USING

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:47.300
SUCH METHODS AS TEACHING
AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:49.860
USING HAND SIGNALS,
USING PLASTIC SYMBOLS

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.800
TO REPRESENT WORDS
AND CONCEPTS,

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.360
AND USING COMPUTER
KEYBOARDS.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.460
ALL HAVE HAD LIMITED
SUCCESS IN TEACHING

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.930
PRIMATES TO USE
WORDS AND EVEN UP TO

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.730
THREE-WORD SENTENCES
ABOUT SIMPLE THINGS.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.530
THERE'S BEEN MUCH
CRITICISM OF THE

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:07.560
METHODS USED AND
THE INTERPRETATION

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.700
PUT ON THE
APES' RESPONSES.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.230
THERE ARE MANY BIASES
THAT CAN CONFOUND RESULTS

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.560
WHEN TRYING TO OBSERVE AND
RECORD ANIMAL BEHAVIOR.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.430
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THE PROBLEMS

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:24.660
OF OBSERVATIONAL
STUDIES LATER.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.260
AS YET, NO PRIMATE HAS
ACQUIRED LANGUAGE

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.530
TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF
COMPREHENSION OF HUMAN

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.960
CHILDREN IN SPITE OF
INTENSE TRAINING PROGRAMS.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.600
THE QUESTION CONTINUES
TO INVITE INTEREST

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.600
AS IT'S CENTRAL TO THE
NATURE/NURTURE DEBATE

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.360
AND THE ARGUMENT THAT THERE
IS A QUALITATIVE DIFFERENCE

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:49.630
BETWEEN HUMANS
AND OTHER ANIMALS.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.330
NOW LET'S CONTINUE
LOOKING AT

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.630
THE DEVELOPMENT
OF HUMAN LANGUAGE.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.730
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
RESEARCH INTO THE QUESTION

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.100
OF HOW BABIES ACTUALLY
MAKE THE LEAP BETWEEN

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.930
OBJECTS, ACTIONS,
AND WORDS.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:06.330
JEROME BRUNER STATED THAT
BABIES LEARN THE PATTERN

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.530
OF FAMILIAR ROUTINES.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.400
FOR EXAMPLE,
MEAL TIMES,

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.630
AND CAN REMEMBER
THEM IN SOME WAY.

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.400
THIS MAY BE WHY THEY'RE
UPSET BY STRANGERS

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.500
WHO DO THINGS IN AN
UNPREDICTABLE MANNER.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.900
THE BABY'S KNOWLEDGE OF
THESE SOCIAL ROUTINES

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.260
IS WHAT ENABLES IT TO
"CRACK THE CODE" OF THE

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.930
LANGUAGE WHICH ACCOMPANIES
SOCIAL INTERACTION.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.330
JEROME BRUNER ALSO SAW
LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.400
IN TERMS OF A WAY FOR
CHILDREN TO SOLVE PROBLEMS,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.230
SUCH AS "HOW CAN I GET
MOM TO GIVE ME A DRINK?

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.800
HALLIDAY SUGGESTED THAT
LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT WAS

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.230
ALL PART OF CHILDRENS'
ATTEMPTS TO MASTER AND

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.400
INFLUENCE THEIR WORLD; FOR
EXAMPLE, TO GET PEOPLE

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.600
TO DO THINGS AND
BRING THINGS TO THEM.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.460
MARGARET HARRIS SPENT
MANY HOURS WATCHING

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.330
MOTHERS AND
BABIES TOGETHER.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.030
SHE FOUND THAT
MOTHERS PREDICTED

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.030
WHAT THE CHILDREN
WERE ABOUT TO DO

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.830
AND THEY WOULD PUT
THIS INTO WORDS.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.800
SO JUST AS THE CHILD
THOUGHT OF KNOCKING

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.530
OVER THE BRICKS,
MOTHER WOULD SAY,

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.800
"ARE YOU GOING TO
KNOCK THEM ALL DOWN?"

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.460
HARRIS SHOWED THAT 80%
OF MOTHER'S UTTERANCES

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.160
AT THE AGE OF 16 MONTHS
REFERRED TO THE OBJECT

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.230
ON WHICH THE CHILD WAS
FOCUSING AS SHE SPOKE.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.230
INTERESTINGLY, SHE
ALSO NOTED THAT MOTHERS

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.300
OF SLOW
LANGUAGE DEVELOPERS

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.830
DIDN'T GET THIS
TIMING EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:19.800
SHE ALSO SUGGESTED
THAT THE REASON WHY

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.100
BLIND CHILDRENS' LANGUAGE
IS DELAYED IS THAT

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.330
THEY LACK THIS VISUAL
CONTEXT FOR WORD LEARNING.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:28.630
ONCE THE CHILD HAS GRASPED
THE IDEA OF USING WORDS,

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.060
THERE IS THEN A STAGE
OF VOCABULARY LEARNING

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:36.560
WHERE PARENTS ACTIVELY
TEACH THE NAMES OF THINGS.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:42.460
IT'S A MAN... A MAN.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.900
THERE IS THEN A VERY RAPID
STAGE OF WORD ACQUISITION.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:47.760
WE'LL MOVE ON
TO THIS STAGE

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.460
AFTER WE'VE LOOKED
AT THE THEORIES.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.330
BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGISTS
SUCH AS B.F. SKINNER

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.060
BELIEVED THAT CHILDREN
LEARN LANGUAGE

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.830
BY THE PROCESS
OF IMITATION,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.530
AND THAT THIS IS SHAPED
BY OPERANT CONDITIONING.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.660
THAT IS, PARENTS ARE
CONSTANTLY REWARDING

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:03.700
OR REINFORCING THE
CHILD'S ATTEMPTS

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.330
TO IMITATE SPEECH.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:10.030
HELLO DUCK.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.360
ALTHOUGH IMITATION DOES
PLAY SOME PART IN LANGUAGE

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.630
- ESPECIALLY IN
ACQUIRING VOCABULARY -

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.130
IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT
THE WHOLE STORY.

00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.430
FOR EXAMPLE, CHILDREN
CREATE ORIGINAL SENTENCES

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:45.900
AND SAY THINGS WHICH THEY'VE
NEVER HEARD ADULTS SAY.

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.030
SOME OF THE RULES OF
GRAMMAR THAT CHILDREN

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:50.500
HAVE TO ACQUIRE ARE
ACTUALLY VERY COMPLICATED,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:21:04.760
AND THEY'RE EASIER
TO USE THAN EXPLAIN.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.830
YOU CAN SEE NOW WHY
ADULTS WOULD FIND IT

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.730
VERY DIFFICULT
TO EXPLAIN

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.430
THE RULES OF LANGUAGE
TO CHILDREN.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.530
IN ANY CASE, ADULT
SPEECH HAS MANY

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:14.360
GRAMMATICAL ERRORS
IN IT, SO CHILDREN

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.900
DON'T NECESSARILY
HEAR GOOD LANGUAGE.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.030
IT SEEMS THEN THAT
IMITATION CAN'T BE

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.200
THE ONLY WAY THAT
CHILDREN ACQUIRE LANGUAGE.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.430
THE OTHER POSSIBILITY IS
THAT LANGUAGE IS INNATE.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.360
NOAM CHOMSKY PROPOSED THAT
CHILDREN ARE BIOLOGICALLY

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.960
PRE-PROGRAMMED TO
ACQUIRE LANGUAGE.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.430
HE SUGGESTED THAT CHILDREN
HAVE WHAT HE CALLED

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.700
A "LANGUAGE
ACQUISITION DEVICE"

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.560
WHICH HELPS THEM TO ACQUIRE
THE RULES OF GRAMMAR.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.700
HE CLAIMED THAT THE DEEP
STRUCTURE OF ALL LANGUAGES

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.030
ARE THE SAME, AND
THEREFORE AN INHERITED

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.800
LANGUAGE ACQUISITION
DEVICE IS UNIVERSAL.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.000
THIS COULD EXPLAIN THE
FACT THAT ALL CHILDREN

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.060
GO THROUGH THE SAME
LANGUAGE STAGES

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.430
AND TEND TO MAKE THE
SAME LANGUAGE MISTAKES

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:58.930
INSTEAD OF SIMPLY
MIMICKING ADULTS.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.300
♪ A NEIGH, NEIGH HERE AND
A NEIGH, NEIGH THERE ♪

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.430
♪ HERE A NEIGH,
THERE A NEIGH, ♪

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.330
♪ EVERYWHERE A
NEIGH, NEIGH ♪

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:12.400
♪ OLD MACDONALD HAD A
FARM, EE-EYE-EE-EYE-OH. ♪

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.730
WE ALSO KNOW FROM
BRAIN STUDIES THAT

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.700
THERE ARE SPECIALIZED
AREAS OF THE BRAIN

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.730
RESPONSIBLE FOR
LANGUAGE PROCESSING.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.260
THE PRIMARY AUDITORY
AREA RECEIVES A SIGNAL

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.400
FROM THE EAR AND TRANSMITS
IT VIA NERVE FIBERS

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.130
TO WERNICKE'S AREA IN
THE LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE,

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:34.000
WHICH IS RELATED TO
UNDERSTANDING OF LANGUAGE.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.560
THIS IS THEN TRANSMITTED
TO BROCA'S AREA

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.400
ON THE LEFT
FRONTAL LOBE

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.930
WHICH IS RELATED TO THE
PRODUCTION OF SPEECH.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.000
AND THE MOTOR AREA
DRIVES OUR MUSCLES

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.860
TO PRODUCE SPEECH.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.100
FURTHER SUPPORT FOR
BIOLOGICAL PRE-PROGRAMMING

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.200
COMES FROM LENNEBERG,
AMONG OTHERS,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.830
WHO SUGGESTED
THAT THERE MAY BE

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.460
CRITICAL PERIODS FOR
LANGUAGE LEARNING.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.530
EVIDENCE HAS COME FROM
STUDIES OF SEVERELY

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:58.960
EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY
NEGLECTED CHILDREN

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.800
WHO HAVE BEEN REARED IN
SOME KIND OF ISOLATION.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.660
WHEN THEY'RE DISCOVERED,
THESE CHILDREN

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.760
CANNOT SPEAK AND THEY
DO SEEM TO HAVE PROBLEMS

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.860
IN LEARNING TO
SPEAK LATER.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.230
A RECENT CASE IN GREAT
BRITAIN DESCRIBED A

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.630
FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
WHO'D BEEN LEFT ALONE

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.000
IN A DARK BEDROOM FOR
UP TO 22 HOURS A DAY.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.660
SHE COULD ONLY COMMUNICATE
BY GRUNTS AND SQUEALS

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:22.630
WHEN SHE CAME TO SCHOOL.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.200
HOWEVER, IN MANY OF
THE REPORTED CASES

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.300
THE CHILDREN HAVE ACQUIRED
SOME LANGUAGE WHEN

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:34.160
SUBSEQUENTLY BROUGHT UP
IN A NORMAL ENVIRONMENT.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.130
TO SUMMARIZE THE DEBATE
ON LANGUAGE ACQUISITION:

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.600
CHOMSKY TAKES THE
POSITION THAT WE'RE BORN

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.460
WITH A PREDISPOSITION
TO LEARN LANGUAGE.

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:47.760
SUPPORT COMES FROM THE
FACT THAT CHILDREN ALL

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.530
OVER THE WORLD LEARN IN
THE SAME WAY; THAT WE HAVE

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.200
SPECIALIZED NERVE CELLS
FOR LANGUAGE PROCESSING;

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:56.630
THAT DEAF BABIES BABBLE;
THAT BABIES WHO HAVE BEEN

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.560
ISOLATED DURING CERTAIN
CRITICAL PERIODS

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.700
DO NOT ACQUIRE
NORMAL LANGUAGE;

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:04.400
AND THAT LANGUAGE IS
ESSENTIAL FOR SURVIVAL.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.360
SKINNER TAKES THE
OPPOSING VIEW THAT

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.400
BABIES LEARN FROM
THE ENVIRONMENT,

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.160
FROM HEARING
LANGUAGE AROUND THEM,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.060
BEING ENCOURAGED
BY PARENTS,

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.600
AND BY IMITATING AND
OBSERVING OTHERS.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.660
THE MAJOR PROBLEM
WITH THIS VIEW

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.730
IS THAT CHILDREN PRODUCE
UNIQUE LANGUAGE

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.960
THAT THEY COULD NOT
HAVE HEARD BEFORE.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.400
THE INTERACTIONIST VIEW
SUGGESTS THAT ALL THESE

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.930
FACTORS COMBINED WITH
GOOD HEALTH AND NUTRITION

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.830
ASSIST THE DEVELOPMENT
OF LANGUAGE.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:35.200
NOW TO RETURN TO THE
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.860
HAVING PASSED THROUGH THE
PRE-VERBAL AND SINGLE-WORD

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.000
SENTENCE STAGES, CHILDREN
NOW MOVE TO USING SHORT

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.560
SENTENCES FROM ABOUT 18
MONTHS TO TWO YEARS OLD.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.000
THEY SPEAK IN A KIND OF
TELEGRAMMATIC FASHION,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.700
OMITTING THE LESS
IMPORTANT WORDS.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.360
IS IT YOURS?

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.430
ARE YOU GOING
TO DRIVE IT?

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.530
(UNINTELLIGIBLE)

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.660
DID YOU? WHAT COLOR?

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.430
YELLOW, BLUE, PURPLE.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.360
IS THAT WHAT
COLOR MY CAR IS?

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.600
IT BLACK.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.700
ALTHOUGH THEIR
SENTENCES ARE SHORT,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.230
THEIR ABILITY TO REMEMBER
THE WORDS OF RHYMES AND SONGS

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.860
SUGGESTS THAT THIS IS NOT
DUE TO POOR MEMORY SPAN.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:27.930
(SINGING)

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:35.600
(SINGING)

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.200
IT HAS BEEN REPORTED BY
WAGNER THAT YOUNG CHILDREN

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.230
MAY SPEAK 20,000 TO
30,000 WORDS A DAY.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.730
BY TWO AND A HALF,
CHILDREN HAVE A VOCABULARY

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:46.100
OF OVER 400 WORDS.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.700
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS
COULD BE CALCULATED?

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.600
THIS COULD MAKE AN
INTERESTING PRACTICAL

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.260
STUDY WITH A CHILD
THAT YOU KNOW.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.260
THERE'S MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS

00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:01.300
IN THE USER'S GUIDE.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:07.300
(SINGING)

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.630
LANGUAGE NOW BECOMES
SOMETHING TO PLAY WITH

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.500
AND A WAY OF SHARING
AND ENJOYING THINGS.

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.230
EARLY RHYMES AND STORIES
START TO BRING THE HISTORY

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.260
AND CULTURE OF THE
WORLD OUTSIDE THE

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:21.060
CHILD'S IMMEDIATE FAMILY
INTO HIS OR HER LIFE.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.300
IN THE SPEECH ERRORS
THAT CHILDREN MAKE

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.300
WE CAN SEE HOW THEY'RE
GRADUALLY WORKING OUT

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.630
THE RULES OF GRAMMAR
FOR THEMSELVES.

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.530
PARENTS DO GRADUALLY
INCREASE DEMANDS FOR

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.400
ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE AND
OFTEN INSIST ON THE CHILD

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:36.200
USING SPECIFIC AND
EXTENDED PHRASES.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.830
FOR EXAMPLE,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:40.900
"SAY 'PLEASE GIVE
ME THE BALL'".

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.760
MAY I WHAT?

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.660
PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND
THAT ADULTS TEND TO

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.760
RESPOND TO THE
TRUTHFULNESS OF YOUNG

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.960
CHILDRENS' UTTERANCES
RATHER THAN THE GRAMMAR.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.160
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE CHILD
SAYS "THAT ARE A DUCK",

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.760
IT WOULD BE CORRECTED
TO "NO, THAT'S A HEN"

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.060
RATHER THAN
"THAT IS A DUCK".

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.030
CHILDREN TODAY ACQUIRE
A LARGER VOCABULARY

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.930
THAN THEY USED TO,
PROBABLY BECAUSE

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:09.100
OF THE INFLUENCE
OF THE MASS MEDIA.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:11.260
HOWEVER, PUTTING A YOUNG
CHILD IN FRONT OF A

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:13.860
TELEVISION HOPING IT WILL
TEACH HIM TO SPEAK WELL

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.830
DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A VERY
SUCCESSFUL APPROACH.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.730
IT'S THE HUMAN INTERACTION
IN THE LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.430
THAT ENCOURAGES THE
CHILD TO LEARN LANGUAGE.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.130
NOTE HOW THESE
PARENTS ENCOURAGE

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.100
THEIR DAUGHTERS'
LANGUAGE.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.900
WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.660
THEY'RE JUST MOVING.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.600
JUST MOVING?

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:38.260
(BABBLING)

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.230
YOU MAY ALSO HAVE
NOTED THE SPECIAL WAY

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.160
IN WHICH PEOPLE
SPEAK TO CHILDREN.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.400
THIS IS CALLED
"PARENTESE".

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.330
IT'S BEEN FOUND TO TAKE
A VERY SIMILAR FORM

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:47.860
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:50.860
WHAT DO YOU THINK ARE THE
MAIN FEATURES OF PARENTESE?

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.000
LISTEN TO THESE ADULTS
TALKING TO CHILDREN

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.030
AND THEN SEE IF
YOU CAN DEFINE IT.

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:58.460
OH, DEAR. OH, DEAR.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.600
I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT WAS A YES OR NO

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.030
OR IT'S GOOD OR BAD.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:07.730
IT'S TIME FOR HOME, OKAY?

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:12.300
IT'S TIME FOR HOME.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:17.400
OH, HE'S A GORGEOUS BOY.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.200
HE'S A LOVELY
LITTLE BOY.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:39.260
CAN I HAVE A SMILE?
CAN I HAVE A SMILE?

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.460
PUT IT THERE,
PUT IT THERE.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.330
YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT
WE SEEM TO MAKE OUR SPEECH

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.360
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND BY
USING FAMILIAR WORDS,

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.500
SOMETIMES IN A
CHILD'S FORM.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.200
OUR SENTENCES
ARE SHORTER,

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.100
AND THERE'S A CHANGE
IN PITCH AND INTONATION.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.130
NOW, HAVING LOOKED AT SOME
OF THE WAYS THAT CHILDRENS'

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.200
LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT
CAN BE STIMULATED,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.630
WE'D LIKE YOU AS PSYCHOLOGY
STUDENTS TO CONSIDER

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:57.460
WHAT ADVICE YOU COULD
GIVE TO PARENTS ON THIS.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.530
AND WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR
WITH THE ENDLESS

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.460
WHY? WHY? WHY?

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.300
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT WE TRY TO ANSWER

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:05.700
CHILDRENS' QUESTIONS.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:18.460
WHY? WHY?

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.160
AND OF COURSE WE CAN
STIMULATE CHILDRENS'

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.360
LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT
WITH A SAFE, HAPPY,

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.100
AND INTERESTING
ENVIRONMENT WITH PLENTY

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.430
OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR
EXPANDING VOCABULARY.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.700
SO ALL THESE THINGS COME
TOGETHER TO ASSIST

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:33.130
THE MOVE THROUGH THE
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.430
THE NEED TO COMMUNICATE,
THE NEED TO INTERACT WITH

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.860
ATTACHMENT FIGURES,
THE NEED TO LISTEN,

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.100
THE NEED TO CONTROL THE
ENVIRONMENT, AND THE NEED

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.530
TO BE ENCOURAGED TO
INCREASE VOCABULARY,

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.300
LEADING TO THE USE OF
LANGUAGE AS A SYMBOLIC TOOL.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.560
BY THE TIME A CHILD
GOES TO SCHOOL,

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.030
THE BASIC GRAMMATICAL
RULES HAVE BEEN LEARNED,

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.730
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
STILL MANY EXCEPTIONS

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.630
TO THE RULES AND
IRREGULAR WORDS

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:56.460
TO BE LEARNED IN
THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.060
LANGUAGE CAN NOW BE
USED TO ENJOY JOKES AND

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.630
PLAY-ON-WORDS, AND A
LARGE REPERTOIRE OF

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:07.430
PLAYGROUND GAMES AND
RHYMES IS ACQUIRED.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:13.230
♪ THIS IS HOW THEY
COUNT THEIR MONEY ♪

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:15.800
♪ TURN AROUND.... ♪

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.060
LANGUAGE ALSO ALLOWS
CHILDREN TO EXPRESS

00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.160
THEIR THOUGHTS AND
CREATIVE IDEAS.

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.100
WELL, AS I AM A
SECRETIVE AGENT...

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.760
NOW, IT'S
VERY HARD WORK.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.830
YOU HAVE TO DESTROY
A LOT OF BADDIES.

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:33.160
SO YOU DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE
NOT AT SCHOOL, DO YOU?

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.200
I DO IT IN
THE PLAYGROUND.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:42.030
AND I ALSO DO ROBBERIES,
BUT I DON'T KILL THEM.

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.860
I DON'T FIGHT
ROBBERIES A LOT.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.530
AND SOMETIMES THERE'S
A CRIME ROBBERY.

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:51.300
BY SEVEN YEARS OLD
CHILDRENS' SPOKEN LANGUAGE

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.230
IS VERY SIMILAR
TO ADULTS'.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.230
BUT OF COURSE LANGUAGE
LEARNING CONTINUES

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.700
FOR A LONG
TIME TO COME.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.130
PSYCHOLOGISTS DEBATE WHETHER
WE NEED LANGUAGE TO THINK,

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:04.130
OR WE NEED TO THINK
FIRST TO HAVE LANGUAGE.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.360
BENJAMIN WHORF
TOOK THE VIEW THAT

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:23.430
THOUGHT IS DEPENDENT
ON LANGUAGE.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.830
A COMMON EXAMPLE IS THAT
INUITS - ESKIMOS -

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.600
HAVE MORE THAN 12
WORDS FOR SNOW.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.460
THEY PERCEIVE AND
THINK ABOUT SNOW

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:33.760
IN A VERY DIFFERENT
WAY FROM US.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.900
UNDERSTANDING AND
DESCRIBING SNOW IS

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.360
OBVIOUSLY MORE IMPORTANT
TO AN INUIT'S WAY OF LIFE

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.560
THAN TO OURS.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.860
THESE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES
OBVIOUSLY DETERMINE

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.860
THE TYPE AND EXTENT
OF VOCABULARY

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.630
AN INDIVIDUAL
CHILD ACQUIRES.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.630
LEWIS IS ALREADY
ACQUIRING MANY WORDS

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.230
THAT WOULD NOT BE IN
AN INUIT'S VOCABULARY.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.860
PAUSE THE VIDEO
FOR A MINUTE

00:32:53.860 --> 00:33:16.900
AND CONSIDER WHAT
THESE WORDS MIGHT BE.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.200
THE WHORF-SAPIR
HYPOTHESIS STATES THAT

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.730
WE CAN'T PERCEIVE WHAT WE
HAVEN'T GOT WORDS FOR,

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:23.830
BUT LEWIS WILL ALREADY
BE LEARNING TO USE WORDS

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.760
CONNECTED WITH A
WARMER CLIMATE,

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.530
OUTDOOR ACTIVITY,
GARDENS, AND NATURE.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.760
HE CAN OBVIOUSLY ALSO
PERCEIVE GOING ON HOLIDAY

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:41.360
TO THE SEASIDE.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.500
JEAN PIAGET HELD THE
OPPOSITE VIEW TO WHORF

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.760
AND BELIEVED THAT
CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:49.160
PRECEDED SEMANTIC
DEVELOPMENT.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.200
SOMETIMES CHILDRENS'
LANGUAGE MAY GIVE US

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.800
A CLUE TO THEIR LEVEL OF
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.760
FOR EXAMPLE, THE USE OF
"ALL GONE" MAY BE LINKED

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.760
TO AN UNDERSTANDING
OF OBJECT PERMANENCE.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.700
THE DEBATE CONTINUES,
BUT WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.730
THERE'S A VERY STRONG
LINK BETWEEN LANGUAGE

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:07.000
AND THOUGHT AS EVIDENCED
BY THESE CHILDREN

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.730
SOLVING VERBAL QUESTIONS
USING THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE.

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:13.930
JOHN IS TALLER THAN PAUL;
PAUL IS TALLER THAN JANE.

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:17.230
WHO IS THE TALLEST?
-JOHN.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.230
WHO IS THE TALLEST?
-JOHN.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.900
WHO IS THE TALLEST?
-JOHN.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.930
VERY GOOD.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:27.430
VYGOTSKY TAKES AN
INTERACTIONIST VIEW.

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:29.300
HE SUGGESTS THAT
LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.200
ARE QUITE SEPARATE
ACTIVITIES WHICH

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.230
COME TOGETHER AND INTERACT
AT AROUND TWO YEARS OLD.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:37.900
WE'VE NOTED THAT CHILDREN
ALL ACQUIRE LANGUAGE

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.430
IN THE SAME SEQUENCE, BUT
THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:42.600
DIFFERENCES IN HOW
QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.600
LANGUAGE IS
LEARNED AND USED.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.660
FOR EXAMPLE, BOYS
ACQUIRE LANGUAGE

00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:49.530
ON AVERAGE A LITTLE
LATER THAN GIRLS.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.860
ACTIVE CHILDREN SEEM
TO USE FEWER WORDS

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.900
THAN LESS ACTIVE ONES.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.930
PREMATURE, ABUSED,
BLIND, AND DEAF CHILDREN

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.530
MAY ALL SHOW SOME
LANGUAGE DELAY.

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.560
IN TWINS AND OTHER
MULTIPLE BIRTHS,

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.700
LANGUAGE IS OFTEN
DELAYED BECAUSE NOT ONLY

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.960
ARE THEY OFTEN PREMATURE
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THE

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.060
UNIQUE SITUATION WHERE
THEY'RE COMMUNICATING

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.200
MAINLY WITH SOMEONE AT THE
SAME DEVELOPMENTAL LEVEL.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.560
THEY CAN BE HELPED BY
MIXING WITH OTHER CHILDREN

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.760
OF DIFFERENT AGES
AND HAVING PLENTY OF

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.060
INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION
FROM ADULTS.

00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.760
THE RANGE OF NORMAL
VARIATION IS CONSIDERABLE,

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.030
AND MOST CHILDREN DO
EVENTUALLY COME TO

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.560
DEVELOP LANGUAGE
SKILLS FULLY.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.830
CURRENT EDUCATIONAL
PRACTICE IN PRIMARY

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.060
AND NURSERY SCHOOLS
HAS BEEN INFLUENCED BY

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.460
PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH,
AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.230
NOW PLAYS AN IMPORTANT
PART IN THE CURRICULUM.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.460
THE PROGRESSION FROM
SPOKEN WORDS TO READING

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.730
AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE
IS VITAL, NOT ONLY FOR

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.730
THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR
THE FUTURE OF MANKIND.

00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:47.860
ALL HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.130
WHO CAN LEARN TO READ,
AND THE FUTURE OF

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:52.400
HUMAN CIVILIZATION IS
THEREFORE DEPENDENT

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.360
ON LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT.

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.560
SO THE MESSAGE FOR
STUDENTS IS THIS:

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:02.060
(BELL RINGING)

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:06.400
GOODLY STUDENTS,
TAKE HEED.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:16.660
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO AND
IMPROVE YOUR COMMUNICATIONS!

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.530
THEY ALWAYS SAY
IN THE FILM WORLD,

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.660
"NEVER WORK WITH
CHILDREN OR ANIMALS"

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.230
AND MAKING A VIDEO LIKE
THIS YOU FIND OUT WHY.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:25.460
YOU'LL FIND WHEN CARRYING
OUT YOUR OWN STUDIES

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.430
THAT EVEN WITH THE
MOST CAREFUL PLANNING,

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:29.800
YOUNG CHILDREN AND
ANIMALS ARE UNPREDICTABLE

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.200
IN THEIR BEHAVIOR.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.400
THEY MAY BE UNABLE TO
UNDERSTAND INSTRUCTIONS

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.600
OR ANSWER QUESTIONS AND
ARE FAR MORE INTERESTED

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.500
IN GETTING ON WITH
THEIR DEVELOPMENT

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.900
THAN WITH YOUR STUDY.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.900
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
TO ASK THE PARENT

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:43.100
OR GUARDIAN'S PERMISSION
TO STUDY A CHILD,

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.060
AND TO FOLLOW THE
ETHICAL GUIDELINES

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.800
WHICH ARE OUTLINED
IN THE USER'S GUIDE.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.760
MOST RESEARCH WITH
YOUNG CHILDREN

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.960
INVOLVES
OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES,

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.000
AND THESE HAVE
THEIR OWN PROBLEMS.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.130
EARLIER WE SAID THAT
THERE HAD BEEN CRITICISM

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.400
OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM
THE STUDY OF CHIMPANZEES.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.830
PAUSE THE VIDEO AND
DISCUSS WHAT PROBLEMS

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.530
AND BIASES MIGHT OCCUR
IN OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:17.830
OF ANIMALS OR CHILDREN.

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.530
ONE OF THE MAIN
PROBLEMS IS REACTIVITY.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.430
THAT IS, A CHANGE
IN NORMAL BEHAVIOR

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.530
DUE TO THE PRESENCE
OF THE OBSERVER.

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.800
IT REQUIRES A BALANCE
BETWEEN ALLOWING CHILDREN

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.500
TO GET USED TO YOU AND YET
NOT BEING SO INTERESTING

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.230
THAT THEY DON'T PRODUCE
THEIR NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.260
ANIMALS ALSO CHANGE
THEIR BEHAVIOR

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:45.330
WHEN UNFAMILIAR
THINGS HAPPEN.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.860
WITH ANIMAL STUDIES
THERE'S A TENDENCY TO

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.600
ANTHROPOMORPHIZE, THAT
IS TO ATTRIBUTE TO THEM

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.930
HUMAN FEELINGS
AND EMOTIONS.

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:55.600
ONE OF THE BIASES MAY BE
BECOMING TOO EMOTIONALLY

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:57.600
INVOLVED WITH THE SUBJECT
TO GIVE AN OBJECTIVE

00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.300
ASSESSMENT OF
THEIR BEHAVIOR.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:01.400
THERE'S MORE DISCUSSION
OF THIS AND PLENTY OF

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.460
IDEAS FOR INTERESTING
PRACTICAL WORK

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.400
AND CLASS EXERCISES
IN THE GUIDE.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.560
