00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.670


2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.330
I HAVE TWO NIGHTS WATCHED WITH YOU,

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.300
BUT CAN PERCEIVE NO TRUTH IN YOUR REPORT.

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.730
WHEN WAS IT SHE LAST WALKED?

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.270
SINCE HIS MAJESTY WENT INTO THE FIELD,

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.030
I HAVE SEEN HER RISE FROM HER BED,

7
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.030
THROW HER NIGHTGOWN UPON HER,

8
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.530
UNLOCK HER CLOSET, TAKE FORTH PAPER,

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.100
FOLD IT, WRITE UPON IT,

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.200
READ IT,

11
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.400
AFTERWARDS SEAL IT, AND AGAIN RETURN TO BED.

12
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.170
YET ALL THIS WHILE IN A MOST FAST SLEEP.

13
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.270
A GREAT PERTURBATION IN NATURE,

14
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.230
TO RECEIVE AT ONCE THE BENEFIT OF SLEEP,

15
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.930
AND DO THE EFFECTS OF WATCHING.

16
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.400
IN THIS SLUMBERY AGITATION,

17
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.870
BESIDES HER WALKING AND OTHER ACTUAL PERFORMANCES,

18
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.370
WHAT, AT ANY TIME, HAVE YOU HEARD HER SAY?

19
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.500
THAT, SIR, WHICH I WILL NOT REPORT AFTER HER.

20
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.500
YOU MAY TO ME,

21
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.070
AND 'TIS MOST MEET YOU SHOULD.

22
00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.770
NEITHER TO YOU NOR ANYONE,

23
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.700
HAVING NO WITNESS TO CONFIRM MY SPEECH.

24
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.130
Lo you, here she comes.

25
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.070
THIS IS HER VERY GUISE,

26
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.700
AND, UPON MY LIFE, FAST ASLEEP.

27
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.970
HOW CAME SHE BY THAT LIGHT?

28
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.500
WHY, IT STOOD BY HER;

29
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.730
SHE HAS LIGHT BY HER CONTINUALLY.

30
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.270
'TIS HER COMMAND.

31
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.600
YOU SEE? HER EYES ARE OPEN!

32
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.370
AYE, BUT THEIR SENSE IS SHUT.

33
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.470
WHAT IS IT SHE DOES NOW?

34
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.470
SHH.

35
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.030
LOOK HOW SHE RUBS HER HANDS.

36
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.700
IT IS AN ACCUSTOMED ACTION WITH HER

37
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.170
TO BE SEEN THUS WASHING HER HANDS.

38
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.830
I HAVE KNOWN HER CONTINUE IN THIS

39
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.970
A QUARTER OF AN HOUR.

40
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.230
YET HERE'S A SPOT.

41
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.570
HARK, SHE SPEAKS.

42
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.830
OUT, DAMNED SPOT.

43
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.300
[crying] OUT, I SAY.

44
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.600
ONE...

45
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330
TWO...

46
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.700
WHY, THEN 'TIS TIME TO DO IT.

47
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.300
HELL IS MURKY.

48
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.970
FIE, MY LORD, FIE!

49
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.300
A SOLDIER, AND AFEARD?

50
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.170
WHAT NEED WE FEAR WHO KNOWS IT,

51
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.200
WHEN NONE CAN CALL OUR POWER TO ACCOUNT?

52
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.100
YET WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

53
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.530
THE OLD MAN TO HAVE HAD SO MUCH BLOOD IN HIM?

54
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.970
DO YOU MARK THAT?

55
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.000
♪ THE THANE OF FIFE HAD A WIFE. ♪

56
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970
WHERE IS SHE NOW?

57
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:53.130
WHAT, WILL THESE HANDS NE'ER BE CLEAN?

58
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.930
NO MORE O' THAT, MY LORD. NO MORE O' THAT.

59
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.800
YOU MAR ALL WITH THIS STARTING.

60
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.030
GO TO!  GO TO!

61
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.670
YOU HAVE KNOWN  WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT.

62
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.300
SHE HAS SPOKE WHAT SHE SHOULD NOT;

63
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.230
I AM SURE OF THAT.

64
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.700
HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT SHE HAS KNOWN.

65
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.130
[gasps]

66
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.270
YET!

67
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.830
HERE'S THE SMELL OF THE BLOOD STILL.

68
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.630
[breathing heavily]

69
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:28.200
ALL THE PERFUMES OF ARABIA WILL NOT SWEETEN THIS LITTLE HAND.

70
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.200
[sniffing]

71
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.730
[crying]

72
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.530
WHAT A SIGH IS THERE!

73
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.470
THE HEART IS SORELY CHARGED.

74
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.400
I WOULD NOT HAVE SUCH A HEART IN MY BOSOM

75
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.570
FOR THE DIGNITY OF THE WHOLE BODY.

76
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.900
WELL, WELL, WELL--

77
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.670
PRAY GOD IT BE, SIR.

78
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.670
[gasps]

79
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.100
THIS DISEASE IS BEYOND MY PRACTICE.

80
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.500
YET I HAVE KNOWN THOSE

81
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.130
WHICH HAVE WALKED IN THEIR SLEEP

82
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.830
WHO HAVE DIED HOLILY IN THEIR BEDS.

83
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.070
WASH YOUR HANDS.

84
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.370
PUT ON YOUR NIGHTGOWN.

85
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.870
LOOK NOT SO PALE.

86
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.000
I TELL YOU YET AGAIN, BANQUO'S BURIED;

88
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.630
EVEN SO?

89
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.870
[whispers] To bed, to bed.

90
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.970
THERE'S KNOCKING AT THE GATE; COME.

91
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.970
COME!

92
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.900

93
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.700
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

94
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.870
WHAT'S DONE CANNOT BE UNDONE.

95
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.170
TO BED!  TO BED!

96
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.100

[grunting]

98
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.500
WILL SHE GO NOW TO BED?

99
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.700
DIRECTLY.

100
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.130
FOUL WHISPERINGS ARE ABROAD.

101
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.930
UNNATURAL DEEDS DO BREED UNNATURAL TROUBLES.

102
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.630
INFECTED MINDS TO THEIR DEAF PILLOWS

103
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.570
WILL DISCHARGE THEIR SECRETS.

104
00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.130
MORE NEEDS SHE THE DIVINE THAN THE PHYSICIAN.

105
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.130
GOD--GOD FORGIVE US ALL.

106
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.330
LOOK AFTER HER.

107
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.270
REMOVE FROM HER THE MEANS OF ALL ANNOYANCE,

108
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.700
AND STILL KEEP EYES UPON HER.

109
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.900
SO GOOD NIGHT.

110
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.030
GOOD NIGHT, GOOD DOCTOR.

111
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.630
MY MIND SHE HAS MATED AND AMAZED MY SIGHT.

112
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.530
I THINK, BUT DARE NOT SPEAK.

113
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.770
(Menteith)  THE ENGLISH POWER IS NEAR,

114
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.130
LED ON BY MALCOLM,

115
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.630
HIS UNCLE SIWARD, AND THE GOOD MACDUFF.

116
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.970
REVENGES BURN IN THEM;

117
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.300
FOR THEIR DEAR CAUSES WOULD TO THE BLEEDING

118
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.900
AND THE GRIM ALARM EXCITE THE MORTIFIED MAN.

119
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.770
NEAR BIRNAM WOOD SHALL WE MEET THEM.

120
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.900
THAT WAY ARE THEY COMING.

121
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.170
WHO KNOWS IF DONALBAIN BE WITH HIS BROTHER?

122
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.830
FOR CERTAIN, SIR, HE'S NOT.

123
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.500
I HAVE A FILE OF ALL THE GENTRY.

124
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.830
THERE IS SIWARD'S SON, AND MANY UNROUGH YOUTHS

125
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.430
THAT EVEN NOW PROTEST THEIR FIRST OF MANHOOD.

126
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.500
WHAT DOES THE TYRANT?

127
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.730
GREAT DUNSINANE HE STRONGLY FORTIFIES.

128
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.500
SOME SAY HE'S MAD.

129
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.100
OTHERS THAT LESSER HATE HIM DO CALL IT VALIANT FURY.

130
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.100
BUT FOR CERTAIN

131
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.030
HE CANNOT BUCKLE HIS DISTEMPERED CAUSE

132
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.470
WITHIN THE BELT OF RULE.

133
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.070
NOW DOES HE FEEL HIS SECRET MURDERS STICKING ON HIS HANDS.

134
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.270
NOW MINUTELY REVOLTS UPBRAID HIS FAITH BREACH.

135
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.830
THOSE HE COMMANDS MOVE ONLY IN COMMAND, NOTHING IN LOVE.

136
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.700
NOW DOES HE FEEL HIS TITLE HANG LOOSE ABOUT HIM,

137
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.800
LIKE A GIANT'S ROBE UPON A DWARFISH THIEF.

138
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.300
[men chuckling]

139
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.300
WHO THEN SHALL BLAME HIS PESTERED SENSES

140
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.730
TO RECOIL AND START, WHEN ALL THAT IS WITHIN HIM

141
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.830
DOES CONDEMN ITSELF FOR BEING THERE?

142
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.100
WELL, MARCH WE ON,

143
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.270
TO GIVE OBEDIENCE WHERE 'TIS TRULY OWED.

144
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.670
MEET WE THE MEDICINE OF THE SICKLY WEAL,

145
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.470
AND WITH HIM POUR WE, IN OUR COUNTRY'S PURGE,

146
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.170
EACH DROP OF US.

147
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.970
OR SO MUCH AS IT NEEDS TO DEW THE SOVEREIGN FLOWER

148
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.530
AND DROWN THE WEEDS.

149
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.870
MAKE WE OUR MARCH TOWARDS BIRNAM.

150
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.330
BRING ME NO MORE REPORTS.

151
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.200
LET THEM FLY, ALL.

152
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.730
TILL BIRNAM WOOD REMOVE TO DUNSINANE,

153
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.200
I CANNOT TAINT WITH FEAR.

154
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.630
WHAT'S THE BOY MALCOLM?

155
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.700
WAS HE NOT BORN OF WOMAN?

156
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.970
THE SPIRITS THAT KNOW ALL MORTAL CONSEQUENCES

157
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.830
HAVE PRONOUNCED ME THUS:

158
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.730
"FEAR NOT, MACBETH; NO MAN THAT'S BORN OF WOMAN

159
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.370
SHALL E'ER HAVE POWER UPON THEE."

160
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.030
THEN FLY, FALSE THANES,

161
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.430
AND MINGLE WITH THE ENGLISH EPICURES.

162
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.030
THE MIND I SWAY BY AND THE HEART I BEAR

163
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:55.230
SHALL NEVER SAG WITH DOUBT NOR SHAKE WITH FEAR.

164
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.370
THE DEVIL DAMN THEE BLACK, THOU CREAM-FACED LOON.

165
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:02.270
WHERE GOT'ST THOU THAT GOOSE LOOK?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.630
THERE ARE 10,000--

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.430
GEESE, VILLAIN?

168
00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.430
SOLDIERS, SIR.

169
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.670
GO PRICK THY FACE AND OVERRED THY FEAR,

WHAT SOLDIERS, PATCH?

172
00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.130
DEATH OF THY SOUL.

173
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.070
THOSE LINEN CHEEKS OF THINE ARE COUNSELORS TO FEAR.

174
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.900
WHAT SOLDIERS,

175
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.030

176
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.570

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.730
THIS PUSH WILL CHEER ME EVER...

182
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:38.470

[exhales]

361
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.570
THE DEVIL HIMSELF COULD NOT PRONOUNCE

362
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.470
A TITLE MORE HATEFUL TO MINE EAR.

363
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:00.300
NO.

364
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.870
NOR MORE FEARFUL.

365
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:07.200
THOU LIEST, ABHORRED TYRANT.

366
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.430
WITH MY SWORD I'LL PROVE THE LIE THOU SPEAK'ST.

367
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.670
[thunder rumbling]

368
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.030
[grunts]

369
00:18:54.370 --> 00:19:04.430


370
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.100
[cries]

371
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:10.000
THOU WAST BORN OF WOMAN.

372
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.900
BUT SWORDS I SMILE AT, WEAPONS LAUGH TO SCORN,

373
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:24.200
BRANDISHED BY MAN THAT'S OF A WOMAN BORN.

374
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:33.570
[suspensful music accelerates]

375
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.070
TYRANT!

376
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.530
SHOW THY FACE!

377
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:46.570
IF THOU BE'ST SLAIN AND WITH NO STROKE OF MINE,

378
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.500
MY WIFE AND CHILDREN'S GHOSTS WILL HAUNT ME STILL.

379
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:55.830
EITHER THOU, MACBETH, OR ELSE MY SWORD,

380
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:59.970
WITH AN UNBATTERED EDGE, I SHEATH AGAIN UNDEEDED.

381
00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.070
LET ME FIND HIM, FORTUNE.

382
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.370
AND MORE I BEG NOT.

383
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.970
WHY SHOULD I PLAY THE ROMAN FOOL AND DIE ON MINE OWN SWORD?

384
00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:20.500
WHILES I SEE LIVES, THE GASHES DO BETTER UPON THEM.

385
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.530
(Macduff) TURN,

386
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.530
HELLHOUND.

387
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.200
TURN!

388
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.370
OF ALL MEN ELSE I HAVE AVOIDED THEE.

389
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:38.770
BUT GET THEE BACK.

390
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.570
MY SOUL IS TOO MUCH CHARGED WITH BLOOD OF THINE ALREADY.

391
00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:47.000
I HAVE NO WORDS.

392
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.870
MY VOICE IS IN MY SWORD.

393
00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.970
THOU BLOODIER VILLAIN THAN TERMS CAN GIVE THEE OUT!

394
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:13.870


395
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.230
THOU LOSEST LABOR.

396
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:23.000
AS WELL MAYST THOU THE INTRENCHANT AIR

397
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.570
WITH THY KEEN BLADE IMPRESS AS MAKE ME BLEED.

398
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.030
I BEAR A CHARMED LIFE,

399
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:36.800
WHICH MUST NOT YIELD TO ONE OF WOMAN BORN.

400
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.330
DESPAIR THY CHARM,

401
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:46.070
AND LET THE ANGEL WHOM THOU STILL HAST SERVED

402
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:48.200
TELL THEE

403
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.130
MACDUFF WAS FROM HIS MOTHER'S WOMB

404
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.300
UNTIMELY RIPPED!

405
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.300
[scoffs]

406
00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.700
[sighs]

407
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.670
ACCURSED BE THE TONGUE THAT TELLS ME SO,

408
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:20.030
FOR IT HATH COWED MY BETTER PART OF MAN.

409
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:28.530
AND BE THESE JUGGLING FIENDS NO MORE BELIEVED...

410
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:33.230
THAT PALTER WITH US IN A DOUBLE SENSE,

411
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:38.070
THAT KEEP THE WORD OF PROMISE TO OUR EAR

412
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.400
AND BREAK IT TO OUR HOPE.

413
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.130
[shudders]

414
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.870
I'LL NOT FIGHT WITH THEE.

415
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:49.600
THEN YIELD THEE, COWARD!

416
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.430
AND LIVE TO BE THE SHOW AND GAZE OF THE TIME.

417
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.100
WE'LL HAVE THEE, AS OUR RARER MONSTERS ARE,

418
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.100
PAINTED UPON A POLE,  AND UNDERWRIT,

419
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.230
"HERE MAY YOU SEE THE TYRANT."

420
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:06.670
I WILL NOT YIELD

421
00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.770
TO KISS THE GROUND BEFORE YOUNG MALCOLM'S FEET

422
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.370
AND TO BE BAITED WITH THE RABBLE'S CURSE.

423
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.400
THOUGH BIRNAM WOOD BE COME TO DUNSINANE,

424
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.130
AND THOU OPPOSED, BEING OF NO WOMAN BORN,

425
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.800
YET I WILL TRY THE LAST!

426
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.130
BEFORE MY BODY I THROW MY WARLIKE SHIELD.

427
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.200
LAY ON, MACDUFF,

428
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.670
AND DAMNED BE HIM THAT FIRST CRIES,

429
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.630
"HOLD, ENOUGH!"

430
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:09.970


431
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.130
THIS WAY, MY LORD.

432
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.700
THE CASTLE'S GENTLY RENDERED.

433
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.030
THE DAY ALMOST ITSELF PROFESSES YOURS,

434
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.900
AND LITTLE IS TO DO.

435
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.100
I WOULD THE FRIENDS WE MISS WERE SAFE ARRIVED.

436
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.300
SOME MUST GO OFF.

437
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.430
AND YET, BY THESE I SEE,

438
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.300
SO GREAT A DAY AS THIS IS CHEAPLY BOUGHT.

439
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.700
MACDUFF IS MISSING, AND YOUR NOBLE SON.

440
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.170
YOUR SON, MY LORD, HATH PAID A SOLDIER'S DEBT.

441
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.230
HE ONLY LIVED BUT TILL HE WAS A MAN,

442
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.570
THE WHICH NO SOONER HAD HIS PROWESS CONFIRMED

443
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.500
IN THE UNSHRINKING STATION WHERE HE FOUGHT

444
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.730
BUT LIKE A MAN HE DIED.

445
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.100
THEN HE IS DEAD.

446
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.800
YOUR CAUSE OF SORROW MUST NOT BE MEASURED BY HIS WORTH,

447
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.500
FOR THEN IT HATH NO END.

448
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.170
HAD HE HIS HURTS BEFORE?

449
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.370
AYE, ON THE FRONT.

450
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.370
WHY THEN, GOD'S SOLDIER BE HE.

451
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.870
HAD I AS MANY SONS AS I HAVE HAIRS,

452
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.030
I WOULD NOT WISH THEM TO A FAIRER DEATH.

453
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.900
AND SO HIS KNELL IS KNOLLED.

454
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.630
(Malcolm) HE'S WORTH MORE SORROW,

455
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.970
AND THAT I'LL SPEND FOR HIM.

456
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.170
HE'S WORTH NO MORE.

457
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.300
THEY SAY HE PARTED WELL AND PAID HIS SCORE.

458
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.870
AND SO GOD BE WITH HIM.

459
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:48.370


460
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:54.830
HAIL, KING.

461
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:57.800
FOR SO THOU ART.

462
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.200
THE TIME IS FREE.

463
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.730
I SEE THEE COMPASSED WITH THY KINGDOM'S PEARL,

464
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.630

465
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:21.070
WHOSE VOICES I DESIRE ALOUD WITH MINE:

466
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.470
HAIL, KING OF SCOTLAND.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:26.370
(all) HAIL, KING OF SCOTLAND!

468
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.030
WE SHALL NOT SPEND A LARGE EXPENSE OF TIME

469
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.970
BEFORE WE RECKON WITH YOUR SEVERAL LOVES,

470
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.330
AND MAKE US EVEN WITH YOU.

471
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:46.170
MY THANES AND KINSMEN, HENCEFORTH BE EARLS,

472
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.730
THE FIRST THAT EVER SCOTLAND IN SUCH AN HONOR NAMED.

473
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.500
WHAT'S MORE TO DO, AS WOULD BE NEWLY PLANTED WITH THE TIME,

474
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.100
AS CALLING HOME OUR EXILED FRIENDS ABROAD

475
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.230
THAT FLED THE SNARES OF WATCHFUL TYRANNY,

476
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.600
PRODUCING FORTH THE CRUEL MINISTERS OF THIS DEAD BUTCHER

477
00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.870
AND HIS FIENDLIKE QUEEN, WHO, AS 'TIS THOUGHT,

478
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.870
BY SELF AND VIOLENT HANDS TOOK OFF HER LIFE.

479
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.800
THIS, AND WHAT NEEDFUL ELSE THAT CALLS UPON US,

480
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.130
BY THE GRACE OF GRACE

481
00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:21.030
WE WILL PERFORM IN MEASURE, TIME, AND PLACE.

482
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.200
SO THANKS TO ALL AT ONCE...

483
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.370
AND TO EACH ONE, WHOM WE INVITE TO SEE US CROWNED AT SCONE.

484
