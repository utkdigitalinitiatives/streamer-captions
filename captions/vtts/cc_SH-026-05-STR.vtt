TO KISS THE GROUNDBEFORE YOUNG MALCOLM'S FEET

422
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.370
AND TO BE BAITEDWITH THE RABBLE'S CURSE.

423
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:16.400
THOUGH BIRNAM WOODBE COME TO DUNSINANE,

424
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.130
AND THOU OPPOSED,BEING OF NO WOMAN BORN,

425
00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.800
YET I WILL TRY THE LAST!

426
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:27.130
BEFORE MY BODYI THROW MY WARLIKE SHIELD.

427
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.200
LAY ON, MACDUFF,

428
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.670

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:09.970


431
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:12.130
THIS WAY, MY LORD.

432
00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.700
THE CASTLE'S GENTLY RENDERED.

433
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.030
THE DAY ALMOST ITSELFPROFESSES YOURS,

434
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:20.900
AND LITTLE IS TO DO.

435
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.100
I WOULD THE FRIENDS WE MISSWERE SAFE ARRIVED.

436
00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.300
SOME MUST GO OFF.

437
00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.430
AND YET, BY THESE I SEE,

438
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.300
SO GREAT A DAYAS THIS IS CHEAPLY BOUGHT.

439
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.700
MACDUFF IS MISSING,AND YOUR NOBLE SON.

440
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.170
YOUR SON, MY LORD,HATH PAID A SOLDIER'S DEBT.

441
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:41.230
HE ONLY LIVEDBUT TILL HE WAS A MAN,

442
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.570
THE WHICH NO SOONERHAD HIS PROWESS CONFIRMED

443
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.500
IN THE UNSHRINKING STATIONWHERE HE FOUGHT

444
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.730
BUT LIKE A MAN HE DIED.

445
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.100
THEN HE IS DEAD.

446
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.800
YOUR CAUSE OF SORROW MUST NOTBE MEASURED BY HIS WORTH,

447
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.500
FOR THEN IT HATH NO END.

448
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.170
HAD HE HIS HURTS BEFORE?

449
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:01.370
AYE, ON THE FRONT.

450
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.370
WHY THEN,GOD'S SOLDIER BE HE.

451
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.870
HAD I AS MANY SONSAS I HAVE HAIRS,

452
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:12.030
I WOULD NOT WISH THEMTO A FAIRER DEATH.

453
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.900
AND SO HIS KNELL IS KNOLLED.

454
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.630
(Malcolm)HE'S WORTH MORE SORROW,

455
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:20.970
AND THATI'LL SPEND FOR HIM.

456
00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.170
HE'S WORTH NO MORE.

457
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.300
THEY SAY HE PARTED WELLAND PAID HIS SCORE.

458
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.870
AND SO GOD BE WITH HIM.

459
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:48.370
