00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:39.800


2
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.800
â™ª Oh blessed King. So full of virtue,

3
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.970
the flower of knighthood, ne'er defiled.

4
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.770
the brave for us, to Christ Jesu.

5
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.300
and to his mother,  merry mild.

6
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.000
In all thy works, was never wild

7
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.900
but full of grace and charity

8
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.470
Merciful ever to man and child

9
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.730
Now sweet King Henry pray for me.

10
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.400
Oh crown'd King with septor in hand

11
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.730
Most noble conquerer, I thee call

12
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.300
For thou has conquered, I understand.

13
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.470
Thy Henry Kingdom imperial.

14
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.870
Where joy are boundeth and grace perpetual,

15
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.070
In presence of  the one in three

16
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.370
Now of thy grace make me apart

17
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.500
and sweet King Henry pray for me.

18
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.430
(Group) Amen

19
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.470
Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!

20
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.000
Comets, importing change of times and states,

21
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.830
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,

22
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.800
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars

23
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.500
That have consented unto Henry's death!

24
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.500
Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!

25
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.700
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.

26
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.830
England ne'er had a king until his time.

27
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.630
Virtue he had, deserving to command:

28
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.830
His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:

29
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.430
His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;

30
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.700
His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,

31
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.670
More dazzled and drove back his enemies

32
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.770
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.

33
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.930
What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:

34
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.200
He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.

35
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.600
We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?

36
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.530
Henry is dead and never shall revive:

37
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.500
Upon a wooden coffin we attend,

38
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.930
And death's dishonourable victory

39
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.030
We with our stately presence glorify,

40
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.600
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.

41
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.330
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap

42
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.230
That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?

43
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.030
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French

44
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.270
Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him

45
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.630
By magic verses have contrived his end?

46
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.900
He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.

47
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.570
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day

48
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.000
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.

49
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.370
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:

50
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.600
The church's prayers made him so prosperous.

51
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.070
The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,

52
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.930
His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:

53
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.300
None do you like but an effeminate prince,

54
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.730
Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.

55
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.600
Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector

56
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.930
And lookest to command the prince and realm.

57
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.330
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,

58
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.900
More than God or religious churchmen may.

59
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.570
Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,

60
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.170
And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st

61
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.830
Except it be to pray against thy foes.

62
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.470
Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:

63
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.570
Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:

64
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.500
Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:

65
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.000
Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.

66
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.670
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:

67
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.130
Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,

68
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.330
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!

69
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.700
A far more glorious star thy soul shall make

70
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.930
Than Julius Caesar or bright--

71
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.070
My honourable lords, health to you all!

72
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.230
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,

73
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.430
Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:

74
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.430
Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,

75
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.400
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.

76
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.430
What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?

77
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.300
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns

78
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.270
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.

79
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.300
Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?

80
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.170
If Henry were recall'd to life again,

81
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.770
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.

82
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.070
How were they lost? what treachery was used?

83
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:05.130
No treachery; but want of men and money.

84
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.770
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,

85
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.000
That here you maintain several factions,

86
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.200
And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,

87
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.300
You are disputing of your generals:

88
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.370
One would have lingering wars with little cost;

89
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.870
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;

90
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.530
A third thinks, without expense at all,

91
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.630
By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.

92
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.100
Awake, awake, English nobility!

93
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.830
Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:

94
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.330
Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;

95
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.070
Of England's coat one half is cut away.

96
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.830
Were our tears wanting to this funeral,

97
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.930
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.

98
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.330
Me they concern; Regent I am of France.

99
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.070
Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.

100
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.700
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!

101
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.030
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,

102
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.530
To weep their intermissive miseries.

103
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:14.370
Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.

104
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.130
France is revolted from the English quite,

105
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.430
Except some petty towns of no import:

106
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.970
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;

107
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.300
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;

108
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.500
Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;

109
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.300
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.

110
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.330
The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!

111
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.270
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?

112
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.530
We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.

113
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.400
Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.

114
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.070
Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?

115
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.800
An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,

116
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.070
Wherewith already France is overrun.

117
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.030
My gracious lords, to add to your laments,

118
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.600
Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,

119
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.700
I must inform you of a dismal fight

120
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.270
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.

121
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.970
What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?

122
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.800
O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:

123
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.170
The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.

124
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.200
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,

125
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.730
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,

126
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.230
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.

127
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.000
By three and twenty thousand of the French

128
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.900
Was round encompassed and set upon.

129
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.530
No leisure had he to enrank his men;

130
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.730
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;

131
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.430
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges

132
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.830
They pitched in the ground confusedly,

133
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.900
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.

134
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.030
More than three hours the fight continued;

135
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.500
Where valiant Talbot above human thought

136
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.400
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:

137
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.900
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;

138
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.330
Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:

139
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.230
The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;

140
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.900
All the whole army stood agazed on him:

141
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.530
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit

142
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.170
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain

143
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.900
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.

144
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.100
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,

145
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.430
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:

146
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.070
He, being in the vaward, placed behind

147
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.270
With purpose to relieve and follow them,

148
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.530
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.

149
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.000
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;

150
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.300
Enclosed were they with their enemies:

151
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.670
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,

152
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.670
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,

153
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.170
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength

154
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.930
Durst not presume to look once in the face.

155
00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.600
Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,

156
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.630
For living idly here in pomp and ease,

157
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.530
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,

158
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.000
Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.

159
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.170
O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,

160
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.700
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:

161
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.930
Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.

162
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.470
His ransom there is none but I shall pay:

163
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.630
I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:

164
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.830
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;

165
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.870
Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.

166
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.200
Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;

167
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.500
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,

168
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.270
To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:

169
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.570
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,

170
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.500
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.

171
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.030
So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;

172
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.200
The English army is grown weak and faint:

173
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.370
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,

174
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.030
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,

175
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.270
Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.

176
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.370
Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,

177
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.300
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,

178
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.370
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.

179
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.770
I do remember it; and here take my leave,

180
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.470
To go about my preparation.

181
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.930
I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,

182
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.970
To view the artillery and munition;

183
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.230
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.

184
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.430
To Eltham will I, where the young king is,

185
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.730
Being ordain'd his special governor,

186
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.600
And for his safety there I'll best devise.

187
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.300
Each hath his place and function to attend:

188
00:13:53.300 --> 00:14:00.500
I am left out; for me nothing remains.

189
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.130
But long I will not be Jack out of office:

190
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.770
The king from Eltham I intend to steal

191
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:14.100
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.

192
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.900
Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens

193
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.230
So in the earth, to this day is not known:

194
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.370
Late did he shine upon the English side;

195
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.130
Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.

196
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.830
What towns of any moment but we have?

197
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.300
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;

198
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.400
Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,

199
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.470
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.

200
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.970
They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:

201
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.030
Either they must be dieted like mules

202
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.130
And have their provender tied to their mouths

203
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:27.370
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.

204
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.430
Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?

205
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.800
Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:

206
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.870
Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;

207
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.370
And he may well in fretting spend his gall,

208
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.100
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.

209
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.670
Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.

210
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.900
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!

211
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.430
Him I forgive my death that killeth me

212
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.070
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.

213
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.630
Who ever saw the like? what men have I!

214
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:32.400
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,

215
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.630
But that they left me 'midst my enemies.

216
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.000
Salisbury is a desperate homicide;

217
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.600
He fighteth as one weary of his life.

218
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.670
The other lords, like lions wanting food,

219
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.000
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.

220
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.800
Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose

221
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.930
They had such courage and audacity?

222
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.030
Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,

223
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.500
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:

224
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.100
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth

225
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.600
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.

226
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.730
I think, by some odd gimmors or device

227
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.170
Their arms are set like clocks, still to strike on;

228
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.170
Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.

229
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.730
By my consent, we'll even let them alone.

230
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.530
Be it so.

231
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.700
Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.

232
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.570
Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.

233
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.530
Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:

234
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.470
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?

235
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.100
Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:

236
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.270
A holy maid hither with me I bring,

237
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.430
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven

238
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.030
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege

239
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.170
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.

240
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.930
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,

241
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.800
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:

242
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.300
What's past and what's to come she can descry.

243
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.870
Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,

244
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.170
For they are certain and unfallible.

245
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.400
Go, call her in.

246
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.630
But first, to try her skill,

247
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:20.030
Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:

248
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.800
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:

249
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.130
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

250
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.970
Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?

251
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.900
Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?

252
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:51.400
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;

253
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.300
I know thee well, though never seen before.

254
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.230
Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:

255
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.700
In private will I talk with thee apart.

256
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.030
Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.

257
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.830
She takes upon her bravely at first dash.

258
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.670
Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,

259
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.470
My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.

260
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.670
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased

261
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.200
To shine on my contemptible estate:

262
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.270
Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,

263
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.270
And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,

264
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.770
God's mother deigned to appear to me

265
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.730
And in a vision full of majesty

266
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.470
Will'd me to leave my base vocation

267
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.170
And free my country from calamity:

268
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.400
Her aid she promised and assured success:

269
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.800
In complete glory she reveal'd herself;

270
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.930
And, whereas I was black and swart before,

271
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.530
With those clear rays which she infused on me

272
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.570
That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.

273
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.800
Ask me what question thou canst possible,

274
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.070
And I will answer unpremeditated:

275
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.170
My courage try by combat, if thou darest,

276
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.930
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.

277
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.100
Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,

278
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.130
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.

279
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.330
Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:

280
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.000
Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,

281
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.700
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,

282
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.800
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;

283
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.330
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.

284
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.330
I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,

285
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.230
Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;

286
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.270
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's churchyard,

287
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.970
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.

288
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.730
Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.

289
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.470
And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.

290
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:28.700
Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon

291
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.070
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.

292
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.500
Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.

293
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.730
Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:

294
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.970
Impatiently I burn with thy desire;

295
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.530
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.

296
00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.830
Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,

297
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.930
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:

298
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.070
'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.

299
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.070
I must not yield to any rites of love,

300
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:05.000
For my profession's sacred from above:

301
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.500
When I have chased all thy foes from hence,

302
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.100
Then will I think upon a recompense.

303
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:18.100
Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.

304
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.970
Methinks, My Lord is very long in talk.

305
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.000
Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;

306
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.900
Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.

307
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.270
Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?

308
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.430
He may mean more than we poor men do know:

309
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:41.530
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.

310
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.570
My lord, where are you? what devise you on?

311
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.770
Shall we give over Orleans, or no?

312
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.370
Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!

313
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.230
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.

314
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.970
What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.

315
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.100
Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.

316
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.000
This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:

317
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.530
Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,

318
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.870
Since I have entered into these wars.

319
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.930
Glory is like a circle in the water,

320
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.700
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself

321
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.700
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.

322
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.930
With Henry's death the English circle ends;

323
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.930
Dispersed are the glories it included.

324
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.400
Now am I like that proud insulting ship

325
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.100
Which Caesar and his fortunes bare at once.

326
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.500
Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,

327
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.200
How may I reverent worship thee enough?

328
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.170
Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.

329
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.800
Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;

330
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.930
Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.

331
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.100
Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:

332
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.370
No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.

333
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.830
I am come to survey the Tower this day:

334
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.330
Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.

335
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.430
Where be these warders, that they wait not here?

336
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.900
Open the gates; The Duke of Gloucester calls.

337
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.230
[Within] Who's there that knockth so imperiously?

338
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.500
(First Serving-Man) It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.

339
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.470
[Within] Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.

340
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.970
(First Serving-Man) Villains, answer you

341
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.100
so the lord protector?

342
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.870
[Within] The Lord protect him! so we answer him:

343
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.730
We do no otherwise than we are will'd.

344
00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.870
Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?

345
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.100
There's none protector of the realm but I.

346
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.270
Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.

347
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:15.270
Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?

348
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.870
What noise is this? what traitors have we here?

349
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.900
Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?

350
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.370
Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.

351
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.730
Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;

352
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.000
His grace, My Lord of Winchester forbids:

353
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.230
From him I have express commandment

354
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.200
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.

355
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:40.000
Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?

356
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.100
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,

357
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.230
Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?

358
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.700
Thou art no friend to God or to the king:

359
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.270
Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.

360
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:55.500
(Serving-Men) Open the gates unto the lord protector,

361
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.800
Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.

362
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.930
How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?

363
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.970
Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?

364
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.600
I do, thou most usurping proditor,

365
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.130
And not protector, of the king or realm.

366
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.370
Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,

367
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.100
Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;

368
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.370
Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:

369
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.130
Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:

370
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.770
This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,

371
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.200
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.

372
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.670
I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:

373
00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.970
Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.

374
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:08.300
What! am I dared and bearded to my face?

375
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.570
Draw, men, for all this privileged place;

376
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.570
Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,

377
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.270
I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:

378
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.930
Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.

379
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.130
Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.

380
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.330
Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!

381
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:35.800
Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?

382
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.730
Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.

383
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:55.500
Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,

384
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.000
Thus contumeliously should break the peace!

385
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.700
Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:

386
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.230
Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,

387
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.770
Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.

388
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.100
Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,

389
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.030
One that still motions war and never peace,

390
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.000
O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,

391
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.970
And would have armour here out of the Tower,

392
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.200
To crown himself king and suppress the prince.

393
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.770
I will not answer thee with words, but blows.

394
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.600
Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife

395
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.730
But to make open proclamation:

396
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.170
Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,

397
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.400
All manner of men assembled here in arms this day

398
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.400
against God's peace and the king's, we charge

399
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.700
and command you, in his highness' name, to repair to

400
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.830
your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,

401
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.630
handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,

402
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.370
henceforward, upon pain of death.

403
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.430
Winchester, I'll be no breaker of the law:

404
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.130
But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.

405
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:10.700
Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:

406
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.330
Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.

407
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.330
I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.

408
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.400
This Winchester's more haughty than the devil.

409
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.400
Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.

410
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.930
Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;

411
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.500
For I intend to have it ere long.

412
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.100
See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.

413
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.000
Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!

414
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.270
I myself fight not once in forty year.

415
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:08.430
Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,

416
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.400
And how the English have the suburbs won.

417
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.530
Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,

418
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.930
Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.

419
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:21.970
(Master-Gunner) But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:

420
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.470
Chief master-gunner am I of this town;

421
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.230
Something I must do to procure me grace.

422
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:32.300
The prince's espials have informed me

423
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.170
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,

424
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.030
Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars

425
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:44.170
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,

426
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.730
And thence discover how with most advantage

427
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.470
They may vex us with shot, or with assault.

428
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.770
To intercept this inconvenience,

429
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.570
A piece of ordnance 'gainst it have I placed;

430
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.900
And even these three days,

431
00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.070
watch'd If I could see them.

432
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.300
Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.

433
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.700
If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;

434
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.670
And thou shalt find me at the governor's.

435
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:17.700
Father, I warrant you; take you no care;

436
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.070
I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.

437
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:48.230
Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!

438
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.530
How wert thou handled being prisoner?

439
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.800
Or by what means got'st thou to be released?

440
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.230
The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner

441
00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.100
Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;

442
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.100
For him was I exchanged and ransomed.

443
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.770
In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.

444
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:11.600
But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,

445
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.270
Whom with my bare fists I would execute,

446
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.030
If I now had him brought into my power.

447
00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:24.000
Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.

448
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.730
With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.

449
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.170
In open market-place produced they me,

450
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.030
To be a public spectacle to all:

451
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.930
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,

452
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.300
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.

453
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.030
Then broke I from the officers that led me,

454
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.470
And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,

455
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.870
To hurl at the beholders of my shame:

456
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.130
My grisly countenance made others fly;

457
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.970
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.

458
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:07.500
In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;

459
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.070
So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,

460
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.930
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,

461
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.370
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:

462
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:21.200
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,

463
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.670
That walked about me every minute-while;

464
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.600
And if I did but stir out of my bed,

465
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.800
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

466
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.230
I grieve to hear what torments you endured,

467
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:45.630
But we will be revenged sufficiently

468
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.430
Now it is supper-time in Orleans:

469
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.470
Here, through this tower, I count each one

470
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.500
and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:

471
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.730
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.

472
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.000
Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,

473
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.900
Let me have your express opinions

474
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.930
Where is best place to make our battery next.

475
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.400
I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.

476
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.070
And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.

477
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.530
For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,

478
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.700
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.

479
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.430
O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!

480
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:54.330
O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!

481
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.800
What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?

482
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.930
Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:

483
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.200
How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?

484
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.770
One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!

485
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.200
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand

486
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.630
That hath contrived this woful tragedy!

487
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.870
In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;

488
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.630
Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;

489
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.000
Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,

490
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.970
His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.

491
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.800
Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,

492
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.900
One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:

493
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.100
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.

494
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.200
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,

495
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.330
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!

496
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:10.130
What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?

497
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.070
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?

498
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.600
My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:

499
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.130
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,

500
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.270
A holy prophetess new risen up,

501
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:25.370
Is come with a great power to raise the siege.

502
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.600
Hear, dying Salisbury doth groan!

503
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.570
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.

504
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.470
Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:

505
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.630
Puzzel or pucelle, dolphin or dogfish,

506
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.270
Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,

507
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:54.100
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.

508
00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:00.500
Convey me Salisbury into his tent,

509
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.830
And then try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.

510
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.000
(Screaming)

511
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.570
Cry: A Talbot

512
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:28.800
Joan of France and la Pucelle

513
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.770
Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?

514
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.700
Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:

515
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:39.870
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.

516
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:47.770
Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;

517
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:52.100
Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:

518
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.870
Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,

519
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.370
And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.

520
00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:00.870
Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.

521
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.700
Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?

522
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.030
My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage

523
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.130
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.

524
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:34.030
But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.

525
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.000
Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:

526
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.030
I must go victor Orleans forthwith.

527
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:10.370
O'ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.

528
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.070
Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;

529
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.570
Help Salisbury to make his testament:

530
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:22.870
This day is ours, as many more shall be.

531
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.570
My mind are whirled like a potter's wheel;

532
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.000
I know not where I am, nor what I do;

533
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.870
A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,

534
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.800
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:

535
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.100
They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;

536
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:45.400
Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.

537
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.830
Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,

538
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.100
Or tear the lions out of England's coat;

539
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.030
Renounce your style, give sheep in lions' stead:

540
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.270
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,

541
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.370
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,

542
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:04.900
As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.

543
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:14.030
Cry: A Talbot

544
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:30.200
It will not be: retire into your trenches:

545
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.230
You all consented unto Salisbury's death,

546
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.330
For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.

547
00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.000
Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,

548
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.030
In spite of us or aught that we could do.

549
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:10.030
O, would I were to die with Salisbury!

550
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.430
The shame hereof will make me hide my head.

551
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.170
Advance our waving colours on the walls;

552
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.700
Rescued is Orleans from the English

553
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.300
Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.

554
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.570
Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,

555
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.430
How shall I honour thee for this success?

556
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.230
Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town?

557
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.800
Dauphin, command the citizens make bonfires

558
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.370
And feast and banquet in the open streets,

559
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:24.030
To celebrate the joy that God hath given us.

560
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.170
All France will be replete with mirth and joy,

561
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.900
When they shall hear how we have play'd the men.

562
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.130
'Tis Joan, not we, by whom the day is won;

563
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.600
For which I will divide my crown with her,

564
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.900
And all the priests and friars in my realm

565
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:46.130
Shall in procession sing her endless praise.

566
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.930
No longer on Saint Denis will we cry,

567
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.300
But Joan la Pucelle shall be France's saint.

568
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.330
Come in, and let us banquet royally,

569
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:04.030
After this golden day of victory.

570
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.270
