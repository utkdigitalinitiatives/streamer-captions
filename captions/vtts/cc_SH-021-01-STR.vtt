00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.800
â™ª Oh blessed King.So full of virtue,

3
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.970
the flower of knighthood,ne'er defiled.

4
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.770
the brave for us,to Christ Jesu.

5
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:13.300
and to his mother, merry mild.

6
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.000
In all thy works,was never wild

7
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.900
but full of graceand charity

8
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.470
Merciful everto man and child

9
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.730
Now sweet King Henrypray for me.

10
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.400
Oh crown'd Kingwith septor in hand

11
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.730
Most noble conquerer,I thee call

12
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.300
For thou has conquered,I understand.

13
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.470
Thy Henry Kingdomimperial.

14
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.870
Where joy are boundethand grace perpetual,

15
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:07.070
In presence of the one in three

16
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.370
Now of thy gracemake me apart

17
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.500
and sweet King Henrypray for me.

18
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.430
(Group) Amen

19
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.470
Hung be the heavens withblack, yield day to night!

20
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.000
Comets, importing changeof times and states,

21
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.830
Brandish your crystaltresses in the sky,

22
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.800
And with them scourge thebad revolting stars

23
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.500
That have consented untoHenry's death!

24
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.500
Henry the Fifth, toofamous to live long!

25
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.700
England ne'er lost a kingof so much worth.

26
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.830
England ne'er had a kinguntil his time.

27
00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.630
Virtue he had, deservingto command:

28
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.830
His brandish'd sword didblind men with his beams:

29
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.430
His arms spread wider thana dragon's wings;

30
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.700
His sparking eyes, repletewith wrathful fire,

31
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.670
More dazzled and droveback his enemies

32
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.770
Than mid-day sun fiercebent against their faces.

33
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.930
What should I say? hisdeeds exceed all speech:

34
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.200
He ne'er lift up his handbut conquered.

35
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.600
We mourn in black: whymourn we not in blood?

36
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.530
Henry is dead and nevershall revive:

37
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.500
Upon a wooden coffin weattend,

38
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.930
And death's dishonourablevictory

39
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.030
We with our statelypresence glorify,

40
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.600
Like captives bound to atriumphant car.

41
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.330
What! shall we curse theplanets of mishap

42
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.230
That plotted thus ourglory's overthrow?

43
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.030
Or shall we think thesubtle-witted French

44
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.270
Conjurers and sorcerers,that afraid of him

45
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.630
By magic verses havecontrived his end?

46
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.900
He was a king bless'd ofthe King of kings.

47
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.570
Unto the French thedreadful judgement-day

48
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:37.000
So dreadful will not be aswas his sight.

49
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.370
The battles of the Lord ofhosts he fought:

50
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.600
The church's prayers madehim so prosperous.

51
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.070
The church! where is it?Had not churchmen pray'd,

52
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.930
His thread of life had notso soon decay'd:

53
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.300
None do you like but aneffeminate prince,

54
00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.730
Whom, like a school-boy,you may over-awe.

55
00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.600
Gloucester, whate'er welike, thou art protector

56
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.930
And lookest to command theprince and realm.

57
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.330
Thy wife is proud; sheholdeth thee in awe,

58
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.900
More than God or religiouschurchmen may.

59
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.570
Name not religion, forthou lovest the flesh,

60
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.170
And ne'er throughout theyear to church thou go'st

61
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.830
Except it be to prayagainst thy foes.

62
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.470
Cease, cease these jars andrest your minds in peace:

63
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.570
Let's to the altar:heralds, wait on us:

64
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.500
Instead of gold, we'lloffer up our arms:

65
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.000
Since arms avail not nowthat Henry's dead.

66
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.670
Henry the Fifth, thy ghostI invocate:

67
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:01.130
Prosper this realm, keepit from civil broils,

68
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.330
Combat with adverseplanets in the heavens!

69
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.700
A far more glorious starthy soul shall make

70
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.930
Than Julius Caesar orbright--

71
00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.070
My honourable lords,health to you all!

72
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.230
Sad tidings bring I to youout of France,

73
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:23.430
Of loss, of slaughter anddiscomfiture:

74
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:29.430
Guienne, Champagne,Rheims, Orleans,

75
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:33.400
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers,are all quite lost.

76
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.430
What say'st thou, man,before dead Henry's corse?

77
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.300
Speak softly, or the lossof those great towns

78
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.270
Will make him burst hislead and rise from death.

79
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.300
Is Paris lost? is Rouenyielded up?

80
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.170
If Henry were recall'd tolife again,

81
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.770
These news would cause himonce more yield the ghost.

82
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.070
How were they lost? whattreachery was used?

83
00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:05.130
No treachery; but want ofmen and money.

84
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.770
Amongst the soldiers thisis muttered,

85
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:11.000
That here you maintainseveral factions,

86
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.200
And whilst a field shouldbe dispatch'd and fought,

87
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.300
You are disputing of yourgenerals:

88
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.370
One would have lingeringwars with little cost;

89
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.870
Another would fly swift,but wanteth wings;

90
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.530
A third thinks, withoutexpense at all,

91
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:29.630
By guileful fair wordspeace may be obtain'd.

92
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:35.100
Awake, awake, Englishnobility!

93
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.830
Let not sloth dim yourhorrors new-begot:

94
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.330
Cropp'd are theflower-de-luces in your arms;

95
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.070
Of England's coat one halfis cut away.

96
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.830
Were our tears wanting tothis funeral,

97
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.930
These tidings would callforth their flowing tides.

98
00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.330
Me they concern; Regent Iam of France.

99
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.070
Give me my steeled coat.I'll fight for France.

100
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.700
Away with thesedisgraceful wailing robes!

101
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.030
Wounds will I lend theFrench instead of eyes,

102
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.530
To weep their intermissivemiseries.

103
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:14.370
Lords, view these lettersfull of bad mischance.

104
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.130
France is revolted fromthe English quite,

105
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.430
Except some petty towns ofno import:

106
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.970
The Dauphin Charles iscrowned king of Rheims;

107
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.300
The Bastard of Orleanswith him is join'd;

108
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.500
Reignier, Duke of Anjou,doth take his part;

109
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.300
The Duke of Alencon fliethto his side.

110
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.330
The Dauphin crowned king!all fly to him!

111
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.270
O, whither shall we flyfrom this reproach?

112
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.530
We will not fly, but toour enemies' throats.

113
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.400
Bedford, if thou be slack,I'll fight it out.

114
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.070
Gloucester, why doubt'stthou of my forwardness?

115
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.800
An army have I muster'd inmy thoughts,

116
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.070
Wherewith already Franceis overrun.

117
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.030
My gracious lords, to addto your laments,

118
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:55.600
Wherewith you now bedewKing Henry's hearse,

119
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.700
I must inform you of adismal fight

120
00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.270
Betwixt the stout LordTalbot and the French.

121
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.970
What! wherein Talbotovercame? is't so?

122
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.800
O, no; wherein Lord Talbotwas o'erthrown:

123
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:14.170
The circumstance I'll tellyou more at large.

124
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.200
The tenth of August lastthis dreadful lord,

125
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.730
Retiring from the siege ofOrleans,

126
00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.230
Having full scarce sixthousand in his troop.

127
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:28.000
By three and twentythousand of the French

128
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.900
Was round encompassed andset upon.

129
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.530
No leisure had he toenrank his men;

130
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.730
He wanted pikes to setbefore his archers;

131
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.430
Instead whereof sharp stakespluck'd out of hedges

132
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.830
They pitched in the groundconfusedly,

133
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.900
To keep the horsemen offfrom breaking in.

134
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.030
More than three hours thefight continued;

135
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.500
Where valiant Talbot abovehuman thought

136
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.400
Enacted wonders with hissword and lance:

137
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.900
Hundreds he sent to hell,and none durst stand him;

138
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.330
Here, there, and everywhere, enraged he flew:

139
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.230
The French exclaim'd, thedevil was in arms;

140
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:08.900
All the whole army stoodagazed on him:

141
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.530
His soldiers spying hisundaunted spirit

142
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.170
A Talbot! a Talbot! criedout amain

143
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.900
And rush'd into the bowelsof the battle.

144
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.100
Here had the conquestfully been seal'd up,

145
00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.430
If Sir John Fastolfe hadnot play'd the coward:

146
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:28.070
He, being in the vaward,placed behind

147
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.270
With purpose to relieveand follow them,

148
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.530
Cowardly fled, not havingstruck one stroke.

149
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.000
Hence grew the generalwreck and massacre;

150
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.300
Enclosed were they withtheir enemies:

151
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.670
A base Walloon, to win theDauphin's grace,

152
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.670
Thrust Talbot with a spearinto the back,

153
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.170
Whom all France with theirchief assembled strength

154
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.930
Durst not presume to lookonce in the face.

155
00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.600
Is Talbot slain? then Iwill slay myself,

156
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.630
For living idly here inpomp and ease,

157
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.530
Whilst such a worthyleader, wanting aid,

158
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.000
Unto his dastard foemen isbetray'd.

159
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.170
O no, he lives; but istook prisoner,

160
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.700
And Lord Scales with himand Lord Hungerford:

161
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.930
Most of the rest slaughter'dor took likewise.

162
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.470
His ransom there is nonebut I shall pay:

163
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.630
I'll hale the Dauphinheadlong from his throne:

164
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.830
His crown shall be theransom of my friend;

165
00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:34.870
Four of their lords I'llchange for one of ours.

166
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.200
Farewell, my masters; tomy task will I;

167
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.500
Bonfires in Franceforthwith I am to make,

168
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.270
To keep our great SaintGeorge's feast withal:

169
00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.570
Ten thousand soldiers withme I will take,

170
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.500
Whose bloody deeds shallmake all Europe quake.

171
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.030
So you had need; forOrleans is besieged;

172
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.200
The English army is grownweak and faint:

173
00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.370
The Earl of Salisburycraveth supply,

174
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.030
And hardly keeps his menfrom mutiny,

175
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:06.270
Since they, so few, watchsuch a multitude.

176
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:09.370
Remember, lords, youroaths to Henry sworn,

177
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.300
Either to quell theDauphin utterly,

178
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.370
Or bring him in obedienceto your yoke.

179
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.770
I do remember it; and heretake my leave,

180
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.470
To go about mypreparation.

181
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.930
I'll to the Tower with allthe haste I can,

182
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.970
To view the artillery andmunition;

183
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.230
And then I will proclaimyoung Henry king.

184
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.430
To Eltham will I, wherethe young king is,

185
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.730
Being ordain'd his specialgovernor,

186
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.600
And for his safety thereI'll best devise.

187
00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:53.300
Each hath his place andfunction to attend:

188
00:13:53.300 --> 00:14:00.500
I am left out; for menothing remains.

189
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:05.130
But long I will not beJack out of office:

190
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.770
The king from Eltham Iintend to steal

191
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:14.100
And sit at chiefest sternof public weal.

192
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.900
Mars his true moving, evenas in the heavens

193
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.230
So in the earth, to thisday is not known:

194
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:55.370
Late did he shine upon theEnglish side;

195
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:59.130
Now we are victors; uponus he smiles.

196
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.830
What towns of any momentbut we have?

197
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.300
At pleasure here we lienear Orleans;

198
00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.400
Otherwhiles the famish'dEnglish, like pale ghosts,

199
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.470
Faintly besiege us onehour in a month.

200
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.970
They want their porridgeand their fat bull-beeves:

201
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.030
Either they must be dietedlike mules

202
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.130
And have their provendertied to their mouths

203
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:27.370
Or piteous they will look,like drowned mice.

204
00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:32.430
Let's raise the siege: whylive we idly here?

205
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.800
Talbot is taken, whom wewont to fear:

206
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.870
Remaineth none butmad-brain'd Salisbury;

207
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.370
And he may well infretting spend his gall,

208
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.100
Nor men nor money hath heto make war.

209
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.670
Sound, sound alarum! wewill rush on them.

210
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.900
Now for the honour of theforlorn French!

211
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.430
Him I forgive my deaththat killeth me

212
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.070
When he sees me go backone foot or fly.

213
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.630
Who ever saw the like?what men have I!

214
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:32.400
Dogs! cowards! dastards! Iwould ne'er have fled,

215
00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.630
But that they left me'midst my enemies.

216
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.000
Salisbury is a desperatehomicide;

217
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.600
He fighteth as one wearyof his life.

218
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.670
The other lords, likelions wanting food,

219
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.000
Do rush upon us as theirhungry prey.

220
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:50.800
Lean, raw-boned rascals!who would e'er suppose

221
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:55.930
They had such courage andaudacity?

222
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.030
Let's leave this town; forthey are hare-brain'd slaves,

223
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.500
And hunger will enforcethem to be more eager:

224
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.100
Of old I know them; ratherwith their teeth

225
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:08.600
The walls they'll tear downthan forsake the siege.

226
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.730
I think, by some oddgimmors or device

227
00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:15.170
Their arms are set likeclocks, still to strike on;

228
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.170
Else ne'er could they holdout so as they do.

229
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:22.730
By my consent, we'll evenlet them alone.

230
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.530
Be it so.

231
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:29.700
Where's the Prince Dauphin?I have news for him.

232
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.570
Bastard of Orleans, thricewelcome to us.

233
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.530
Methinks your looks aresad, your cheer appall'd:

234
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.470
Hath the late overthrowwrought this offence?

235
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:43.100
Be not dismay'd, forsuccor is at hand:

236
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.270
A holy maid hither with meI bring,

237
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.430
Which by a vision sent toher from heaven

238
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.030
Ordained is to raise thistedious siege

239
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:54.170
And drive the English forththe bounds of France.

240
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.930
The spirit of deepprophecy she hath,

241
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.800
Exceeding the nine sibylsof old Rome:

242
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:04.300
What's past and what's tocome she can descry.

243
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.870
Speak, shall I call herin? Believe my words,

244
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.170
For they are certain andunfallible.

245
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.400
Go, call her in.

246
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.630
But first, to try herskill,

247
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:20.030
Reignier, stand thou asDauphin in my place:

248
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.800
Question her proudly; letthy looks be stern:

249
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.130
By this means shall wesound what skill she hath.

250
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:39.970
Fair maid, is't thou wiltdo these wondrous feats?

251
00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.900
Reignier, is't thou thatthinkest to beguile me?

252
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:51.400
Where is the Dauphin?Come, come from behind;

253
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.300
I know thee well, thoughnever seen before.

254
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.230
Be not amazed, there'snothing hid from me:

255
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.700
In private will I talkwith thee apart.

256
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.030
Stand back, you lords, andgive us leave awhile.

257
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.830
She takes upon her bravelyat first dash.

258
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.670
Dauphin, I am by birth ashepherd's daughter,

259
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.470
My wit untrain'd in anykind of art.

260
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.670
Heaven and our Ladygracious hath it pleased

261
00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.200
To shine on mycontemptible estate:

262
00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.270
Lo, whilst I waited on mytender lambs,

263
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.270
And to sun's parching heatdisplay'd my cheeks,

264
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.770
God's mother deigned toappear to me

265
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.730
And in a vision full ofmajesty

266
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.470
Will'd me to leave my basevocation

267
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.170
And free my country fromcalamity:

268
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.400
Her aid she promised andassured success:

269
00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.800
In complete glory shereveal'd herself;

270
00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.930
And, whereas I was blackand swart before,

271
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.530
With those clear rayswhich she infused on me

272
00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.570
That beauty am I bless'dwith which you see.

273
00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:03.800
Ask me what question thoucanst possible,

274
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.070
And I will answerunpremeditated:

275
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:11.170
My courage try by combat,if thou darest,

276
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.930
And thou shalt find that Iexceed my sex.

277
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.100
Resolve on this, thoushalt be fortunate,

278
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.130
If thou receive me for thywarlike mate.

279
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.330
Thou hast astonish'd mewith thy high terms:

280
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.000
Only this proof I'll ofthy valour make,

281
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.700
In single combat thoushalt buckle with me,

282
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.800
And if thou vanquishest,thy words are true;

283
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.330
Otherwise I renounce allconfidence.

284
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.330
I am prepared: here is mykeen-edged sword,

285
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.230
Deck'd with fiveflower-de-luces on each side;

286
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.270
The which at Touraine, inSaint Katharine's churchyard,

287
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.970
Out of a great deal ofold iron I chose forth.

288
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.730
Then come, o' God's name;I fear no woman.

289
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.470
And while I live, I'llne'er fly from a man.

290
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:28.700
Stay, stay thy hands! thouart an Amazon

291
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:31.070
And fightest with thesword of Deborah.

292
00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.500
Christ's mother helps me,else I were too weak.

293
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.730
Whoe'er helps thee, 'tisthou that must help me:

294
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.970
Impatiently I burn withthy desire;

295
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:45.530
My heart and hands thouhast at once subdued.

296
00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:48.830
Excellent Pucelle, if thyname be so,

297
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:52.930
Let me thy servant and notsovereign be:

298
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.070
'Tis the French Dauphinsueth to thee thus.

299
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:59.070
I must not yield to anyrites of love,

300
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:05.000
For my profession's sacredfrom above:

301
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.500
When I have chased all thyfoes from hence,

302
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.100
Then will I think upon arecompense.

303
00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:18.100
Meantime look gracious onthy prostrate thrall.

304
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.970
Methinks, My Lord isvery long in talk.

305
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.000
Doubtless he shrives thiswoman to her smock;

306
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.900
Else ne'er could he solong protract his speech.

307
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.270
Shall we disturb him,since he keeps no mean?

308
00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.430
He may mean more than wepoor men do know:

309
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:41.530
These women are shrewdtempters with their tongues.

310
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.570
My lord, where are you?what devise you on?

311
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.770
Shall we give overOrleans, or no?

312
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:55.370
Why, no, I say,distrustful recreants!

313
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.230
Fight till the last gasp;I will be your guard.

314
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.970
What she says I'll confirm:we'll fight it out.

315
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.100
Assign'd am I to be theEnglish scourge.

316
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.000
This night the siegeassuredly I'll raise:

317
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.530
Expect Saint Martin'ssummer, halcyon days,

318
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.870
Since I have entered intothese wars.

319
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.930
Glory is like a circle inthe water,

320
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.700
Which never ceaseth toenlarge itself

321
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.700
Till by broad spreading itdisperse to nought.

322
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:28.930
With Henry's death theEnglish circle ends;

323
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.930
Dispersed are the gloriesit included.

324
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.400
Now am I like that proudinsulting ship

325
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:39.100
Which Caesar and hisfortunes bare at once.

326
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.500
Bright star of Venus,fall'n down on the earth,

327
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.200
How may I reverentworship thee enough?

328
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.170
Leave off delays, and letus raise the siege.

329
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.800
Woman, do what thou canstto save our honours;

330
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.930
Drive them from Orleansand be immortalized.

331
00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.100
Presently we'll try: come,let's away about it:

332
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.370
No prophet will I trust,if she prove false.

333
00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:13.830
I am come to survey theTower this day:

334
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.330
Since Henry's death, Ifear, there is conveyance.

335
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.430
Where be these warders,that they wait not here?

336
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:35.900
Open the gates; The Duke ofGloucester calls.

337
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.230
[Within] Who's there thatknockth so imperiously?

338
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.500
(First Serving-Man) It is thenoble Duke of Gloucester.

339
00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.470
[Within] Whoe'er he be,you may not be let in.

340
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.970
(First Serving-Man)Villains, answer you

341
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.100
so the lord protector?

342
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.870
[Within] The Lord protecthim! so we answer him:

343
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.730
We do no otherwise than weare will'd.

344
00:24:56.730 --> 00:25:00.870
Who willed you? or whosewill stands but mine?

345
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.100
There's none protector ofthe realm but I.

346
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.270
Break up the gates, I'llbe your warrantize.

347
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:15.270
Shall I be flouted thus bydunghill grooms?

348
00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.870
What noise is this? whattraitors have we here?

349
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.900
Lieutenant, is it youwhose voice I hear?

350
00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.370
Open the gates; here'sGloucester that would enter.

351
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.730
Have patience, noble duke;I may not open;

352
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:29.000
His grace, My Lord ofWinchester forbids:

353
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.230
From him I have expresscommandment

354
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:35.200
That thou nor none ofthine shall be let in.

355
00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:40.000
Faint-hearted Woodvile,prizest him 'fore me?

356
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.100
Arrogant Winchester,that haughty prelate,

357
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.230
Whom Henry, our latesovereign, ne'er could brook?

358
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.700
Thou art no friend to Godor to the king:

359
00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.270
Open the gates, or I'llshut thee out shortly.

360
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:55.500
(Serving-Men) Open the gatesunto the lord protector,

361
00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.800
Or we'll burst them open, ifthat you come not quickly.

362
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.930
How now, ambitiousHumphry! what means this?

363
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.970
Peel'd priest, dost thoucommand me to be shut out?

364
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.600
I do, thou most usurpingproditor,

365
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.130
And not protector, of theking or realm.

366
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.370
Stand back, thou manifestconspirator,

367
00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.100
Thou that contrivedst tomurder our dead lord;

368
00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.370
Thou that givest whoresindulgences to sin:

369
00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.130
Nay, stand thou back, Iwill not budge a foot:

370
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.770
This be Damascus, be thoucursed Cain,

371
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.200
To slay thy brother Abel,if thou wilt.

372
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.670
I will not slay thee, butI'll drive thee back:

373
00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.970
Do what thou darest; Ibeard thee to thy face.

374
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:08.300
What! am I dared andbearded to my face?

375
00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.570
Draw, men, for all thisprivileged place;

376
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.570
Blue coats to tawny coats.Priest, beware your beard,

377
00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:18.270
I mean to tug it and tocuff you soundly:

378
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.930
Here by the cheeks I'lldrag thee up and down.

379
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.130
Gloucester, thou wilt answerthis before the pope.

380
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.330
Winchester goose, I cry, arope! a rope!

381
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:35.800
Now beat them hence; whydo you let them stay?

382
00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.730
Thee I'll chase hence, thouwolf in sheep's array.

383
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:55.500
Fie, lords! that you,being supreme magistrates,

384
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.000
Thus contumeliously shouldbreak the peace!

385
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.700
Peace, mayor! thou know'stlittle of my wrongs:

386
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.230
Here's Beaufort, thatregards nor God nor king,

387
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.770
Hath here distrain'd theTower to his use.

388
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.100
Here's Gloucester, a foeto citizens,

389
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.030
One that still motions warand never peace,

390
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.000
O'ercharging your freepurses with large fines,

391
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.970
And would have armour hereout of the Tower,

392
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.200
To crown himself king andsuppress the prince.

393
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.770
I will not answer theewith words, but blows.

394
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.600
Naught rests for me inthis tumultuous strife

395
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.730
But to make openproclamation:

396
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.170
Come, officer; as loud ase'er thou canst,

397
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:42.400
All manner of men assembledhere in arms this day

398
00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.400
against God's peace andthe king's, we charge

399
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.700
and command you, in hishighness' name, to repair to

400
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.830
your several dwelling-places;and not to wear,

401
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:54.630
handle, or use any sword,weapon, or dagger,

402
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.370
henceforward, upon pain ofdeath.

403
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.430
Winchester, I'll be nobreaker of the law:

404
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.130
But we shall meet, andbreak our minds at large.

405
00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:10.700
Gloucester, we will meet;to thy cost, be sure:

406
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:14.330
Thy heart-blood I willhave for this day's work.

407
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.330
I'll call for clubs, ifyou will not away.

408
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.400
This Winchester's morehaughty than the devil.

409
00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.400
Mayor, farewell: thou dostbut what thou mayst.

410
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.930
Abominable Gloucester,guard thy head;

411
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.500
For I intend to have itere long.

412
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.100
See the coast clear'd, andthen we will depart.

413
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:48.000
Good God, these noblesshould such stomachs bear!

414
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.270
I myself fight not once inforty year.

415
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:08.430
Sirrah, thou know'st howOrleans is besieged,

416
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.400
And how the English havethe suburbs won.

417
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.530
Father, I know; and ofthave shot at them,

418
00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:15.930
Howe'er unfortunate Imiss'd my aim.

419
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:21.970
(Master-Gunner) But now thoushalt not. Be thou ruled by me:

420
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.470
Chief master-gunner am Iof this town;

421
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:28.230
Something I must do toprocure me grace.

422
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:32.300
The prince's espials haveinformed me

423
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.170
How the English, in thesuburbs close intrench'd,

424
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:38.030
Wont, through a secretgrate of iron bars

425
00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:44.170
In yonder tower, tooverpeer the city,

426
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:46.730
And thence discover howwith most advantage

427
00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:50.470
They may vex us with shot,or with assault.

428
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.770
To intercept thisinconvenience,

429
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.570
A piece of ordnance'gainst it have I placed;

430
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.900
And even these three days,

431
00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.070
watch'd If I could see them.

432
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:04.300
Now do thou watch, forI can stay no longer.

433
00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.700
If thou spy'st any, runand bring me word;

434
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.670
And thou shalt find me atthe governor's.

435
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:17.700
Father, I warrant you;take you no care;

436
00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.070
I'll never trouble you, ifI may spy them.

437
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:48.230
Talbot, my life, my joy,again return'd!

438
00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.530
How wert thou handledbeing prisoner?

439
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.800
Or by what means got'stthou to be released?

440
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.230
The Earl of Bedford had aprisoner

441
00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:01.100
Call'd the brave LordPonton de Santrailles;

442
00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.100
For him was I exchangedand ransomed.

443
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.770
In fine, redeem'd I was asI desired.

444
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:11.600
But, O! the treacherousFastolfe wounds my heart,

445
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.270
Whom with my bare fists Iwould execute,

446
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.030
If I now had him broughtinto my power.

447
00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:24.000
Yet tell'st thou not howthou wert entertain'd.

448
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.730
With scoffs and scorns andcontumelious taunts.

449
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.170
In open market-placeproduced they me,

450
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:41.030
To be a public spectacleto all:

451
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:43.930
Here, said they, is theterror of the French,

452
00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:48.300
The scarecrow thataffrights our children so.

453
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.030
Then broke I from theofficers that led me,

454
00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.470
And with my nails digg'dstones out of the ground,

455
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.870
To hurl at the beholdersof my shame:

456
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.130
My grisly countenance madeothers fly;

457
00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:02.970
None durst come near forfear of sudden death.

458
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:07.500
In iron walls they deem'dme not secure;

459
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.070
So great fear of my name'mongst them was spread,

460
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.930
That they supposed I couldrend bars of steel,

461
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.370
And spurn in pieces postsof adamant:

462
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:21.200
Wherefore a guard ofchosen shot I had,

463
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:24.670
That walked about me everyminute-while;

464
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:27.600
And if I did but stir outof my bed,

465
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.800
Ready they were to shootme to the heart.

466
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.230
I grieve to hear whattorments you endured,

467
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:45.630
But we will be revengedsufficiently

468
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.430
Now it is supper-time inOrleans:

469
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.470
Here, through this tower,I count each one

470
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.500
and view the Frenchmen howthey fortify:

471
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.730
Let us look in; the sightwill much delight thee.

472
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:15.000
Sir Thomas Gargrave, andSir William Glansdale,

473
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.900
Let me have your expressopinions

474
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.930
Where is best place tomake our battery next.

475
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:21.400
I think, at the north gate;for there stand lords.

476
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.070
And I, here, at thebulwark of the bridge.

477
00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:27.530
For aught I see, this citymust be famish'd,

478
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.700
Or with light skirmishesenfeebled.

479
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:49.430
O Lord, have mercy on us,wretched sinners!

480
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:54.330
O Lord, have mercy on me,woful man!

481
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.800
What chance is this thatsuddenly hath cross'd us?

482
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.930
Speak, Salisbury; at least,if thou canst speak:

483
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.200
How farest thou, mirror ofall martial men?

484
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.770
One of thy eyes and thycheek's side struck off!

485
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:19.200
Accursed tower! accursedfatal hand

486
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.630
That hath contrived thiswoful tragedy!

487
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.870
In thirteen battlesSalisbury o'ercame;

488
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.630
Henry the Fifth he firsttrain'd to the wars;

489
00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.000
Whilst any trump didsound, or drum struck up,

490
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.970
His sword did ne'er leavestriking in the field.

491
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:47.800
Yet livest thou, Salisbury?though thy speech doth fail,

492
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.900
One eye thou hast, to lookto heaven for grace:

493
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.100
The sun with one eyevieweth all the world.

494
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.200
Heaven, be thou graciousto none alive,

495
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:03.330
If Salisbury wants mercyat thy hands!

496
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:10.130
What stir is this? whattumult's in the heavens?

497
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.070
Whence cometh this alarumand the noise?

498
00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.600
My lord, my lord, theFrench have gathered head:

499
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.130
The Dauphin, with one Joanla Pucelle join'd,

500
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:20.270
A holy prophetess newrisen up,

501
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:25.370
Is come with a great powerto raise the siege.

502
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.600
Hear, dyingSalisbury doth groan!

503
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.570
It irks his heart hecannot be revenged.

504
00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.470
Frenchmen, I'll be aSalisbury to you:

505
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.630
Puzzel or pucelle, dolphinor dogfish,

506
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.270
Your hearts I'll stamp outwith my horse's heels,

507
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:54.100
And make a quagmire ofyour mingled brains.

508
00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:00.500
Convey me Salisbury intohis tent,

509
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.830
And then try what these dastardFrenchmen dare.

510
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.000
(Screaming)

511
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.570
Cry: A Talbot

512
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:28.800
Joan of France and laPucelle

513
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.770
Where is my strength, myvalour, and my force?

514
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:33.700
Our English troops retire,I cannot stay them:

515
00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:39.870
A woman clad in armourchaseth them.

516
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:47.770
Here, here she comes. I'llhave a bout with thee;

517
00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:52.100
Devil or devil's dam, I'llconjure thee:

518
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:54.870
Blood will I draw on thee,thou art a witch,

519
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.370
And straightway give thysoul to him thou servest.

520
00:37:57.370 --> 00:38:00.870
Come, come, 'tis only Ithat must disgrace thee.

521
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.700
Heavens, can you sufferhell so to prevail?

522
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.030
My breast I'll burst withstraining of my courage

523
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.130
And from my shoulderscrack my arms asunder.

524
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:34.030
But I will chastise thishigh-minded strumpet.

525
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.000
Talbot, farewell; thy houris not yet come:

526
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.030
I must go victor Orleansforthwith.

527
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:10.370
O'ertake me, if thou canst;I scorn thy strength.

528
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:14.070
Go, go, cheer up thyhungry-starved men;

529
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.570
Help Salisbury to make histestament:

530
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:22.870
This day is ours, as manymore shall be.

531
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.570
My mind are whirledlike a potter's wheel;

532
00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:27.000
I know not where I am, norwhat I do;

533
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.870
A witch, by fear, notforce, like Hannibal,

534
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:33.800
Drives back our troops andconquers as she lists:

535
00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.100
They call'd us for ourfierceness English dogs;

536
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:45.400
Now, like to whelps, wecrying run away.

537
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.830
Hark, countrymen! eitherrenew the fight,

538
00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.100
Or tear the lions out ofEngland's coat;

539
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:55.030
Renounce your style, givesheep in lions' stead:

540
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.270
Sheep run not half sotreacherous from the wolf,

541
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.370
Or horse or oxen from theleopard,

542
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:04.900
As you fly from youroft-subdued slaves.

543
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:14.030
Cry: A Talbot

544
00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:30.200
It will not be: retireinto your trenches:

545
00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.230
You all consented untoSalisbury's death,

546
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.330
For none would strike astroke in his revenge.

547
00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.000
Pucelle is enter'd intoOrleans,

548
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:05.030
In spite of us or aughtthat we could do.

549
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:10.030
O, would I were to diewith Salisbury!

550
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.430
The shame hereof will makeme hide my head.

551
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.170
Advance our waving colourson the walls;

552
00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.700
Rescued is Orleans fromthe English

553
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:05.300
Thus Joan la Pucelle hathperform'd her word.

554
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:10.570
Divinest creature,Astraea's daughter,

555
00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:12.430
How shall I honour theefor this success?

556
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:15.230
Why ring not out the bellsaloud throughout the town?

557
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:17.800
Dauphin, command thecitizens make bonfires

558
00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.370
And feast and banquet inthe open streets,

559
00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:24.030
To celebrate the joy thatGod hath given us.

560
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.170
All France will be repletewith mirth and joy,

561
00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.900
When they shall hear howwe have play'd the men.

562
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:37.130
'Tis Joan, not we, by whomthe day is won;

563
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:39.600
For which I will divide mycrown with her,

564
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.900
And all the priests andfriars in my realm

565
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:46.130
Shall in procession singher endless praise.

566
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.930
No longer on Saint Deniswill we cry,

567
00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.300
But Joan la Pucelle shallbe France's saint.

568
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.330
Come in, and let usbanquet royally,

569
00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:04.030
After this golden day ofvictory.

570
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:32.270
