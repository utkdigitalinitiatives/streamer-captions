>> NARRATOR: ...is being pushed

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.200

producing entertainment programs

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.060
dressed up as news.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.030
>> ...depraved a wasteland where

"You know, network

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.230
gone soft and it's because of a

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.900
profit motive.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.130
And it makes a really good story

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.160
that particularly people in

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.030
print like to write.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.230
I think the subject is more

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.530
complicated than that and more

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.400
subtle than that.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.200

">> I think, in fact... I think"

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.500
the soft/hard distinction is

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.560
much harder than people would

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.900
like to make it out to be.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.900
The profit motivation is clearly

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.300
an issue in the sense that we

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.530
need to return some reasonable

00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.260
amount of income to Walt Disney

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.230

"I mean, this is
all information,"

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.230
but there was a time-- at least

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.700
in my lifetime-- when that would

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.630
not be considered news.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.260
Has the standard for what

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.300
qualifies as news changed

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.200
primarily because of the

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.460
pressure of profits and ratings?

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.730

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.230
ignoble.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.200
"So, it's broadened,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.030

"mission, to do quality news of"

I would say the strongest early

them every once and a while.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.830

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.230
paragraph-- Section 315 of the

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.760

American journalism as a brand

>> NARRATOR: All of it is

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.230
chopped up to appeal to Yahoo's

journalism.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.130
I think it's a big mistake to

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.530
define journalism by the person

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.230
who does it.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:49.830

egregious.

"But no one did unpack it, and"

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.560
most of the news media just

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.100
ignored it.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.130
ignored it.

a 24-hour audition-- that it

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.400

"going to catch fire, whether"

it's going to become a real

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.460
story-- and that story failed

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.430
its 24-hour audition.

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:20.430

would have been the end of it.

But my blog and others picked up

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:27.200
the story and basically started

"making the case
for it, that it"

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:30.200
was a lot more important than

the rest of the news media had

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.930
thought.

It was an affirmation of the

power of the blogs.

liberal mainstream media.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.230
When CBS News claimed to have

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:06.460
incriminating documents about

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.460
President Bush's National Guard

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.130
"service, it caught
the interest"

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:16.760
of a conservative web log called

Power Line.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.960
Scott Johnson posted questions

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.660
about the story.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.500
"Soon, information that raised"

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.460
doubts about CBS's documents

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.460
began streaming in from around

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.500
the blogosphere.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.600
>> We knew nothing.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.400
The information that we

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.600
contributed was from people who

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.630
did know something and who read

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.000

during the day.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.230
And it really illustrated

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.230
something about the power of the

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:41.630
medium that it could draw on the

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.300
expertise of so many people over

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.300
such a short period of time.

on the site?

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.160
The question I had later that

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.330
morning was how many times has

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:26.400
CBS done this before and gotten

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.400
away with it?

gathered by newspapers.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.960
The web opens up vast

possibilities for good

journalism and already has

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:32.900
created many new voices that are

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.700
valuable.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:35.760
I don't think we can turn this

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:38.060
thing over entirely to bloggers

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.060
and citizen journalists.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:51.000
"They're valuable,

latest generation sold it off.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.300
This is the story about what has

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.030
happened to the Los Angeles

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:24.760
Times.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.760
It's the story of American

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.500
journalism and the turmoil going

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.060
on inside newsrooms across the

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.060
country.

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.260
It all began with an $8.3

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:36.900
billion deal that the Chicago-

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.200
based Tribune Company hoped

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:40.700
would be the start of a new

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.700
media empire.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:44.760

"newspapers, which included the"

"Sun and Newsday, and some"

And they said they felt they

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.700
bought one of the crown jewels

"of American
journalism, and they"

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.600
wanted to keep it that way and

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.600
build it.

>> NARRATOR: But Carroll had to

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.530
deal with some big problems.

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.600
"Circulation had been slipping,"

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.900
and there'd been growing

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:12.700
tensions between the newsroom

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.560
and the last publisher.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.560
Carroll's first move was to

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.060
recruit a managing editor from

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:22.900
"the New York
Times, Dean Baquet."

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:23.630
>> So we came in and it was a

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:25.060
"newsroom that was down, but it"

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:25.960
was a hell of a newsroom.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.430
( laughs )

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:30.900
"I mean, if I came in and said"

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.860
that... I would not say that I

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.530
"walked in the door, or John"

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:33.930
"walked in the door, and picked"

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:35.330
it up off the ground.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.860
I think it was like a Ferrari

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.860
that just needed to be reminded

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.060
that it was a Ferrari.

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.460
( laughs )

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.700
And that's what we did.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.830
>> NARRATOR: Carroll and Baquet

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:51.400
revived the Times' tradition of

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.730
"pursuing big,
serious stories at"

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:54.800
home and abroad-- in-depth

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.430
investigations that serve the

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:58.030
public interest and win

journalism awards.

"Under their

course of the six years John and

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.400
"I were together
as many, if not"

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.700
"more, Pulitzer Prizes than any"

paper in the country.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:19.030
Not that Pulitzer Prizes are a

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.130
"be all and end all, but for a"

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.230

"reputation, they
were important."

"reputation, they
were important."

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:25.500
And I think they told the world

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.000
"that this paper
is coming back,"

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
and they told the paper and the

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.200
staff that we can run with

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.030

We are... it's getting close to

"Times-Mirror, was that a good"

deal?

">> It was a terrible deal, and"

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.530
the market knew it at the time.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:25.930
Tribune's stock declined

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:26.900
dramatically on the day they

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.760
announced they were buying

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.760
Times-Mirror.

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.200
They overpaid.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.730
Everybody knew it at the time.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:36.030
It wasn't a good deal.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.700
"And that, unfortunately, has"

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:38.830
been the beginning of a lot of

the problems that we're

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.630
suffering with today.

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:44.300
>> I'm actually one of the

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.030
people who still think it was

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.360
"the right thing to do, smart"

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.430
strategically.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:50.700
>> NARRATOR: David Hiller is a

"senior executive
at Tribune, and"

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:53.700
was one of the architects of the

Times-Mirror deal.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:56.660
>> There are a lot of things

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.760
that happened after the merger

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.860
that nobody at the time

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:00.900
"predicted, including huge"

"recession, terrorist attack,"

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.930
bumps along the way.

00:48:06.930 --> 00:48:09.930
But the core vision of what you

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.930
could do by putting these great

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.260
newspapers together was smart

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:19.760
"then, and I think it's smart"

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.960
>> NARRATOR: But the deal didn't

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:25.930
"play out as they thought, and"

00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:28.030
with circulation continuing to

savings at the L.A. Times.

Printing and delivery account

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:35.300
for 70% of the cost of producing

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.330
"a newspaper, so this is where"

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:41.330
they started cutting.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.260
"But soon, Tribune also wanted"

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:45.500
"cuts in the
newsroom, which had"

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.360
become the second largest in the

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.460
country.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.700
>> It was clear that some cuts

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:52.830
had to be made.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:55.660
I'm not sure that those were the

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.660
"right cuts, but at a certain"

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.760
"point, if you're going to lead"

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.330
your newsroom and the publisher

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:00.460
made a convincing case that we

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:02.460
"had to do layoffs,
you do them."

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.530
"had to do layoffs,
you do them."

00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:04.930
>> And they've cost cut every

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.300
year.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.300
And for a while it was fine

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.430
because there really was

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:13.700
considerable fat in the

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.360
operation.

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:15.930
operation.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.230
But after a while it began to

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:19.060
damage the business side of the

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:19.760
paper and its ability to keep

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.300
the circulation up.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.130
It damaged the news side of the

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:21.900
paper.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.600
It reduced the amount we were

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.400
able to give the reader.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.300
>> The cuts started to be sort

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.130
of part of the life of the

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.400
"paper, and I
think this is true"

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.500
in a lot of papers.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:30.460
"It wasn't just layoffs, it was"

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:32.530
"every few months... I mean,"

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:33.400
you'd start the year with a

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.960
"budget, and every few months"

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.230
you'd re-budget and you'd cut

And it was happening at a time

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.430
when the paper was making lots

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:51.430

20% operating margin.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.300
That's roughly double what the

I don't understand it.

every year than you made the

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:27.360

Is it getting bigger or is it

getting smaller?

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.700
That's plainly the concern that

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.800
the investors have and why Wall

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.500

I think there's a tremendous

amount of anxiety right now

high-falutin', but"

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.200

of my world and the people who

own newspapers because they are

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:45.260

newspapers.

and cut.

And they end up downsizing and

01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:07.760
hollowing out their reporting

"happens, they can

ambushed on a patrol in Baghdad.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.130
>> So the convoy's guard shot

01:10:51.130 --> 01:10:53.130
back at the insurgents.

01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:55.130

"have, he pulled the camera out"

01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:57.100
and started filming this

firefight.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:10:58.800

"was like, ""What

some traffic there.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:07.430
And I think... so it's adding to

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:08.200
the journalism and understanding

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.200

01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.900
to embrace the internet.

01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:23.000
I think that a lot of other

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.130
"newspapers, including the L.A."

01:11:24.130 --> 01:11:25.400

"Times, were slow."

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.060
Journalists were slow to embrace

01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:27.630
it.

01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:28.500
I'll own up to that.

01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.460
I think business sides of

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.100
newspapers were slow to embrace

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.000
"it, too, because
they thought it"

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.100
wouldn't... they didn't see how

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:33.800
they were going to make money

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:34.400
from it.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.930
So we were slow.

01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:38.360
"But, my God, what a good thing"

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:41.360

interesting.

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:49.230
You have to engage people once

01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:50.930
they're there.

01:11:50.930 --> 01:11:52.000
And you have to make it so that

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.660
they want to keep coming back.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.330

The worst thing that you... the

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.530
situation can be is you lose

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:10.060
them to some other source of

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.500
information on the web.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.730
Then getting them back is going

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:13.600
to be impossible.

years somebody with deep pockets

01:12:20.930 --> 01:12:22.030
is going to decide that there's

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:24.900
a great opportunity to create

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.930
local-based news offerings that

01:12:26.930 --> 01:12:28.360
don't have a newspaper attached

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.960
to it at all.

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.730
You wouldn't have the came cost

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:33.330

But if you were putting out a

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:39.230
quality and perhaps much more

"would be lower,
you could make a"

01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.130
Whether every newspaper will get

there or whether everyone will

"get there in the same way, I"

Los Angeles Times.

01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:26.000
Why isn't the Tribune Company?

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.800
You're already making 20%.

"Well, as a public company, one"

01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:32.830
answer would be the stock price

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:33.660
would go way below where it's

01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:35.300
"currently going, which is way"

below where it used to be.

01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:38.360
So a private owner like Mr.

able to say, I'll"

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:42.830
earn X percent.

"And if he's the owner, he gets"

"If Wall Street's

get to say what their

expectations are for what a

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:53.430
publicly-owned business is

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:56.430
expected to achieve.

01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:58.300
That's just... as brutal as it

01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.330
"may seem, that's
kind of a fact"

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:04.230

"ownership is quite perfect,"

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.460
though I like the St. Pete

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:18.860

01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:45.360
actually a relatively new idea.

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.860
Used to be that we thought

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.230
businesses had their purpose.

01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:49.930
Their purpose was to be making

01:17:49.930 --> 01:17:50.630
newspapers or fountain pens or

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:51.760

whatever.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.060
And now we act as though the

01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:53.800
only purpose of a business is to

01:17:53.800 --> 01:18:01.060
enrich the people who traded on

01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.060
Wall Street.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:04.660
I don't agree with that.

01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:05.460
I think that's a wrongheaded

view.

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.560
Of course you've got to have

"profit, of course
you've got to"

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:10.630
that's not why we're doing it.

01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:11.930
We're doing it because

01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:13.060
publishing a newspaper is a

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:13.860
crucial thing to be doing.

"And I've had to
say ""No"" in this"

newsroom.

01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:26.060
And I can't tell you how... I

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.130
can't tell you what it's like to

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:28.130
go out as an editor and still

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:29.100
have your newsroom support you

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:30.500
when you've had to do hard

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.700
stuff.

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:37.400
It meant a lot to me.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.630
>> NARRATOR: Since leaving the

01:21:42.630 --> 01:21:43.700
"Los Angeles Times, Dean"

01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:46.000

journalism.

01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:57.030
>> I'm very sentimental about

01:21:57.030 --> 01:22:00.060
"newspapers, but I also am very"

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:00.900
clearheaded about the fact that

01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.760
newspapers are doing the

01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.760
reporting in this country.

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.700
Google and Yahoo and those

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.060
people aren't putting reporters

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:08.800
on the street in any numbers at

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.230
all.

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:12.160
Blogs can't afford it.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.200
Network television is taking

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.000
reporters off the street.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.300
reporters off the street.

01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:18.100
Commercial radio journalism is

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:20.730
almost nonexistent.

01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:22.130
And the newspapers are the last

01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:25.130
ones standing.

01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:26.030
ones standing.

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:27.260
And newspapers are threatened.

01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:27.960
And reporting is absolutely an

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:33.360
essential thing for democratic

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.360
self-government.

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.130
Who's going to do it?

01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:38.260
Who's going to pay for the news?

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:43.600
If newspapers fall by the

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:53.960
"wayside, what will we know?"

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.100
">> Extra, extra,

01:22:59.100 --> 01:22:59.860
it!

Los Angeles Times celebrates

01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:05.300
125 years.

"fired Dean Baquet, publisher"

01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:10.400
David Hiller turned up at a

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:11.400
ceremony honoring the L.A. Times

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.060
with a star on Hollywood

Boulevard.

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:16.030
>> Thanks for having us on this

01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.730
great day.

01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:17.400
>> NARRATOR: But the paper's

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:19.460
fate was never more uncertain.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:21.500
Eli Broad made a bid to buy the

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.360
"Times and its parent company,"

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.860
Tribune.

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:24.730
So did the Chandler family that

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:27.730
once owned the Times.

01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:29.160
"But so far, the
Tribune Company"

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.630
has not accepted any of the

01:23:30.630 --> 01:23:32.560
"bids, leaving
the future of one"

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:40.530
