>> NARRATOR: Tonight on
<i>Frontline...</i>

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.230
>> The job of a reporter is to
be the curmudgeon who raises
questions that nobody else wants
to raise.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.130
That's what the best reporters
try to do.
>> NARRATOR: Once upon a time,
they were thought of as heroes.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.960
But today the entire news
industry is in crisis.
>> The public has a terrific
disdain for the press.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.960
>> We have a press that is at
war with an administration while
our country is at war against
merciless enemies.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.400
>> For 30 or more years, there
had been an assumption about the
government and the press, and
suddenly in the last couple of

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.700
years that's changed.
>> NARRATOR: In a four-part
special series,<i> Frontline</i>
reporter Lowell Bergman looks at

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.930
the challenges facing
journalists today...
>> Would you go to jail to
protect your source?

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.800
>> Absolutely.
>> NARRATOR: ...the war between
the White House and the press...
>> The President of the United

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.960
States saying, "If you publish
this story, you will have blood
on your hands."
>> NARRATOR: ...the explosion of

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.930
new and emerging media...
>> Do you ever feel like the
6:00 news just ain't cutting it
for you?

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.960
>> You don't see anybody between
20 and 30 getting their news
from the evening news.
You see them getting it online.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.500
>> NARRATOR: ...and the economic
realities of today's news
business.
>> You have to make more every

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.260
year to keep the shareholders
happy.
>> NARRATOR: How did we get
here?

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.060
>> We're judging journalism by
the same standards that we apply
to entertainment.
That may be one of the greatest

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.730
tragedies in the history of
American journalism.
>> NARRATOR: And what is at
stake?

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.730
>> There is a dire need for
institutions that tell the
truth, that pursue the truth,
and that chase it at all cost.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:03:02.600
>> NARRATOR: Tonight, part one
of<i> News War,</i> a<i> Frontline</i> special
series.
>> Go, go, go, go, go!

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:10.000
>> Over here!
>> NARRATOR: On July 6, 2005,
outside the D.C. Federal
District Court, a media swarm

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.960
gathered.
>> Back up a little.
Let's give him a little room.
Let's back up just a little.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.230
>> NARRATOR: They were hounding
fellow journalists...
>> How important do you feel
about the First Amendment right

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.860
to the press?
>> NARRATOR: ...reporters who
were refusing to testify in the
investigation known as the Plame

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.130
Affair...
>> Do you have any comment at
all?
>> Sorry.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.900
>> NARRATOR: ...a case that had
become the most significant
clash between the press and
federal government in decades.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.960
>> What do we want?
>> Free press!
>> When do we want it?
>> Now!

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.330
>> This case did damage I think
to the First Amendment.
I think it did damage to the
individual careers of a number

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:56.560
of reporters.
I think it did damage to the
credibility of the media.
>> NARRATOR: There was no more

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.630
tangled business between the
Bush administration and the
press than the Plame affair.
The conflict that would raise

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.430
profound questions about
reporters' ability to protect
their confidential sources has
its roots in the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:17.530
administration's march to war.
(<i> gavel banging</i> )
>> Mr. Speaker, the President of
the United States.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.660
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )
>> NARRATOR: In January of 2003,
the Bush administration was
riding high.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:32.500
In Afghanistan, America had
toppled the Taliban, and now the
President was preparing the
country for a new war.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:42.600
>> A brutal dictator with a
history of reckless aggression,
with ties to terrorism, with
great potential wealth, will not

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:51.000
be permitted to dominate a vital
region and threaten the United
States.
(<i> applause</i> )

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.160
>> They were feeling a kind of
confidence.
They had a kind of hubris.
If you had to look at a few

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:06.300
months of this administration as
to maybe the perils of... of
overconfidence, you probably
would look at these few months.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.260
>> Saddam has perfected the game
of cheat and retreat and is very
skilled in the art of denial and
deception.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.130
>> NARRATOR: For several months,
there had been a steady drumbeat
to war.
>> What he wants is time and

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:25.860
more time to husband his
resources, to invest in his
ongoing chemical and biological
weapons program, and to gain

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:35.800
possession of nuclear weapons.
>> There was clearly a set
pattern of speeches, two or
three times a day, to reinforce

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.760
the W.M.D. thing.
>> NARRATOR: Walter Pincus is a
longtime national security
reporter for the "Washington

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.330
Post."
>> First, it was nuclear.
And then it was the idea that
they had chemical and

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.230
biological.
>> As we meet, chemists and
biologists and nuclear
scientists are toiling in

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.200
weapons labs and underground
bunkers, working to give the
world's most dangerous dictators
weapons of unprecedented power

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.560
and lethality.
>> Then it was the idea that
they would give it... give it to
the terrorists.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:14.500
>> The man is a threat, Hutch,
I'm telling you.
He's a threat not only with what
he has, he's a threat with what

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:21.600
he's done.
He's a threat because he is
dealing with al-Qaeda.
>> It's just overwhelming the

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:30.960
advantage the government has
when it wants to sell a point of
view, and that's what they did.
>> NARRATOR: But the Bush

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.460
administration was also helped
by the nation's leading
newspapers.
>> It's important to understand

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.960
that the number of news
organizations that actually have
a national security reporter or
bureaus overseas and can

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:52.660
penetrate the intelligence
community are very limited.
And the<i> New York Times</i> is at the
top of that list.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:07:01.300
So when the<i> New York Times</i> began
to have stories that supported
the administration's claims
about weapons of mass

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.460
destruction in Iraq, it had an
echo effect.
It had an echo effect that the
administration was conscious of

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.660
and employed.
>> What specifically has he
obtained...
>> We now know that you had

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.360
people talking to key reporters
doing these stories for the
<i>Times.</i>
>> There is a story in the<i> New</i>

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:23.900
<i>York Times</i> this morning...
this-- and I want to attribute
this to the<i> Times</i> -- I don't
want to talk about...

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:29.230
>> Those stories would appear
and then they would reference
the very material that they'd
given them and say, "See, this

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:36.430
is coming from the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times,</i> not just us."
>> The kinds of tubes that are
necessary to build a centrifuge.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:42.930
And the centrifuge is required
to take low-grade uranium and...
and enhance it into highly-
enriched uranium.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:50.730
>> It was kind of a loop, and it
was a conscious loop.
>> A lot of people wrote, you
know, stories that were overly

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:58.260
credulous.
>> NARRATOR: Bill Keller took
over as Executive Editor of the
<i>New York Times</i> after the run-up

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:06.160
to the Iraq war.
>> It wasn't some kind of sense
of overdeveloped patriotism or
eagerness on the part of

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:12.700
reporters to ingratiate
themselves with the White House.
What it was, was, you know,
reporters want to get on the

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:18.860
front page.
They want scoops.
>> It's a very hard area to
write about.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:24.360
I was not alone.
Many other papers made the...
did the same kind of reporting
that I did.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:31.200
I think because the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times</i> is the paper that it is
and I had written for so long
about it, I was...

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.730
>> INTERVIEWER: You were the
leader.
You were the expert in this
area.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.760
>> I was the alleged expert.
There were other experts.
>> NARRATOR: Judith Miller was
one of the<i> Times'</i> lead reporters

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:47.160
on the W.M.D. story.
She had covered terrorism for
over a decade.
>> INTERVIEWER: You've said that

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.330
you may have gotten some of the
stories wrong because your
sources were wrong.
>> Right.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:59.430
They gave me information that I
believe they believed.
It was information that was
given to the President.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:06.700
The National Intelligence
Estimate went to the President.
Well, if the President was being
given this information, it was

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:15.830
the official intelligence
assessment of the United States
government and the intelligence
community.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:24.000
I think... I believed that...
that they wouldn't give the
President false information.
President false information.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.530
>> She had the wrong sources.
And you can't... the excuse
can't be, "I'm only as good as
my sources."

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:37.300
my sources."
Now, if you have... if you've
talked to everyone and exhausted
every possible avenue, then you

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:47.030
can say that.
But no reporter ever does that.
So if... if your sources are
wrong, you're wrong, and you

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:52.030
have to accept responsibility.
>> INTERVIEWER: You believed
there was W.M.D. in Iraq?
>> I did.

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:56.400
>> INTERVIEWER: You said as much
publicly?
>> Yes.
>> What happens if we go to war

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:09.200
against Iraq and we find no
weapons of mass destruction?
>> I think the chance of that
happening is about zero.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:19.760
There's just too much there.
When I say the chances are about
zero, that's the way it looked.
It was totally wrong.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.930
I think I dropped the ball here.
I should've pushed much, much
harder.
>> INTERVIEWER: Harder on the

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:31.560
skepticism about the reality of
W.M.D.?
>> Yes.
In other words, said, "Hey,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:39.530
look, the evidence is not as
strong as they were claiming."
>> No terrorist state poses a
greater or more immediate threat

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:46.100
to the security of our people
than the regime of Saddam
Hussein in Iraq.
>> An al-Qaeda-type network

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:52.030
trained and armed by Saddam
could attack America and leave
not one fingerprint.
>> We have firsthand

00:10:52.030 --> 00:11:00.430
descriptions of biological
weapons factories on wheels.
>> We don't want the smoking gun
to be a mushroom cloud.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:10.230
>> NARRATOR: Many in the media
got the W.M.D. story wrong.
<i>Frontline</i> aired its own report
on the possible threats of

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:18.330
Saddam's weapons programs.
>> When a man known as Saddam's
bomb maker went to work...
>> The way that the press was

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:26.530
sold and spun and turned around
and just fooled by the White
House in the run-up to the war
represents more than just a

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:35.500
missed story.
How can one say that we have a
watchdog press after a
performance like that?

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:42.930
>> NARRATOR: In fact, there was
some W.M.D. reporting that did
get the story right.
>> What we were doing was

00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:48.460
following reporting.
And good solid reporting was
telling us one thing, and that's
what we wrote.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:54.000
>> NARRATOR: Clark Hoyt was
Knight Ridder's Washington
editor during the run-up to the
war in Iraq.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:02.560
>> What we were hearing from
very good sources was really
nothing has changed with Iraq.
>> NARRATOR: But as they

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.030
continued their skeptical
reporting, Hoyt says they began
to feel heat from the
government.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:12.660
>> Someone in the Defense
Department called our reporter a
communistic Bolshevik.
communistic Bolshevik.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:17.900
l;;;;jump
Others said, "You know, all you
guys have in this town is your
reputation and your credibility,

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:24.260
and we're going to get you, and
we're going to get that."
I will say at times it seemed
very lonely because you kept

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:31.360
looking around saying, "Where's
everybody else?"
>> NARRATOR: The<i> Washington</i>
<i>Post</i> had reporters who had also

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:38.930
begun hearing doubts about the
evidence of W.M.D. in the final
days before war.
>> I started calling people I

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:47.100
knew in the Pentagon and finally
got somebody who just honestly
said, "We don't know where they
are.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:58.160
We don't know if they are
there."
And then somebody in the agency
did the Potemkin village idea,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:05.830
that Saddam Hussein was making
believe he had the stuff when he
didn't.
That led up to the piece two

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:14.960
days before the war that it
might not be there.
>> NARRATOR: Pincus' story ran
on page 13.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:30.660
The lead headline of the<i> Post</i>
that day was: "President Tells
Hussein to Leave Iraq Within 48
Hours or Face Invasion."

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:40.560
By the beginning of May 2003,
Baghdad had fallen.
>> Major combat operations in
Iraq have ended.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:48.130
In the battle of Iraq, the
United States and our allies
have prevailed.
>> NARRATOR: The President

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:53.630
landed aboard the "U.S.S.
Lincoln."
>> Operation Iraqi Freedom was
carried out with a combination

00:13:53.630 --> 00:14:07.760
of precision and speed and
boldness the enemy did not
expect and the world had not
seen before.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.860
>> The Pentagon announced the
dispatch of a 1,300-member
search team.
Senior officers in Iraq are

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.030
puzzled.
>> Things could have been taken
and buried, they could have been
transported or they could have

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:22.100
been destroyed.
>> Enough already.
Where are the weapons of mass
destruction?

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:28.860
>> NARRATOR: By the summer of
2003, the news media were
raising questions about Saddam's
W.M.D.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.800
>> 17 U.S. troops have been
killed in ambushes in Iraq since
President Bush...
>> NARRATOR: The news about the

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.930
war grew more violent by the
day.
>> Would the American people
have been so supportive going to

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:43.930
war absent the weapons of mass
destruction argument?
>> Do you believe that the
administration oversold the

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:50.200
weapons of mass destruction
problem?
>> NARRATOR: And in the middle
of that summer, a new critic

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:56.960
emerged.
In an op-ed in the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times,</i> a former ambassador
raised doubts about a claim made

00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.530
by the President.
>> The British government has
learned that Saddam Hussein
recently sought significant

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:08.960
quantities of uranium from
Africa.
>> INTERVIEWER: When you heard
the remarks of the President in

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.900
his State of the Union address,
were you listening to it?
>> I was, yes.
>> INTERVIEWER: What was your

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:19.060
reaction when you heard those
remarks live?
>> I assumed that the
countries... the country to

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:25.530
which the President was
referring was not Niger.
>> NARRATOR: Joseph Wilson wrote
that the Vice President's office

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:32.730
had raised questions about this
alleged Niger uranium deal and
that the C.I.A. had asked him to
look into it.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:39.300
He says that he found no
evidence of a deal.
>> A misstatement of fundamental
fact which supported the

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:46.000
justification for the invasion
of a sovereign nation was in the
President's State of the Union
address.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.830
This administration failed to
correct the record.
>> NARRATOR: Wilson decided to
correct the record himself.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:58.200
First, he agreed to talk
confidentially to two reporters.
>> I had not wanted my name used
in this.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:05.700
in this.
It was not to hide my own role
from my own government, but
rather to make sure that all

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:12.400
their attack dogs did not get an
early opportunity to try and
trash me.
trash me.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.160
>> INTERVIEWER: So why did you
decide to go public?
>> Because it became apparent in
June that the administration was

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:22.200
just going to continue to
stonewall.
>> Can you explain how an
erroneous piece of intelligence

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.100
on the Iraq-Niger connection got
into your State of the Union
speech?
And should somebody be held

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:31.760
accountable, sir?
>> I gave a speech to the nation
that was cleared by the
intelligence services.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.630
>> NARRATOR: Five days after
Wilson's op-ed, the C.I.A. took
responsibility for not removing
the faulty claim from Bush's

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:44.960
speech.
>> Sir, how did it get into your
speech if it was erroneous?
>> NARRATOR: Days later,

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:52.100
conservative columnist Robert
Novak came out with his own
column.
Novak contradicted the

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:59.200
impression that Cheney had been
responsible for Wilson's trip to
Niger, writing that two Bush
administration officials said

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:06.860
Wilson had been sent at the
suggestion of his wife, C.I.A.
operative Valerie Plame.
>> For an administration that

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:10.460
came to office...
>> NARRATOR: Wilson was all over
the news...
>> Senior officials in the White

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:15.060
House...
>> NARRATOR: ...charging the
White House with outing his
wife, an undercover C.I.A.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.330
officer...
>> It is gratuitous.
It is a gratuitous smear.
>> NARRATOR: ...to punish him

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:24.160
for his dissent.
>> INTERVIEWER: So this was
hardball politics, basically.
>> It's something they're well

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.860
known for, absolutely.
known for, absolutely.
>> Wilson suspects the leak was
deliberate, a reprisal for his

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.130
challenge...
>> NARRATOR: The story played as
a potentially devastating
scandal for the White House.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:39.330
>> The Bush White House is
facing a potential criminal
investigation.
>> NARRATOR: Revealing Plame's

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:45.130
identity to the press may have
been a violation of the law.
>> The prosecutors and agents
who are and will be handling

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:50.100
this investigation are career
professionals...
>> NARRATOR: The Justice
Department was called on to open

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:56.000
a leak investigation.
>> ...in matters involving
sensitive national security
information.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.360
>> INTERVIEWER: Your office got
the referral in the Valerie
Plame case?
>> Yes.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:07.800
>> Yes.
The F.B.I. runs leak
investigations when those leaks
involve classified information.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.800
>> INTERVIEWER: How do you
conduct these investigations?
I mean, we read about them in
the paper, but we have no idea

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.800
actually what goes on.
>> Well, first of all, you have
a victim agency, the owner of
the information, those who

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.930
classified it.
What they have to do is file a
report which consists of 11
questions.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:27.830
questions.
And those questions go from:
"Was the material properly
classified?"

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:32.200
"Was the information that was
leaked accurate compared to what
the actual classified
information is?"

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.430
information is?"
>> INTERVIEWER: The information
has to be accurate?
>> Yes.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:43.800
>> INTERVIEWER: So when the
government announces a leak
investigation and it comes to
your office, it's confirming

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.430
that the... that the report in
the newspaper, for example, or
on television was true?
>> In... yes.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:54.760
Indirectly, yes.
>> INTERVIEWER: That's one way
to fact check.
>> Behind the showdown is an

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.630
investigation into whether
someone in the White House
illegally leaked the name of...
>> ...claims the leak came as

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:08.200
payback.
Libby and Karl Rove have been
identified by other reporters as
discussing the case.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:15.900
>> NARRATOR: The question was
who had leaked to Novak, and
suspicions reached the highest
levels of the White House.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:24.430
Was it Karl Rove?
The Vice-President's chief of
staff, Lewis "Scooter" Libby?
Cheney himself?

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:32.230
>> Listen, I don't know of
anybody in my administration who
leaked classified information.
If somebody did leak classified

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:39.160
information, I'd like to know
it, and we'll take the
appropriate action.
>> NARRATOR: Quickly dubbed

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:47.660
"Plamegate," the Plame Affair
became a media spectacle.
>> The Bush White House is so
secretive and hidden that people

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:54.760
thought, "Oh, this is going to
be the issue that will pry it
open."
People have written that there

00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:01.960
were the echoes of Watergate.
>> Mr. President, on another
issue, the C.I.A. Leakgate, what
do you say to critics of the

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:07.030
administration who say that this
administration retaliates
against naysayers?
>> Yeah.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:13.300
Well, first of all, I'm glad you
brought that question up.
>> The real issue in the summer
of 2003 was we'd been in Iraq

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:20.000
for three or four months and
hadn't found any weapons of mass
destruction.
That was the real story.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.760
>> Two things, I think, the
administration hyped.
One was the connection to al-
Qaeda, and, two, their absolute

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:30.600
certainty that they had some
sense that they knew where these
weapons were.
>> That was just pulsing in the

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.960
background of all of this.
>> Now I see the Justice
Department is now starting to
investigate.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:41.260
Now, isn't that a sweetheart
deal?
deal?
Attorney General John Ashcroft,

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:47.830
appointed by this President,
investigating the President.
>> NARRATOR: In Congress,
Democrats demanded a Special

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:54.030
Prosecutor take over the case.
Prosecutor take over the case.
>> ...do this investigation as
independent from the political

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:59.960
appointees in the Justice
Department as possible.
>> NARRATOR: And some in the
media agreed.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:06.230
>> INTERVIEWER: The<i> New York</i>
<i>Times</i> editorialized for a
special counsel.
>> Yes.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:11.300
>> INTERVIEWER: And eventually
Attorney General Ashcroft
stepped aside.
>> Yes.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:15.200
>> INTERVIEWER: It's kind of
ironic?
>> Be careful what you wish for.
>> Be careful what you wish for.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:23.160
Be careful what you editorialize
for.
>> NARRATOR: This is who they
got.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:34.030
Known as a tough, nonpartisan
career prosecutor, Patrick
Fitzgerald was appointed to take
over the investigation.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.830
As he looked for the leaker,
Fitzgerald decided the only way
he could determine if a crime
had been committed was to get

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:43.630
the testimony of the journalists
involved.
It had turned out that Novak
wasn't the only one who had been

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:50.730
given the information about
Plame.
>> It is clear that at least
four of us were talked to in the

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:56.300
same way.
same way.
After Joe Wilson's column in the
<i>Times</i> and his interview in the

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:06.700
<i>Post,</i> which got buried in the
back of the paper, at least four
of us were given roughly the
same story: the wife arranged

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:13.330
for the trip-- to undermine the
trip, and that doesn't happen ad
hoc.
hoc.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:18.800
So I think there was a plan to
do that.
>> INTERVIEWER: A conspiracy to
manipulate the press?

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.730
>> Or, as I put it, it's damage
control.
They're not the first
administration to do it.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:35.460
I don't think they violated the
law, but they gave an opening to
people to make that allegation.
>> NARRATOR: Among those

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:42.530
contacted by Fitzgerald was
<i>Time</i> magazine's Matthew Cooper.
Cooper had reported on the
magazine's web site that

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:48.930
government officials had told
him that Valerie Plame was a
C.I.A. official.
His primary source, Cooper's

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:57.130
bosses knew, was Karl Rove.
>> The conversations that Matt
Cooper was having about Valerie
Plame's identity did not strike

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:03.730
me as out of the ordinary.
me as out of the ordinary.
I was frankly trying to figure
out why a special counsel was

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:09.630
needed, what the law was that
was broken, why a grand jury was
called and why we were being
subpoenaed.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:14.700
>> INTERVIEWER: Because you just
thought this is the way things
go and this is how you report in
Washington?

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:20.330
>> Well, first of... well, not
only in Washington.
Leaks and use of anonymous
sources is very much in the

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:26.860
fabric of American journalism
today.
The places where it's most
obvious are in Washington and

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:35.560
Hollywood, on Wall Street and in
sports.
>> It's important in
understanding the Plame case to

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:44.560
understand how anonymous
sourcing has changed over the
last generation.
During Watergate, and before

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:52.560
that, confidentiality was a tool
that journalists would offer to
reluctant sources to coax them
to come forward.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:24:00.060
That has shifted to the point
where confidentiality and
anonymity are conditions that
the source often imposes on the

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:09.900
journalist.
To the public, the whistle
blower who is Deep Throat
reluctantly guiding an

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:22.300
investigative reporter is very
different than a high-ranking
administration official lunching
in an elegant Washington hotel,

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:29.900
spinning a reporter with the
protection of confidentiality.
That's the powerful trying to
get their message out to other

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.160
elites through elite media, and
elites through elite media, and
that's what occurred in the
Plame case.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:42.060
Plame case.
That's the powerful trying to
>> NARRATOR: Among the powerful
now in the sights of the

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:47.230
investigation was Scooter Libby.
Fitzgerald subpoenaed the<i> New</i>
<i>York Times'</i> Judith Miller,
having learned that Libby had

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:56.700
spoken to her, and Miller had
refused to cooperate.
>> We can't begin to say, "I'm
only going to issue pledges of

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:04.760
confidentiality when politically
I agree with the source or I
think the source isn't... isn't
politically motivated."

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:11.200
I mean, almost all leaks of
information are politically
motivated.
>> The law can't and shouldn't

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:20.700
distinguish, and I would say
journalists can't and shouldn't
distinguish between what, good
sources and bad?

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:26.630
>> NARRATOR: Long-time First
Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams
was retained by the<i> New York</i>
<i>Times</i> to represent Miller.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:33.030
>> If we're going to have a
political litmus test, then
we're not talking about
principle at all.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:39.530
Then we're just talking about,
you know, is this a good way to
get the Bush administration, or
is this a good way to... to help

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:48.700
the Bush administration?
Nothing to do with... with
matters of principle.
>> NARRATOR: The principle was

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:54.300
protecting your source no matter
what.
Cooper and Miller said they were
prepared to go to jail rather

00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:02.700
than testify.
>> Once you break the... a
confidential source
relationship, there's every

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:07.100
reason for every source in the
future to not believe it when
you say, "We will keep you in
confidential source."

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:15.430
One, it's a slippery slope.
Once you... once you break that
confidentiality once, it... it
harms our reporting from now on.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:21.500
>> NARRATOR: But Fitzgerald was
changing the playing field with
a novel technique to get
reporters to talk.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:29.430
Waivers had been distributed to
potential sources in the White
House, releasing reporters from
their pledge of confidentiality.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:35.430
And then the waivers were
presented to the reporters and
their publications.
>> INTERVIEWER: Did you feel

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:41.160
that the kinds of releases that
the special prosecutor got from
the White House were sufficient?
>> Our lawyers talked...

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.760
No, that would not have been
sufficient.
Our lawyers talked to lawyers
for the individuals involved to

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:54.260
satisfy us that the... that the
release was voluntary, personal,
directly from that individual,
specifically about what it was

00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:01.300
that we were asked to testify
about.
>> We were told the source had
come forward, had identified

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:12.030
himself as the one who talked to
me about it, and had released me
to talk to the prosecutor about
it if, at the same time, I never

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:17.800
mentioned his name publicly.
And I never have.
>> INTERVIEWER: But you did
testify?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:21.300
>> I gave a deposition, yeah.
>> INTERVIEWER: Well, which is
testimony.
So...

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.560
>> Yeah.
Didn't go...
>> INTERVIEWER: Sworn testimony.
>> ...to the grand jury.

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:27.200
It wasn't as dramatic as all
that.
And I was never asked to
identify my source, and I never

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.230
did because the prosecutor knew
who the source was.
One of the agreements with the
prosecutor was I wouldn't be

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:36.960
asked.
>> INTERVIEWER: That was to save
you from losing your virginity
or something?

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.600
>> Yeah.
It's something I felt very
strongly about.
>> Some of our people have given

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:48.060
very limited depositions in
which they have not revealed any
confidential sources nor in any
other way violated our ethics.

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:55.430
Very, very narrow testimony.
>> INTERVIEWER: But put yourself
in the position of someone who
sees a newspaper providing their

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.930
reporters to give testimony,
however smart the negotiation
is.
>> It's not that just the

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:05.160
negotiations are smart.
You're really... you're really
evading the principle here.
The principle here is that we

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:12.630
have not revealed confidential
sources.
>> Hell, no, we won't go!
Hell, no, we won't go!

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:18.060
>> NARRATOR: The battle over
confidential sources is an old
one.
It came to a head during another

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:24.400
era when the government and the
press were at war.
>> In the pro and con over the
riots one thing was certain.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.230
Major social reforms were
needed.
>> NARRATOR: In California, a
young reporter would find

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:36.600
himself in the middle of this
war.
>> I went to California in the
fall of 1968.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:42.660
And really, my primary job,
my... almost my entire job for
that period as a national
correspondent with the<i> New York</i>

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:50.130
<i>Times</i> was to cover the Black
Panther parties.
There was genuine concern in
America that black Americans

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:59.060
were headed towards some kind of
violent confrontation with
government.
And then came this group of very

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:05.500
young people in their
militaristic uniforms, black
berets, black leather jackets.
But most of all, they were

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:12.600
embracing the gun.
My job was to... my editor
wanted me to get on the inside,
tell us where they going, what

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.430
does this mean?
>> There's little hope of
avoiding open armed war in the
streets of California and

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:24.430
preventing it from sweeping
across this nation.
>> The Black Panthers posed a
real threat.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:30.060
In their time, they were as
serious as terrorist groups
would be today.
would be today.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.030
>> INTERVIEWER: And that was the
law enforcement view.
>> That was the fact.
There were different members of

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:40.730
the Black Panthers that were
tried for various crimes,
convicted of various crimes.
They were one of the many

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:50.060
subjects of concern at the time.
>> NARRATOR: Concerned about the
Black Panthers' activities, the
F.B.I. turned to Earl Caldwell.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:58.660
>> The F.B.I. called me and
asked if I would have regular
meetings informally with agents.
They said, "We know that you're

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:04.060
over there all the time and
you're seeing what's happening,
and you're all around with them.
And we'd like you just to tell

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:08.300
us what's going on, sort of be
our eyes and ears on the
inside."
inside."

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:15.360
And I told them, of course, I
couldn't do that.
I can't... can't even have this
conversation with you.

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:22.000
>> NARRATOR: Eventually, the
F.B.I. told Caldwell that he
might have information about a
possible crime.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.100
>> The F.B.I. said that the
Panthers had made a threat to
the President.
I did have the quotes about that

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:36.200
in my story.
The Panthers were saying, "And
we recognize the government is
being oppressive, and we have

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:42.430
our duty, obligation to bear
arms against the government."
>> NARRATOR: But Caldwell
refused to cooperate with the

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:48.660
F.B.I.
>> They persisted in it.
And then one day, they said,
"Tell Earl Caldwell we're not

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:55.200
playing with him.
He doesn't want to talk to us,
he can tell it in court."
This was, like, on a Friday.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:03.430
On a Monday, they... they had...
(<i> chuckles</i> )
...they had issue... came back
with a subpoena.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:09.900
>> NARRATOR: Caldwell fought the
subpoena up to the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals.
>> My lawyer argued that "You're

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:18.160
going to destroy this reporter."
He talked about how reporters
could bring back and answer and
tell America about these

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:25.030
questions that were so large at
that time.
He argued that the First
Amendment, this is precisely

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:31.060
what it protects-- not just
information, but the process.
We won a unanimous...
(<i> chuckles</i> )

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:40.130
...we won a unanimous decision
from the United States Court of
Appeals.
>> NARRATOR: The government

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:46.360
appealed the decision to the
Supreme Court where Caldwell's
case was joined by two others,
and the case became famous,

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:52.360
commonly referred to as
Branzburg.
>> We talk about the Branzburg
case.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:58.630
To me, it's not the Branzburg
case; it's my case, it's the
Caldwell case, but anyway...
>> NARRATOR: At the time, James

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:05.600
Goodale was General Counsel for
the<i> New York Times.</i>
>> This case became a case of
the press standing up to the

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:12.530
government.
We're the press, we're over
here.
This information is ours.

00:32:12.530 --> 00:32:16.630
You're over there, the
government, and the twain shall
never meet.
>> INTERVIEWER: The press is not

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:20.400
an arm of law enforcement.
>> Sure.
The... the press can't be the
arm of law enforcement because

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:26.600
if it is, there's no ability for
the public, for which the press
is a surrogate, to criticize the
government and look into what

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:32.430
the government's done wrong.
>> I don't begrudge them from
standing on their principle, but
I think that there's on the

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:38.300
other side another principle
that is equally important, which
is, if there's criminal conduct
out there that you or I or

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:44.630
anybody else knows about, you
darn well ought to get that
information to the people who
are in charge of law

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:50.300
enforcement.
>> NARRATOR: William Bradford
Reynolds was a government lawyer
who argued against the reporters

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:55.700
before the Supreme Court in
Branzburg.
>> The reporter's mantra is
"It's the public's right to

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:02.730
know."
I think that the public has a
right to know.
I... I also believe that if the

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:08.760
reporter has... knows the
identity of somebody who's
committed a crime, the public
has a right to know that just as

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:15.360
much.
>> The court also ruled today
that newsmen are not immune from
being summoned before a grand

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:20.630
jury and being forced to answer
questions.
>> NARRATOR: In a 5-4 decision,
the Supreme Court ruled against

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:26.530
the reporters.
>> Branzburg answered the
question, is there a
constitutional protection here

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:32.760
for reporters?
And it said no, there is not.
There is no testimonial
privilege that is available to

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:39.330
the reporters that protects them
from testifying anymore than
there is one that would protect
me as a private citizen from

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:45.800
testifying.
>> I just wasn't going to buy
that... buy that argument, so...
>> INTERVIEWER: What do you

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.400
mean, you weren't going to buy
the argument?
>> Well, it's...
>> INTERVIEWER: It's called the

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.200
Supreme Court for a reason.
>> I know, but there's always a
way, you know.
I could not, as a practical

00:33:52.200 --> 00:34:00.900
matter, go back to my pals in
the newsroom and say, "I can't
protect you because the Supreme
Court has taken all your

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:08.200
protection."
You can't do that.
So I sent my family away, locked
myself into a room in my

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:16.200
apartment.
The air conditioning was turned
off, and I sweated out five
pounds and a theory how the

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:27.230
Branzburg case actually created
a reporter's privilege for
reporters, even though it seemed
to have done the exact opposite.

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:32.100
>> NARRATOR: The key to
Goodale's argument was Justice
Lewis Powell.
>> Powell says effectively,

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:39.900
"Okay, I'm with you against the
press on this case, but in other
cases, there should be an
ability for the press to deal

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:47.530
with the subpoenas."
He didn't spell out exactly what
he meant.
So I said, "Well, look, if this

00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:53.160
other case is... he's one and
I've got four over here.
Last time I knew, that made
five, and that's more than the

00:34:53.160 --> 00:35:02.630
four that voted against me.
So if I get another case that is
perhaps a little different than
Caldwell's case, I will argue

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:08.360
that those five votes create a
reporter's privilege."
>> The<i> Times</i> intends to continue
fighting for its reporters'

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:14.160
right to keep their sources
confidential, fighting both in
the courts and through state or
federal legislation.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:21.360
>> Our theory was go back and
fight this thing out state by
state by state by state until we
end up with enough body of law

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:29.230
so that there's protection for
reporters.
>> NARRATOR: As Goodale set to
work, it was a heady time for

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:36.560
reporters.
The Watergate reporting had
helped take down a president,
and the value of anonymous

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:45.630
sources was never more clear.
>> It would have been totally
impossible to have done the
Watergate reporting and

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.100
identified our sources.
identified our sources.
>> INTERVIEWER: Weren't you
subpoenaed during Watergate?

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.200
>> Yes.
>> INTERVIEWER: For your
sources?
>> Yes.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:59.400
There was a suit brought for the
purpose of getting to us, among
other things.
And so we were subpoenaed.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:07.560
And the strategy had been gone
over with the lawyers.
Our notes, my notes were
transferred to the custody of

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:13.930
Katharine Graham, the publisher
of the<i> Washington Post.</i>
>> We called that the
"grandmother defense" because if

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:21.560
we suddenly gave all our
documents to a woman who was in
her 60s, then, you know, instead
of Bernstein and Woodward,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:28.230
Katharine Graham is a whole lot
better possessor on all... a lot
more important witness.
more important witness.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.430
>> As Bradlee said, "Wouldn't
that be something?
Every photographer in town would
be down at the courthouse to

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:36.960
look at our girl going off to
the slam."
And Mrs. Graham was ready to go
to jail because she understood

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:47.060
the principle.
>> The principle is this: the
government has all kinds of ways
to get information-- it can

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:54.660
eavesdrop, it can wiretap,
legally, it can offer immunity
to criminals in order to get
them to testify.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:04.830
them to testify.
What is the essential route to
get information by the press?
And that is to offer a

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:13.530
confidentiality.
So when people say, "Well,
nobody should be above the law,"
spouses are above the law.

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:21.500
They don't have to give the
testimony against their spouse.
Lawyers don't have to.
Why?

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:32.330
Because there is a social,
judicial benefit to having
confidence imbued in certain
relationships.

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:36.030
>> Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the
<i>Washington Post.</i>
>> Yes, yes.
What is it?

00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:42.660
>> NARRATOR: By the mid-1970s,
journalists played as heroes in
the popular imagination.
>> You tell me what you know,

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:50.960
and I'll confirm.
>> What you had was a sea change
in historical and social terms,
in terms of the news media.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:57.030
People often think that judges
are born in robes, and they
issue their decisions as if from
like Moses, coming down from the

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:01.800
Ten Commandments.
But they don't.
But they don't.
Judges operate in a historical

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:09.930
and a social context.
And judges all across the
country were very much affected
by Watergate.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:16.860
>> NARRATOR: And James Goodale
was finding new success in his
legal battle.
>> We came up with this idea

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:22.360
that we, the reporters, should
have a privilege, namely the
have a privilege, namely the
reporters' privilege, not to

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:31.060
cough up this information every
time the government wants it.
>> NARRATOR: Across the country,
reporters went to jail to

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:42.460
protect their sources.
And over the next decade, many
states passed legislation and
lower courts ruled to protect

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:47.160
journalists.
Today, 49 states recognize some
degree of a reporter's
privilege.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:57.260
>> Some very creative media
lawyers led by Jim Goodale were
able to convince many judges,
and we had a certain level of

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:05.700
success over the years in
getting subpoenas knocked out in
civil cases and in... in
criminal trials.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.530
>> NARRATOR: Though there's
never been a federal law
establishing a reporter's
privilege, the Justice

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:16.060
Department uses a set of
guidelines in its decision to
subpoena journalists.
>> The guidelines are very

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:22.930
clear.
A media subpoena should only be
sought when all other avenues of
investigation have been

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:30.300
foreclosed, and only in exigent
circumstances.
And exigent circumstances were
explained to me to be grave

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.330
national security matters.
>> INTERVIEWER: Emergencies.
>> Yeah, emergencies.
>> INTERVIEWER: Life and death.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:41.500
>> Life and death.
>> NARRATOR: Mark Corallo was
working in Attorney General John
Ashcroft's Justice Department

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:48.300
when the Plame investigation
began.
Though Ashcroft was never asked
to subpoena any reporters in the

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:54.930
case, Corallo says it's unlikely
that he would have.
He says he never saw Ashcroft
approve a subpoena of a reporter

00:39:54.930 --> 00:40:03.530
for confidential sources in the
time he worked there.
>> We were committed to not
issuing one of these subpoenas.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:10.830
>> INTERVIEWER: To the liberals
out there watching, Attorney
General Ashcroft always said no?
>> Attorney General Ashcroft

00:40:10.830 --> 00:40:17.600
always said no.
>> INTERVIEWER: "Do not subpoena
the journalists."
>> Correct.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:23.500
>> NARRATOR: But in the Plame
case, Patrick Fitzgerald was
determined to get reporters to
cooperate.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:31.130
He had worked out deals to get
four reporters to testify.
Matthew Cooper and Judith Miller
had refused, and the reporters

00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:40.160
had another problem.
Just as the Plame affair had
begun, in an unrelated case, a
federal judge in Chicago had

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:47.730
dropped a bombshell.
>> Judge Richard Posner, who's a
very influential judge, said, "I
just wanted to be clear that

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:57.130
I've reread the Branzburg case,
and all you judges out there
who've been saying for the last
30 years that Branzburg provides

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:03.560
some sort of privilege are
wrong.
There is no privilege in
Branzburg, period."

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:08.130
>> He caused a lot of trouble
because he said, "Look, there's
another way to look at it other
than what all these lawyers have

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:13.160
done.
A reporter's got to testify."
>> INTERVIEWER: Well, the other
way to look at it, is the court

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.500
ruled 5-4, there is no
privilege...
>> There's no privilege.
>> INTERVIEWER: ...and Powell

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.460
was just saying it'd be nice if
Congress passed a law or
somebody did something to
protect...

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.430
>> Yeah.
Well, Powell was just blowing
smoke.
>> INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:27.030
And you had taken the smoke and
made it appear to be real.
>> Yeah.
Right.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.000
>> INTERVIEWER: That's what he's
saying.
He called your bluff.
>> Yeah.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.100
Well, I don't think it's a
bluff, with all due respect.
>> NARRATOR: Bluff or no bluff,
Cooper and Miller were forcing

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:44.930
the question: would the courts
back their decision not to
testify?
>> My standard for cooperation

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:48.760
was very high.
It was different from other
people's.
Everybody has to make that call

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:55.760
themselves.
But I knew what I could live
with and what I couldn't live
with.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:01.460
>> Judy Miller's attitude about
this was that it was important
for at least someone to stand up
and fight even if she wound up

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:08.500
losing.
>> NARRATOR: The reporters did
lose.
The Supreme Court refused to

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:18.760
hear the case, and the final
word was left with a lower
court.
>> INTERVIEWER: The Appellate

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.660
Court in that case spoke
directly, spoke very, very
clearly, and said Branzburg
stands.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.960
>> That's what they said.
There's no ambiguity at all.
That there is no protection, the
Court of Appeals in Washington

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.030
said, for journalists in... in
situations in which a grand jury
seeks information in good faith
from a journalist, period.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:42.000
from a journalist, period.
>> INTERVIEWER: Is it possible
that given the bad facts in this
case and given the decision to,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:48.830
in a sense, fight this on
principle that in the end what
you did was make bad law?
>> It's possible.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:55.000
It's possible.
>> INTERVIEWER: You got the
Appellate Court to reaffirm
Branzburg, which Goodale and...

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:04.660
your friend Goodale and allies
have been trying to avoid a
decision like that for decades.
>> Yeah.

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:13.860
It just seems to me that there
are some fights which have to be
fought.
And sometimes they have to be

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:22.760
fought even if chances of
winning are... are slight.
>> NARRATOR: On July 6, 2005,
Matthew Cooper headed into the

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:29.930
D.C. District Court where he
would agree to testify.
>> What do we want?
>> Free press!

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:34.030
>> When do we want it?
>> Now!
>> NARRATOR: Pearlstine and
<i>Time</i> magazine had given

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:39.730
Fitzgerald Cooper's notes.
>> INTERVIEWER: Your reporter,
Matt Cooper, he wasn't happy
with your giving up his notes.

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:48.500
with your giving up his notes.
>> He disagreed with me.
He wished that I hadn't done so.
He wished that I hadn't done so.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:55.860
He viewed his conversation with
Rove as a confidential exchange
that ought to be protected.
He disagreed with me about it,

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:09.030
and I think he would have been
prepared to go to jail himself.
>> It is a sad time when two
journalists were simply doing

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:16.330
their jobs and trying to keep
confidences and report important
stories face the prospect of
going to prison for keeping

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:22.030
those confidences.
>> It's the most difficult
decision I've had to make in
more than three decades in

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:27.830
journalism.
And I say that with the
understanding that lots of
people whom I respect and admire

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:35.500
would disagree with me.
>> Disgraceful.
Absolutely disgraceful.
I've talked about this with...

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:41.500
with Norman.
We have a civilized
disagreement.
Norman Pearlstine is in a very

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:50.700
difficult political position in
real life because he has to go
to his board of directors, who
are not First Amendment-niks and

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:57.130
maybe not even media people who
know a lot about media, and tell
them that he's going to go in
civil contempt.

00:44:57.130 --> 00:45:04.100
I think, as a practical matter,
that is very difficult for him.
>> As usual with Jim, a little
learning is a dangerous thing.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:11.230
I never went to the board.
I made the decision on my own in
my capacity as editor-in-chief
of Time, Inc.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:20.700
In this particular case,
involving a grand jury,
involving a question of national
security, involving White House

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:28.630
officials who are not
traditional whistleblowers but
if anything were trying to
undermine a whistleblower, and a

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:38.200
situation where the name of the
source was in our e-mail and
available to several dozen
people within Time, Inc., it

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:47.860
seemed to me that as an
institution we had no choice but
to turn over our notes in this
case.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:53.300
>> NARRATOR: Because the<i> New</i>
<i>York Times</i> had not been in
possession of Miller's notes,
the government did not pursue a

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:58.600
subpoena against the<i> Times.</i>
>> Are you confident justice
will prevail on this one?
>> NARRATOR: The decision to

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:03.300
cooperate or not was up to
Miller, and the paper stood by
her.
>> Good luck, good luck.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:09.600
>> Thank you.
>> Yeah, go get 'em.
>> The underlying principle that
we try to protect our sources

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:17.460
including against subpoenas
before grand juries is a good
principle, but it's a very, very
hard one to explain to... to the

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:22.730
general public given both the
problematic nature of the
reporter and the problematic
nature of the leak.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:28.600
nature of the leak.
I think everybody wished that it
was a cleaner case.
>> INTERVIEWER: But do you ever

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.800
really get to choose?
>> No.
Which is why we ended up, you
know, fighting this one as best

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:40.630
we could.
>> NARRATOR: When Miller refused
to testify, she was shackled and
taken out the rear of the

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:50.860
courtroom into a waiting police
van, where she was driven to the
Alexandria Detention Center in
Virginia.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:57.960
>> Here's a reporter who's not
well-liked, generally, by the
press establishment, who
suddenly takes a position that

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.260
is heroic to the press
establishment.
>> Arianna Huffington, you wrote
that Miller doesn't want to

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:10.300
reveal her source at the White
House because she is the source.
>> It was so complicated that
there were even wags inside the

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:16.760
<i>New York Times</i> who speculated
that Judith Miller never had any
sources.
>> "Miller's no fool.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:22.200
She understood the lesson of the
Martha Stewart case: when you
find yourself covered with mud,
there's nothing like a brief

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.230
stint in a minimum security
prison to restore your old
luster."
What a nasty...

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.300
>> Definitely seems to be true.
>> But what a nasty thing to
write.
>> INTERVIEWER: There's

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:38.560
definitely a group of people who
felt that you were becoming a
martyr, that you were doing this
to make up for the problems with

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:43.460
the W.M.D. coverage.
>> I didn't feel that I had
anything to apologize for with
my W.M.D. coverage.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:50.760
my W.M.D. coverage.
I knew why I was in jail, and I
knew that I was in jail for a
cause that I thought was

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:55.760
essential to our profession.
So I was very comfortable with
the decision.
the decision.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.460
But was it painful?
Yes.
Was it disappointing?
Yes.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:13.300
Was it infuriating sometimes?
Yes.
>> NARRATOR: On September 29,
2005, after 85 days in jail,

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:21.100
Judith Miller finally made a
deal to provide limited
testimony and was freed.
>> I heard directly from my

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:26.930
source that I should testify
before the grand jury.
>> NARRATOR: Soon after, she and
the<i> New York Times</i> would part

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:34.730
ways.
>> When we finally ended up
relenting and Judy ended up
testifying, I felt like we may

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:41.400
have been a little too quick to
charge out on the... on the limb
and... and vociferously defend
the principle.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:48.430
I mean, there's, you know, part
of me that wonders whether we
might have gotten a deal at the
beginning comparable to the one

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:53.560
that we got at the end.
>> INTERVIEWER: Sounds like
something you regret, the whole
situation.

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:57.830
>> Well, there's certainly
aspects of it I regret.
I'm... you know, the principle
is the principle.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:07.430
And... and I'm... I'm... I would
rather work at a place, you
know, that stands up for that
principle than one that doesn't.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:14.500
>> On July 2003, the fact that
Valerie Wilson was a C.I.A.
officer was classified.
Not only was it classified but

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:21.400
it was not widely known outside
the intelligence community.
>> NARRATOR: On October 28,
2005, almost two years after

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:28.160
taking over the case, Special
Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald
faced the media.
>> Valerie Wilson's cover was

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:35.030
blown in July 2003.
>> NARRATOR: In the end, no one
was charged with outing Valerie
Plame.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:40.030
>> Mr. Novak was not the first
reporter.
>> NARRATOR: Instead, the Vice
President's chief of staff,

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:45.700
Scooter Libby, was indicted on
charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice.
>> In fact, Mr. Libby was the

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:53.400
first official known to have
told a reporter when he talked
to Judith Miller in June of 2003
about Valerie Wilson.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:58.560
>> NARRATOR: But it would turn
out there was still more to the
story.
The Plame investigation had one

00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:08.530
last twist.
>> When Fitzgerald said that
Judy Miller was the first to
learn about this from Scooter

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:17.460
Libby, the Vice President's
chief of staff, I realized I was
the first to learn about it.
>> NARRATOR: Woodward's leaker

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:22.500
was also the primary source for
Novak's column, the
administration official who blew
Plame's cover in the first

00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:28.930
place.
>> Novak wrote he learned of it
from somebody who is not a
partisan gunslinger.

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:36.330
It was an offhand remark.
That's exactly the way I learned
it.
>> NARRATOR: The leak had not

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:42.830
come from Bush's inner circle,
but from a dissenter who had
questioned the administration's
march to war: then Deputy

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:52.260
Secretary of State Richard
Armitage.
>> It was a classic case of
doing a long interview and

00:50:52.260 --> 00:51:02.130
Armitage gossiping at the end.
There was a lot of energy and
airtime and ink spent over
something that really didn't

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:13.000
amount to a violation of the
law.
There is no echo of Watergate.
>> Jury selection got underway

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.160
today in the criminal trial of
Scooter Libby...
>> Jurors were shown the Cheney
talking points...

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:24.260
>> NARRATOR: With the Libby
trial back in the news, details
are emerging about the extent to
which the Vice President's

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:29.930
office directed the effort to
discredit Joseph Wilson.
>> The Vice President and
Scooter Libby were discussing

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:34.830
the Wilsons almost every day for
two weeks...
>> INTERVIEWER: What are we to
make of Joe Wilson and his

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:40.700
complaint that the government of
the United States retaliated
against him?
Do you believe that the White

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:45.960
House was out to get him?
House was out to get him?
>> Yeah, and guess what?
Joe Wilson, move over.

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:50.230
The White House is out to get a
lot of people.
And every White House is.
And every White House is.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.360
It's part of the tug of war of
policy that you try to advance
your interests and undermine
your opponents'.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:01.160
If you're going to start
criminalizing those kind of
leaks, which is what the
nation's capital is based on,

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:09.230
you're going to be throwing an
awful lot of reporters in jail
and maybe some... an awful lot
of government officials.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:13.600
>> The British government has
learned that Saddam Hussein
recently sought...
>> NARRATOR: What started as a

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.800
campaign to spin the press on
the road to war...
>> We know for a fact that there
are weapons there.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:23.630
>> NARRATOR: ...became a muddled
story about official leaks,
political hardball and questions
about a cover-up at the highest

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:34.060
level of the White House.
But in the end, the lasting
effect of what was called
"Plamegate" may be what it means

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:40.460
for the institution of the
press.
>> I think the Bush
administration saw that a top

00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:47.630
reporter for the number-one
newspaper in this country could
go to jail for weeks and nothing
would happen, in essence.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:55.100
And I think that emboldened them
to go after the press in other
cases, as they have, threaten
other reporters with jail, as

00:52:55.100 --> 00:53:01.330
they have, because they saw this
as a green light.
They saw this, that they could
get away with it.

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:08.030
And now it's, "Katie, bar the
door."
>> NARRATOR: Next week on
<i>Frontline,</i> the battles

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:11.700
continues...
>> INTERVIEWER: So you're ready
to go to prison?
>> Well, "ready" is perhaps not

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:17.300
the appropriate word.
>> For 30 or more years, there
had been a certain assumption
about the government and the

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.330
press.
And suddenly, in the last couple
of years, that's changed.
>> INTERVIEWER: How did you

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:26.230
first find out that the F.B.I.
was interested in what you may
have shot?
>> NARRATOR: ...government

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:32.800
secrets exposed...
>> It used to be that you could
depend upon the moral character
of news media and the commitment

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:39.100
and loyalty to the United
States.
>> There can be no excuse for
anyone entrusted with vital

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:46.130
intelligence to leak it, and no
excuse for any newspaper to
print it.
>> NARRATOR: ...and the White

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:50.330
House fights back.
>> It's the President of the
United States saying, "If you
publish this story, you will

00:53:50.330 --> 00:54:09.600
have blood on your hands."
>> NARRATOR: Next time on
