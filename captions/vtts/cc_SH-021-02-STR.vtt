00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830


2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.470
Sirs, take your places andbe vigilant:

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.230
If any noise or soldieryou perceive

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.100
Near to the walls, by someapparent sign

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.070
Let us have knowledge atthe court of guard.

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.130
Sergeant, you shall.

7
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.400
Thus are poor servitors,

8
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.170
When others sleep upontheir quiet beds,

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:37.330
Constrain'd to watch indarkness, rain and cold.

10
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.100
Lord Regent, and redoubtedBurgundy,

11
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.670
By whose approach theregions of Artois,

12
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.600
Wallon and Picardy arefriends to us,

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.930
This happy night theFrenchmen are secure,

14
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.270
Having all day carousedand banqueted:

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.870
Embrace we then thisopportunity

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.300
As fitting best toquittance their deceit

17
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.470
Contrived by art andbaleful sorcery.

18
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.030
Coward of France! how muchhe wrongs his fame,

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.630
Despairing of his ownarm's fortitude,

20
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.570
To join with witches andthe help of hell!

21
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.800
Traitors have never othercompany.

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.270
But what's that Pucellewhom they term so pure?

23
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.700
A maid, they say.

24
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.770
A maid! and be so martial!

25
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.570
Pray God she prove notmasculine ere long,

26
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.730
If underneath the standardof the French

27
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.900
She carry armour as shehath begun.

28
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.570
Well, let them practiseand converse with spirits:

29
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.030
God is our fortress, inwhose conquering name

30
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.630
Let us resolve to scaletheir flinty bulwarks.

31
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.870
Ascend, brave Talbot; wewill follow thee.

32
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.400
Not all together: betterfar, I guess,

33
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.000
That we do make ourentrance several ways;

34
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.070
That, if it chance the oneof us do fail,

35
00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.370
The other yet may riseagainst their force.

36
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.500
Agreed: I'll to yondcorner.

37
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.930
And I to this.

38
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:12.170
And there will Talbotmount, or make his grave.

39
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.230
Now, Salisbury, for thee,and for the right

40
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.770
Of English Henry, shallthis night appear

41
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.670
How much in duty I ambound to both.

42
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.700
Arm! arm! the enemy dothmake assault!

43
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.000
Cry: 'St. George,' 'ATalbot.'

44
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.930
How now, my lords! what,all unready so?

45
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.900
Unready! ay, and glad we'scaped so well.

46
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.630
'Twas time, I trow, towake and leave our beds,

47
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.300
Hearing alarums at ourchamber-doors.

48
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.300
I think this Talbot be afiend of hell.

49
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.870
If not of hell, theheavens, sure, favour him.

50
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.870
Here cometh Charles: Imarvel how he sped.

51
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.100
Tut, holy Joan was hisdefensive guard.

52
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.900
Is this thy cunning, thoudeceitful dame?

53
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.830
Didst thou at first, toflatter us withal,

54
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.530
Make us partakers of alittle gain,

55
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.300
That now our loss might beten times so much?

56
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.000
Wherefore is Charlesimpatient with his friend!

57
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.230
At all times will you havemy power alike?

58
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.330
Sleeping or waking must Istill prevail,

59
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.200
Or will you blame and laythe fault on me?

60
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.270
Improvident soldiers! hadyour watch been good,

61
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.430
This sudden mischief nevercould have fall'n.

62
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.930
Duke of Alencon, this wasyour default,

63
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.530
That, being captain of thewatch to-night,

64
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.630
Did look no better to thatweighty charge.

65
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.900
Had all your quarters beenas safely kept

66
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.300
As that whereof I had thegovernment,

67
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.800
We had not been thusshamefully surprised.

68
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.930
Mine was secure.

69
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.500
And so was mine, my lord.

70
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.270
And, for myself, most partof all this night,

71
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.630
Within her quarter andmine own precinct

72
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.970
I was employ'd in passingto and fro,

73
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.730
About relieving of thesentinels:

74
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.930
Then how or which wayshould they first break in?

75
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.900
Question, my lords, nofurther of the case,

76
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.730
How or which way: 'tissure they found some place

77
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.670
But weakly guarded, wherethe breach was made.

78
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.200
And now there rests noother shift but this;

79
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.230
To gather our soldiers,scatter'd and dispersed,

80
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.370
And lay new platforms toendamage them.

81
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:27.200
Cry: A Talbot

82
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.730
I'll be so bold to takewhat they have left.

83
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.130
The cry of Talbot servesme for a sword;

84
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.430
For I have loaden me withmany spoils,

85
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.630
Using no other weapon buthis name.

86
00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:04.900
Cry: A Talbot

87
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.370
Here sound retreat, andcease our hot pursuit.

88
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.900
The day begins to break,and night is fled,

89
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.400
Whose pitchy mantleover-veil'd the earth.

90
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:30.400
Now have I paid my vowto Salisbury's soul;

91
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.830
For every drop of bloodwas drawn from him,

92
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.870
There hath at least fiveFrenchmen died tonight.

93
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.500
And that hereafter agesmay behold

94
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.630
What ruin happen'd inrevenge of him,

95
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.830
Within their chiefesttemple I'll erect

96
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.430
A tomb, wherein his corpseshall be interr'd:

97
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.370
Upon the which, that everyone may read,

98
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.630
Shall be engraved the sackof Orleans,

99
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.270
The treacherous manner ofhis mournful death

100
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.400
And what a terror he hadbeen to France.

101
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.330
Advance his body tothe marketplace,

102
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.930
the middle center of thiscursed town.

103
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.770
But, lords, in all ourbloody massacre,

104
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.700
I muse we met not with theDauphin's grace,

105
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.330
His new-come champion,virtuous Joan of Arc,

106
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.000
Nor any of his falseconfederates.

107
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.330
'Tis thought, Lord Talbot,when the fight began,

108
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.130
Roused on the sudden fromtheir drowsy beds,

109
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.200
They did amongst thetroops of armed men

110
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.170
Leap o'er the walls forrefuge in the field.

111
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.670
Myself, as far as I couldwell discern

112
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.000
For smoke and duskyvapours of the night,

113
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.170
Am sure I scared theDauphin and his trull,

114
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.270
When arm in arm they bothcame swiftly running,

115
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.400
Like to a pair of lovingturtle-doves

116
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.100
That could not liveasunder day or night.

117
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.830
After that things are setin order here,

118
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.370
We'll follow them with allthe power we have.

119
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.970
All hail, my lords! whichof this princely train

120
00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.200
Call ye the warlikeTalbot, for his acts

121
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.470
So much applauded throughthe realm of France?

122
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:59.330
Here is the Talbot: whowould speak with him?

123
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.530
The virtuous lady,Countess of Auvergne,

124
00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.670
With modesty admiring thyrenown,

125
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.300
By me entreats, great lord,thou wouldst vouchsafe

126
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.070
To visit her poor castlewhere she lies,

127
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.000
That she may boast shehath beheld the man

128
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.830
Whose glory fills theworld with loud report.

129
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.230
Is it even so? Nay, then,I see our wars

130
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.430
Will turn unto a peacefulcomic sport,

131
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.700
When ladies crave to beencounter'd with.

132
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.270
You may not, my lord,despise her gentle suit.

133
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.500
Ne'er trust me then; forwhen a world of men

134
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.130
Could not prevail with alltheir oratory,

135
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.800
Yet hath a woman'skindness over-ruled:

136
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.930
And therefore tell her Ireturn great thanks,

137
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.570
And in submission willattend on her.

138
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.200
Will not your honours bearme company?

139
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.230
No, truly; it is more thanmanners will:

140
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.270
And I have heard it said,unbidden guests

141
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.270
Are often welcomest whenthey are gone.

142
00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.600
Well then, alone, sincethere's no remedy,

143
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:09.970
I mean to prove thislady's courtesy.

144
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.200
Come hither, captain.

145
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.230
You perceive my mind?

146
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.070
I do, my lord, and meanaccordingly.

147
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.530
Porter, remember what Igave in charge;

148
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.000
And when you have done so,bring the keys to me.

149
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.900
Madam, I will.

150
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.230
The plot is laid: if allthings fall out right,

151
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.770
I shall as famous be bythis exploit

152
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.570
As Scythian Tomyris byCyrus' death.

153
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:50.200
Great is the rumor of thisdreadful knight,

154
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.930
And his achievements of noless account:

155
00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.700
Fain would mine eyes bewitness with mine ears,

156
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.100
To give their censure ofthese rare reports.

157
00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.300
Madam,

158
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.900
According as your ladyshipdesired,

159
00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.900
By message craved, so isLord Talbot come.

160
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:09.300
And he is welcome. What!is this the man?

161
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.430
Madam, it is.

162
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.500
Is this the scourge ofFrance?

163
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.030
Is this the Talbot, somuch fear'd abroad

164
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:23.270
That with his name themothers still their babes?

165
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.300
I see report is fabulousand false:

166
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.070
I thought I should haveseen some Hercules,

167
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.670
A second Hector, for hisgrim aspect,

168
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.400
And large proportion ofhis strong-knit limbs.

169
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:42.630
Alas, this is a child, asilly dwarf!

170
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.900
It cannot be this weak andwrithled shrimp

171
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:50.200
Should strike such terrorto his enemies.

172
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.800
Madam, I have been bold totrouble you;

173
00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.300
But since your ladyship isnot at leisure,

174
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.300
I'll sort some other timeto visit you.

175
00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.700
What means he now? Go askhim whither he goes.

176
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.300
Stay, my Lord Talbot; formy lady craves

177
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.100
To know the cause of yourabrupt departure.

178
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.730
Marry, for that she's in awrong belief,

179
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:13.630
I go to certify herTalbot's here.

180
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.370
If thou be he, then artthou prisoner.

181
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.900
Prisoner! to whom?

182
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:25.500
To me, blood-thirsty lord;

183
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.930
And for that cause Itrained thee to my house.

184
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.900
Long time thy shadow hathbeen thrall to me,

185
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.370
For in my gallery thypicture hangs:

186
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:37.600
But now the substanceshall endure the like,

187
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.330
And I will chain theselegs and arms of thine,

188
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.230
That hast by tyranny thesemany years

189
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.470
Wasted our country, slainour citizens

190
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.830
And sent our sons andhusbands captivate.

191
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.230
Ha, ha, ha!

192
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:59.300
Laughest thou, wretch? thymirth shall turn to moan.

193
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.470
I laugh to see yourladyship so fond

194
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.200
To think that you haveaught but Talbot's shadow

195
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.500
Whereon to practise yourseverity.

196
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.570
Why, art not thou the man?

197
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.470
I am indeed.

198
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.000
Then have I substance too.

199
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.700
No, no, I am but shadow ofmyself:

200
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.230
You are deceived, mysubstance is not here;

201
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.200
For what you see is butthe smallest part

202
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.470
And least proportion ofhumanity:

203
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.670
I tell you, madam, werethe whole frame here,

204
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.000
It is of such a spaciouslofty pitch,

205
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Your roof were notsufficient to contain't.

206
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.900
This is a riddlingmerchant for the nonce;

207
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.730
He will be here, and yethe is not here:

208
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.900
How can thesecontrarieties agree?

209
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.370
That will I show youpresently.

210
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.230
How say you, madam? areyou now persuaded

211
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.730
That Talbot is but shadowof himself?

212
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.570
These are his substance,sinews, arms and strength,

213
00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.200
With which he yoketh yourrebellious necks,

214
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.270
Razeth your cities andsubverts your towns

215
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.700
And in a moment makes themdesolate.

216
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:30.070
Victorious Talbot! pardonmy abuse:

217
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:34.100
I find thou art no lessthan fame hath bruited

218
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:42.770
And more than may begather'd by thy shape.

219
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.970
Let my presumption notprovoke thy wrath;

220
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.500
For I am sorry that withreverence

221
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.970
I did not entertain theeas thou art.

222
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.330
Be not dismay'd, fairlady; nor misconstrue

223
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.100
The mind of Talbot, as youdid mistake

224
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:05.730
The outward composition ofhis body.

225
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.800
What you have done hathnot offended me;

226
00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.230
Nor other satisfaction doI crave,

227
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.470
But only, with yourpatience, that we may

228
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:19.600
Taste of your wine and seewhat cates you have;

229
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.270
For soldiers' stomachsalways serve them well.

230
00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:26.870
With all my heart, andthink me honoured

231
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:31.930
To feast so great awarrior in my house.

232
00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:20.070
Great lords and gentlemen,what means this silence?

233
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.970
Dare no man answer in acase of truth?

234
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:27.830
Within the Temple-hall wewere too loud;

235
00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:29.930
The garden here is moreconvenient.

236
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.000
Then say at once if Imaintain'd the truth;

237
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.370
Or else was wranglingSomerset in the error?

238
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:39.430
Faith, I have been atruant in the law,

239
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.470
And never yet could framemy will to it;

240
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.870
And therefore frame thelaw unto my will.

241
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:51.570
Judge you, my Lord ofWarwick, then, between us.

242
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.630
Between two hawks, whichflies the higher pitch;

243
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.700
Between two dogs, whichhath the deeper mouth;

244
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.000
Between two blades, whichbears the better temper:

245
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.330
Between two horses, whichdoth bear him best;

246
00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:14.330
Between two girls, whichhath the merriest eye;

247
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.500
I have perhaps some shallowspirit of judgement;

248
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.070
But in these nice sharpquillets of the law,

249
00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:25.770
Good faith, I am no wiserthan a daw.

250
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:32.830
Tut, tut, here is amannerly forbearance:

251
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.530
The truth appears so nakedon my side

252
00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.100
That any purblind eye mayfind it out.

253
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.630
And on my side it is sowell apparell'd,

254
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:41.170
So clear, so shining andso evident

255
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:49.570
That it will glimmerthrough a blind man's eye.

256
00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:54.930
Since you are tongue-tiedand so loath to speak,

257
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:59.830
In dumb significantsproclaim your thoughts:

258
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.930
Let him that is atrue-born gentleman

259
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:07.870
And stands upon the honourof his birth,

260
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:11.700
If he suppose that I havepleaded truth,

261
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:22.330
From off this brier plucka white rose with me.

262
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.100
Let him that is no cowardnor no flatterer,

263
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:30.800
But dare maintain theparty of the truth,

264
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:39.000
Pluck a red rose from offthis thorn with me.

265
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.800
I love no colours, andwithout all colour

266
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.030
Of base insinuatingflattery

267
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:54.100
I pluck this white rosewith Plantagenet.

268
00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.100
I pluck this red rose withyoung Somerset

269
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.030
And say withal I think heheld the right.

270
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.100
Stay, lords and gentlemen,and pluck no more,

271
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.970
Till you conclude that heupon whose side

272
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:12.870
The fewest roses arecropp'd from the tree

273
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.200
Shall yield the other inthe right opinion.

274
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.500
Good Master Vernon, it iswell objected:

275
00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:22.200
If I have fewest, Isubscribe in silence.

276
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.930
And I.

277
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.430
Then for the truth andplainness of the case.

278
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.930
I pluck this pale andmaiden blossom here,

279
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.130
Giving my verdict on thewhite rose side.

280
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.800
Prick not your finger asyou pluck it off,

281
00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.770
Lest bleeding you do paintthe white rose red

282
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.630
And fall on my side so,against your will.

283
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.870
If I my lord, for myopinion bleed,

284
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.370
Opinion shall be surgeonto my hurt

285
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:51.330
And keep me on the sidewhere now I am.

286
00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:04.700
Well, well, come on: whoelse?

287
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:09.970
Unless my study and mybooks be false,

288
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.970
The argument you held waswrong in you:

289
00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:22.530
In sign whereof I pluck awhite rose too.

290
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.800
Now, Somerset, where isyour argument?

291
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.730
Here in my scabbard,meditating that

292
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:30.700
Shall dye your white rosein a bloody red.

293
00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.500
Meantime your cheeks docounterfeit our roses;

294
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.630
For pale they look withfear, as witnessing

295
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.670
The truth on our side.

296
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:40.800
No, Plantagenet,

297
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.530
'Tis not for fear butanger that thy cheeks

298
00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.570
Blush for pure shame tocounterfeit our roses,

299
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.330
And yet thy tongue willnot confess thy error.

300
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.000
Hath not thy rose acanker, Somerset?

301
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.800
Hath not thy rose a thorn,Plantagenet?

302
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.430
Ay, sharp and piercing, tomaintain his truth;

303
00:20:56.430 --> 00:21:02.430
Whiles thy consumingcanker eats his falsehood.

304
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.200
Well, I'll find friends towear my bleeding roses,

305
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.600
That shall maintain what Ihave said is true,

306
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:13.270
Where false Plantagenetdare not be seen.

307
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.500
Now, by this maidenblossom in my hand,

308
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:21.330
I scorn thee and thyfashion, peevish boy.

309
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:23.330
Turn not thy scorns thisway, Plantagenet.

310
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.530
Proud Pole, I will, andscorn both him and thee.

311
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.200
I'll turn my part thereofinto thy throat.

312
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.970
Away, away, good Williamde la Pole!

313
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:34.200
We grace the yeoman byconversing with him.

314
00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.200
Now, by God's will, thouwrong'st him, Somerset;

315
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.700
His grandfather was LionelDuke of Clarence,

316
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.630
Third son to the thirdEdward King of England:

317
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.430
Spring crestless yeomenfrom so deep a root?

318
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.670
He bears him on theplace's privilege,

319
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:49.300
Or durst not, for hiscraven heart, say thus.

320
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.400
By him that made me, I'llmaintain my words

321
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.400
On any plot of ground inChristendom.

322
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.630
Was not thy father,Richard Earl of Cambridge,

323
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.400
For treason 'headed inour late king's days?

324
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.730
And, by his treason,stand'st not thou attainted,

325
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:04.100
Corrupted, and exempt fromancient gentry?

326
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.930
His trespass yet livesguilty in thy blood;

327
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:13.430
And, till thou be restored,thou art a yeoman.

328
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.200
My father was attached,not attainted,

329
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.770
Condemn'd to die fortreason, but no traitor;

330
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:21.270
And that I'll prove onbetter men than Somerset,

331
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.830
Were growing time onceripen'd to my will.

332
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.130
For your partaker Pole andyou yourself,

333
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:30.270
I'll note you in my bookof memory,

334
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.870
To scourge you for thisapprehension:

335
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:36.100
Look to it well and sayyou are well warn'd.

336
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.530
Ah, thou shalt find usready for thee still;

337
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:40.830
And know us by thesecolours for thy foes,

338
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:44.100
For these my friends inspite of thee shall wear.

339
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:49.100
And, by my soul, this paleand angry rose,

340
00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:53.030
As cognizance of myblood-drinking hate,

341
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.630
Will I for ever and myfaction wear,

342
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.430
Until it wither with me tomy grave

343
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.700
Or flourish to the heightof my degree.

344
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.970
Go forward and be chokedwith thy ambition!

345
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:08.130
And so farewell until Imeet thee next.

346
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:15.470
Have with thee, Pole.Farewell, ambitious Richard.

347
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.400
How I am braved and mustperforce endure it!

348
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.400
This blot that they objectagainst your house

349
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.670
Shall be wiped out in thenext parliament

350
00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:39.030
Call'd for the truce ofWinchester and Gloucester;

351
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.370
And if thou be not thencreated York,

352
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.270
I will not live to beaccounted Warwick.

353
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:49.430
Meantime, in signal of mylove to thee,

354
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.270
Against proud Somerset andWilliam Pole,

355
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:58.500
Will I upon thy party wearthis rose:

356
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:03.130
And here I prophesy: thisbrawl to-day,

357
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:05.430
Grown to this faction inthe Temple-garden,

358
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:09.370
Shall send between the redrose and the white

359
00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:15.000
A thousand souls to deathand deadly night.

360
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.800
Good Master Vernon, I ambound to you,

361
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.700
That you on my behalfwould pluck a flower.

362
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.800
In your behalf still willI wear the same.

363
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.500
And so will I.

364
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.100
Thanks, gentle sir.

365
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:46.270
Come, let us four todinner: I dare say

366
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:51.370
This quarrel will drinkblood another day.

367
00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.600
Kind keepers of my weakdecaying age,

368
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.330
Let dying Mortimer hererest himself.

369
00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:28.130
Even like a man new haledfrom the rack,

370
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.700
So fare my limbs with longimprisonment.

371
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.170
And these grey locks, thepursuivants of death,

372
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.470
Nestor-like aged in an ageof care,

373
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:43.900
Argue the end of EdmundMortimer.

374
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.200
But tell me, keeper, willmy nephew come?

375
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.500
Richard Plantagenet, mylord, will come:

376
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.630
We sent unto the Temple,unto his chamber;

377
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.900
And answer was return'dthat he will come.

378
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:07.470
Enough: my soul shall thenbe satisfied.

379
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:14.770
Poor gentleman! his wrongdoth equal mine.

380
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.970
Since Henry Monmouth firstbegan to reign,

381
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.200
Before whose glory I wasgreat in arms,

382
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.570
This loathsomesequestration have I had:

383
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:30.430
Even so long hasRichard been obscured,

384
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.800
Deprived of honour andinheritance.

385
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.200
But now the arbitrator ofdespairs,

386
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.370
Just death, kind umpire ofmen's miseries,

387
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:48.200
With sweet enlargementdoth dismiss me hence:

388
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.830
I would his troubleslikewise were expired,

389
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.730
That so he might recoverwhat was lost.

390
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:02.670
My lord, your lovingnephew now is come.

391
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.700
Richard Plantagenet, myfriend, is he come?

392
00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.770
Ay, noble uncle, thusignobly used,

393
00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:15.330
Your nephew, late despisedRichard, comes.

394
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:21.170
Direct mine arms I mayembrace his neck,

395
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.600
And now declare, sweet stemof York's great stock,

396
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.400
Why didst thou say, oflate thou wert despised?

397
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:39.900
First, lean thine agedback against mine arm;

398
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.570
And, in that ease, I'lltell thee my disease.

399
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:52.030
This day, in argument upona case,

400
00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.000
Some words there grew'twixt Somerset and me;

401
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.030
Among which terms he usedhis lavish tongue

402
00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:59.370
And did upbraid me with myfather's death:

403
00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:02.370
Therefore, good uncle, formy father's sake,

404
00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.730
In honour of a truePlantagenet

405
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.500
And for alliance sake,declare the cause

406
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.000
My father, Earl ofCambridge, lost his head.

407
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.300
That cause, fair nephew,that imprison'd me

408
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.800
And hath detain'd me allmy flowering youth

409
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.300
Within a loathsomedungeon, there to pine,

410
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.970
Was cursed instrument ofhis decease.

411
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:26.900
Discover more at largewhat cause that was,

412
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:34.070
Henry the Fourth,grandfather to this king,

413
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.170
Deposed his nephewRichard,

414
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.400
The first-begotten and thelawful heir,

415
00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:42.830
Of Edward king, the thirdof that descent:

416
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.470
In Henry's reign thePercies of the north,

417
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.500
Finding his usurpationmost unjust,

418
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.070
Endeavor'd my advancementto the throne:

419
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:56.500
The reason moved thesewarlike lords to this

420
00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.230
Was, for that--young KingRichard thus removed,

421
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:03.630
Leaving no heir begottenof his body--

422
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.600
I was the next by birthand parentage;

423
00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.530
For by my mother I derivedam

424
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:14.630
From Lionel Duke ofClarence, the third son

425
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.300
To King Edward the Third;whereas he

426
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.430
From John of Gaunt dothbring his pedigree,

427
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:24.130
Being but fourth of thatheroic line.

428
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:28.870
But mark: as in thatgreat haughty attempt

429
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:32.870
They laboured to plantthe rightful heir,

430
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:39.800
I lost my liberty and theytheir lives.

431
00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.270
Long after this, whenHenry the Fifth,

432
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:47.000
Succeeding his fatherBolingbroke, did reign,

433
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.300
Thy father, the Earl ofCambridge then, derived

434
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.800
From famous EdmundLangley, Duke of York,

435
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:58.730
Marrying my sister thatthy mother was,

436
00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.400
Again in pity of my harddistress

437
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.870
Levied an army, weening toredeem

438
00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:08.930
And have install'd me inthe diadem:

439
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.800
But, as the rest, so fellthat noble earl

440
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.600
And was beheaded. Thus theMortimers,

441
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:23.270
In whom the title rested,were suppress'd.

442
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.170
Of which, my lord, yourhonour is the last.

443
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.700
True; and thou seest thatI no issue have

444
00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:38.170
Thou art my heir; the restI wish thee gather:

445
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:44.000
My dear, be wary in thystudious care.

446
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Thy grave admonishmentsprevail with me:

447
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.770
But yet, methinks, myfather's execution

448
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.400
Was nothing less thanbloody tyranny.

449
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:58.170
With silence, nephew, bethou politic:

450
00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:02.570
Strong-fixed is the houseof Lancaster,

451
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:10.530
And like a mountain, notto be removed.

452
00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:14.770
But now thy uncle isremoving hence:

453
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.870
As princes do their courts,when they are cloy'd

454
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:23.430
With long continuance in asettled place.

455
00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:29.070
O, uncle, would some partof my young years

456
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.930
Might but redeem thepassage of your age!

457
00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.470
Thou then dost wrong me,as that slaughterer doth

458
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.670
Which giveth many woundswhen one will kill.

459
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:45.300
Mourn not, except thousorrow for my good;

460
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:50.070
Only give order for myfuneral:

461
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:56.070
And so farewell, and fairbe all thy hopes

462
00:31:56.070 --> 00:32:02.730
And prosperous be thy lifein peace and war!

463
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:23.470
And peace, no war, befallthy parting soul!

464
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:40.330
Well, I will lock hiscounsel in my breast;

465
00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:47.330
And what I do imagine letthat rest.

466
00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:56.700
Keepers, convey him hence,and I myself

467
00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:08.170
Will see his burial betterthan his life.

468
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:15.200
Here dies the dusky torchof Mortimer,

469
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.970
Choked with ambition ofthe meaner sort:

470
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.670
And for those wrongs,those bitter injuries,

471
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.800
Which Somerset hathoffer'd to my house:

472
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.000
I doubt not but withhonour to redress;

473
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.400
And therefore haste I tothe parliament,

474
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.370
Either to be restored tomy blood,

475
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.770
Or make my ill theadvantage of my good.

476
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.770
