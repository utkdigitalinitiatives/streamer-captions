00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:27.890



00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.190

        I'm more passionate about this
        sport than I've been about any
      

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.890

        other sport.


00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.600

        If you let it go, if you release
        the brakes, you're
      

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.480

        going so fast that
        you can just fly.
      

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.540



00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.700

        I was encouraging her to race
        but then when we found out she
      

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.960

        was born a man, we didn't
        know what to do.
      

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.080

        Is she going to beat
        me every time?
      

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.720

        I feel cheated.


00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.350

        She can't have it.


00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.460

        In my life, she can't.


00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.560

        On a cellular level, is
        really male or female?
      

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.260

        She's wasn't born a female
        like the rest of us.
      

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.950

        I don't think she's
        100% woman.
      

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.260

        Why should we have to
        compete with her?
      

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.310

        I want to race bicycles.


00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.930

        That's what it comes down to.


00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.610

        I fit on the gender spectrum
        as a woman.
      

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.230

        I believe I have a right
        to be there.
      

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.480

        I believe it's fair.


00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:44.290



00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.260

        Here we are at Bear Mountain.


00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.190

        Get ready for the finals of
        the Pro Women's Downhill.
      

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.640

        A beautiful day and some of the
        fastest girls in Canada
      

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.890

        get ready to go.


00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.070



00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.060

        It's the first major race of the
        season and all eyes are on
      

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.780

        Michelle Dumaresq.


00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.810

        Now a woman, Michelle
        was born male.
      

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.660

        She legally changed her
        gender six years ago.
      

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.940

        Just one month ago, she was
        granted permission by the
      

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.190

        Canadian Cycling Association
        to compete
      

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.930

        in the women's category.


00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.060

        This is her first big race
        with a pro license.
      

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.750



00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.950

        Michelle Dumaresq, ladies
        and gentlemen, out
      

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.200

        of John Henry bikes.


00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:42.970



00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.470

        With a 443.01 Dumaresq
        moves into the lead.
      

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.140

        I made one mistake.


00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.530

        Michelle wins the race
        by 10 seconds.
      

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.750

        In a sport where races generally
        last from two to
      

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.630

        five minutes, this is
        a fairly big margin.
      

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:12.620



00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.310

        Some of Michelle's competitors
        immediately start a petition
      

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.130

        to overturn her win.


00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.870

        Basically, you're trying to
        protest this so that she can't
      

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.440

        win today, is that correct?


00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.710

        If it were up to me, she would
        not stand on the podium.
      

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.660

        And we need to make a point as
        well and if this goes through
      

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.960

        today, then we could have a
        national champion in our
      

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.540

        country that's a transgendered
        female, or I don't know what
      

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.640

        you call her.


00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.100

        Sorry.


00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.030

        But that person could be
        going to the World
      

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.020

        Championships this year.


00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.060

        What are people going to think
        about women racing downhill?
      

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.330

        And maybe this protest that
        we're starting today, Michelle
      

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.130

        might look at it and realize
        what she's doing.
      

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.450

        Because everybody who's signed
        that paper believes in our
      

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.190

        cause, being just
        women racing.
      

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.000

        And maybe she'll realize that
        and decide to keep some
      

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.330

        friends, hopefully.


00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.670

        Did you have trouble getting
        signatures for
      

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.920

        the petition today?


00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.760

        Not very much.


00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.170

        90% of the people will sign
        it, that we've asked.
      

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.250

        I've got an official protest
        that I received from a group
      

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.810

        of racers in the
        elite category.
      

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.220

        They're protesting the result of
        this race because the rider
      

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.680

        who won the elite women category
        is transgendered.
      

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.840

        And that they don't feel that it
        was fair that she competed
      

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.640

        in that category.


00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.880

        What kind of advantages
        does she have?
      

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.820

        Physical.


00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.560

        Definitely, she weighs about 50
        or 60 pounds more than any
      

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.600

        of us and she's way stronger.


00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.340

        Mountain biking--


00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.640

        She's got a lot more upper
        body strength--
      

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.460

        Downhilling is so
        much upper body
      

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.100

        strength, so much leg strength.


00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.200

        It's just so physical.


00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.180

        But you change the fact
        of your chromosomes.
      

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.360

        You can't change that.


00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.000

        You can't diminish the number
        of muscle fibers you have to
      

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.160

        be fair with us.


00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.520

        Your bones, heart, lungs,
        everything.
      

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.230

        Unless they gutted you and taken
        out everything that's
      

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.690

        inside of you and put in female
        parts, and then changed
      

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.260

        your body to a female
        as well surgically.
      

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.900

        Even that, how can people
        turn a man to a woman?
      

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.170



00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.810

        Now where does it
        go from here?
      

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.670

        I've denied the protest because
        the rider was issued a
      

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.220

        license by Cycling BC,
        by our parent body.
      

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.730

        And under those rules that I've
        worked with, riders who
      

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.360

        are issued a current license
        are entitled to race in the
      

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.820

        category that the parent body
        has decided to race in.
      

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.650

        She's going to be on her own.


00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.870

        We might even decide to protest
        the race and she'll be
      

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.120

        the only one racing.


00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.450

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.240

        they going to do?


00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.990

        Are they're going to not
        join me on the podium?

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.080

        it which is really hard because

        Write some more letters, talk
        to a few more people, maybe
      

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.580

        take it up with the IOC.


00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.250



00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.660

        But I think it let
        a few people know
      

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.120

        that it bothers us.


00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.880

        This is years of work.


00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.230

        Years of work.


00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.410

        It's my dream come true.


00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.450

        We were going to do something
        more today because you have to
      

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.230

        start somewhere.


00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.940

        But we're going to wait and
        get some advice from maybe
      

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.610

        some of the top, top pro
        women in the world.
      

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.880

        Because clearly Michelle
        is good enough to be a
      

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.640

        threat to them too.


00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:07.290

        She's pretty fast.


00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.900

        If they listen to the protest
        and decide to not let me race,
      

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.860

        there's not much I can do
        about it at this point.
      

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.130

        I feel like this has just driven
        a big dividing line
      

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.920

        down the center.


00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.670

        And I realize that I've probably
        lost a few friends or
      

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.310

        damaged a few relationships
        because of this.
      

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.460

        And that hurts me a lot.


00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.030

        But I'm not going to go away
        until someone forces me to.
      

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.140

        I'm not giving up.


00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.180

        I'm going to keep going until I
        get to race in the World Cup
      

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.920

        and I get to race against the
        best woman in the world.
      

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:49.150



00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.340

        To achieve her dream of racing
        at the World Cup level,
      

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.070

        Michelle must first
        prove herself on
      

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.320

        the national circuit.


00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:01.180



00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.310

        I don't really think the issue
        with me racing has made it to
      

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.590

        the East Coast yet.


00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.670

        Who knows?


00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.730

        I've been surprised before.


00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.980

        Word spreads really fast,
        especially in mountain bike
      

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.280

        communities, even though it's
        across the country, it's still
      

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.530

        a small community.


00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:31.420



00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.910

        Have you seen the man who goes
        in the women's category?
      

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:35.910

        He signed.


00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.900

        He was the man with the boobs.


00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.400

        Yeah.


00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.620

        He was a travesty?


00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.060

        Like two sex, the guy.


00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:44.550

        No way.


00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.930

        Yeah, and he signed for the
        women's category and he won.
      

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:55.800

        And the UCI called him to
        give back the medal.
      

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.770

        Really?


00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:57.260

        Yeah.


00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.650

        I heard it.


00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.580

        They thought it was a woman.


00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.550

        Yeah.


00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:06.260

        You look in his helmet,
        and whoa!
      

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.680

        That's just weird.


00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.930

        Yeah.


00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:20.860



00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.230

        Whew, it's fun.


00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.990



00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.870

        She sounded pretty confident.


00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.230

        She sounded like she had
        her act together.
      

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.080

        Michelle, how did the
        run treat you today?
      

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.250

        I was clean.


00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.890

        I got my lines I wanted.


00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.640

        Michelle's win qualifies her
        to compete at the upcoming
      

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.340

        World Cup, in Mount
        St. Ann, Quebec.
      

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.590

        Michelle, congratulations.


00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.490

        Nice job.


00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.740

        Thank you so much.


00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.160



00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.410

        [APPLAUSE]


00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.380



00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.230

        I decided to tell the women I
        was racing against my history.
      

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.220

        I told them background and about
        the controversy that was
      

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.770

        happening on the West Coast.


00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.280

        And much to my surprise,
        most of them had
      

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.120

        already heard about it.


00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.110

        And they'd heard that
        there was a protest.
      

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.020

        I'm a mountain bike racer
        and I'm a woman.
      

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.280

        But the real thing is I
        want to race a bike.
      

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.070

        Yes, I'm transsexual.


00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.210

        That's my history and
        I can't ever--
      

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:24.280

        I'll never escape that.


00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.300

        I don't really want to.


00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.150

        It's a big part of my life.


00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.040

        I don't regret anything
        that I've done.
      

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.470

        Do you have a psychological
        advantage?
      

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.670



00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.760

        I'm unsure.


00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:36.750

        Right.


00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.100

        You just know that you
        feel different.
      

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.850

        Well, I was raised, even though
        I lived as a boy, I
      

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:43.730

        always knew I was a girl.


00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.910

        Ever since I was a little kid.


00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.380

        This is from four or
        five years old was
      

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.160

        when I first knew.


00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.450

        So even growing up as a male,
        I tried to emulate what they
      

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.200

        did but in the back
        of my mind, I
      

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.860

        always knew I was female.


00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.660

        I never once thought about it
        as being psychological.
      

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.000

        But when I see your size.


00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.260

        I think I can't swear.


00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.590

        I think, holy cow.


00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.780

        I think, oh my God.


00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.230

        Because I look at you, I think,
        ah, you can take--
      

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.200

        you can suck up the
        hits a lot better.
      

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.470

        As a person, I think you're fun
        and a great person to be
      

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.350

        with, and I think, yeah, I'd
        love to race with you.
      

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.810

        But then I look and I think, oh
        my God, like she's going to
      

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.640

        kick my ass.


00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.860

        At first, is Kelli wrong,?


00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.710

        I don't know what I
        think about that.
      

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:32.230

        In a way, maybe it's not too
        fair and then once I met you,
      

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.240

        you just seem a regular
        girl to me.
      

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.720

        Bring it on.


00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.970

        Let's go.


00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:42.800



00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.500

        When I was 18 and I was the
        starting on this process, I
      

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:52.930

        first realized that I was
        perhaps really transsexual.
      

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.300

        And that I was really going
        to spend the rest of
      

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.550

        my life as a woman.


00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.360



00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.250

        I thought my life was
        over at that point.
      

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.840

        I thought there's no future
        for someone like me.
      

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.140

        I'll be ostracized.


00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.210

        I'll lose my friends, my
        family, my job, and
      

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.070

        everything.


00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:12.840

        Life wasn't worth living.


00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.950

        The future was bleak.


00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.940

        There's nothing worse than
        living [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
      

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.270

        and feeling like you're the only
        one in the world who's
      

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.060

        doing this.


00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.480

        Twenty years ago, it was
        a pretty lonely place.
      

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:39.820



00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.150

        I was five.


00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.550

        I can't describe it.


00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.840

        I just knew I was different.


00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:54.000



00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.150

        When I became aware that
        there's girls, and then
      

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:00.350

        there's boys, there's certain
        things that the girls do that
      

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.310

        the boys aren't allowed to do
        and certain ways the girls
      

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.840

        dressed and the boys aren't
        allowed to dress.
      

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.050

        And I didn't understand
        all that.
      

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:10.200

        It's a totally, deep inside
        identity thing.
      

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.810



00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.540

        How do describe identity?


00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.940

        You just know.


00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.470

        It's invisible but it's there
        and mine is pretty clear.
      

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.150

        I know I wasn't like the
        boys, and I knew I
      

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.180

        wasn't like the girls.


00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.260

        I was just somewhere
        in the middle.
      

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.620

        And it's pretty confusing
        when you're a kid.
      

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:38.960



00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.670

        It's like living amongst
        the lions.
      

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:45.480

        I learned to emulate not just
        what the guys did in sport but
      

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.270

        being a guy itself.


00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.620

        You're living amongst them
        and you're in disguise.
      

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.900

        There was this part missing from
        my male experience, what
      

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.430

        it means to be male.


00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:01.940

        And it just wasn't there.


00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:05.720



00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.970

        But I kept it to myself.


00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.280



00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.530

        I don't think my parents knew.


00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.190



00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.800

        I wasn't about to tell anyone.


00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:25.300



00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.600

        I really didn't know whether she
        was unhappy or not because
      

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.420

        she held it in so well.


00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.600

        She just held it in.


00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.880

        And eventually she couldn't
        hold it in anymore.
      

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.300

        And she had to start
        transitioning.
      

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.510



00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.090

        I felt guilt when I was younger,
        that I was letting my
      

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.900

        family down, my dad because
        I was the oldest son.
      

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.010



00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:57.690

        When you start to process, one
        of the first drugs you take is
      

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.620

        an androgen blocker which stops


00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.570

        testosterone from being absorbed.


00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:05.160

        You also start taking estrogen
        and progesterone.
      

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.030

        That causes some pretty severe
        effects immediately.
      

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.590



00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:15.510

        It changes everything, skin,
        your hair, your height, your
      

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.540

        weight, your fat,
        your emotions.
      

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.320



00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.220

        You have to do what's called a
        real life test, which is you
      

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.630

        have to live for two
        full years, 24-7.
      

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.310

        That means your work, you
        family, your friends, living
      

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.190

        as a woman.


00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.070

        But with the plumbing
        of a male.
      

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.330



00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.330

        I was living two lives.


00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.130

        I wanted to go ahead.


00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.300

        But I wasn't able to let go of
        the other one until it became
      

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:43.550

        apparent that you couldn't
        do both.
      

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:48.760



00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.440

        I came out to my dad when we
        were putting up drywall.
      

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:56.430

        I'm holding drywall up over my
        head, and got the screw gun
      

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.260

        and screws out.


00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.770

        Dad, by the way, I'm
        changing my gender.
      

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:07.420



00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.130

        The whole idea is to worry about
        what your child is-- if
      

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.070

        they're going to be happy.


00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.130

        That's the number one thing.


00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.480

        You always want your child to
        be healthy and happy, but
      

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.960

        particularly to be happy.


00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.980

        And whatever makes that
        child happy is what
      

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.460

        parents should want.


00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:24.660

        I remember when Michelle was
        going to a clinic there in her
      

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.230

        transitioning period and she
        said, of 20 people, probably
      

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.250

        18 of them, their parents
        had disowned them.
      

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.490

        It's very fortunate
        that Michelle is
      

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.760

        a very strong person.


00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.740

        You have to think that they're
        a lot of people out there,
      

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:43.280

        transgender people, and I would
        hate to think that my
      

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.840

        child couldn't come to me and
        therefore committed suicide.
      

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.090

        How would you live with that?


00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:57.160



00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.010

        Thinking back, I guess it was a
        very tough goal for Michael,
      

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.400

        and now Michelle.


00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.630

        I just admire her so much for
        having the conviction to say,
      

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.780

        I'm going to be what I am,
        not what other people
      

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.840

        expect me to be.


00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.650

        Yeah, I'm lucky.


00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:18.000

        I have some really
        sweet parents.
      

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.640

        Very, very good parents.


00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.890

        [UNINTELLIGIBLE]


00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:39.530



00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.730

        Michelle and I are really,
        really close friends and I
      

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.540

        really respect her
        for who she is.
      

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:50.040

        Me and Michelle really bonded
        based on a similar connection
      

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.410

        with having struggles
        in our lives.
      

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:54.760

        Kelli and I are so close.


00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.800

        We've had amazing
        conversations.
      

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.020



00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.070

        Kelli's truly taken the time to
        question met to say, hey,
      

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.170

        explain to me your perception
        of gender.
      

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:11.260

        Explain to me how somebody can
        live for so long outwardly as
      

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.430

        one sex and then change.


00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.190

        How does that happen?


00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.980

        We ride together a lot and
        she teaches me a lot.
      

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.890

        She pushes me in a real
        physical level but
      

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:27.110

        intellectually I relate
        to her at a woman.
      

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.470

        And then the UCI ended up giving
        Michelle a license.
      

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:39.020

        And for some reason, when it
        became valid and OK by a
      

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.180

        governing body, all
        of the sudden, it
      

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.790

        became not OK for me.


00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.630

        Something just didn't
        seem fair to me.
      

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.380

        It pushed a button that I
        couldn't really understand.
      

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:54.850

        The only way I could really
        describe it is, all of the
      

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:59.540

        sudden it took me back to years
        and years and years of
      

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.170

        feeling this difference between
        males and females.
      

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.710

        I was always told I should
        sit like a girl.
      

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.070

        I should act like a girl and I
        should do this like a girl.
      

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.240

        I've always been encouraged
        to be cautious
      

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:14.820

        and don't hurt yourself.


00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.250

        You're meant to have babies
        and you're the caregiver.
      

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.860

        You're not the out there,
        be aggressive.
      

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.140

        I grew up with two older
        brothers and a neighborhood
      

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.610

        full of boys.


00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.160

        On weekends, they play hockey.


00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.960

        I'd sit on the sidelines.


00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.670

        Throughout my experience, the
        boys' activities always
      

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:33.870

        dictated what was
        going to happen.
      

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:38.700



00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.170

        Mountain biking felt like it
        took me away from being a
      

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.620

        woman and just let me be for
        the first time in my life.
      

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.430



00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:53.670

        It allowed me to challenge
        my fears.
      

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:58.150

        So it liberated me
        in some sense.
      

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.720

        And then for Michelle to come
        into the picture, it felt like
      

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:06.650

        a male was coming in to my
        territory and now I have to
      

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:08.630

        compete against a male which I
        thought I've been competing
      

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:11.920

        against all my life.


00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.310

        [APPLAUSE]


00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:15.580

        I had such a problem with it.


00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.010

        I couldn't even actually
        continue a
      

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.270

        friendship with Michelle.


00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.500



00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.950

        The loss of Kelli's friendship
        has almost--
      

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.960

        I can't say it's going
        to make me stop.
      

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.990

        But that hurt more
        than anything
      

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.050

        else and I love Kelli.


00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:37.810

        I really do.


00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.060

        She's just an amazing
        person and there's
      

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.500

        nothing I can say anymore.


00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.680

        I just have to back off let
        it a settle itself out.
      

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.250

        I've lost some friends
        in this but her, I
      

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:51.870

        didn't expect to lose.


00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.430

        That's been a tough one.


00:21:53.430 --> 00:22:10.240



00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.930

        After several local wins,
        Michelle has proven she's one
      

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:14.610

        of the fastest women
        in Canada.
      

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:18.550



00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:21.070

        She now gets to test herself
        for the first time on the
      

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.320

        international circuit.


00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:29.090



00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.630

        I don't know if I've ever felt
        quite like I've wanted
      

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:36.430

        something more than to compete
        at the World Cup level.
      

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:40.790

        I'll never say I want to win
        the World Cup but I'm just
      

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.380

        happy to achieve this
        level right now.
      

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:47.600

        The drive, certainly right now,
        is the highest that I've
      

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.850

        ever felt before.


00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:52.450



00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.060

        This is the first World
        Cup to come to North
      

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.330

        America this year.


00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.410

        I don't know who knows so
        far, and who doesn't
      

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.840

        know about my history.


00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.990

        A friend of mine told me
        something about the Canadian
      

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:10.230

        girl who was a man and
        she's competing.
      

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.220

        Then, yeah, we were discussing
        a little bit.
      

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.660

        My opinion is that, once
        you're born as a
      

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:21.410

        man, you are a man.


00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:23.400

        Because it's in sport and
        effects all of us, then I
      

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.860

        think that's when it becomes
        an issue then for us.
      

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.200

        Which is a shame because it
        seems like a personal attack
      

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.490

        on someone and it's not
        meant in that way.
      

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.130

        There's of course a couple of
        people I'm really interested
      

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:37.970

        in to find out their reactions,


00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.490

        namely, Missy Giove.


00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:44.510

        From the United States of
        America, Missy Giove.
      

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.540

        Missy Giove is one of the women
        who pioneered this area
      

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.100

        of the sport.


00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.350

        She's one of my heroes and
        definitely one of the icons.
      

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.590

        She used to walk around
        with a purple mohawk.
      

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.850

        And she's not afraid
        to be herself.
      

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:00.970

        Missy doesn't walk around with
        "dyke" tattooed on her
      

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:02.000

        forehead either.


00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.680

        I respect that.


00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.570

        I don't wave a trans flag.


00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:08.280

        Yeah, her sexuality is part of
        who she is and my history is
      

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.600

        part of who I am.


00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.080

        I'm proud of where I came
        from and who I am now.
      

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.430

        And she'd probably say
        the same thing.
      

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:19.480



00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:22.750

        Amidst the buzz about her
        history, Michelle and her
      

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.390

        competitors practice
        the course for two
      

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.640

        days before the race.


00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:46.010



00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:50.240

        It's a tough course.


00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.550

        Definitely the hardest course
        I've ever been.
      

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.950



00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.150

        My first reaction is Michelle
        is stronger.
      

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.660

        She's got to be stronger.


00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.580

        She's got more muscle tissue.


00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.110

        You're born with more muscle
        tissue so you can't
      

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:04.880

        actually lose it.


00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:10.390

        And then I was like, well, maybe
        we should do research.
      

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.440

        I do see her on the downhill
        course and sometimes feel like
      

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.610

        this isn't right.


00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:14.540

        This isn't fair.


00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.530

        I watch her muscle her bike
        around and she's--
      

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.310

        It makes a few of the girls
        nervous out there.
      

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.320



00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.450

        Dr. Jerilynn Prior a leading
        endocrinologist and
      

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:30.150

        researcher, pioneered the use
        of female sex hormones in
      

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.700

        gender reassigned therapy.


00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.720

        I would think that any male
        advantage would go away after
      

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.090

        the assignment had been complete
        and the hormone
      

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:44.440

        therapy had been continued
        for several years.
      

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.750

        If the person started off with
        broad shoulders, the skeleton
      

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:51.660

        isn't going to change, the
        structure of the skeleton.
      

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.480

        But the musculature decreases.


00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.650

        The heavy musculature that's
        typical of testosterone in
      

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.450

        some men will decrease.


00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:05.530

        When you look at all women,
        there's a whole range of
      

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.470

        musculoskeletal development.


00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:10.600

        And when you look at men,
        there's a whole range.
      

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.520

        When you look at stature,
        the same is true.
      

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.600

        There's many men that are
        shorter than women.
      

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.840

        And there's many women that have
        more muscles than men do.
      

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.530

        So you can't make an absolute
        about this is a female thing,
      

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:24.970

        and this is a male thing.


00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.780

        Yeah, I think she should
        be allowed to race.
      

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.270

        And I'm not afraid
        to race her.
      

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:33.610

        And why are we so threatened
        by men as females?
      

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:34.940

        Why should we be?


00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.440

        And she's not a man,
        she's a woman.
      

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.300

        And people need to
        understand that.
      

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.470

        Now you have a boyfriend?


00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:41.000

        Or no.


00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:41.980

        Now you have a girlfriend now?


00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:42.290

        Neither.


00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:43.420

        Or neither, you're
        just single?
      

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:44.920

        But I don't want to
        choose either.
      

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.240

        Oh, you're not a--


00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.490

        Yeah, I'm sort of--


00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:47.280

        Open?


00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.060

        Whoever comes along.


00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.290

        Right.


00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.620

        And that's a whole different
        issue, sexuality.
      

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:51.290

        It is.


00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.730

        It is.


00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.760

        I don't deny that I
        used to be male.
      

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:58.800

        There's a little part of me that
        loves, that enjoyed being
      

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.590

        male, enjoyed the camaraderie
        that goes along with it and
      

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.770

        the aggression and all that.


00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:07.360

        But that's only part of it and
        I think I'm not a man because
      

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.990

        I enjoy being aggressive.


00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.980

        I'm just an aggressive woman.


00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.900

        I walk around and
        look all strong.
      

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.810

        But I don't have any
        more muscle mass
      

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.120

        than most women so.


00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.520

        And that's a hard thing
        perception-wise for me to
      

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:19.980

        explain to people.


00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.800

        Because all the see is bulk.


00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.870

        Well, let me tell you, you look
        like a female downhiller.
      

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.300

        Exactly.


00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.340

        Funny enough, what you're trying
        to do is opposite of
      

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:28.910

        what I'm trying to.


00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.930

        I'm trying to get more
        testosterone.
      

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.510

        You're trying to lose yours
        and get more estrogen.
      

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.700

        So I can get more muscle mass,
        so I can manipulate my
      

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.480

        hormones naturally, of course.


00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.810

        I don't take steroids.


00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.810

        Keep your chin up, girl.


00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.210

        And just know that you're f--


00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.240

        mowing a huge path
        for other people.
      

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.050

        You're going to make this much
        easier for other people but it
      

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.320

        ain't going to be
        easy for you.
      

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.760

        Maybe you're going to reach your
        goals and be everything
      

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.110

        you want to be.


00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.180

        At the same time, maybe you
        don't and you get close enough
      

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.570

        and the next person is going to
        have it a little easier and
      

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.540

        they're going to be able
        to reach theirs.
      

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.560

        I'm not going to say you're
        not going to results but I
      

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.760

        don't think you're going
        to beat me this year.
      

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.370

        I don't think so.


00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.480

        I'd like to try.


00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.370

        I'd like to see you try too, so
        hopefully it won't be the
      

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.880

        end for me.


00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.340

        I'd like to race with you.


00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:08.120

        Yeah.


00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120

        That'd be cool.


00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.140

        Well, good luck, sweetheart.


00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.390

        You bet.


00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:17.320



00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.610

        After being ceded in a
        qualifying run, the riders
      

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.420

        prepare for their
        final race run.
      

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.270

        If she were to win Canadian
        Nationals, and if I were to
      

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.660

        get second, or third, or any
        if us girls, to stand there
      

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:38.930

        and watch someone, who I feel
        cheated, take the title I'd
      

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.090

        feel awful.


00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.600

        It would really, really
        bother me.
      

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.120

        I actually have a letter that
        I'm distributing here at this
      

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:51.140

        race basically proving the
        advantages that she has.
      

00:28:51.140 --> 00:29:15.260



00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.470

        A bad crash during her race
        run leaves Michelle with a
      

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.390

        disappointing 23rd
        place finish.
      

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:24.630



00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:25.250

        I love downhilling.


00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.030

        I love downhilling.


00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.280

        I love downhilling.


00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.390



00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.540

        That's feels better.


00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.790

        It's nicely padded now.


00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:37.400



00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.540

        It really wasn't my day
        but I'll try again.
      

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.520

        I'm not going away.


00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.140

        I'll be back to the World Cup
        whether it's next year or
      

00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.890

        World Championships this
        year, I don't know.
      

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.290

        But this is so much fun.


00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:57.300



00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.480

        Continuing their fight to have
        Michelle barred from women's
      

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.300

        competition, Sylvie Allen and
        Cassandra Boon circulate a
      

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:07.160

        six-page letter of protest.


00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.510

        Transsexuals should not compete
        in the category
      

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.920

        reserved for natural women.


00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.460

        I put this letter together so
        people can have information.
      

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.900

        If I get a million questions
        at a race, I can just say,
      

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.770

        here you go.


00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.230

        Read this and make
        your own opinion.
      

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.970

        Number three.


00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.760

        Transsexual women are unique
        in terms of athleticism.
      

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.000

        They should be allowed to
        compete in a new category
      

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.200

        called transgender.


00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.410

        Great, I'd be racing
        against myself.
      

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.250

        Forever.


00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.700

        We have to keep on working.


00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.140

        Hopefully this letter will open
        some more eyes and some
      

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.000

        of the top girls have
        voiced their
      

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.540

        opinions about it as well.


00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.530

        We'll see what other things
        happen when more of the
      

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.970

        authorities of sport
        get involved.
      

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:55.630

        Sylvie and Cassandra send the
        letter to the governing bodies
      

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:59.950

        of cycling, the UCI, or
        International Cycling Union,
      

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.440

        and the Canadian Cycling
        Association.
      

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.360



00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.420

        I could tell you that not only
        cycling, but all the sports
      

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.870

        associations, at the Canadian
        level are really careful with
      

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.950

        everything that relates to
        law, that relates to the
      

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:15.770

        athletes' rights.


00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:18.180

        There is in Canada the
        Charter of Rights
      

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.100

        that we have to respect.


00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.000

        And this is for everyone,
        including people who are
      

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.650

        working in sports.


00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:27.200

        I feel like we have no support
        from our cycling associations.
      

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.960

        They're just scared
        to get involved
      

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.010

        because of legal issues.


00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.880

        I'm sorry but my human rights
        are being violated as well.
      

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.190

        Some people might say
        that it's not fair.
      

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.430

        But this is where
        we are at now.
      

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.370

        This is the only decision that
        could be made when it comes to
      

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.820

        voluntary change
        in you gender.
      

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.950

        It's legally recognized.


00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.410

        The person becomes
        legally a woman.
      

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:47.860

        That's it.


00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.180

        And we have to accept it.


00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.290

        The reality is that you're a
        transgender person during
      

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:55.570

        transition.


00:31:55.570 --> 00:32:00.140

        After transition, you're either
        a woman or a man.
      

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.740

        You're not a transgender
        person indefinitely.
      

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.550

        So there can be no transgender
        category.
      

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:10.710

        Is she using this racing as a
        way to prove to the public,
      

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.910

        the world, that I am a woman.


00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.450

        Look at me, I'm on
        a woman's podium.
      

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.620

        I've been given this medal,
        this acknowledgement.
      

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.710

        I'm just wondering what
        her reasons are.
      

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:23.540

        Recognition?


00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.960

        Attention?


00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.600

        It can't be just truly
        for the sport of it.
      

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:33.730



00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.920

        Michelle continues to compete
        throughout the summer.
      

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.240

        Her overall results earn
        her a place on the
      

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.490

        Canadian National Team.


00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:50.610



00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:53.770

        Michelle becomes the first
        openly transgendered woman in
      

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:57.000

        the world to be named to a
        national team in any sport.
      

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.450



00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:05.370

        This sets an international
        precedent.
      

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:07.330

        You have 14 messages.


00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.320

        Wow.


00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.950

        Suddenly, everyone cares.


00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:15.320

        BC TV, CBC, BC Radio.


00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.390



00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.130

        I don't like my hair
        this morning.
      

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.980

        The bruised and banged up legs
        of downhill mountain biker
      

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.760

        Michelle Dumaresq.


00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.220

        She's just won a spot on the
        Canadian women's team.
      

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.110

        But some of her teammates
        don't want her there.
      

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:36.750

        That's because until six years
        ago, Michelle Dumaresq was
      

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.240

        Michael Dumaresq.


00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.250

        Dumaresq says estrogen and
        progesterone treatments have
      

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.380

        left her smaller, less
        muscular, and
      

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:44.970

        hormonally a woman.


00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:47.970

        My results show that I'm in the
        same range as the rest of
      

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.180

        the Canadian women.


00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.960

        And we're not even on the
        same scale when it comes
      

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.600

        internationally.


00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.640

        I don't personally believe
        that I have an advantage.
      

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.890

        If I thought I did,
        my own conscience
      

00:33:58.890 --> 00:33:59.390

        wouldn't let me do this.


00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.360

        We were trying to contact you
        yesterday, which was Saturday.
      

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.350

        Today's Sunday.


00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.600

        That's what I want.


00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.160



00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.570

        Holy cow.


00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:11.890

        That's the second page.


00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:18.380



00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.230

        Cassandra Boon and other team
        are calling on their sports
      

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.830

        governing body to ban Dumaresq
        from competing against women.
      

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:28.020

        I personally just don't believe
        that you can change
      

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.880

        the way that you were born and
        you're completely can turn
      

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.530

        yourself into the other sex.


00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:38.360

        I have a license given to me by
        the International Cycling
      

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.440

        Union to race as a woman because
        that's what I am.
      

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:50.260



00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.040

        You are legally female and yet
        you must take hormones to
      

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.360

        maintain this.


00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.980

        So, where does that put
        the testing committee?
      

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.670

        Estrogen is not a performance
        enhancing drug.
      

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.030

        It isn't?


00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.280

        No.


00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.420



00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.310

        There hasn't been--


00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.560

        They know.


00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.370



00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:13.890

        You are a welder.


00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:14.320

        I am.


00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.400

        Yeah.


00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.400

        Does estrogen help
        in the welding?
      

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.160

        But how do they treat
        you at work?
      

00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.250

        They must know that this
        has all been going on.
      

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.340

        I transitioned on the job,
        in a steel shop.
      

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:25.260

        Oh, yeah.


00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:27.590

        What kind of brave
        soul are you?
      

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:31.360

        I just smile and when you're
        smiling, people
      

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.820

        can't knock you down.


00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.900

        I guess you don't say, break
        a leg to a biker.
      

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.290

        Anyway, nice to meet you.


00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:37.780

        Yes, you too.


00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.270

        [APPLAUSE]


00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:39.520

        Michelle Dumaresq.


00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:46.110



00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.050

        The World Championship is a
        single race that determines
      

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.830

        the fastest rider
        in the world.
      

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:54.170

        For me, the opening ceremonies
        are really
      

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.170

        neat to be apart of.


00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:56.970

        Because we're walking through
        town and stuff and everyone's
      

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:57.940

        applauding, going, "Canada!


00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:03.190

        Canada!"


00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:05.370

        The best part of the whole thing
        was feeling that you're
      

00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:07.840

        in there and that you're a
        chosen part of the team and
      

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.340

        how cool is this?


00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:11.470

        Here we are.


00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:14.250

        There was probably two points
        actually where there was a
      

00:36:14.250 --> 00:36:17.280

        little tear in the
        eye, overwhelmed.
      

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.010

        I'm just sort of realizing that
        this is as big as it gets
      

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.260

        for my sport.


00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.660



00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.200

        I don't think there's ever
        been a conflict between
      

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.060

        Michelle and I at all.


00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.550

        We get along great besides the
        fact that we have differences
      

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.890

        in opinion on the racing.


00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.320

        We've talked about it.


00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.160

        Michelle knows where I stand
        with regards to it.
      

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:43.260

        And she accepts the fact
        that I don't agree.
      

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.060

        And I believe she doesn't
        hold it against me.
      

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:49.080

        And I don't hold
        it against her.
      

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.440



00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.150

        The UCI has ruled in favor of
        Michelle and that's the way
      

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:59.300

        it's going to be and people have
        to learn to live with it
      

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.780

        and get on with life.


00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:29.780



00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.710

        Michelle has a mechanical
        failure during the race and
      

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.860

        places 25th.


00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:36.770

        I'm just happy to have--
        to come to the World
      

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.950

        Championships, just to be part
        of the Canadian team.
      

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.970

        Amazing, amazing experiences.


00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.680

        This is racing.


00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.280

        It happens.


00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.380

        It just happens to
        be a big race.
      

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.420

        But just to be part of
        this is incredible.
      

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.670

        I'm so lucky.


00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.940



00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.580

        Going to a race and being stared
        at and pointed at,
      

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:57.430

        doesn't bother me that much.


00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:01.620

        It's the friendship stuff that
        is most painful, to know the
      

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:07.490

        people who I've love and
        appreciate and respect
      

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:13.020

        disagree with me on a
        really deep level.
      

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:18.380

        Kelli still has some issues with
        me racing and it's by no
      

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:21.720

        means really resolved.


00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:23.880

        It's a really controversial
        issue.
      

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.050

        It's really hard on
        me personally.
      

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:30.920

        I'm not really at the point
        where I feel that she should
      

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.870

        be allowed to race and she knows
        that and I know that.
      

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:38.120

        It's not a secret.


00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.060



00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.410

        Our relationship's not
        going to be the same.
      

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.880

        Maybe one day, but right
        now it's so sad.
      

00:38:47.880 --> 00:39:00.060



00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:03.180

        With international media
        exposure, Michelle finds
      

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:08.710

        herself being discussed online
        in chat rooms and web forums.
      

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.510

        She also starts getting emails
        from complete strangers.
      

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:16.090



00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:16.890

        Hello, Michelle.


00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.130

        We have never met although
        we do have a
      

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.110

        mutual riding friend.


00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.890

        I saw you on television last
        night and, wow, can you ride.
      

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:24.770

        You've obviously worked very
        hard at this sport and I hope
      

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:26.650

        that you will not let the
        negativity and obvious
      

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:29.220

        jealousy of a couple
        of other gals deter
      

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.260

        you from being yourself.


00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.740

        I wish I could be there to cheer
        you on, my dear girl.
      

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.690

        That's pretty special.


00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:39.740

        I get hundreds of letters
        like this, from people
      

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.010

        all over the world.


00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.990

        Since I'm not out of my team or
        really much out anywhere,
      

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:46.060

        I'm scared.


00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.430

        But I figured if you and
        Marie and others can
      

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:51.870

        be out, so can I.


00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:55.930

        It's nice sometimes to be
        acknowledged, have the backing
      

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.060

        and people going, yeah, you
        are doing the right thing.
      

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.780



00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.340

        The reality is that there was
        no role model for me.
      

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.890

        I wanted someone to say
        that you'll be OK.
      

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:12.770

        Or even give me indication
        that there was hope.
      

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.840

        And there's nobody.


00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.260

        Naturally, my role models
        would come from
      

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.690

        the sporting world.


00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:22.670

        And there just isn't a lot
        who share my history.
      

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:25.930

        The first transsexual athlete
        to achieve widespread
      

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:28.980

        notoriety was Renee Richards,
        who formerly played
      

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.260

        professional tennis
        as Richard Raskin.
      

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.740

        In the 1970s, Renee Richards
        went to the Supreme Court to
      

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:40.130

        fight for and win the right
        to play in the US Open.
      

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:43.740

        After almost 15 years of media
        silence, she commented to a
      

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:47.990

        National Post reporter
        on Michelle's story.
      

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:52.070

        She came out saying that I
        should cease and desist, and
      

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.430

        that I'm fighting
        a losing battle.
      

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.590

        And even if I do
        win, I'll lose.
      

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:57.610

        That really hit home.


00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.630

        I was quite shocked at that
        because that was 25 years ago.
      

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.900

        The world's a much different
        place now.
      

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.800

        She's someone who, for whatever
        reason, had surgery
      

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.340

        done and she says it
        destroyed her life.
      

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.790

        And now she's speaking
        out against me.
      

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:17.570

        I'm doing my thing.


00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:18.720

        If I make mistakes, fine.


00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.390

        They're my mistakes.


00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:22.390

        The more I learn about her, the
        more I don't want to be
      

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:23.640

        compared to her.


00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.290



00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:31.830

        I'm still scared to death that
        somehow I've maybe made the
      

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.510

        wrong decision by stepping out
        into the public environment
      

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.260

        and going, yeah, I'm trans.


00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.190

        And I race bikes and I
        want to be winning
      

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:44.670

        on a World Cup level.


00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.390

        If anyone thinks that I've
        figured it out, I haven't.
      

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:49.280



00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.880

        I'm strictly going
        by instinct.
      

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:59.810



00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:06.360

        Other trans athletes emailing
        me say, Michelle, help.
      

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.670

        How did you do this?


00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:10.460

        How did you face everyone?


00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.550

        I can't do it.


00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.130

        I can't.


00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.780

        I don't have the strength
        or the courage.
      

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.810

        And I write back, Look,
        yes, you do.
      

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:19.130

        If you want it bad enough,
        you'll do it.
      

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:25.730



00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.420

        Michelle trains hard in the off
        season, hoping to take her
      

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.080

        racing to the next level.


00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.220

        If she's successful, she may
        be able to attract a major
      

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.810

        sponsor, which she'll need to
        achieve her new dream of
      

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:38.610

        turning pro and making mountain


00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.570

        bike racing her career.


00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:46.930



00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.910

        This year, my body is
        in the right place.
      

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.640

        I'm feeling strong.


00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.850

        The outcome is going to
        be, I hope, podium.
      

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.270

        That's the goal.


00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:00.740

        If I'm first, I'll be--


00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.510



00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.760

        We'll see.


00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.250



00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:12.020

        This is no longer about Michelle
        racing locally and
      

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.590

        winning a couple
        of local races.
      

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:18.080

        This is about Michelle racing
        in the World Cup circuit.
      

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.920

        When you're a professional
        athlete, everything's taken
      

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.020

        into consideration.


00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:24.300

        Sponsors, this is
        business now.
      

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.550

        Let's go racing.


00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.470



00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.270

        Michelle prepares for the World
        Cup on Grouse Mountain
      

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:36.100

        in her hometown of Vancouver.


00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.700

        In top form from winter
        training, and with a hometown
      

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.960

        advantage, Michelle stands her
        best chance yet at reaching
      

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.290

        the podium at an international
        race.
      

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:47.570



00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:49.990

        If ever there was my kind
        of course, this is it.
      

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.330

        This is the terrain that I'm
        used to, the soil conditions
      

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.900

        I'm used to.


00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.970

        It's full-on.


00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.410

        It's rough.


00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.040

        It's fast. It's got
        everything.
      

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.470

        And it's here.


00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.390

        In Vancouver.


00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.680

        Michelle's most vocal opponents,
        Sylvie and
      

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.840

        Cassandra retired from racing
        at the end of last season.
      

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.780

        While the atmosphere is now
        friendlier, most of Michelle's
      

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.700

        competitors still have
        mixed feelings.
      

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:19.990



00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:22.000

        I'm going to be friends
        with her.
      

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:22.820

        She helps out.


00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.420

        She you shows you
        lines and stuff.
      

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:32.890

        I respect her in so many ways
        but as far as results go, if
      

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.820

        she wins or loses, doesn't
        matter to me.
      

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:37.070

        It's still unfair.


00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.300



00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.360

        It's a very interesting
        dichotomy
      

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.050

        between, go, Michelle!


00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:47.210

        And, God damn, couldn't
        you just go away?
      

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:52.260



00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.610

        I think Michelle is an
        excellent champion.
      

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:58.360

        It's nice to see her do well
        because it'll raise the issue,
      

00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.610

        bring it to head again.


00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:10.320



00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.380

        I don't want to lose perspective
        on this.
      

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.570

        I realize that even though
        everyone's being very friendly
      

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:17.570

        now, if I podium and
        it very well could
      

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:19.970

        be a different story.


00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:24.900

        It's when you're a threat,
        that's when people react.
      

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.470

        I expect to be top five.


00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:30.110

        I just need to have everything
        go my way.
      

00:45:30.110 --> 00:46:43.890



00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.140

        Rider down.


00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:52.990



00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:54.240

        [APPLAUSE]


00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:20.260



00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:25.590

        55.64


00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:26.660

        Bolts on my stem.


00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.820

        They hold my bars on the bike
        came loose as I was riding
      

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.370

        down the run.


00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:33.370

        And the bars kept dropping
        and dropping.
      

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.550

        So they were down to where I
        couldn't brake any longer.
      

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:44.030



00:47:44.030 --> 00:48:02.490

        Slowed down by her crash,
        Michelle finishes dead last.
      

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:06.850

        It's just a race but I've got
        a couple of hundred people
      

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:09.570

        that I know on this mountain
        that are cheering for me.
      

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.260



00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.010

        And now I'm going to run away
        before they all come up here
      

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:15.260

        and go, how was your race?


00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:36.170



00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:37.650

        I need to go.


00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:53.620



00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:56.500

        There was a lot of negative
        energy coming from some of the
      

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.520

        circuit last year.
      

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:01.190



00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:03.740

        And I really don't think
        that it was coming
      

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.890

        from a place of knowledge.


00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:06.860

        I think it was just coming
        from a place
      

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.600

        of emotion and anger.


00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:18.360



00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.220

        I've done a lot of growing and a
        lot of learning and a lot of
      

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.380

        looking into gender.


00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:27.840

        And I've come to some
        places with it.
      

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:31.660

        I still think that there
        are places there
      

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.940

        it's just not fair.


00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:39.760

        But at the same time, we're
        placed in society where all we
      

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.860

        have is two genders and
        you're either one
      

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:42.840

        or you're the other.


00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.990

        And right now, she is a woman.


00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.680

        She's legally labeled a woman.


00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:51.220

        There's no other place for her
        and she's a talented woman.
      

00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.560

        I believe that she's really
        teaching a lot of people out
      

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.670

        there right now and I happen
        to be one of them.

        After her devastating crash at
        Grouse Mountain, Michelle has
      

00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:36.840

        one more chance to
        attract attention
      

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.100

        from potential sponsors.

        will be tough.

        accomplishments.
      

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:59.480

        I think she's taken on a pretty
        tremendous challenge.
      

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:00.730

        It's very exciting.

        back from Claire

        and seven back Michelle.

        I didn't have a perfect run.


00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:37.210

        This means I go to Europe.

        It's kind of neat.


00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.770

        won because she's

        very fast, very strong.

        testing in 2000, the
      

00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:17.800

        International Olympic Committee
        had no official
      

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:21.190

        policy on transsexual
        athletes.
      

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:26.440

        In May 2004, the IOC finally
        ruled on the question.
      

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.310

        Athletes who have completed
        gender reassignment are now
      

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:31.180

        eligible to compete
        in the Olympics.
      

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.460



00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:38.020

        I just happened to be the
        one who stood up and
      

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:39.010

        said, I want to race.


00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.260

        I want to play too.


00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.440



00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:43.690

        Everyone else gets
        to, why can't I?
      

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:53.400



00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:58.900

        I sincerely hope that in all
        of this, that some kid is
      

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:01.060

        going to see my story.


00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:05.820

        And go, if Michelle can do
        it, I can do it too.
      

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:07.720

        She's still smiling.
