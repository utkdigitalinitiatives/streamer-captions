00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270


2
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.300
I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,

3
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.270
Or whether he be 'scaped away or no

4
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.130
From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:

5
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.400
Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;

6
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.300
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;

7
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.170
Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard

8
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.330
The happy tidings of his good escape.

9
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.030
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?

10
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.870
I cannot joy, until I be resolved

11
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.300
Where our right valiant father is become.

12
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.500
I saw him in the battle range about;

13
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.900
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.

14
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.630
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop

15
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.470
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;

16
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.930
Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,

17
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.400
Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,

18
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.370
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.

19
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.230
So fared our father with his enemies;

20
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.070
So fled his enemies my warlike father:

21
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.570
Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.

22
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.200
See how the morning opes her golden gates,

23
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.770
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!

24
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.330
How well resembles it the prime of youth,

25
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.200
Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!

26
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.570
Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?

27
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.870
Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;

28
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.870
Not separated with the racking clouds,

29
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.200
But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.

30
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.970
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,

31
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.230
As if they vow'd some league inviolable:

32
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.830
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.

33
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.530
In this the heaven figures some event.

34
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.300
'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.

35
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.630
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,

36
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.500
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,

37
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.670
Each one already blazing by our meeds,

38
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.730
Should notwithstanding join our lights together

39
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.770
And over-shine the earth as this the world.

40
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.630
Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear

41
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.600
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.

42
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.670
Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,

43
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.270
You love the breeder better than the male.

44
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.370
But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell

45
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.400
Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?

46
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.730
Ah, one that was a woful looker-on

47
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.170
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,

48
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.070
Your princely father and my loving lord!

49
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.700
O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.

50
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.870
Say how he died, for I will hear it all.

51
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.830
Environed he was with many foes,

52
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.570
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy

53
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.800
Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.

54
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.600
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;

55
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.000
And many strokes, though with a little axe,

56
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.330
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.

57
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.400
By many hands your father was subdued;

58
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.100
But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm

59
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.430
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,

60
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.230
Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,

61
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.670
Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,

62
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.730
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks

63
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.370
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood

64
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.230
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:

65
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.970
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,

66
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.030
They took his head, and on the gates of York

67
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.700
They set the same; and there it doth remain,

68
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.070
The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.

69
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.200
Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,

70
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.170
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.

71
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.670
O Clifford, savage Clifford! thou hast slain

72
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.330
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;

73
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.470
And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,

74
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.230
For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.

75
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.870
Now my soul's palace is become a prison:

76
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.570
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body

77
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.070
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!

78
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.430
For never henceforth shall I joy again,

79
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.570
Never, O never shall I see more joy!

80
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.930
I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture

81
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.230
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:

82
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.430
Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;

83
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.430
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal

84
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.500
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,

85
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.130
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.

86
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.100
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:

87
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.470
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me

88
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.570
Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,

89
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.300
Or die renowned by attempting it.

90
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.170
His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;

91
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.130
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.

92
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.130
Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,

93
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.970
Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:

94
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.700
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;

95
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.100
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.

96
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.530
(drums sound)

97
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.330
How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?

98
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.070
Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount

99
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:02.300
Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance

100
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.330
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,

101
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.200
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.

102
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.270
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!

103
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.500
O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,

104
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.970
Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,

105
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.730
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.

106
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.500
Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;

107
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.600
And now, to add more measure to your woes,

108
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.830
I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.

109
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.530
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,

110
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.570
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,

111
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.430
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,

112
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.130
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.

113
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.530
I, then in London keeper of the king,

114
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.030
Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,

115
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.100
And very well appointed, as I thought,

116
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.630
March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,

117
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.070
Bearing the king in my behalf along;

118
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.530
For by my scouts I was advertised

119
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.030
That she was coming with a full intent

120
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.330
To dash our late decree in parliament

121
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.270
Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.

122
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:50.070
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met

123
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:56.530
Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:

124
00:08:56.530 --> 00:09:01.200
But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,

125
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.800
Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,

126
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.370
That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;

127
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.600
Or whether 'twas report of her success;

128
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.430
Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,

129
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.830
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,

130
00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:23.570
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,

131
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.900
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;

132
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.800
Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,

133
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.600
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,

134
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.670
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.

135
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:43.930
I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,

136
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.800
With promise of high pay and great rewards:

137
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:55.130
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,

138
00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:01.670
And we in them no hope to win the day;

139
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:07.900
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;

140
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.300
My Lord the Duke of Norfolk and myself,

141
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.430
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:

142
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.530
For in the marches here we heard you were,

143
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.730
Making another head to fight again.

144
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.270
Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?

145
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.230
Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;

146
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:31.900
'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:

147
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.400
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,

148
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.330
But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.

149
00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:46.070
Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;

150
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.470
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine

151
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.870
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,

152
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.330
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,

153
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.200
Were he as famous and as bold in war

154
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.630
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.

155
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.230
I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:

156
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:09.800
'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.

157
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.400
But in this troublous time what's to be done?

158
00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:16.800
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,

159
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.000
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,

160
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.930
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?

161
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:23.630
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes

162
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.400
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?

163
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.830
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.

164
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.330
Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;

165
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:40.700
And therefore comes my brother Montague.

166
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:49.270
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,

167
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.600
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,

168
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.470
And of their feather many more proud birds,

169
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.930
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.

170
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.170
He swore consent to your succession,

171
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.570
His oath enrolled in the parliament;

172
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.530
And now to London all the crew are gone,

173
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:04.570
To frustrate both his oath and what beside

174
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.470
May make against the house of Lancaster.

175
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:14.830
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:

176
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:19.130
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,

177
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.130
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,

178
00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:24.230
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,

179
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.970
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,

180
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.230
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,

181
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.370
And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'

182
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.330
But never once again turn back and fly.

183
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.170
Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:

184
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.370
Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,

185
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.670
That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.

186
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.500
Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;

187
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.270
And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--

188
00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:59.330
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!

189
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.500
No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:

190
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:07.670
The next degree is England's royal throne;

191
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.100
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd

192
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.500
In every borough as we pass along;

193
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.270
And he that throws not up his cap for joy

194
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.130
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.

195
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:27.700
King Edward, George, brave Richard, Montague,

196
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.270
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,

197
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.970
But sound the trumpets, and about our task.

198
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.900
Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,

199
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.030
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,

200
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.430
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.

201
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.170
Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!

202
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.770
(drums sound) (group screams) God and St. George!

203
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.900
How now! what news?

204
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.600
The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,

205
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.330
The queen is coming with a puissant host;

206
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.700
And craves your company for speedy counsel.

207
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:04.300
Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.

208
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:18.500
(drums pounding, trumpet blaring)

209
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.400
Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.

210
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.330
Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy

211
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.800
That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:

212
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.830
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?

213
00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.830
Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:

214
00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:56.900
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.

215
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.400
Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,

216
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.370
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.

217
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.070
My gracious liege, this too much lenity

218
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.400
And harmful pity must be laid aside.

219
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.800
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?

220
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.930
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.

221
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.230
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?

222
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.600
Not his that spoils her young before her face.

223
00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.270
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?

224
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:32.070
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.

225
00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:35.370
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,

226
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.830
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.

227
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.970
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,

228
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:46.730
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:

229
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.500
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,

230
00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.770
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;

231
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:57.470
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,

232
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.600
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,

233
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.570
Which argued thee a most unloving father.

234
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.600
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;

235
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.530
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,

236
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.930
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,

237
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.800
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings

238
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.700
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,

239
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.700
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,

240
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:22.400
Offer their own lives in their young's defence?

241
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.870
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!

242
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.400
Were it not pity that this goodly boy

243
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.600
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,

244
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.800
And long hereafter say unto his child,

245
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.870
'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got

246
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.570
My careless father fondly gave away'?

247
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:49.970
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;

248
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.230
And let his manly face, which promiseth

249
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.200
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart

250
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.500
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.

251
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.500
Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,

252
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.830
Inferring arguments of mighty force.

253
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.030
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear

254
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.200
That things ill-got had ever bad success?

255
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.830
I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;

256
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.000
And would my father had left me no more!

257
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.970
For all the rest is held at such a rate

258
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.600
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep

259
00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.400
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.

260
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.830
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know

261
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.930
How it doth grieve me that thy head stands here!

262
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:45.730
My lord, cheer up your spirits: your foes are nigh,

263
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.600
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.

264
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.730
You promised knighthood to our forward son:

265
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.770
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.

266
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.900
Edward, kneel down.

267
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.770
Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;

268
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.600
And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.

269
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.100
My gracious father, by your kingly leave,

270
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.530
I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,

271
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.600
And in that quarrel use it to the death.

272
00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.170
Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.

273
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.930
Royal commanders, be in readiness:

274
00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.270
For with a band of thirty thousand men comes Warwick,

275
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.700
backing of the Duke of York;

276
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.930
And in the towns, as they do march along,

277
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:36.130
Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:

278
00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.400
Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.

279
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.030
I would your highness would depart the field:

280
00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.670
The queen hath best success when you are absent.

281
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:43.730
Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.

282
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.770
Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.

283
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:49.430
Be it with resolution then to fight.

284
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.730
My royal father, cheer these noble lords

285
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.670
And hearten those that fight in your defence:

286
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.970
Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'

287
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.500
Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,

288
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.000
And set thy diadem upon my head;

289
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.870
Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?

290
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:27.100
Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!

291
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.730
Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms

292
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.800
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?

293
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.330
I am his king, and he should bow his knee;

294
00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.800
I was adopted heir by his consent:

295
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.570
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,

296
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.070
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,

297
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.130
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,

298
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.300
To blot out me, and put his own son in.

299
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.370
And reason too:

300
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.870
Who should succeed the father but the son?

301
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.770
Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!

302
00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.100
Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,

303
00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.230
Or any he the proudest of thy sort.

304
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.930
'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?

305
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:06.170
Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.

306
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.730
For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.

307
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.670
What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?

308
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:17.470
Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?

309
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.970
When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,

310
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.670
Your legs did better service than your hands.

311
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:26.770
Then 'twas my turn to flee, and now 'tis thine.

312
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.100
You said so much before, and yet you fled.

313
00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.330
'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.

314
00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:35.430
No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.

315
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.970
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain

316
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.470
The execution of my big-swoln heart

317
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.870
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.

318
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.730
I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?

319
00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:48.370
Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,

320
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.030
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;

321
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.370
But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.

322
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.830
Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.

323
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.870
Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.

324
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.530
I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:

325
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.170
I am a king, and privileged to speak.

326
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.830
My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here

327
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.270
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.

328
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:08.900
Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:

329
00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.030
By him that made us all, I am resolved

330
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.070
that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.

331
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.530
Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?

332
00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:19.670
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,

333
00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.770
That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.

334
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.600
If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;

335
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.470
For York in justice puts his armour on.

336
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.730
If that be right which Warwick says is right,

337
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.630
There is no wrong, but every thing is right.

338
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.270
Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;

339
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.970
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.

340
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.830
But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;

341
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.730
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,

342
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.170
Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,

343
00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:51.630
As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.

344
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.930
Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,

345
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.670
Whose father bears the title of a king,--

346
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.100
As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--

347
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.830
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,

348
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:06.030
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?

349
00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.500
A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,

350
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.900
To make this shameless callet know herself.

351
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.170
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,

352
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.730
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;

353
00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.900
And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd

354
00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.600
By that false woman, as this king by thee.

355
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.330
His father revell'd in the heart of France,

356
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.000
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;

357
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.630
And had he match'd according to his state,

358
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.400
He might have kept that glory to this day;

359
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.070
But when he took a beggar to his bed,

360
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.730
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,

361
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.630
Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,

362
00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:48.930
That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,

363
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:52.100
And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.

364
00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.500
For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?

365
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.670
Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;

366
00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:00.600
And we, in pity of the gentle king,

367
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.830
Had slipp'd our claim until another age.

368
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:05.100
But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,

369
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.800
And that thy summer bred us no increase,

370
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.830
We set the axe to thy usurping root;

371
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.830
And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,

372
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.170
Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,

373
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:16.370
We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,

374
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.930
Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.

375
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.570
And, in this resolution, I defy thee;

376
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.100
Not willing any longer conference,

377
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.100
Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.

378
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:27.030
Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!

379
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.270
And either victory, or else a grave.

380
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.330
Stay, Edward.

381
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:32.370
No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:

382
00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.370
These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.

383
00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:45.400
(drums sound)

384
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:56.170
(drums sound)

385
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.830
(canons boom)

386
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.900
Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,

387
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.970
I lay me down a little while to breathe;

388
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.130
For strokes received, and many blows repaid,

389
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.870
Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,

390
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:16.400
And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.

391
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:25.230
Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!

392
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:29.430
For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.

393
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.430
How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?

394
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:33.870
Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;

395
00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.370
Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:

396
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.430
What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?

397
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.830
Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;

398
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.000
And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.

399
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.470
Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?

400
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:49.730
Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,

401
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.800
Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;

402
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.630
And in the very pangs of death he cried,

403
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:58.770
Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,

404
00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:03.100
'Warwick, revenge! my son, revenge my death!'

405
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.400
So, underneath the belly of their steeds,

406
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.500
That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,

407
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.670
The noble Salisbury gave up the ghost.

408
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.870
Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:

409
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:27.000
I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.

410
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.470
Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,

411
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:39.030
Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;

412
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.570
And look upon, as if the tragedy

413
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:46.700
Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?

414
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.270
Here on my knee I vow to God above,

415
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.130
I'll never pause again, never stand still,

416
00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.730
Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine

417
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:00.170
Or fortune given me measure of revenge.

418
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.430
O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;

419
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.570
And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!

420
00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.370
And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,

421
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:14.170
I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,

422
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:17.830
Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,

423
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.370
Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands

424
00:27:19.370 --> 00:27:22.270
That to my foes this body must be prey,

425
00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.700
Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,

426
00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.530
And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!

427
00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:37.270
Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,

428
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:39.770
Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.

429
00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:44.500
Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,

430
00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.630
Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:

431
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:54.170
Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.

432
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.000
Yet let us all together to our troops,

433
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.470
And give them leave to fly that will not stay;

434
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.870
This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;

435
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:04.230
For yet is hope of life and victory.

436
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.500
Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.

437
00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:22.870
Clifford! Clifford!

438
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:40.900
Richard! Richard!

439
00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.300
Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:

440
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.830
Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,

441
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.770
And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,

442
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.330
Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.

443
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:57.030
Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:

444
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.930
This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;

445
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:05.200
And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;

446
00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.270
And here's the heart that triumphs in their death

447
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:13.100
And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother

448
00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.770
To execute the like upon thyself;

449
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.200
And so, have at thee!

450
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:22.470
Nay Warwick, single out some other chase;

451
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.630
For I myself will hunt this wolf to death.

452
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:38.600
(drums sound. bugles blaring. clanging swords)

453
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:28.030
This battle fares like to the morning's war,

454
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:31.730
When dying clouds contend with growing light,

455
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.870
What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,

456
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:38.500
Can neither call it perfect day nor night.

457
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.430
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea

458
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.730
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;

459
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.370
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea

460
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:50.230
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:

461
00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:53.730
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;

462
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.070
Now one the better, then another best;

463
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:58.230
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,

464
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:02.570
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:

465
00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:06.830
So is the equal poise of this fell war.

466
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:18.300
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.

467
00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:22.700
To whom God will, there be the victory!

468
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:25.700
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,

469
00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.170
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both

470
00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:31.800
They prosper best of all when I am thence.

471
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.070
Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;

472
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:43.900
For what is in this world but grief and woe?

473
00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.130
O God! methinks it were a happy life,

474
00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.930
To be no better than a homely swain;

475
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:55.730
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,

476
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.530
To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,

477
00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:02.130
Thereby to see the minutes how they run,

478
00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.330
How many make the hour full complete;

479
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.770
How many hours bring about the day;

480
00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:11.800
How many days will finish up the year;

481
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.830
How many years a mortal man may live.

482
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:21.170
When this is known, then to divide the times:

483
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:24.830
So many hours must I tend my flock;

484
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.230
So many hours must I take my rest;

485
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.570
So many hours must I contemplate;

486
00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:36.400
So many hours must I sport myself;

487
00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.400
So many days my ewes have been with young;

488
00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.530
So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:

489
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:49.330
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:

490
00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:54.900
So minutes, hours, days, weeks,  months, and years,

491
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.370
Pass'd over to the end they were created,

492
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:04.870
Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.

493
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:11.200
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!

494
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.330
Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade

495
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:16.500
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,

496
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.270
Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy

497
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:23.500
To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?

498
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:28.300
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.

499
00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:33.800
And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,

500
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.430
His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.

501
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:40.900
His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,

502
00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:44.570
All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,

503
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.330
Is far beyond a prince's delicates,

504
00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.370
His viands sparkling in a golden cup,

505
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.300
His body couched in a curious bed,

506
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.030
When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.

507
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.400
Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.

508
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:19.030
This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,

509
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:23.330
May be possessed with some store of crowns;

510
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.770
And I, that haply take them from him now,

511
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.230
May yet ere night yield both my life and them

512
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:32.430
To some man else, as this dead man doth me.

513
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.470
Who's this?

514
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.370
O God! it is my father's face,

515
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:58.930
Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.

516
00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:02.000
O heavy times, begetting such events!

517
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:09.370
From London by the king was I press'd forth;

518
00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.930
My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,

519
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:16.130
Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;

520
00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:23.430
And I, who at his hands received my life,

521
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.870
Have by my hands of life bereaved him.

522
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:36.300
Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!

523
00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:44.400
And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!

524
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.830
My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;

525
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:55.170
And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.

526
00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.470
O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!

527
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.630
Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,

528
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.200
Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.

529
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.770
Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;

530
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.970
And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,

531
00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:14.030
Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.

532
00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:27.130
Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,

533
00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:29.730
Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:

534
00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:35.130
For I have bought it with an hundred blows.

535
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:47.000
But let me see: is this our foeman's face?

536
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:54.330
Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!

537
00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:59.530
Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,

538
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:07.230
Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,

539
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:11.330
Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,

540
00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:15.970
Upon thy wounds, that kills mine eye and heart!

541
00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:21.400
O, pity, God, this miserable age!

542
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:24.100
What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,

543
00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.200
Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,

544
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.500
This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!

545
00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:35.830
O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,

546
00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:39.630
And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!

547
00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:44.100
Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!

548
00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.470
O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!

549
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:51.770
O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!

550
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.870
The red rose and the white are on his face,

551
00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:59.400
The fatal colours of our striving houses:

552
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:03.470
The one his purple blood right well resembles;

553
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:10.000
The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:

554
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.200
Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;

555
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.730
If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.

556
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.830
How will my mother for a father's death

557
00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:21.730
Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!

558
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.900
How will my wife for slaughter of my son

559
00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.170
Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!

560
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:29.300
How will the country for these woful chances

561
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.670
Misthink the king and not be satisfied!

562
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:35.730
Was ever son so rued a father's death?

563
00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.570
Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?

564
00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:43.130
Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?

565
00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:48.070
Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.

566
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:51.330
I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.

567
00:39:56.070 --> 00:40:00.300
These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;

568
00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.970
My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,

569
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:09.830
For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;

570
00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:15.030
My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;

571
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:18.700
And so obsequious will thy father be,

572
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.530
Even for the loss of thee, having no more,

573
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:27.770
As Priam was for all his valiant sons.

574
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:35.800
I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,

575
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:41.930
For I have murdered where I should not kill.

576
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.470
Sad-hearted men, much overgone with care,

577
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:55.830
Here sits a king more woful than you are.

578
00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.900
Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,

579
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.700
And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:

580
00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.600
Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.

581
00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.770
Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:

582
00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:11.830
Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds

583
00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:13.900
Having the fearful flying hare in sight,

584
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.730
With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,

585
00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:20.770
And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,

586
00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.530
Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.

587
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:26.300
Away! for vengeance comes along with them:

588
00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.270
Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;

589
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.800
Or else come after: I'll away before.

590
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.770
Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:

591
00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:42.430
Not that I fear to stay, but love to go

592
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:47.770
Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!

593
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:53.670


594
00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:35.800
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,

595
00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:42.470
Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.

596
00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.770
O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow

597
00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:52.470
More than my body's parting with my soul!

598
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:58.100
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;

599
00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:04.500
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.

600
00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:13.830
Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,

601
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:20.630
The common people swarm like summer flies;

602
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:25.530
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?

603
00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:29.300
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?

604
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:38.770
O, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,

605
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.700
Or as thy father and his father did,

606
00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:45.330
Giving no ground unto the house of York,

607
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:51.700
They never then had sprung like summer flies;

608
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:58.000
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm

609
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.200
Had left no mourning widows for our death;

610
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.970
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.

611
00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:13.570
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?

612
00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:19.770
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?

613
00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:30.170
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;

614
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:36.270
No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:

615
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:40.400
The foe is merciless, and will not pity;

616
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:45.200
For at their hands I have deserved no pity.

617
00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:52.330
The air hath got into my deadly wounds,

618
00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:58.300
And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.

619
00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:04.270
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;

620
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:09.030
I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.

621
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:14.700
Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,

622
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:21.430
And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.

623
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.630
Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,

624
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:34.600
That led calm Henry, though he were a king,

625
00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:40.070
No, 'tis impossible he should escape,

626
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.800
For, though before his face I speak the words

627
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.800
Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:

628
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.130
And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.

629
00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:55.600
(sound of someone's last exhale)

630
00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:03.130
Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?

631
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.070
A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.

632
00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.600
See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,

633
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:15.270
If friend or foe, let him be gently used.

634
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:21.530
Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;

635
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:27.170
Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch

636
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:30.900
In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,

637
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.330
But set his murdering knife unto the root

638
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:37.300
From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,

639
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:41.130
I mean our princely father, Duke of York.

640
00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.770
From off the gates of York fetch down the head,

641
00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:53.900
Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;

642
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.700
Instead whereof let this supply the room:

643
00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.130
Measure for measure must be answered.

644
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.200
Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,

645
00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.700
That nothing sung but death to us and ours:

646
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.530
Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,

647
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:17.230
And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.

648
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.500
I think his understanding is bereft.

649
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:25.530
Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?

650
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.330
Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,

651
00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.770
And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.

652
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:36.570
O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:

653
00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:38.130
'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,

654
00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:40.000
Because he would avoid such bitter taunts

655
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.270
Which in the time of death he gave our father.

656
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:46.630
If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.

657
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:49.370
Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.

658
00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:51.930
Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.

659
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.800
Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.

660
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.500
While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.

661
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.830
Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.

662
00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:02.400
Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.

663
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.430
Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?

664
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:08.730
They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.

665
00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:12.800
What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard

666
00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.200
When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.

667
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:21.870
I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,

668
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.370
If this right hand would buy two hour's life,

669
00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:27.230
That I in all despite might rail at him,

670
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.600
This hand should chop it off, and with it issuing blood

671
00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.370
Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst

672
00:49:32.370 --> 00:49:36.230
York and young Rutland could not satisfy.

673
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:46.370
Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,

674
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:48.900
And rear it in the place your father's stands.

675
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:56.270
And now to London with triumphant march,

676
00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:01.630
There to be crowned England's royal king:

677
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:04.930
From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,

678
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.330
And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:

679
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:10.600
So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;

680
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.600
And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread

681
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.030
The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;

682
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:18.570
For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,

683
00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:22.570
Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.

684
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:24.800
First will I see the coronation;

685
00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:26.800
And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,

686
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:30.630
To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.

687
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:34.430
Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;

688
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.530
For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,

689
00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:40.100
And never will I undertake the thing

690
00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.170
Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.

691
00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:52.070
Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,

692
00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:56.530
And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,

693
00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.070
Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.

694
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.070
Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;

695
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.870
For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.

696
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.230
Tut, that's a foolish observation:

697
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.600
Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,

698
00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.270
To see these honours in possession.

699
00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.730
