<i>Emotions and the adult brain.</i>

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.330
MAN:
Why do we have these emotions?

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.230
What are they for?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.260
WOMAN:
There's no empathy or sympathy.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.060
He just can't get that feeling.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.000
WOMAN 2:
Deadness, terror,
distorted time.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.100
I did not want to live.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.300

NARRATOR:
"I wake to sleep,
and take my waking slow.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.760
"I feel my fate
in what I cannot fear.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.600
I learn by going
where I have to go."

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.430
"We think by feeling.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.630
"What is there to know?

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.160
"I hear my being dance
from ear to ear.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.500
"I wake to sleep,
and take my waking slow.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.700
I learn by going
where I have to go."

The adult brain
crowned by the cerebral cortex.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.460
A wrinkled mass of tissue just a
fraction of a centimeter thick.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.230
Within its furrows
lie our powers

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.960
to reason, judge, understand.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.530
But buried beneath
is an unconscious underworld--

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.730
a cluster of structures

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.030
that drives our appetites,
moods and emotions.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.130
MAN:
For a long time, it was thought
the brain was divided into two.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.960
Emotion was one thing
and thought was something else,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.860
and these were two things

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.700
that were interfering
with each other.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.330
But it's now clear

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.830
that this division was wrong,
just completely wrong.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.660
(<i> toddler cooing, giggling</i> )

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.900
WOMAN:
There's a highly choreographed,
hardwired relationship

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.260
between the thinking areas
of the brain

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.360
and the feeling areas
of the brain.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.430
One affects the other
at all times.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.600
MAN:
It is not possible to have a
properly working reason system

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.330
without having a properly
working emotion system.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.700
What you think, what you create,
the problems you solve,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.060
the way you reason
don't exist in a vacuum.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.830
There is always a backdrop
of emotion and feeling.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.460
We are not thinking machines.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.600
We are feeling machines
that think.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.830
WOMAN:
It's been 23 years
since he suffered the stroke.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.600
It was just horrible.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.360
I just felt like I had
totally lost my best friend.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.060
I wanted to bring him back
to the person that he was

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.300
but, you know, in reality
I should have known I couldn't.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.200
The doctor said to me,
"The best thing to do

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.060
"is to actually have
a funeral for Marvin,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.200
"the one that you married,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.630
"and accept the Marvin
that you brought home

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.700
"as a totally different person,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.030
because he'll never
be the same."

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.060
NARRATOR:
At 56, Marvin Bateman

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.860
is a shadow of the young husband
and father he once was.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.360
A stroke has left him paralyzed
on one side of his body,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.230
but its most devastating impact
is less visible.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.530
He has been cut off
from his emotions.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.860
I want to see my mommy.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:13.500
Please, no.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.030
I want to see my...
my mommy again.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.730
I want... I want to see my mom.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.300
MAN (<i> in movie</i> ):
Put the lotion
in the basket!

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.800
(<i> dog barking</i> )

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.760
(<i> breathing rapidly</i> )

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.160
(<i> screaming hysterically</i> )

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.030
So how did that make you feel
when we were watching it?

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:47.460
Well, I mean, it's, um...
I don't know.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.600
It's... it's, well,
it's hard.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.730
I'm trying to think.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:51.960
It's like...

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.030
I... I know you're
looking for a word,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.030
but I can't think
of one right now.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.230
No, that's okay.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.730
NARRATOR:
At the University of Iowa,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.200
researchers are trying
to understand

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.330
why Marvin cannot feel
a simple emotion like fear.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:19.600
A scan shows the stark region
where Marvin's brain has died.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.960
MAN:
The core of the damage
is in areas

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.560
that have to do
with creating a feeling.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.700
It's not that he has lost the
ability to produce an emotion.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.600
The losses have more
to do with the ability

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.860
to feel the emotions
that he produces.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:44.400
WOMAN:
Can you remember, like, from
this picture to that picture?

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.000
Oh, it's been
a long time.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.200
Well, no, see, we
were still living

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.400
in Winthrop there.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.600
Yeah, I know.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.630
And then this is
after I got moved to Warren

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:54.530
and I'd had that
stupid stroke, you know?

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.800
Yeah.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.000
NARRATOR:
Emotion: you can see it
on Marvin's face--

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.860
a smile, a laugh,
a scowl of frustration.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.660
But what he does not experience
is the awareness of emotion.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.360
Emotions are generated

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.200
by structures hidden deep
in the brain.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.100
The tiny, almond-shaped amygdala

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.230
is the first to respond
to an emotional event,

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.260
triggering a series
of split-second reactions

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.560
within the brain's
emotional core.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:39.560
Waves of nerve impulses
travel down the brain stem,

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.400
setting off an instantaneous,
visceral response

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.100
throughout the body.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.530
DAMASIO:
A lot of the time, the machinery
that produces the emotion

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.460
is operating
without us noticing it at all,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.530
creating changes in posture
and in facial expression,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.860
altering the way the organs
inside the body are working,

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.100
preparing the body
for what's needed next,

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.400
generating chemical responses

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.900
that you will
never know existed,

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.260
and all of this is what
constitutes the emotional state.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.300
NARRATOR:
For most people,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.530
awareness of a feeling
follows just milliseconds

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:23.360
after an emotion is created.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.200
The body sends signals back

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.600
to the area
of the brain responsible

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.300
for conscious thought,
making us aware of our feelings.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.400
It is in this region
of emotional awareness

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.800
that Marvin's stroke decimated
hundreds of millions

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.460
of brain cells.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.030
Marvin experiences emotion,
his body responds.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.330
But when the physical response

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:54.560
is communicated back
to his thinking brain,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.830
the signal falls into a void.

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:01.900
Marvin can only guess at what he
or others may be feeling.

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.060
MARVIN'S WIFE:
When you're married,

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.060
there's an emotional connection
between two people.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.130
That connection
is no longer there.

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.460
It's like somebody cut that wire
between the two of us.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.030
If I try and talk to him,
you know,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.060
about something
that's bothering me

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.300
or... (<i> sighs</i> )

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.560
um... I just need
somebody to listen,

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.530
he's just not there for me.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.860
There's no empathy or sympathy.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.930
He just can't get that feeling

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.600
and he knows it should come,
but it just won't.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.930
MAN (<i> on TV</i> ):
This is the Chamonix Valley
in the French Alps.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.200
Avalanche paths
are evident all around.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.960
In the past...

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.000
NARRATOR:
Before the stroke, Marvin
was a successful salesman,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.530
selling plumbing supplies
throughout Iowa,

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:59.900
but he hasn't been able
to work in 23 years.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.260
WIFE:
He was very ambitious, driven.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.330
Now he doesn't really want
to make any decisions

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:15.060
as far as anything important,
you know.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:17.430
I couldn't make decisions
like I thought I should

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.060
and I probably wouldn't,
you know,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.960
make a decision
about different things.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.330
I probably would have
screwed stuff up

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.300
because if it wasn't
for Arlene,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.100
we wouldn't be
where we're at,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.700
because I didn't make,
you know, proper
business decisions

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.360
on, uh, house
and any bills

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.700
or anything like that,

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.530
because I just wasn't able
to make decisions.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.230
NARRATOR:
Marvin has trouble deciding,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.000
because he has lost
the emotional connection

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.560
to his past.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.230
Memories and the emotions
that go with them

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.430
guide our every decision.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.500
But for Marvin,
memories are bereft of feeling.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.260
DAMASIO:
All the things
that you go through in your life

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.400
in terms of decisions
are inevitably accompanied

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.360
by some kind of emotion,
positive or negative.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:18.560
Each decision has some kind
of similarity

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.430
with a decision of the past.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:27.100
And when you are in a position
to decide once again,

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.560
you will call up
an emotional memory

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.530
that will appear
as a gut feeling

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.760
and will lead you
in one direction or another.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.660
So what you have
is literally a navigational aid,

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:44.760
something that helps you get
to the right decision.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:48.230
And if that is broken down,

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.030
then you're at the mercy
of facts and logic

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.200
and that's just not good enough.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.600
NARRATOR:
Marvin is rudderless as he
navigates through daily life.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.630
But, um, I'm not an invalid.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.930
I'm not, uh, I'm not...

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.460
Some days people
probably think I am

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.500
but I'm not.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.560
You know, I'm able
to do a lot of things.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.000
I'd give everything up
to have him back emotionally.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.700
We care about each other,
you know,

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.160
and I'll always love him,
but I just miss the old Marvin.

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:41.460
DAMASIO:
There's an old idea that emotion
is not at all a good thing,

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.330
because it is difficult
to control.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.900
But emotion is extremely useful.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.600
Emotion is not a luxury.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.260
Emotion is part and parcel
of the mechanisms

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.700
that allow us to stay alive.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:08.760
NARRATOR:
Feelings seem intangible,
intensely subjective.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.000
But now, using
new imaging technologies,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.360
scientists have demonstrated

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.930
that emotions have a physical
place in the brain.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.360
Anger...

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.830
Happiness...

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:29.860
Sadness...

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.230
Fear.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.130
Sometimes intense,
often fleeting,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.700
each has a specific
neural circuitry

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.500
that has evolved over
millions of years.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.100
Why do we have
these emotional states?

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.860
What are they for?

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.960
Well, they all serve a purpose.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.960
They're all adaptive.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.900
By having a feeling of emotion,

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:02.660
you have a possibility of taking
into account what happened

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:07.160
and using that for the proper
planning of future actions.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.130
If something caused happiness,

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:15.300
because it was something that
was potentially good for you,

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:19.760
having that feeling is going to
help you organize your planning

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.860
around the possibility
of getting some more

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.230
of that good thing that you had.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.960
NARRATOR:
Even emotions
that are disturbing,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.060
like anger or fear,
have their purpose.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.530
MAN:
No one's life
is free from stress,

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.660
and when those stresses occur
or problems arise,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:41.630
we have specific emotions

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.400
that are part of our repertoire
for a reason,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.700
because they help us solve
those important problems.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:51.960
Anger, for example,
is a constellation,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.230
a package, of brain responses

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.100
that facilitates our ability
to remove obstacles

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.200
that are in the way
of important goals.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.630
DAMASIO:
With fear, the essential thing

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.630
is to place the organism
out of danger.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.960
So for instance,

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.460
an animal can rapidly flee
from the predator, or freeze.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:24.530
DAVIDSON:
And so the experience of certain
kinds of negative emotions

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.860
are absolutely necessary
and appropriate.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:34.160
Where problems arise
is when an emotion persists

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.700
for a much longer duration
of time than it normally would.

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:42.660
(<i> car horn beeps nearby</i> )

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.560
MAN:
It was 6:00 A.M.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.760
I was, like every day,
normal day, going to work.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.930
I was stopped in the red light
in the intersection

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:06.760
and as soon as the light
turned green, I started going.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.030
I just heard a horn, and I take
a look at my right side.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.830
The car...

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.430
(<i> crashing</i> )

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.730
(<i> voice breaking</i> ):
It's all that I can remember.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:33.660
I thought it was over,
but I'm still so scared.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.630
MAN:
It's 6:00 A.M. on January 24.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.800
You are driving yourself
to work.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.330
You are listening to the radio.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.830
You stop at the intersection

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.660
of School Street
and Highland Avenue.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.130
NARRATOR:
It's been a year
since the accident

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.860
that broke
Johnny Cortez's arm and leg.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:16.100
His bones have healed, but he
is still unable to free himself

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.460
from tormenting memories
and crippling fear.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.160
At the V.A. Research Center
in Manchester, New Hampshire,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.160
scientists are monitoring
Johnny's level of anxiety.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.530
He is suffering

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.260
from post-traumatic
stress disorder, PTSD.

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:48.230
MAN:
One of the diagnostic signs
of PTSD

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.630
is that the reminders
of the traumatic event

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.630
produce a physical response.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.700
We decided to use
the patient's own memory

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.330
of the traumatic event
as a stimulus

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:05.230
so we can measure bodily changes
in the laboratory.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.830
RESEARCHER:
As you're going through
the traffic light,

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.830
suddenly you see the light of
a car coming on your right side

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:12.460
about to crash into you.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:16.630
RESEARCHER:
What we saw while we
were watching Mr. Cortez

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.760
remembering that automobile
accident that he went through

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.600
was his heart rate going up
much higher than it was

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.830
prior to the memory.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.360
It started out around 90
and it wound up above 140.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.100
NARRATOR:
The beating of Johnny's heart
and the sweat on his skin

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:40.930
testify to Johnny's anguish and
provide a window into his brain.

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.700
PITMAN:
We think that what's going on in
the mind of the person with PTSD

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.660
is not a simple memory.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.700
It's a reexperiencing situation,
it's a reliving.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.530
If they feel as if
they're really back

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:00.330
in their traumatic situation

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:02.700
then their hearts
start to beat faster

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.460
and their hands get sweatier,

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.230
because
they're preparing to deal

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.400
with a very frightening event.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.600
PITMAN (<i> over intercom</i> ):
The car crashes into you.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.630
Your chest is constricted
and you want to scream.

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.700
You hear sirens

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.000
and then a female voice
asking you something,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.460
but you can't answer
the question.

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:31.660
The voices around you
are like a dream.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.760
You're confused and feel
the blood rushing to your head.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.160
MAN:
In PTSD, something breaks.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.730
An event occurs

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.060
and the body and the brain
cannot accept that it's over,

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.930
and so instead of moving
through it, people get stuck.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:52.000
They're always afraid
that it will come back.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.430
They think that it has come back
when they hear certain sounds

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.860
or feel certain things in their
bodies that remind them of it

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.030
and it becomes like a cancer

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.830
that sits there
inside of your memory,

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:08.430
that dominates how you see the
world and how you see yourself.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.030
CORTEZ:
Most of the nights,
I can't sleep very well.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.300
The bad dreams,
they are terrible,

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.530
and, uh, when I get
bad dreams, nightmares,

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:25.260
I don't know how what...
I can't remember what it...

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:30.600
I just woke up when I realize,
I am on the floor crying.

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:32.900
(<i> sighs heavily</i> )

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:39.160
And my wife, trying to calm me,

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.730
saying, "It's okay,
Johnny, it's okay."

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:52.400
NARRATOR:
How has fear, a lifesaving,
evolutionary response to danger,

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.960
been transformed by
a traumatic accident into PTSD?

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:02.230
At Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.430
scientists are examining
the fear response,

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.060
scanning the brains of people

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:09.730
with and without
post-traumatic stress disorder

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.200
as a series
of expressionless faces

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.330
are flashed in front of them.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.560
Hidden among the faces
is a single image

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.060
that signifies threat,
a face frozen in terror.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.700
In that instant, one part of the
brain, in every test subject,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.500
is highly responsive--
the amygdala.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:45.800
DAVIDSON:
The amygdala
is a small structure

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.930
which cares a lot
about threat and fear.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.960
If there's something that may be
potentially harmful to us,

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.730
it is a brain area which
gets activated very quickly

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.460
and recruits other areas
of the brain

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.660
to try to deal with
this unexpected circumstance.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.300
The amygdala sends outputs
to the body

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.500
so that your muscles begin to
tense, hormones are released,

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.030
blood pressure goes up,

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.900
and all of these are part of the
protective response of the body

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.530
designed by evolution
to help you stay alive.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.360
Imagine you're walking down
a path in the woods

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.860
and all of a sudden
there's a curved object

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.100
that looks like a snake
on the ground.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.060
And you find yourself stopping

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.560
with your leg resting
above that object

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:36.900
and you look down and see
that it's simply a stick.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:38.830
So why did your leg
stop like that?

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.460
NARRATOR:
In the normal brain,
the amygdala acts

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:48.600
like an early-warning system,
alerting us to danger.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:52.330
But the amygdala
does not act on its own.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:56.560
The frontal cortex,
where we think and reason,

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.500
plays a crucial role.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:05.100
LeDOUX:
There are two parallel routes of
fear processing in your brain.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.400
One will go directly
to the amygdala--

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.430
it's a quick-and-dirty pathway--

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.030
and trigger
a fear reaction unconsciously.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.400
But then as the information

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.400
slowly makes its way
to the cortex,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.300
the cortex perceives
the difference

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:22.730
between the stick and the snake
and says, "It's only a stick."

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.360
NARRATOR:
Once the discerning cortex
has determined

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.300
that there is no call for panic,

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.800
it sends a message
to the amygdala,

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.160
quieting the fear response.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.830
But in
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:43.660
the cortex is held hostage
by a volatile amygdala.

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.060
Thinking is hijacked by emotion.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.560
VAN DER KOLK:
People with PTSD

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.030
are very sensitively tuned
to pick up threat

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.960
and respond
to even very minor stimuli

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.960
as if their life were in danger.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.500
All there is
is your fear and your threat

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.000
that "My life
has come to an end."

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.460
You're trapped.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:20.200
CORTEZ:
Any single noise
make me jump, make me nervous.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.160
My heart start beating fast.

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.330
So I say,
"What's going on with me?"

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.830
"An accident that happened
to everybody, to everyone,

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:39.000
"how an accident can change
the life for someone?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.100
Why?"

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.360
I can't understand why.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.030
NARRATOR:
Most people suffering from PTSD
are like Johnny,

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:53.000
at the mercy of an overly
sensitive amygdala

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.600
and the hormone that gives
that extra burst of energy

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.760
to help us fight or take flight

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.260
in the face of danger--
adrenaline.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.930
In a moment of terror,

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:11.030
the amygdala sets off
a cascade of reactions.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:14.560
A wave of nerve impulses
travels down the brain stem

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.130
and triggers the release
of adrenaline in the body,

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.860
sending a flood of stress
hormones into the brain

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.030
that help etch the memory
of the danger

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.600
more deeply into
our neural circuitry

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.930
so we can avoid it
the next time.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.760
McGAUGH:
An emotionally
arousing experience

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.930
releases hormones
which will enable you

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:36.300
to deal with that experience
in the future,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.400
because you'll have
a stronger memory

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.930
of that particular set
of circumstances

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:43.100
and you can use that information

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.730
to make decisions about
what you do in the future.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.500
NARRATOR:
But people with PTSD

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.660
appear to have an overly
sensitive amygdala.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.460
Even a harmless sound
can set it off.

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:01.100
Again and again, the traumatic
moment is involuntarily recalled

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.960
and relived, repeatedly
activating the amygdala

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.000
and releasing adrenaline,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.830
each time, searing the trauma

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.600
deeper into the memory centers
of the brain.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.130
McGAUGH:
Post-traumatic stress disorder

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.600
is simply ordinary emotion
and memory gone haywire.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.000
It's gone too far.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.760
It's using
a very adaptive mechanism

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.900
for a maladaptive purpose.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.030
NARRATOR:
If PTSD begins
with a jolt of adrenaline,

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.660
can blocking
the effect of adrenaline

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.660
stop PTSD before it starts?

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:45.400
(<i> sirens wailing</i> )

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.160
In the emergency room at
Massachusetts General Hospital,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.900
where Johnny was treated
after his accident,

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.760
scientists
have been experimenting

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.630
with a new treatment.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.500
If it works, it might spare
traumatized patients

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.560
a lifetime of nightmares
and anxiety.

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:07.800
Why not see
if giving a beta-blocker--

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.700
a drug which blocks
the action of adrenaline--

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.730
why not give that to subjects

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.160
who have had
a traumatic experience?

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.560
So that even if
they relive the situation,

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.460
even if they
have these flashbacks,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:24.630
they won't have the adrenaline
making too strong a memory.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.400
NARRATOR:
In a carefully controlled study,

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.030
traumatized accident victims
were given the beta-blocker drug

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:35.200
as soon as they arrived
in the emergency room

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.100
and then four times a day
for two weeks.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.100
The preliminary data suggest

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.230
that by interfering
with adrenaline's impact

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.960
beta-blockers can stop
the vicious cycle

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.300
of post-traumatic stress
disorder in its tracks.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.360
McGAUGH:
If post-traumatic
stress disorder

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.160
can be weakened or blocked,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:06.230
then there is a way
to prevent this disease.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.730
And until now
there has not been one.

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.100
So that's pretty big news if it
turns out to work out that way.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.900
There'll always
be the memory there,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.200
but the hope is to prevent that
from becoming so strong

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.930
that it takes over the life
of the individual

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.960
and becomes
not just a strong memory,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.900
but it becomes a very
significant emotional disorder.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.330
NARRATOR:
Just as fear has turned
against Johnny Cortez,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:48.800
terrorizing him with
its unrelenting persistence,

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.730
other emotions, too,
can go awry.

00:30:53.330 --> 00:31:00.360
Anger, desire, sadness
are just as tangible as fear,

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.100
and any one of them
can spin out of control

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.100
with devastating consequences.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.160
MAN:
Emotion tells us
what's good about our world,

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.930
what's bad about our world.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.460
Emotion forms self-concept,

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.460
but our whole self-concept
can get away from us.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.460
We can feel hopeless
and worthless.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.860
We can feel
that there's no future for us.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.200
NARRATOR:
Lauren Slater first checked
into a psychiatric hospital

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.500
at the age of 14, suffering
from severe depression.

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.030
Ten years later,

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.230
after having been in and out
of the same hospital,

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.100
she was still suffering.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.760
SLATER:
When I was 24 or 25 years old,

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.560
my fifth hospitalization
was fairly brief.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.460
They were
at the end of the line with me.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.730
What could they do for this
girl-- now become young woman--

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.630
who they'd seen year after year?

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.300
And I was discharged
from the hospital,

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.130
and I didn't have a place to go.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:21.400
So I went to this motel.

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.460
And I fell asleep.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.160
I was in this half state
between sleep and wake,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:34.360
and I could see very, very
clearly where my life was going.

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:42.230
I knew that I did not want to
live the way I had been living.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:45.560
I saw myself clearly;
I saw who I was and what I was

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.560
and what I had become.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.400
And I knew I wanted out.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.160
And out meant two things,
one of two things:

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.460
it meant somehow
either getting better, changing

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:57.500
or it meant leaving.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:02.400
And those were both
options for me.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.160
It was at that moment in the
hotel room that I made a choice.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.500
I wanted to try getting up--

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.860
that's what
I wanted to try first.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:19.660
NARRATOR:
Lauren went on living

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.400
with depression
grooved in her brain;

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:25.300
not the passing blues
we all can feel,

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:28.700
but a chronic
and confounding disease.

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.730
MAN:
We are still struggling
to understand

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:35.430
what goes wrong in the brain
to cause depression.

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.960
Because depression
can have profound symptoms.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.500
It can change lives.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.930
It can lead people
to end their lives.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:47.430
And yet, when we look at the
brain of a depressed person,

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.960
we don't see any holes in it,
any obvious lesions.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.460
I mean, it's far different
from any other disorders.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:58.600
We don't know what causes it,
we don't have a pathology of it

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.160
like we do for Alzheimer's
disease or Parkinson's disease.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.560
So all we have
at the present time

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.500
is we have a collection
of clinical signs and symptoms.

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:21.160
SLATER:
To feel depressed,
to me, is to feel dead.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:26.460
It's to feel that all
of the things in your life

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:30.130
that gave you comfort
and meaning,

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.700
they are no longer
even familiar.

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:39.100
Deadness, terror,
horror, distorted time;

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.660
it's the ultimate isolation.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:42.430
It's the ultimate wordlessness,

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:44.830
which is why it's so hard
to talk about it.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:55.800
NARRATOR:
An image captures what words
cannot-- the depressed brain.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.930
No physical damage is apparent,
but to scientists

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:05.200
its signature is clearly visible
in patterns of brain activity.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.260
The prefrontal cortex,
the part of the brain

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:11.900
with which we understand
and engage with our world,

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:15.760
has grown dull and silent.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.930
The emotional core of the brain

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.800
is sending
the prefrontal cortex signals,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.460
flooding it with chemicals
carrying emotional messages,

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.200
but the prefrontal cortex

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:30.100
can only make
tentative attempts to respond.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.760
MAYBERG:
There should
be a constant interplay

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.160
between what we feel
and what we think.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.500
But in the state
of intense depression,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.760
the balance between
emotion and feelings

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:48.300
and thinking and reasoning
becomes... out of whack.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.630
NARRATOR:
Anyone can become depressed,

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.630
but chronic,
unrelenting depression

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.830
seems to run in families,

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:06.300
passed through the genes
generation to generation,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.800
a vulnerability
that can be heightened

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.230
by traumatic experiences
early in life.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.630
SLATER:
Looking at my family history,

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:18.430
you can see that depression
runs through the family tree.

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:23.230
My father has definitely
struggled with depression,

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:26.430
and his mother and his father
suffered as well.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:29.030
So I know that it's there,
and it goes back.

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:30.760
I also think, though,

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.900
that the environment
had a really significant role

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.460
in how those genetic tendencies

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.430
or inevitabilities
were played out.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:45.800
There were episodes of violence,
of pretty serious violence,

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:51.200
where there would be punching,
hitting, pulling by the hair.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.360
A lot of cruelty,
a lot of humiliation.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.760
And it was like that
day after day after day.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.100
MAN:
We know that there are critical
periods in childhood

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.360
when the brain
is remarkably plastic.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.030
And one of the consequences
of early trauma,

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:11.600
it's very likely

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.330
that the brain does not
form the normal connections

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.160
that it normally would,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.900
and it's going to have
consequences in adulthood.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.160
NARRATOR:
Most people
who experience depression

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.730
did not experience
childhood abuse.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.300
But Charles Nemeroff believes

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.160
that physical, sexual,
even emotional abuse

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.460
can make the brain abnormally
sensitive to stress

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:38.860
and, later in life,

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:42.530
make some people
more vulnerable to depression.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.760
Scientists have found
that people with depression

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.360
often produce too much
of the stress hormone cortisol.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.100
NEMEROFF:
Many conceptualize depression as
the stress response gone awry.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:59.230
Stress is really an event that
should be very time-limited.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.300
You're exposed to a stressor,

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.100
your stress hormone
should be released

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.800
and they should
turn off very quickly.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.930
NARRATOR:
But in the brain
of a depressed person,

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:12.230
stress triggers
too much cortisol for too long.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:15.260
Chronic exposure
to this normal stress hormone

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.000
can be toxic to the brain.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.400
HYMAN:
You can think of it
almost as leaving a scar,

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.600
as changing the brain--

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.930
as making the brain

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.500
more vulnerable
to subsequent depressions.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.630
SLATER:
After my experience
in that motel room,

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.660
I really worked hard
to pull it together.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.400
I tried to live
without symptoms.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.230
I tried to live
without collapsing.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.230
It was boot camp for a year,
absolute boot camp.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.830
I had charts, lists,
this, this and that,

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:49.360
anything just to get myself
on the right road.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.260
A huge amount of sweat equity
went into that effort,

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.360
and it didn't work.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.060
And when it didn't work,

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.460
I was ready, really ready,
to throw in the towel.

00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:00.260
And it wasn't just a year,

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.660
it was those ten years
preceding it.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.760
I was exhausted.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.800
So suicide was a welcoming
thought to me.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:15.530
People kill themselves
when they are depressed

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:19.030
as a way of trying
to spare themselves

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.660
from unremitting
and unrelenting pain.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:28.160
Suicide is one viable cure
for depression.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.330
That's how
the depressed person sees it.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:35.060
But there's this tenacious part
of not only me, but all of us--

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.230
we want to live.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:41.860
So I called the psychiatrist
that I had been seeing

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.400
and she said to me, "There's
this new drug on the market

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.800
"and I think we should try it.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.560
It's called Prozac."

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.630
And my response to that was,

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.030
"Don't... don't...
I don't want another drug."

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:57.400
And yet when the psychiatrist
offered me a possible way out,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.030
I immediately jumped for it.

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.960
And so I tried it.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.960
You know, swallow
a little biochemical missile

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.460
and boom-- kaboom--
you're changed.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:20.430
NEMEROFF:
The brain contains a hundred
billion cells, neurons,

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:26.600
and they make a hundred trillion
connections or synapses.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.500
And each of the neurons

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.800
release chemical substances
called neurotransmitters,

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:36.260
and these neurotransmitters are
the legal tender of the brain;

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.130
that's how these cells
communicate with each other.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.200
NARRATOR:
As the neurotransmitters flow
through the brain like a river,

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.260
sending a steady stream
of information

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.130
between the brain's emotional
and thinking regions,

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.060
just a few milligrams
of an antidepressant

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.860
like Prozac, Zoloft or Paxil

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.760
can quickly and radically
affect one of them:

00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:02.130
the mood-influencing
chemical, serotonin.

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.060
In the synaptic gap
between the neurons,

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.360
where serotonin
delivers messages

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.160
from one cell to another,

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:18.830
sit a series of molecules
that work like locks on a canal,

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.230
regulating the flow
of serotonin,

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.660
determining its rise and fall.

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:30.660
In the depressed brain,
serotonin is often at low ebb.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.230
An antidepressant
can plug the entry

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.700
to some of the molecular locks,
forcing serotonin levels to rise

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.300
in the open spaces
between the cells,

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.230
a change that occurs
throughout the brain,

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.260
but especially in the brain's
prefrontal cortex.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.530
MAN:
And the fact that it occurs
in the prefrontal cortex

00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:54.830
I think is very intriguing,
since this is the very area

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:59.160
that people would have guessed
would be a critical area

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.560
in being able
to regulate your mood,

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.060
for the brain to be able
to get itself back on track.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:10.660
NARRATOR:
Higher levels of serotonin
stimulate a cascade of reactions

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.860
that bring the brain
back into balance.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:19.500
Within weeks, the symptoms
of depression mysteriously lift.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.600
What we really want to
understand is that last step,

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.830
that last bit,
that change in the wiring,

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.400
so that the "I'm no good,"

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.560
changes to,
"Maybe things are not so bad."

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.030
And that is going to take

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.800
an enormous amount of progress
in neuroscience.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.830
But when we understand that,
we're going to understand

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:42.230
very, very important things
about what it means to be human,

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:45.030
how things go wrong
and how things can go right.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.400
WOMAN:
When I first went on Prozac,
for the first, like, six months

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.900
they were, like, probably
the best six months of my life.

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.300
Suddenly, I could feel:

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:05.000
Um, I could feel pleasure,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.900
I could feel happiness,
I could feel sadness.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.830
It was like this whole range
of... possibilities.

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:15.230
I was walking around stunned.

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:19.330
My senses were very different,
colors were different,

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:23.560
my taste buds were different,
my tongue was different.

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.100
This world
was suddenly open to me

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.960
that I had never
really explored before.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.330
There are no words to convey

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:41.660
how... unbelievable
that experience was, um...

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.000
how much happiness I had.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:52.860
NARRATOR:
It has been 12 years

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.900
since Lauren first found relief
from depression.

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:59.430
Ever since, she has worked
to rebuild her life.

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.760
She received a doctorate
in psychology...

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:08.130
married, had a child.

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:15.000
LAUREN:
In my more reductive moments
I tend to think,

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.560
"Alter serotonin transmission,
alter the person;

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.830
beginning and end of story."

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:22.860
But the story, of course,
always gets more complicated.

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.530
MAN:
You really are one, you know,
of the miracle stories here

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:30.130
for this treatment.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.600
LAUREN:
I've been on this now
for 12 years.

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.360
You know,
and I always feel like...

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.460
you know, my big concern is that
I'm on borrowed time with it.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:39.030
Um, and I know that...

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:41.330
DOCTOR:
At this point, it's
a borrowed decade.

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:43.330
A borrowed decade,
more than a decade now.

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:44.930
Borrowed decade plus two years,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.030
which is good, but...

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.360
I have to say,
I don't know

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.730
that I'm a Prozac wonder story,

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.000
I mean, because, you know...

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.430
Why?

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.230
Well, because I started
on ten milligrams

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:56.600
and I'm now, you know,
eight times that,

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:59.000
which is why
I'm suspicious of the drug.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.030
I am very suspicious
of the drug.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:02.600
But, Lauren,
here's...

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.100
Although I also, of course,
am half in love with it.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.660
But I am suspicious of it.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.530
The fact that you've
been on the stuff,

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:09.960
it's been your mainstay,

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.600
you've been mostly
free of symptoms,

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.560
we've been able to get
you freer of symptoms

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.030
when you've become
symptomatic,

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.300
is both
a nifty thing

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.460
and one that's,
unfortunately,
a little rare

00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:20.800
in the treatment
of chronic, severe
depression.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.660
One rarely sees a depression
as<i> severe</i> as yours

00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:28.200
which remits as
fully as yours has.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.500
LAUREN:
I thought, "Now I have this drug
and it's great."

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.100
I thought I actually
had it licked,

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.060
but then it became a much more
complicated relationship.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.500
It became an...
it became an unreliable lover,

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:46.560
one who had the capacity
to, to save me

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.660
and yet who could leave me
at any moment utterly stranded.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.300
NARRATOR:
Lauren is not cured
of depression.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.100
Drugs only relieve the symptoms.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:59.330
And like an infection that
resists an antibiotic,

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:02.300
Lauren's brain periodically
begins to resist

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:06.930
the anti-depressant;
she relapses.

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:11.700
Dosages must be increased,
different drugs must be found.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.200
Patients call it
the "Prozac poop-out."

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.730
LAUREN:
My biggest fear
with Prozac poop-out now

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:27.960
is that now that I have a child,
it's no longer just me.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:34.330
And I'm afraid that I will not
be able function as a parent...

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:37.400
and that that will obviously
have repercussions

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.000
for my daughter.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.260
NARRATOR:
Lauren will always
need medication

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:47.500
to help her
get on with her life,

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.630
to simply go to work each day.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:53.960
But now she looks beyond her own
suffering, to helping others.

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.960
Um...

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.860
I think when I was young
I thought I was just lazy,

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:06.000
and I think everyone else
thought I was just lazy.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.030
But, um...

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.660
It's like when you're
at the dentist's office

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.000
you get, like, that
lead cape put on you;

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.460
when I'm depressed

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.230
I feel like I
always have it on.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.100
Now what
you're telling me...

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.260
NARRATOR:
Drawing on her own experience
with depression,

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.800
Lauren has become
a practicing psychologist,

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.400
counseling patients at
a community clinic in Boston.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.960
Like Lauren,
many of them take drugs

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.330
to relieve their depression.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:34.900
LAUREN:
You started off
the therapy session

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:36.900
saying that you have
no resources

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.600
outside of your doctors
and your medication,

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:41.760
and you'd be a puddle of sugar

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.930
should I and your pscyho-
pharmacologist, I guess,

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.500
and the pills themselves
suddenly fly away.

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:53.900
LAUREN:
I think that drug therapy
probably gives a leg up,

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.660
um, the ability to become
symptom-free enough

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.260
so that you can learn
new ways of behaving.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.230
But I resist in myself
and in other people

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.630
being reduced simply to a series
of biochemistry...

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.160
or biochemical interactions,

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.300
so, in some ways,
I insist on some kind of...

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.900
there's<i> got</i> to be some kind
of therapeutic process here

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.930
that's not just talking
about our synapses.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.830
You yourself told me

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:17.930
that you built
a support network,

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.560
you've come
out of the closet

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.330
with your depression,

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:22.900
and that that
really helps.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.630
And these
are all of the...

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.900
coping mechanisms
that you have.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:32.630
The fact is that you have
resources inside of you.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:35.760
NARRATOR:
For many people,
drugs alone are not enough

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.760
to keep depression at bay.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.000
Research has demonstrated

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.230
that the most effective way
to treat depression

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:46.530
is with a combination
of drugs and talk therapy.

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:51.000
HYMAN:
Talk therapy works,
because it works on the brain.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.030
Any time we learn something new,

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.830
any time we change our mind
about something,

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:59.830
any time we remember something,
we can do that only by changing

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.830
the physical structure
of our brain--

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.500
by changing, literally,
synaptic connections,

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.430
so that we're processing
information differently.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:09.400
DAVIDSON:
We can think of therapy

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.560
as the brain learning a skill

00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:15.700
that's not unlike learning
a complex motor skill

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:20.300
or, for example, becoming adept
at a particular sport,

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.430
uh, or becoming adept
at a musical instrument

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:25.760
where there
is systematic practice

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:30.030
and that practice leads to a
demonstrable change in behavior.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.730
The anxiety of
getting depression

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.630
is almost worse
than the depression.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:36.260
Yes, and the thing
you need to remember
about that

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.430
is that you've always
gotten through it.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:42.260
Maybe with cuts and scrapes
and serious wounds,

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:45.330
but you've always
gotten through it, so...

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.500
LAUREN:
The curiosities and energies

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.730
that had always been
rightfully mine

00:49:57.730 --> 00:49:59.800
were finally taking their place.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.500
And yet for me,
it was not that simple.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.330
My personality, yes,
had always consisted

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.060
of suppressed energies
and curiosities,

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.430
but also of depressions,

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:14.360
echoing intensities, drivenness
that tipped into pain.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.900
I missed these things,
or parts of them anyway,

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:21.600
for they were as familiar to me
as dense fog and drizzle,

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.200
which has its own sort
of lonely beauty,

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.230
as does a desert
or the most mournful of music.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:34.630
Having lived with chronic
depression, a high pitched panic

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:36.600
and a host of other
psychiatric symptoms

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.160
since my earliest years

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.230
I had made for myself
an illness identity,

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:43.930
a story of self that
had illness as its main motive,

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:47.600
the explanatory model
on which my being was based.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.200
And now gone:

00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.260
I had tipped over, stepped over
the border into health.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.830
There was no more depression,

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:57.130
which had felt like the stifling
yet oddly comforting weight

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:58.930
of a woolen blanket,

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:02.300
or anxiety, which lent a certain
fluorescence to things,

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.630
or voices,
which had always been there,

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:07.160
sometimes louder,
sometimes softer,

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.960
some north star of sound
in the night.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.100
(<i> applause</i> )

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.730
NARRATOR:
In the 12 years since
she has left the hospital

00:51:20.730 --> 00:51:22.930
that had become a second home,

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:27.260
Lauren has tamed her depression
and learned to live with it.

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:30.400
At times, it can be
a precarious peace,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.400
but one that has allowed her
to write

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:36.600
and become
a critically praised author.

00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.900
LAUREN:
When I was in the hospital,

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.900
there was a mental health worker
who was so smart.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.000
She said to me around
maybe my fourth time in,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.100
"You know, you're just going
to come back here forever,

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.960
aren't you?"

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:51.760
And it looked that way;

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.260
it looked like that
was going to be my life.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.030
Well, in some ways I feel like
I'm just so damn successful.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:58.330
(<i> laughs</i> )

00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:01.460
But not for the reasons
that you might think,

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.630
um, but because I'm out,
and I've stayed out.

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:15.360
(<i> people conversing
 indistinctly</i> )

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:23.030
HYMAN:
The adult brain is capable

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:26.200
of the whole panoply
of human thought.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.700
But it's emotion

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:34.660
that is at the very heart
of our thinking lives.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.360
McGAUGH:
Our lives are governed
by emotions

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:47.630
and the interaction of emotions
with our thought processes.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:50.100
That's... that's who we are.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.260
We are emotional people.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.200
There's no such thing as
a nonemotional moment in life.

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:07.130
NARRATOR:
"We think by feeling.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:10.200
"What is there to know?

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.930
I hear my being dance
from ear to ear."

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:20.260
"I wake to sleep,
and take my waking slow.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.430
I learn by going
where I have to go."
