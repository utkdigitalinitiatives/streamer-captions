00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.030


2
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.800
Well, lords, the duke of Lancaster is dead.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.730
And living, too, for now his son is duke.

4
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.400
Barely in title, not in revenues.

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.670
Richly in both, if justice had her right.

6
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.470
My heart is great, but it must break with silence,

7
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.700
ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue.

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.330
Nay, speak thy mind,

9
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.630
and let him ne'er speak more

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.370
that speaks thy words again to do thee harm.

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.870
Tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of Hereford?

12
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.930
If it be so, out with it boldly, man.

13
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.930
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.

14
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.800
No good at all that I can do for him,

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.530
unless you call it good to pity him,

16
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.670
bereft and gelded of his patrimony.

17
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.170
Now, afore God,

18
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.630
'tis shame such wrongs are borne in him,

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.330
a royal prince,

20
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.200
and many moe of noble blood in this declining land.

21
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.470
The king is not himself, but basely led by flatterers.

22
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.900
And what they will inform,

23
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.070
merely in hate against any of us all,

24
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.000
that will the king severely prosecute 'gainst us,

25
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400
our lives, our children, and our heirs.

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.200
The commons hath he pilled with grievous taxes

27
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.730
and quite lost their hearts.

28
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.300
The nobles hath he fined for ancient quarrels

29
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.400
and quite lost their hearts.

30
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.700
And daily new exactions are devised

31
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.730
as blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what.

32
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.230
But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?

33
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.300
Wars have not wasted it, for warred he hath not,

34
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.800
but basely yielded upon compromise

35
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.670
that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows.

36
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.930
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.

37
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.170
The earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.

38
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.700
The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.

39
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.530
Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.

40
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.500
He hath not money for these Irish wars,

41
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.970
his burdenous taxations notwithstanding,

42
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.300
but by the robbing of the banished duke--

43
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.370
His noble kinsman.

44
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.530
Oh, most degenerate king.

45
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.270
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,

46
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.270
yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm.

47
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.670
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,

48
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.130
and yet we strike not, but securely perish.

49
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.030
We see the very wreck that we must suffer,

50
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.030
and unavoided is the danger now

51
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.300
for suffering so the causes of our wreck.

52
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.400
Not so.

53
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.270
Even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering,

54
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.230
but I dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is.

55
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.730
Nay, let us share thy thoughts,

56
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.730
as thou dost ours.

57
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.400
Be confident to speak, Northumberland.

58
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.730
We three are but thyself.

59
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.730
And, speaking so,

60
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.830
thy words are but as thoughts.

61
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.130
Therefore, be bold.

62
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.400
Then thus.

63
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.100
I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay in Brittany,

64
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.570
received intelligence that Harry, duke of Hereford;

65
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.030
Rainold Lord Cobham,

66
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.330
that late broke from the duke of Exeter;

67
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.430
his brother, archbishop late of Canterbury;

68
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.370
Sir Thomas Erpingham; Sir John Ramston;

69
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.070
Sir John Norbery; Sir Robert Waterton; and Francis Quoint--

70
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.730
all these well furnished by the duke of Britain

71
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.030
with eight tall ships,

72
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.200
3,000 men of war--

73
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.970
are making hither with all due expedience

74
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.700
and shortly mean to touch our northern shore.

75
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.000
Perhaps they had ere this,

76
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.030
but that they stay

77
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.230
the first departing of the king for Ireland.

78
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.800
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,

79
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.900
imp out our drooping country's broken wing,

80
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.830
redeem from broking pawn the blemished crown,

81
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.930
wipe off the dust that hides our scepter's gilt,

82
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.370
and make high majesty look like itself,

83
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.900
away with me in post to Ravenspurgh.

84
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.470
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,

85
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.870
stay and be secret, and myself will go.

86
00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.130
To horse; to horse.

87
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.030
Urge doubts to them that fear.

88
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.100
Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.

89
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.930
I know not what to do.

90
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.400
I would to God, so my untruth had not provoked him to it,

91
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.000
the king had cut off my head with my brother's.

92
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Uncle--

93
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.330
What, are there no posts dispatched for Ireland?

94
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.800
How shall we do for money for these wars?

95
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.170
Come, Sister--

96
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.200
Cousin, I would say--

97
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.330
pray, pardon me.

98
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.830
Go, fellow.

99
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.070
Get thee home.

100
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.030
Provide some carts and bring away the armor that is there.

101
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.870
Gentlemen, will you go muster men?

102
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.270
If I know how or which way to order these affairs

103
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.430
thus disorderly thrust into my hands,

104
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.070
never believe me.

105
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.600
Both are my kinsmen.

106
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.100
The one is my sovereign,

107
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.800
whom both my oath and duty bids defend.

108
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.230
The other again is my kinsman, whom the king hath wronged,

109
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.700
whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.

110
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.070
Well, somewhat we must do.

111
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.000
Come, cousin; I'll dispose of you.

112
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.400
Gentlemen, will you go muster up your men

113
00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.130
and meet me presently at Berkeley?

114
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.300
The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,

115
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.770
but none returns.

116
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.070
For us to levy power proportionable to the enemy

117
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.230
is all unpossible.

118
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.900
Besides, our nearness to the king in love

119
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.670
is near the hate of those love not the king.

120
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.030
And that is the wavering commons,

121
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.870
for their love lies in their purses,

122
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.770
and whoso empties them by so much

123
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.330
fills their hearts with deadly hate.

124
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.370
Wherein the king stands generally condemned.

125
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.600
If judgment lie in them, then so do we,

126
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.270
because we ever have been near the king.

127
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.830
Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol Castle.

128
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.670
The earl of Wiltshire is already there.

129
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.270
Thither will I with you,

130
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.700
for little office will the hateful commons perform for us,

131
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.570
except like curs to tear us all to pieces.

132
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.900
Will you go along with us?

133
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.370
No.

134
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.030
I will to Ireland to His Majesty.

135
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.700
Farewell.

136
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.070
If heart's presages be not vain,

137
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.070
we three here part that ne'er shall meet again.

138
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.030
That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.

139
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.370
Alas, poor duke.

140
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.500
The task he undertakes

141
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.400
is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry.

142
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.100
Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.

143
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.530
Farewell at once, for once, for all, forever.

144
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.200
Well, we may meet again.

145
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.200
I fear me, never.

146
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.530
How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?

147
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.970
Believe me, noble lord,

148
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.700
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.

149
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.500
These high, wild hills and rough, uneven ways

150
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.070
draws out our miles and makes them wearisome.

151
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.870
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,

152
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.500
making the hard way sweet and delectable.

153
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.830
But I bethink me what a weary way

154
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.830
from Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found

155
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.600
in Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,

156
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.770
which, I protest, hath very much beguiled

157
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.800
the tediousness and process of my travel.

158
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.500
But theirs is sweetened by the hope to have

159
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.030
the present benefit which I possess.

160
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.070
And hope to joy

161
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.900
is little less in joy than hope enjoyed.

162
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.700
By this the weary lords shall make their way seem short,

163
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.100
as mine hath done by sight of what I have,

164
00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.470
your noble company.

165
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.830
Of much less value is my company than your good words.

166
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.200
But who comes here?

167
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.970
It is my son, young Harry Percy,

168
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.470
sent from my brother, Worcester, whencesoever.

169
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:14.470
Harry.

170
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.600
How fares your uncle?

171
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.370
I had thought, my lord, to have learned his health of you.

172
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.230
Why, is he not with the queen?

173
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.000
No, my good lord.

174
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.970
He hath forsook the court, broken his staff of office,

175
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:31.800
and dispersed the household of the king.

176
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.970
What was his reason?

177
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.900
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.

178
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.530
Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.

179
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.700
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh

180
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.900
to offer service to the duke of Hereford,

181
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.470
and sent me over by Berkeley

182
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:48.270
to discover what power the duke of York had levied there,

183
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.570
then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.

184
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.870
Have you forgot the duke of Hereford, boy?

185
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:57.130
No, my good lord, for that is not forgot

186
00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.970
which ne'er I did remember.

187
00:07:58.970 --> 00:07:59.970
To my knowledge,

188
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.870
I never in my life did look on him.

189
00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.130
Then learn to know him now.

190
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.930
This is the duke.

191
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.900
My gracious lord,

192
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.800
I tender you my service,

193
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.330
such as it is, being tender, raw, and young,

194
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.800
which elder days shall ripen and confirm

195
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.830
to more approved service and desert.

196
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.470
I thank thee, gentle Percy,

197
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.400
and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy

198
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.770
as in a soul remembering my good friends.

199
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:35.530
And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,

200
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.070
it shall be still thy true love's recompense.

201
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.670
My heart this covenant makes.

202
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:43.500
My hand thus seals it.

203
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.870
How far is it to Berkeley,

204
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.900
and what stir keeps good old York there with his men of war?

205
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.270
There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees,

206
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.100
manned with 300 men, as I have heard.

207
00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.330
And in it are the lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour.

208
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.800
None else of name and noble estimate.

209
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.670
Here come the lords of Ross and Willoughby,

210
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.970
bloody with spurring and fiery red with haste.

211
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.370
Welcome, my lords.

212
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.900
I wot your love pursues a banished traitor.

213
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.830
All my treasury is yet but unfelt thanks,

214
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.130
which more enriched

215
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.570
shall be your love and labor's recompense.

216
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.930
Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord--

217
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.400
And far surmounts our labor to attain it.

218
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.700
Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor,

219
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.170
which, till my infant fortune comes to years,

220
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.500
stands for my bounty.

221
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.170
But who comes here?

222
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.500
It is my lord of Berkeley, as I guess.

223
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.570
My lord of Hereford, my message is to you.

224
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.100
My lord, my answer is to Lancaster,

225
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.330
and I am come to seek that name in England.

226
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.300
And I must find that title in your tongue

227
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.430
before I make reply to aught you say.

228
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.230
Mistake me not, my lord.

229
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.270
'Tis not my meaning to raze one title of your honor out.

230
00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.370
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,

231
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.300
from the most gracious regent of this land,

232
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.770
the duke of York, to know what pricks you on

233
00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.830
to take advantage of the absent time

234
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.900
and fright our native peace with self-born arms.

235
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.900
I shall not need transport my words by you.

236
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.670
Here comes His Grace in person.

237
00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.970
My noble uncle.

238
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:25.170
Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee,

239
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.630
whose duty is deceivable and false.

240
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.630
My gracious uncle--

241
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.630
Tut, tut.

242
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.830
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.

243
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.300
I am no traitor's uncle,

244
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.900
and that word "grace" in an ungracious mouth is but profane.

245
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.330
Why have those banished and forbidden legs

246
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.700
dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?

247
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.030
But then more "why."

248
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.700
Why have they dared to march

249
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.800
so many miles upon her peaceful bosom,

250
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.300
frighting her pale faced villages with war

251
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.570
and ostentation of despised arms?

252
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.200
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?

253
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.230
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,

254
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.800
and in my loyal bosom lies his power.

255
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.770
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth

256
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.170
as when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself

257
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.130
rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,

258
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.370
from forth the ranks of many thousand French.

259
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.630
Oh, then how quickly would this arm of mine,

260
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.830
now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee

261
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.470
and minister correction to thy fault.

262
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.430
My gracious uncle, let me know my fault.

263
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.930
On what condition stands it and wherein?

264
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.530
Even in condition of the worst degree,

265
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.230
in gross rebellion and detested treason.

266
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.930
Thou art a banished man

267
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.830
and here art come before the expiration of thy time

268
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.300
in braving arms against thy sovereign.

269
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.630
As I was banished, I was banished Hereford.

270
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.470
But as I come, I come for Lancaster.

271
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.530
And, noble Uncle, I beseech Your Grace.

272
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:58.230
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.

273
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:00.300
You are my father,

274
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:04.370
for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive.

275
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.400
Oh, then, my father, will you permit

276
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.300
that I shall stand condemned a wandering vagabond,

277
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.070
my rights and royalties plucked from my arms perforce

278
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.900
and given away to upstart unthrifts?

279
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.530
Wherefore was I born?

280
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.330
If that my cousin king be king in England,

281
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.670
it must be granted I am duke of Lancaster.

282
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:29.000
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin.

283
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.900
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,

284
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.430
he should have found his uncle Gaunt a father

285
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.600
to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.

286
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.030
I am denied to sue my livery here,

287
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.800
and yet my letters patents give me leave.

288
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.430
My father's goods are all distrained and sold,

289
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.630
and these and all are all amiss employed.

290
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.300
What would you have me do?

291
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.700
I am a subject, and I challenge law.

292
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.500
Attorneys are denied me,

293
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.030
and therefore, personally I lay my claim

294
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.130
to my inheritance of free descent.

295
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.500
The noble duke hath been too much abused.

296
00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.530
It stands Your Grace upon to do him right.

297
00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.800
Base men by his endowments are made great.

298
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.100
My lords of England, let me tell you this.

299
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.500
I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs

300
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.970
and labored all I could to do him right.

301
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.930
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,

302
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.900
be his own carver and cut out his way

303
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.200
to find out right with wrong, it may not be.

304
00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.870
And you who do abet him in this kind

305
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.630
cherish rebellion and are rebels all.

306
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:36.630
The noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own.

307
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.830
And for the right of that,

308
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.970
we all have strongly sworn to give him aid

309
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.530
and let him never see joy that breaks that oath.

310
00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.830
Well, well.

311
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.730
I see the issue of these arms.

312
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.630
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,

313
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.400
because my power is weak and all ill left.

314
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.430
But if I could,

315
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.070
by Him that gave me life,

316
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.130
I would attach you all and make you stoop

317
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.630
unto the sovereign mercy of the king.

318
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:10.300
But since I cannot, be it known to you I do remain as neuter.

319
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.670
And so farewell...

320
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.970
unless you please to enter in the castle

321
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.500
and there repose you for this night.

322
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.530
An offer, Uncle, that we will accept.

323
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.370
But we must win Your Grace to go with us to Bristol Castle,

324
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.930
which they say is held by Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,

325
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.500
the caterpillars of the commonwealth,

326
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.230
which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.

327
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.500
It may be that I will go with you.

328
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.370
No, but yet I'll pause,

329
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.370
for I am loath to break our country's laws.

330
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.270
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are.

331
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.500
Things past redress are now with me past care.

332
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.730
My lord of Salisbury, we have stayed ten days

333
00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.570
and hardly kept our countrymen together,

334
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.070
and yet we hear no tidings from the king.

335
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.700
Therefore we will disperse ourselves.

336
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.700
Farewell.

337
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.570
Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman.

338
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.670
The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.

339
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.470
'Tis thought the king is dead.

340
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.070
We will not stay.

341
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.670
The bay trees in our country are all withered

342
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.700
and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven.

343
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.730
The pale faced moon looks bloody on the earth,

344
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.500
and lean looked prophets whisper fearful change.

345
00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:35.000
Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,

346
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.530
the one in fear to lose what they enjoy,

347
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.370
the other to enjoy by rage and war.

348
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:45.100
These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.

349
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.230
Farewell.

350
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.430
Our countrymen have gone and fled,

351
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.270
as well assured Richard, their king, is dead.

352
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.000
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--

353
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.800
since presently your souls must part your bodies--

354
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.870
with too much urging your pernicious lives,

355
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.930
for it were no charity.

356
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.100
Yet to wash your blood from off my hands,

357
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.570
here in the view of men

358
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:15.430
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.

359
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.370
You have misled a prince, a royal king,

360
00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.100
a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,

361
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.200
by you unhappied and disfigured clean.

362
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.000
You have in manner with your sinful hours

363
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.700
made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,

364
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.700
broke the possession of a royal bed,

365
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.900
and stained the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks

366
00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.870
with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.

367
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.300
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,

368
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.030
near to the king in blood--

369
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.830
and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me--

370
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.900
have stooped my neck under your injuries

371
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.630
and sighed my English breath in foreign clouds,

372
00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:03.900
eating the bitter bread of banishment,

373
00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.770
whilst you have fed upon my signories,

374
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:11.570
disparked my parks and felled my forest woods,

375
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.700
from my own windows torn my household coat,

376
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.100
razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,

377
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.270
save men's opinions and my living blood,

378
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.900
to show the world I am a gentleman.

379
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.970
This and much more, much more than twice all this,

380
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.770
condemns you to the death.

381
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.470
See them delivered over to execution and the hand of death.

382
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:37.530
More welcome is the stroke of death to me

383
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.270
than Bolingbroke to England.

384
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.830
Lords, farewell.

385
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.970
My comfort is that heaven will take our souls

386
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.770
and plague injustice with the pains of hell.

387
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.270
My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatched.

388
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.570
Uncle,

389
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.330
you say the queen is at your house.

390
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.470
For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated.

391
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.570
Tell her I send to her my kind commends.

392
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.770
Take special care my greetings be delivered.

393
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.600
A gentleman of mine I have dispatched

394
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.000
with letters of your love to her at large.

395
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.430
Thanks, gentle Uncle.

396
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:25.400
Come, lords; away.

397
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.230
To fight with Glendower and his complices:

398
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.400
awhile to work, and after, holiday.

399
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.100
