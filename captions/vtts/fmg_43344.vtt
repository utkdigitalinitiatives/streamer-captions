00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.030
THERE ARE SOME
GREAT QUESTIONS

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.270
THAT HAVE INTRIGUED
AND HAUNTED US

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.570
SINCE THE DAWN
OF HUMANITY.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.370
WHAT IS
OUT THERE?

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.170
HOW DID WE
GET HERE?

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.970
WHAT IS THE
WORLD MADE OF?

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.370
THE STORY OF OUR SEARCH
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.500
IS THE STORY
OF SCIENCE.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.300
OF ALL HUMAN ENDEAVORS,
SCIENCE HAS HAD

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.130
THE GREATEST IMPACT
ON OUR LIVES...

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.000
ON HOW WE SEE THE WORLD,
ON HOW WE SEE OURSELVES.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.730
ITS IDEAS, ITS ACHIEVEMENTS,
ITS RESULTS ARE ALL AROUND US.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.900
BUT THE STORY OF SCIENCE
HAS BEEN SHAPED AS MUCH

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.970
BY WHAT'S OUTSIDE THE
LABORATORY AS INSIDE.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.200
POWER AND PASSION,
RIVALRY AND SHEER CHANCE

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.230
HAVE ALL PLAYED
SIGNIFICANT ROLES.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.700
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW
HISTORY MADE SCIENCE

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.430
AND HOW SCIENCE
MADE HISTORY.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:33.570


00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.170
THIS TIME, PERHAPS THE
GREATEST PUZZLE OF EXISTENCE.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:49.830


00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.800
INSIDE EVERY ONE OF US
THERE LIES A MYSTERY.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.700
SOMETHING CREATES
THE RICH AND INTENSE

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.400
EXPERIENCE
OF BEING ALIVE.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.730
BUT WHAT
EXACTLY IS IT?

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.030
WHAT IS IT THAT
MAKES A LIVING THING

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.700
SO DIFFERENT FROM
A NON LIVING THING?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.300
THE QUEST TO EXPLAIN THE
SHEER WONDER OF LIFE HAS BEEN

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.730
ONE OF THE MOST ENDURING
CHALLENGES SCIENCE HAS FACED.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.700
THE COMPLETE ANSWER HAS
PROVED TANTALIZING AND ELUSIVE.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.100
BUT WE HAVE COME TO UNDERSTAND
MANY OF THE SECRETS OF LIFE

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.500
BY STUDYING THE CREATURE
THAT INTERESTS US THE MOST:

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.570
OURSELVES.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:02.770


00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.670
ACROSS THE ANCIENT WORLD THERE
WERE LONG RUNNING ARGUMENTS

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.000
ABOUT WHAT
CONSTITUTES LIFE.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.970
FOR 1,500 YEARS
ONE PARTICULAR VIEW

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.530
DOMINATED
WESTERN THOUGHT...

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.370
THE IDEAS OF A ROMAN
CALLED CLAUDIUS GALEN.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.030


00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.670
HIS IDEAS ABOUT LIFE
WERE SHAPED BY

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.600
ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT
AND BLOODY SPECTACLES

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.800
PROVIDED BY THE
ROMAN EMPIRE...

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.070
FOR GALEN STARTED OUT AS
PHYSICIAN TO THE GLADIATORS.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.770
THIS WAS OFTEN A
FIGHT TO THE DEATH.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.970
EVEN FOR THE VICTOR SURVIVAL
WAS NOT ALWAYS GUARANTEED.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.230
TRANSLATOR: FOR EXAMPLE,
TOMBSTONES OF GLADIATORS

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.630
HAVE SURVIVED WHICH SAY
THAT THE GLADIATOR DID NOT DIE

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.330
BECAUSE HE WAS ATTACKED BY
A LION OR KILLED BY A SWORD,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.300
BUT BECAUSE OF
THE INCOMPETENCE

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.130
OF THE DOCTOR
WHO HAD TREATED HIM.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.730
GALEN WAS DETERMINED TO
KEEP HIS GLADIATORS ALIVE.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.830
HIS PREDECESSOR HAD
LOST 60 WOUNDED VICTORS.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.330
GALEN ONLY
LOST FOUR.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.830
BUT GALEN WASN'T JUST
INTERESTED IN PRESERVING LIFE;

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.070
HE WANTED
TO EXPLAIN IT.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.370
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE
WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN BODY

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.600
AND WRITE HIS
FINDINGS DOWN

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.300
BECAME HIS LIFELONG
PASSION AND HIS LEGACY.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.330
TRANSLATOR: THE LIVER
WAS AN IMPORTANT ORGAN

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.970
WITHIN GALEN'S
CONCEPT OF ANATOMY.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.130
BECAUSE THE LIVER
WAS THE PLACE, HE SAID,

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.500
WHERE BLOOD
WAS FORMED.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.730
BLOOD, HE BELIEVED,
CONTAINED WITHIN IT SPIRITS.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.270
THE SPIRITS COME FROM THE LIVER,
THE BRAIN, AND THE HEART.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.030
AND IT'S THESE SPIRITS THAT
WERE THE ESSENCE OF LIFE.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.730
HE WROTE 300 BOOKS
AND PAMPHLETS EXPLAINING

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.330
ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT
THE BODY AND HOW IT WORKS.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.670
HIS WORK WAS
ENCYCLOPEDIC,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.100
BUT IT WAS ALSO
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.500
TRANSLATOR: GALEN BASED
HIS TEACHINGS ON EXAMPLES

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.870
DRAWN FROM ANIMAL ANATOMY,
NOT HUMAN ANATOMY.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.900
FOR EXAMPLE, PIGS, VARIOUS
TYPES OF MONKEYS, SHEEP, GOATS,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:07.130
AND IT IS EVEN SAID THAT GALEN
DISSECTED AN ELEPHANT'S HEART.

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.470
NEVERTHELESS, HIS
SYSTEM FAR SURPASSED

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.100
ANYTHING ELSE
OF THE TIME.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.700
HE BECAME WEALTHY
AND HUGELY INFLUENTIAL.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:27.770


00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.800
REMARKABLY, A SET OF BELIEFS
ABOUT THE BODY LAID DOWN BY

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.500
ONE MAN IN ANCIENT ROME WENT
ON TO BECOME MEDICAL GOSPEL.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.970
FOR MORE THAN A
THOUSAND YEARS

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.600
GALEN'S WORK PROVIDED
THE REFERENCE BOOK OF LIFE.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.300
UNTIL DEVELOPMENTS
IN RENAISSANCE ITALY

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.500
CHANGED THE WAY
WE SEE THE WORLD.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:04.770


00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.470
THE DUOMO
IN FLORENCE.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.500
IT WAS BUILT AT A TIME WHEN
THE CITY STATES OF ITALY

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.570
WERE UNDERGOING
DRAMATIC CHANGE.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.530
THE UPHEAVALS
WOULD GO ON TO AFFECT

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.470
OUR UNDERSTANDING
OF LIFE.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:32.970
ONE CHANGE IN
PARTICULAR BEGAN HERE.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.630
AS WELL AS BUILDING ONE OF
THE ICONS OF THE RENAISSANCE,

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:43.630
FILIPPO BRUNELLESCHI INTRODUCED
A NEW WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.770
IT INVOLVED MATHEMATICS, AND
USING THE CATHEDRAL BUILDINGS

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.970
HE DEMONSTRATED
HOW IT WORKED.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:55.030
<i>MOVE IT UP AND DOWN UNTIL THE
TWO IMAGES MERGE TOGETHER.</i>

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.100
<i>HOLD THIS ONE LIKE THAT AND THEN
MOVE THE MIRROR UP AND DOWN.</i>

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:04.170
BRUNELLESCHI TOOK A PAINTING
OF THE BAPTISTRY AND A MIRROR.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.330
HE ASKED HIS FRIENDS TO LOOK
THROUGH A HOLE IN THE PICTURE

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.700
AND TRY TO LINE
UP THE REFLECTION

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.730
WITH THE BUILDING
IN FRONT OF THEM.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.370
WHAT WAS SO NOVEL AT THE
TIME WAS THAT THE PAINTING

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.330
WAS ACTUALLY A VERY
GOOD THREE DIMENSIONAL

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.130
REPRESENTATION
OF THAT BUILDING.

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.870
<i>THAT'S
REALLY COOL.</i>

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.530
IT'S SO REALISTIC BECAUSE OF
HIS NOVEL APPROACH TO PAINTING.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.900
LINES THAT IN
REALITY ARE PARALLEL

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.530
HE DREW AS CONVERGING
TO A VANISHING POINT.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:40.270
THIS WAS
COUNTER INTUITIVE.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.770
TO MANY
IT STILL IS.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.230
BUT THIS MADE THE PAINTING
ACCURATELY REFLECT

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.500
WHAT WAS SEEN
IN REAL LIFE.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:55.330
IT WAS THE START OF MODERN
PERSPECTIVE PAINTING.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:59.770
IT WOULD SHAPE THE
QUEST TO UNDERSTAND LIFE

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:07.230
BY CREATING A NEW
DESIRE FOR REALISM.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.230
THAT DESIRE CAN BE SEEN
CLEARLY ON THE BODIES

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.330
LOCKED AWAY IN
WINDSOR CASTLE.

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:24.070


00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.770
WINDSOR CASTLE HOUSES
AROUND 600 SKETCHES

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:29.370
BY LEONARDO
DA VINCI,

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.770
INCLUDING EXQUISITE
DRAWINGS OF THE HUMAN BODY.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.870
LEONARDO WAS OF COURSE
ONE OF THE GREATEST ARTISTS

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.400
OF THE RENAISSANCE -
WONDERFUL DRAFTSMAN.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.600
HE HAD A VERY CONCRETE SENSE
OF THREE DIMENSIONALITY.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.900
HE WAS ABLE TO FORM IDEAS IN HIS
HEAD OF HOW STRUCTURES WORKED,

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.770
TURN THEM AROUND IN HIS HEAD
AND GET THEM DOWN ON PAPER

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.270
WITH HIS WONDERFULLY LUCID
METHODS OF REPRESENTATION.

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.130


00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.300
SEEING THE DETAIL OF THESE
DRAWINGS IS LIKE LOOKING BACK

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.700
DIRECTLY INTO THE HEART OF THE
NEW RENAISSANCE VIEW OF LIFE.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:09.930
IT'S IN THESE
PEN STROKES

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.770
THAT YOU CAN SEE
SOMETHING GROUNDBREAKING.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.500
HERE HE'S TRYING TO CUT
MUSCLES AWAY AND LIFT THEM

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.400
AWAY FROM THE POINTS
OF INSERTION AND ORIGIN

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.870
TO SHOW HOW THE BONES ARE
CONNECTED TO THE MUSCLES.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.530
IT'S THAT SORT OF
DIAGRAMMATIC INNOVATION

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.030
WHICH IS SO
IMPRESSIVE AT THIS TIME.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.370
NOBODY HAD MADE ANATOMICAL
DRAWINGS LIKE THIS EVER BEFORE.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.030
NOT EVEN
APPROACHING IT.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:42.800
LEONARDO'S DRAWINGS ARE
PARTICULARLY REALISTIC.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:50.000
UTTERLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY
PRE RENAISSANCE DRAWINGS

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.900
OF THE BODY WHICH USED TO
BE STYLIZED OR SYMBOLIC.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.100
THE CHANGE IN CONCEPTION OF
WHAT AN ANATOMICAL DRAWING

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:03.170
COULD BE, FROM THE
MEDIEVAL YEAR, IF YOU LIKE,

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.870
BEFORE LEONARDO,
IS PROFOUND.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:12.470


00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:16.130
RENAISSANCE ARTISTS
HELPED GIVE NEW IMPETUS

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.670
TO THE STUDY OF
HUMAN ANATOMY.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.200
UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S REALLY
BENEATH THE SKIN WOULD

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.430
OPEN UP NEW AVENUES IN THE
SEARCH FOR THE SECRET OF LIFE.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:47.470


00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.400
ANATOMY STUDIES FLOURISHED
IN THE ITALIAN TOWN OF PADUA,

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.870
ONE OF THE GREAT CENTERS OF
LEARNING IN THE 16TH CENTURY.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:02.730
IN 1594 THE UNIVERSITY BUILT
THIS ANATOMY THEATER...

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:11.430
THE OLDEST SURVIVING STRUCTURE
OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:17.330
TRANSLATOR: THE CREATION
OF AN ANATOMY THEATER

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:21.330
AS A PLACE THAT COULD HOLD A
LARGE NUMBER OF SPECTATORS

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:28.730
CREATED FOR THE FIRST TIME A
SITUATION OF MASS PARTICIPATION.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.800
200 STUDENTS WOULD
HAVE CRAMMED IN HERE,

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.400
AND THEY WERE NOT
CONTENT FOR THEIR

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.100
ANATOMY LESSONS
TO RELY ON ANIMALS...

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.670
THEY WANTED
TO STUDY HUMANS.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:52.470


00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.600
THE CORPSES WOULD
BASICALLY BE THE BODIES

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.400
OF CRIMINALS WHO
HAD BEEN EXECUTED.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:14.200


00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.170
WHAT'S STRIKING ABOUT
DISSECTIONS IN PADUA

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:21.370
WAS THAT THEY WERE DONE
IN A COMPLETELY NEW WAY.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.200
PREVIOUSLY, ANATOMY LESSONS
HAD INVOLVED THE PROFESSOR

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.100
READING FROM GALEN'S BOOK WHILE
DEMONSTRATORS CUT UP A BODY

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.800
AND POINTED OUT THE ORGAN
THAT WAS BEING DESCRIBED.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.700
BUT HERE IN PADUA
STUDENTS WERE ENCOURAGED

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.100
TO DESCRIBE WHAT
THEY ACTUALLY SAW

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.870
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT GALEN'S
BOOK SAID THEY SHOULD SEE.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:52.400
THIS NEW STYLE OF ANATOMY
LESSON WAS A BRAZEN CHALLENGE

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.100
TO ACCEPTED
WISDOM.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.970
IT HAD BEEN PIONEERED BY
ANDREAS VESALIUS WHO WAS

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:05.900
MADE PROFESSOR OF SURGERY
AND ANATOMY AGED JUST 23.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:12.770
HE PUBLISHED A DETAILED
ATLAS OF THE HUMAN BODY

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:19.200
- A NEW BOOK OF LIFE.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.070
AS A RESULT OF MAKING
HIS OWN CAREFUL

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:26.100
OBSERVATIONS OF THE BODY,
VESALIUS CORRECTED

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.770
MISTAKE AFTER MISTAKE
IN ORTHODOX BELIEFS.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.730
TRANSLATOR: IN PARTICULAR
THE ANATOMY OF THE LIVER,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:38.770
THE ANATOMY OF THE HEART,
AND THE ANATOMY OF THE BRAIN.

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:42.630
IN THESE THREE AREAS PRECISE
ANATOMICAL KNOWLEDGE

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.230
ALLOWED ONE TO
UNDERSTAND THE FUNCTION

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:51.170
OF THESE THREE ORGANS IN
A NEW AND DIFFERENT WAY.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.900
BUT VESALIUS DID MORE
THAN SIMPLY CORRECT

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.270
GALEN'S
STRUCTURAL ERRORS.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:03.470
WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT
VESALIUS' WORK IS HIS APPROACH.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.070
HE CAREFULLY
OBSERVED,

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.670
STRIPPING AWAY
LAYER AFTER LAYER.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:14.500
THIS WOULD START
WESTERN MEDICAL SCIENCE

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:20.170
ON A DISTINCT AND
POWERFUL COURSE.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.270
FROM NOW ON THE ESSENCE
OF LIFE WOULD BE SOUGHT

00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.300
BY LOOKING DEEPER AND
DEEPER INTO THE BODY.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.700
AND FOR MOST OF THAT
QUEST THE SECRET OF LIFE

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:38.030
WOULD REMAIN TANTALIZINGLY
JUST OUT OF REACH.

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:49.770


00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.330
ENGLAND.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:55.130
A THOUSAND MILES FROM
RENAISSANCE ITALY.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.130
STRUGGLING WITH
RELIGIOUS DIVISIONS

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:02.230
AND POLITICAL
UPHEAVAL.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:10.900
17TH CENTURY ENGLAND
WAS HEADING FOR CIVIL WAR.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.400
THERE WAS TENSION BETWEEN
THE OLD AND THE NEW...

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:21.170
A CONFLICT EMBODIED
IN THE INQUISITIVE MIND

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:24.570
OF A PHYSICIAN
WORKING HERE

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:31.400
AT ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S
HOSPITAL IN LONDON.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.200
WILLIAM HARVEY WAS IN MANY
RESPECTS A TRADITIONALIST.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:43.300
BUT HE STARTED TO INVESTIGATE
HOW THE BODY WORKS.

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.830
THIS WOULD FORCE
HIM TO CHALLENGE

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:51.100
AND EVENTUALLY
OVERTURN ORTHODOX VIEWS.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.570
WHEREAS VESALIUS HAD
JUST OBSERVED STRUCTURE,

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.500
HARVEY INVESTIGATED
FUNCTION.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:15.070


00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:18.400
HARVEY QUESTIONED THE
WIDELY ACCEPTED BELIEFS

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.770
THAT BLOOD IS
MADE BY THE LIVER

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:27.670
AND CONSUMED BY
THE REST OF THE BODY.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:31.470
ONE OF HIS MOST FAMOUS
EXPERIMENTS WAS TO CALCULATE

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:36.730
THE VOLUME OF BLOOD THAT
PASSES THROUGH THE HEART.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.730
WE'VE GOT SOME PIG HEARTS
HERE AND I'M GOING TO

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.030
FILL UP THE PIG
HEART WITH BLOOD.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:51.270
I'M GOING TO POUR INTO THE
VENTRICLES HERE - A BIT LEAKY.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:55.400
SO HERE WE HAVE ONE
"HEARTFUL" OF BLOOD.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:00.830
AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO
WEIGH THIS ON THE BALANCE

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:05.030
AND IT'S APPROXIMATELY
JUST OVER FOUR OUNCES.

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:07.630
HARVEY CALCULATED THE
NUMBER OF HEARTBEATS

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.500
IN A HALF
HOUR PERIOD.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.600
HE THEN MULTIPLIED THIS
BY THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.130
IN ONE CARDIAC
"EJECTION", IF YOU LIKE,

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:17.500
AND CAME UP WITH A
STAGGERING FIGURE.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.030
HARVEY'S FIGURES SHOW
THAT THE HEART CAN PROPEL

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:27.770
AN ASTONISHING 4,000 LITERS
OF BLOOD EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.630


00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.800
THAT'S AN AWFUL
LOT OF BLOOD.

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.900
NOW IF ACCEPTED WISDOM WAS
CORRECT, THEN THE BODY WAS

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:46.300
MAKING AND USING UP THIS
MUCH BLOOD EVERY 24 HOURS.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.570
THE AMOUNT OF BLOOD WAS
VASTLY IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:55.000
THAT THE LIVER COULD
POSSIBLY PRODUCE DURING A DAY.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.330
HARVEY'S EXPERIMENTS
LED HIM TO ONE CONCLUSION:

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:05.430
BLOOD MUST CIRCULATE
AROUND THE BODY.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.100
THE HEART WAS NO LONGER
JUST A MYSTERIOUS ORGAN

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.630
THAT INFUSES BLOOD
WITH THE ESSENCE OF LIFE.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:20.270
IT WAS NOW
MORE LIKE A PUMP.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.370
HE WAS REALLY PUTTING
FORWARD A VERY RADICAL IDEA.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.870
IT'S A VERY COURAGEOUS
THING TO DO TO OVERTURN

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.430
THE PREVAILING INTELLECTUAL
ETHOS ON ANYTHING

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.670
AND I THINK HARVEY
WAS A VERY BRAVE MAN.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:38.370
HARVEY'S WORK OPENED THE DOOR
TO A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:42.130
IT PROMISED A LESS SPIRITUAL,
MORE PHYSICAL CONCEPT

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.830
OF HOW THE
BODY WORKS.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:52.970


00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.100
THE CHANGE WAS
BORN OUT OF:

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.770
THE REALISM OF
PERSPECTIVE PAINTING...

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:03.670
A NEW OBSERVATIONAL
SCHOOL OF ANATOMY...

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.870
AND HARVEY'S
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.670
THE STAGE WAS
NOW SET FOR A MORE

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.800
MATERIALISTIC
APPROACH TO THE BODY.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.370
AND TO LIFE.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:27.200


00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.370
THIS TOWN CLOCK NEAR PADUA
WAS BUILT IN THE 17TH CENTURY.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.030
A TIME WHEN MECHANICS
WAS HELPING TO EXPLAIN

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.930
THE WORLD
AROUND US.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.870
MEN LIKE GALILEO AND NEWTON
WERE OFFERING A COMPLETELY

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:50.770
NEW VIEW OF THE COSMOS BASED
ON MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:55.100
ITS INTERNAL WORKINGS WERE
LIKENED TO THOSE OF A CLOCK.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.970
COGS, WEIGHTS, PULLEYS
- SIMPLE COMPONENTS

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:04.700
THAT TOGETHER MAKE
A COMPLEX MACHINE.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.300
PEOPLE BEGAN TO WONDER IF
THERE WERE THINGS IN NATURE

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.070
THAT WERE ALSO DRIVEN
BY HIDDEN CLOCKWORK.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.330
WAS THE SAME
TRUE OF US?

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.470
WERE WE JUST
MECHANICAL BEINGS?

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.030
AN ITALIAN MATHEMATICIAN
CALLED GIOVANNI BORELLI

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.530
TOOK THE RIGOROUS ANALYTICAL
METHODS FROM MECHANICS

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:34.430
AND APPLIED THEM
TO THE STUDY OF LIFE.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.400
HE WOULD HOLD HIS ARM OUT
AND THEN PUT AS MUCH WEIGHT

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.170
AS POSSIBLE ON BEFORE HE
COULDN'T HOLD IT ANYMORE.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.570
IF I BRING MY ARM INTO MY
BODY IT'S A LOT EASIER.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.130
IN HIS ATTEMPT TO
UNDERSTAND THE BODY,

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:54.000
BORELLI BROKE IT DOWN
INTO VERY SIMPLE CONCEPTS.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.130
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE
OF A BORELLI ARM.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.800
HERE'S THE WRIST.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.500
AND IF WE THINK OF THESE
ROPES HERE AS MUSCLES,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.430
IF WE SHORTEN THE ROPES LIKE
YOU CONTRACT YOUR MUSCLES,

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.230
WE CAN MOVE
THE JOINT.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.070
HE DEDUCED THAT THE MAIN
POINT OF OUR MUSCLES

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:13.430
IS LESS ABOUT STRENGTH
AND MORE ABOUT MOVEMENT.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.800
BECAUSE IT'S ATTACHED
VERY CLOSE TO THE JOINT

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.030
JUST A SMALL MOVEMENT
IN THE MUSCLE,

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.070
A SMALL CONTRACTION,
CREATES A HUGE MOTION.

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:23.470
IT WAS A MAJOR STEP
TOWARDS EXPLAINING

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.800
HOW OUR BODIES
REALLY WORK.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.800
HAVING BROKEN IT DOWN,
BORELLI COULD NOW

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.830
PUT THE BODY BACK
TOGETHER AGAIN.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.530
SO HERE'S
BORELLI'S MAN.

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:42.300
THIS IS THE HUMAN BODY AS
BORELLI WOULD HAVE SEEN IT.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.030
EACH OF THESE WOODEN
SEGMENTS IS A BONE

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.530
AND EACH OF THESE ROPES
REPRESENTS THE MUSCLES

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:51.200
AND IT'S THE TENSIONING OF
THESE ROPES, OR THE MUSCLES,

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.300
WHICH ALLOWS YOU
TO STAND STRAIGHT UP.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:01.600


00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.670
AND BORELLI DIDN'T
JUST LOOK AT MOVEMENT,

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:07.970
HE ANALYZED THE
INTERNAL ORGANS TOO...

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.670
CALCULATING THE
VOLUME OF THE LUNGS

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.330
AND THE FORCE OF
THE PUMPING HEART.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.370
THOUGH BORELLI'S
CONCEPTS WERE VERY SIMPLE

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.600
AND BROKEN DOWN INTO
VERY SIMPLE TERMS,

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.100
ALMOST ALL OF HIS
POSTULATES STILL HOLD.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.600
THAT GOES FROM THE JOINT
LEVEL TO THE MUSCLE

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:26.570
AND EVEN THE
MUSCLE FIBER LEVEL -

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.000
ALL OF HIS POSTULATES
ARE STILL VALID TODAY.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.100


00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.770
WITH HIS INSIGHTS AND
MATHEMATICAL DESCRIPTIONS

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.000
OF THE BODY, BORELLI
WAS ABLE TO DESCRIBE

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.430
MANY OF THE THINGS
THAT THE BODY CAN DO.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.770
HE SAW THE BODY AS A MACHINE -
A VERY SOPHISTICATED MACHINE,

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.200
BUT A MACHINE
NONETHELESS.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.100


00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:02.700
BORELLI INSPIRED A NEW
SCIENCE OF BIOMECHANICS.

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:09.700
THE LIVING BODY BROKEN
DOWN INTO COMPONENT PARTS.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:19.530
LIFE REDUCED TO
SIMPLE PHYSICAL LAWS.

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.600
BUT FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVED
IN THE MECHANICAL BODY

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.430
THERE WAS A
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:31.030
THIS CLOCK NEEDS TO BE
WOUND UP EVERY 47 HOURS

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:37.500
OTHERWISE IT
SIMPLY STOPS.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:42.400
WHAT WAS THE EQUIVALENT
IN THE HUMAN BODY?

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.100
WHAT WAS THE LIFE
FORCE THAT DRIVES US?

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:55.200
THE QUESTION REKINDLED AN
ANCIENT IDEA KNOWN AS VITALISM.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.970
THE IDEA THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING MORE TO LIFE

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.900
THAN A
PHYSICAL BODY.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.230
SOMETHING
INTANGIBLE...

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:13.470
IN THE 18TH CENTURY MANY
BELIEVED THAT EXTRA SOMETHING

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:19.400
MIGHT LIE IN THE VERY
LATEST SCIENTIFIC MARVEL...

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:25.700
ELECTRICITY.

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.800
NO ONE KNEW
QUITE WHAT IT WAS.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.530
NO ONE KNEW QUITE
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:38.170
AND IN 1771 A RETIRING
DOCTOR CALLED LUIGI GALVANI

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.200
MADE ONE OF THE MOST
PERPLEXING AND IMPORTANT

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.370
DISCOVERIES OF
THE CENTURY.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:47.270
HE'D FOUND THAT
TOUCHING FROGS LEGS

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:52.970
WITH DIFFERENT METALS
WOULD MAKE THEM TWITCH.

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:57.270
GALVANI WAS CONVINCED
THAT ELECTRICITY WAS

00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:02.030
BEING GENERATED FROM
WITHIN THE TISSUE OF THE FROG.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.270
HE CLAIMED TO HAVE
DISCOVERED THE VITAL FORCE,

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:10.000
THE SECRET TO WHAT
MAKES TISSUE ALIVE.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.700
WAS THIS EVIDENCE OF A LINK
BETWEEN MATTER AND SPIRIT?

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:20.630
COULD THIS ANIMAL ELECTRICITY
BE THE SPARK OF LIFE?

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:27.370


00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:34.000
ACROSS EUROPE, EMINENT
RESEARCHERS SET OUT TO FIND OUT.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.900
ONE SCIENTIST WHO
TOOK IT TO EXTREMES

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:43.730
WAS THE GERMAN SCHOLAR
ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:49.630
NERVE SPECIALIST,
DR. DAVID LIEBETANZ,

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.830
WORKS AT HUMBOLDT'S OLD
UNIVERSITY IN GOTTINGEN.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:27:05.330
HE IS PREPARED TO TRY SOME
SIMILAR SELF EXPERIMENTATION.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:10.230
TRANSLATOR: TO BEGIN WITH
I'VE PLACED TWO ELECTRODES

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.470
ON A GROUP
OF MUSCLES,

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.730
AND NOW I WILL PASS
SOME CURRENT THROUGH IT.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:18.600
VON HUMBOLDT'S GOAL WAS
TO ESTABLISH WHETHER

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.230
ANIMAL ELECTRICITY
WAS THE LIFE FORCE

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.700
THAT ANIMATED
THE HUMAN MACHINE.

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.170
TRANSLATOR: YOU CAN
SEE HOW THE HAND AND

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:32.530
PARTICULARLY THE TWO FINGERS
- I CAN'T OPEN THEM ANYMORE.

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.730
I CAN'T STRETCH MY
FINGERS ANYMORE.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.870
DAVID'S MUSCLES ARE
CONTRACTING DUE TO

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.970
CAREFULLY CONTROLLED
ELECTRIC SHOCKS.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:48.400
IN VON HUMBOLDT'S TIME THIS
WAS ALL A LOT MORE RUDIMENTARY.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.830
TRANSLATOR: HE TRIED TO
TRIGGER BIG MOVEMENTS

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.470
IN HIS BACK MUSCLES BY
APPLYING ELECTRICITY

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:58.700
WHICH ALSO ULTIMATELY LED
TO SELF INDUCED BURNS,

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.600
BIG WOUNDS WHICH
THEN BECAME INFLAMED.

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.570
EVEN THIS
DIDN'T STOP HIM.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.630
HE ALSO TRIED TO
USE THESE WOUNDS

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:10.470
TO FEED THE ELECTRICITY
DIRECTLY INTO THE MUSCLES.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:16.730
SO THESE WERE DEFINITELY LIFE
THREATENING EXPERIMENTS.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.700
TO RECAPTURE SOME OF
THE MADNESS AND NOVELTY

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.170
OF HIS ELECTRICAL
WORK 200 YEARS AGO,

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.800
DAVID HAS DEVISED
AN EXPERIMENT

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.530
ADAPTING HIS MACHINE
TO RESPOND TO MUSIC.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:33.430


00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:49.030
♪

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:54.400
VON HUMBOLDT PERFORMED 4,000
EXPERIMENTS WITH ELECTRICITY.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.230
TRANSLATOR: BLIMEY,
THAT WAS EXHAUSTING.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:29:01.700
I'M GLAD
THAT'S OVER.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.630
IT QUICKLY LED TO PEOPLE
BELIEVING YOU COULD ANIMATE

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.400
NOT JUST MUSCLES BUT
ALSO WHOLE ANIMALS,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.570
OR EVEN
HUMAN BEINGS,

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.170
BY APPLYING ELECTRICITY
TO THE BODY.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:17.200


00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.500
OTHER EXPERIMENTERS
AGREED.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.570
THIS SEEMED TO BE
EVIDENCE OF A LINK

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:24.470
BETWEEN MATTER
AND SPIRIT.

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:30.570
THEY TRIED TO USE ELECTRICITY
TO BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.400
AND FAILED.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.730
HOWEVER HARD THEY TRIED,
THEY COULDN'T IMPART LIFE

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:42.130
TO FLESH
AND BLOOD.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.730
THE PROMISE OF ANIMAL
ELECTRICITY PROVED TO BE

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.630
A FALSE DAWN
FOR VITALISTS.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:30:00.500


00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.170
THE SEARCH FOR
THE SECRET OF LIFE

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.700
WOULD NEED A WHOLE
NEW APPROACH TO SCIENCE.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:19.030


00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.900
19TH CENTURY BERLIN.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.430
CAPITAL OF A
NATION ON THE RISE.

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:29.930
THE PRUSSIAN ESTABLISHMENT
BUILT GRAND MONUMENTS

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:33.600
AND GREAT ARMIES.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:42.270
IT INVESTED IN INDUSTRY
AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:50.300
PRUSSIAN ASPIRATIONS SPAWNED
INNOVATIVE WORKING METHODS.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.600
UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, FOR
EXAMPLE, NOW COLLABORATED

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.670
WITH THEIR PROFESSORS
ON NEW RESEARCH.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.770
THIS WAS WHEN
THE MODERN IDEA

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:07.000
OF THE RESEARCH
LABORATORY WAS BORN.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.930
INSTEAD OF LONE GENIUSES THERE
WOULD BE TEAMS OF SCIENTISTS

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.600
TACKLING PROBLEMS,
DOING EXPERIMENTS,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.170
BEING PEER
REVIEWED.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:21.400
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
WOULD NOW BE ORGANIZED,

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.430
SYSTEMIZED,
LEGITIMIZED.

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:31.130
ALL THIS WOULD HAVE A DIRECT
EFFECT ON THE FUTURE OF BIOLOGY

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:37.600
AND FUNDAMENTALLY ALTER
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.800
THIS NEW PRUSSIAN SYSTEM
EXPLOITED A TECHNOLOGY

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.100
THAT HAD BEEN INVENTED
200 YEARS PREVIOUSLY...

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:50.500


00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.730
THE MICROSCOPE.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:58.200
ONE OF THE FIRST TO USE
IT HAD BEEN ROBERT HOOKE

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.400
IN THE 17TH
CENTURY.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.130
HOOKE PUBLISHED A BOOK
FULL OF THE DRAWINGS

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:11.130
OF WHAT HE MANAGED TO SEE
LOOKING DOWN THE MICROSCOPE.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.770
HIS BOOK, <i>MICROGRAPHIA,</i>
HAD REVEALED A WORLD

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.700
NO ONE HAD
SEEN BEFORE.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:24.870
IT WAS STRANGE
AND BEAUTIFUL.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.570
THE MICROSCOPE HAD REVEALED
THE INTRICATE STRUCTURE

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:33.230
OF PLANTS, SNOWFLAKES,
AND NATURAL FIBERS.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:38.100
INSECTS WITH BODY
PARTS ON A SCALE

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.200
NO ONE HAD
IMAGINED POSSIBLE.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:48.500
IT WAS A WORLD OF
UNPRECEDENTED DETAIL.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.430
ONE PICTURE OF
A SLICE OF CORK

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:54.100
IS PERHAPS NOT THE
MOST INTERESTING

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:57.500
BUT IT IS IN FACT
THE MOST IMPORTANT...

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:04.470
BECAUSE THIS IS THE
FIRST DRAWING OF A CELL.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:10.200
HE PICKED A VERY GOOD
MATERIAL TO LOOK AT...

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.270
CORK, BECAUSE YOU
CAN REALLY CLEARLY SEE

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.970
THE OUTLINE
OF THE CELLS.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.830
AND THIS WAS THE FIRST
RECORDED DESCRIPTION

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.830
OF THESE STRUCTURES
AND HE NAMED THEM "CELLS"

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:27.170
BECAUSE THEY LOOKED
LIKE LITTLE ROOMS.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.930
AT THE TIME NO ONE REALIZED
THE TRUE SIGNIFICANCE

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.230
OF WHAT
HE HAD SEEN.

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:37.300
AND THE IDEA OF THE CELL
WOULD LANGUISH IN OBSCURITY

00:33:37.300 --> 00:33:40.530
FOR 200 YEARS.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.370


00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:48.600
THE CELL FINALLY RESURFACED
IN THE MID 19TH CENTURY

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.930
IN THE RESEARCH
LABORATORIES OF PRUSSIA.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:57.400


00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.230
THERE WAS NOW
A MICROSCOPE,

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:06.370
A WAY OF DELVING DEEPER INTO
LIFE, ON EVERY LAB BENCH.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:12.670
AND RESEARCHERS NOW
SAW CELLS NOT JUST IN CORK

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:17.000
BUT IN OTHER
PLANTS...

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.270
AND IN ANIMALS.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:26.770
THEIR BASIC FINDING WAS THAT
ALL LIFE IS MADE UP OF CELLS.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:32.500
IT WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL
AT THE TIME OF ITS DISCOVERY.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.570
PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS LIFE

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:38.070
AND WHAT
WASN'T LIFE.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:42.630
AND THE REVELATIONS ABOUT
THE CELL HAD ONLY JUST BEGUN.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:45.970
A LITTLE KNOWN GERMAN
CALLED ROBERT REMAK

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:51.770
STUDIED FROG SPAWN AND
RECORDED A REMARKABLE PROCESS.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.630
HE COULD OBSERVE THAT CELLS
WERE COMING FROM EACH OTHER

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.370
BECAUSE HE COULD SEE THEM,
HE COULD WATCH THEM,

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.500
HE COULD OBSERVE
THEM DIVIDING.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.730
SEEN IN TIME LAPSE, AT
FIRST THE CELLS ARE SIMPLY

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.130
REPLICATING
AND DIVIDING.

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:15.570
THEN SLOWLY THE CELLS
START TO SPECIALIZE

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:22.500
AND FORM THE DIFFERENT BODY
PARTS OF THE JUVENILE FROG.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.770
THIS WAS THE FIRST
OBSERVATION THAT

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.100
REALLY SHOWED YOU THAT
ALL THE CELLS OF THE BODY

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.300
THROUGH THIS
DIVISION PROCESS

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.700
GIVE RISE TO EVERY
OTHER CELL IN THE BODY.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:38.570
AND IT ISN'T JUST THE HUMBLE
TADPOLE THAT GROWS LIKE THIS.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:48.870


00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:56.300
THE MICROSCOPE HAD REVEALED
TWO FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF LIFE.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:03.070
EVERY LIVING THING ON THE
PLANET IS MADE OF CELLS

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:08.430
AND CELLS ONLY COME
FROM OTHER CELLS.

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:15.200
UNDERSTAND THE CELL AND YOU'D
UNDERSTAND WHAT LIFE WAS.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:22.600


00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:27.330
EXCEPT IT WASN'T
AS EASY AS ALL THAT.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.530
BECAUSE EVEN WITH
THE BEST MICROSCOPES,

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:34.370
THIS IS ALL
THEY COULD SEE...

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:40.430
A NUCLEUS IN A
TRANSLUCENT MUSH.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:46.570
THE SECRET OF LIFE, ONCE AGAIN,
HAD SLIPPED OUT OF REACH.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.530


00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:53.000
IF BIOLOGISTS WERE TO
MAKE FURTHER PROGRESS

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.630
THEY HAD TO FIND A WAY TO
MAKE THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE.

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:05.130


00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:11.800
IN THE 1850'S SYNTHETIC
DYES BURST ONTO THE SCENE

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.700
CREATING A WHOLE
NEW PALLET.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:21.570
FASHION DROVE
THE DEMAND.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:25.570
PAINTING AND THE ARTS
WERE ALSO REVITALIZED.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:30.370


00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.770
ARTIFICIAL COLORS WERE
MADE BY GERMAN CHEMISTS

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:37.170
ON AN INDUSTRIAL
SCALE...

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:42.030
AND THEY TRANSFORMED
THE SEARCH FOR LIFE.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:45.030
THE DIFFERENT CHEMICALS
USED MEANT THAT DIFFERENT

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:49.470
COLORED DYES WERE ABLE TO STAIN
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CELL.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:53.030
THERE WERE STAINS THAT
WILL LABEL YOUR NUCLEI

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:57.070
AND THERE ARE STAINS THAT WILL
LABEL THE OUTSIDE OF THE CELL.

00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:59.100
THEY WERE DISCOVERING
THINGS BECAUSE

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.570
THEY WERE THE FIRST
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:06.070
THEY FOUND
INTERNAL MEMBRANES,

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.500
PROTEIN STRUCTURES
AND ENERGY STORES.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.030
BUT WHAT STOOD
OUT IN PARTICULAR -

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:18.200
INSIDE THE NUCLEUS
WERE THE CHROMOSOMES.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.400
CHROMOSOMES, MEANING
"COLORED BODIES",

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:25.170
WERE NAMED AFTER THE DYES
THAT HELPED REVEAL THEM.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:27.870
AND THEY CLEARLY
PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:33.670
WHEN A CELL DIVIDES
AND REPLICATES.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.330
IT SEEMED THIS WAS WHERE
THE SECRET OF LIFE MUST LIE.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:44.200


00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.230
THIS NEW UNIT OF LIFE, THE
CHROMOSOME, HAD EMERGED

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:53.430
FROM THE RISE OF GERMANY
AS A WORLD POWER...

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.630
ITS CREATION OF
RESEARCH LABORATORIES...

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:01.530
AND ITS INVESTMENT IN THE
CHEMICAL DYE INDUSTRY.

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:03.830
THESE FACTORS
HAD BROUGHT US

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:10.170
TANTALIZINGLY CLOSE TO A
NEW UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:18.330
BUT IT SEEMS AS IF SCIENCE
NEVER SOLVES ONE PROBLEM

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.470
WITHOUT CREATING
SEVERAL MORE.

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.700
HAVING IDENTIFIED
THE CHROMOSOMES

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.170
IT WAS CLEAR THAT
RESEARCHERS WOULD NEED TO

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:30.530
FIND OUT HOW THEY WORKED,
HOW THEY REPLICATED...

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:34.500
AND THAT WOULD
NOT BE EASY.

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:42.870


00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:49.170
THE STORY OF SCIENCE HAS NEVER
BEEN A STRAIGHTFORWARD ONE.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:53.130
THE NEXT STAGE SEEMS TO HAVE
LITTLE TO DO WITH BIOLOGY.

00:39:53.130 --> 00:40:00.630
IT INVOLVED A MORAL
CRISIS IN A SECRETIVE TOWN.

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:05.430
IT WAS A TOWN
WITH NO NAME.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:08.630
IT DID NOT
APPEAR ON MAPS,

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:14.900
BUT IT CONSUMED MORE
ELECTRICITY THAN NEW YORK.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.170
OAK RIDGE, TENNESSEE
WAS PART OF THE BIGGEST

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:22.470
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
PROJECT IN HISTORY:

00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:26.630
THE MANHATTAN
PROJECT.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:32.070
ITS AIM: TO CREATE
A NUCLEAR BOMB.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:36.170


00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.300
THE REACTORS HERE IN OAK
RIDGE PRODUCED THE URANIUM

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.230
FOR THE BOMB
DROPPED ON HIROSHIMA.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:52.570


00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:57.270
THE BOMB CONTAINED 64
KILOS OF URANIUM OF WHICH

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:02.900
ONLY ABOUT HALF A GRAM WAS
TURNED INTO PURE ENERGY.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.200
BUT THIS
WAS ENOUGH.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:21.930


00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.670
THERE HAVE BEEN FEW
MORE SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:28.000
FOR SCIENCE
THAN THIS...

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.870
IT CHANGED
SO MUCH.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.470
THE CREATION OF AN
INSTRUMENT OF DEATH

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:44.100
WOULD EVEN IMPACT ON
THE SCIENCE OF LIFE.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.330
MANY OF THE SCIENTISTS
WHO'D HELPED MAKE THE BOMB

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.200
NOW WANTED
OUT OF PHYSICS.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.600
IT WAS TAINTED.

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.530
THEY WANTED SOMETHING
MORE LIFE AFFIRMING.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:05.770
AND MANY OF THEM
FOUND IT IN BIOLOGY.

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:10.870
AFTER THE WAR A PHYSICIST
CALLED MAURICE WILKINS

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.670
CAME HERE TO KING'S
COLLEGE LONDON

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.370
TO STUDY THE
ENIGMATIC CHROMOSOME.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:20.230
WHAT HE STARTED HERE
WOULD LEAD TO ONE OF THE

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:24.300
GREAT SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES
OF THE 20TH CENTURY

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:29.430
AND TRANSFORM OUR
UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.730
IT BEGAN INNOCUOUSLY ENOUGH
WHEN HE STARTED TO INVESTIGATE

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:38.100
ONE OF THE CHEMICALS
FOUND INSIDE CHROMOSOMES.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.470
I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO EXTRACT
SOME DNA FROM MY OWN CELLS.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:46.330


00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:50.900
ALL IT TAKES IS A
LITTLE SALT WATER.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.200
JUST GOING TO
POUR THIS INTO HERE...

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.430
SOME WASHING
UP LIQUID.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.200
DO THIS FOR
SEVERAL SECONDS...

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.930
AND A SPLASH OF
ICE COLD ALCOHOL.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:05.900
I CAN SEE THESE FIBERS
NOW SO I'M ACTUALLY

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.030
LOOKING AT MY DNA
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:10.430
I'VE NEVER DONE
THIS BEFORE.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:13.000
THERE'S AN EXTRAORDINARILY
LONG FIBER THERE.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.300
TODAY, DNA IS OFTEN
CALLED THE SECRET OF LIFE.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:22.400
BUT IS IT REALLY?

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.670
BACK IN THE 1950'S THEY
REALIZED THAT DNA WAS SPECIAL

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:30.830
THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW
AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT IT.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.100
MAURICE WILKINS REALIZED
THAT HE'D BE ABLE TO BRING

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.370
HIS PHYSICIST TECHNIQUES
TO BEAR ON MATERIAL LIKE THIS

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:41.470
AND HOPEFULLY ELUCIDATE THE
STRUCTURE OF THE MOLECULE

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.230
AND FROM THAT
LEARN ITS FUNCTION.

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:47.930
HIS WEAPON OF CHOICE
WAS A TECHNIQUE CALLED

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:50.730
"X-RAY DIFFRACTION".

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:58.600
X-RAYS FIRED AT THE DNA HIT THE
MOLECULE AND GET SCATTERED.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.900
THE PATTERN OF THE
SCATTERING CAN BE USED

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:05.800
TO CALCULATE THE
SHAPE OF THE MOLECULE.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.730
THIS ESSENTIALLY
IS A PHOTOGRAPH

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.630
OF A MOLECULE'S
SHADOW.

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:18.700


00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.730
JOINING WILKINS' DEPARTMENT
WAS ONE OF THE BEST

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:25.370
X-RAY DIFFRACTION
EXPERTS AROUND:

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.130
ROSALIND FRANKLIN.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:31.530
IN HERE IS THE ORIGINAL
SAMPLE OF DNA THAT SHE USED.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.570
AND IN HER HANDWRITING
IT REFERS TO THE SAMPLE

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.300
AND WHERE IT
CAME FROM.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.430
YOU CAN DRAW
FIBERS OF THE DNA

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.170
AND THIS HERE STILL IS
AN INTACT DRAWN FIBER

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.070
IN A LITTLE RIG MADE
OUT OF A PAPER CLIP.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:47.070
SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS TAKING
THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND THE DATA

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:50.470
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY
PROVE THE STRUCTURE.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:53.230
BUT SHE HAD
COMPETITION.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.400
IN CAMBRIDGE A DIFFERENT
TEAM WAS ALSO RACING

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.570
TO MAKE
SENSE OF DNA.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:02.470
FRANCIS CRICK, ANOTHER
FORMER PHYSICIST,

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:06.530
AND JAMES WATSON,
WERE BUILDING MODELS.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:11.070
IN APRIL 1953
THEY PUBLISHED...

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:16.600
THE FAMOUS
DOUBLE HELIX.

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:20.470
THEY GOT THE GLORY, BUT
THEIR MODEL WAS INSPIRED

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:24.400
BY ONE OF FRANKLIN'S
PHOTOGRAPHS

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.930
SHOWN TO WATSON WITHOUT
FRANKLIN'S KNOWLEDGE.

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:33.030
HERE IS THE FAMOUS
PHOTOGRAPH, #51.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:36.830
IT WAS WHEN JIM WATSON SAW
THIS PARTICULAR PHOTOGRAPH

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:40.730
AND HE REALIZED HOW CLEAR
THE EVIDENCE WAS FOR A HELIX

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:44.870
THAT THEY WERE ABLE
TO COMPLETE THE MODEL

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.300
THAT TURNED OUT
TO BE CORRECT.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:54.270


00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:59.030
THE SECRET OF DNA HAD
BEEN UNLOCKED BY PHYSICS.

00:45:59.030 --> 00:46:03.570
IT WAS THIS HELICAL SHAPE -
TWO STRANDS CLOSELY ENTWINED

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:06.770
- WHICH NEATLY EXPLAINED
HOW A CELL DIVIDES,

00:46:06.770 --> 00:46:10.670
HOW IT REPLICATES,
AND UNTIL NOW

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:16.070
THAT HAD BEEN ONE OF
BIOLOGY'S GREATEST MYSTERIES.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:20.070


00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:28.900
DNA SOON BECAME THE FOUNDATION
OF A NEW SCIENCE OF LIFE.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:35.800
BUT IS IT THE
SECRET OF LIFE?

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:40.530
IN THE LAST 50 YEARS WE'VE
UNCOVERED A VAST AMOUNT

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:45.100
OF OUR DNA - WHAT IT'S MADE
UP OF, HOW IT FUNCTIONS -

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:51.700
AND WE CAN EVEN
CREATE DNA IN THE LAB.

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.930
BUT WE'VE ALSO
DISCOVERED THAT DNA

00:46:55.930 --> 00:47:00.130
IS NOT ENOUGH
TO CREATE LIFE.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:03.600
DNA IS SIMPLY A SET
OF INSTRUCTIONS

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.730
AND IT NEEDS TO BE READ
BY OTHER MOLECULES.

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:14.070
AND DNA CAN EVEN BE MODIFIED BY
OTHER PARTS OF THE SAME CELL.

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:17.500
THIS CIRCULAR FEEDBACK
MEANS LIFE CANNOT BE

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:20.370
PINNED DOWN TO
ONE COMPONENT.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.700
IN SHORT, TO
CREATE LIFE

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:27.830
YOU ABSOLUTELY
NEED THE WHOLE CELL.

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:33.470


00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:36.700
THE PROCESS OF DELVING
EVER DEEPER INTO THE BODY

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.230
HAS DISCOVERED
SO MUCH.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:46.830
IT HAS CREATED MODERN
BIOLOGY, BUT IT HAS ALSO

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.770
SHOWN THAT THE SECRET
OF LIFE DOES NOT LIE

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:55.570
IN SIMPLICITY, IN ANY ONE
CHEMICAL OR PROCESS.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:48:01.370
THE ESSENCE OF LIFE
MUST LIE IN COMPLEXITY.

00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:09.170
ONE DAY WE PROBABLY
WILL UNDERSTAND

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:12.830
HOW ALL THE COMPONENTS
IN THE CELL COMBINE,

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:16.930
HOW THEY
CREATE LIFE.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:21.100
BUT EVEN THEN, THAT
WOULD BE PRIMITIVE.

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.670
ONLY ONE CELL...

00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:26.870
IT IS A MASSIVE STEP FROM
THAT TO THE COMBINATION OF

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:32.770
BILLIONS OF CELLS WHICH
MAKE UP EACH OF OUR BODIES.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.100
WE HAVE GONE ON AN
ENORMOUS JOURNEY

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.230
TO GET WHERE
WE ARE TODAY.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:39.330
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO UNDERSTANDING

00:48:39.330 --> 00:48:47.830
THE COMPLEXITY OF LIFE WE
STILL HAVE A HUGE WAY TO GO.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.270
ONCE AGAIN, THE
ENIGMATIC SECRET OF LIFE

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:56.700
HAS SLIPPED AWAY.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.700
