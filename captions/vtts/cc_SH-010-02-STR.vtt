2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.400
Will you stay no longer?

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.270
nor will you not thatI go with you?

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.600
By your patience, no. Mystars shine darkly over me:

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.170
the malignancy of my fate mightperhaps distemper yours;

6
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.870
therefore I shall craveof you your leave

7
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.970
that I may bear my evilsalone: it were a bad

8
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.470
recompense for your love,to lay any of them on you.

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.530
: Let me yet know of youwhither you are bound.

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.400
No, sooth, sir: my determinatevoyage is mere extravagancy.

11
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.770
But I perceive inyou so excellent

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.000
a touch of modesty, that youwill not extort from me

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.930
what I am willing to keep in;

14
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.870
therefore it charges me

15
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.670
in manners the ratherto express myself.

16
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.870
You must know of me then,Antonio, my name is Sebastian,

17
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.570
which I called Roderigo.My father was that

18
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.830
Sebastian of Messaline, whomI know you have heard of.

19
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.630
He left behind himmyself and a sister,

20
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.300
both born in an hour: if theheavens had been pleased,

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.700
would we had so ended! butyou, sir, altered that;

22
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.800
for some hour before youtook me from the breach of

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.370
the sea was my sisterdrowned.

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.630
Alas the day!

25
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.170
A lady, sir, though it wassaid she much resembled me,

26
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.900
was yet of manyaccounted beautiful:

27
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.170
but, though I could notwith such estimable wonder

28
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.770
overfar believe that, yet thusfar I will boldly publish her;

29
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.070
she bore a mind that envycould not but call fair.

30
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.000
She is drowned already,sir, with salt water,

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.230
though I seem to drown herremembrance again with more.

32
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.200
Pardon me, sir, your badentertainment.

33
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.630
O good Antonio, forgive meyour trouble.

34
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.170
If you will not murderme for my love,

35
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.430
let me be your servant.

36
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.530
If you will not undo whatyou have done, that is,

37
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.570
kill him whom you haverecovered, desire it not.

38
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.270
Fare ye well at once: mybosom is full of kindness,

39
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.130
and I am yet so near themanners of my mother,

40
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.770
that upon the least occasionmore mine eyes will tell

41
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.800
tales of me. I am bound to theCount Orsino's court: farewell.

42
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.170
The gentleness of all thegods go with thee!

43
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.070
I have many enemies inOrsino's court,

44
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.530
Else would I very shortlysee thee there.

45
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.370
But, come what may, I doadore thee so,

46
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.100
That danger shall seemsport, and I will go.

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.130
Approach, Sir Andrew:

48
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.130
not to be abed after midnightis to be up betimes;

49
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.500
and 'diluculo surgere,'thou know'st,--

50
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.800
Nay, my troth, I knownot: but I know,

51
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.000
to be up late is to be up late.

52
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.430
A false conclusion: I hateit as an unfilled can.

53
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.070
To be up after midnight andto go to bed then, is early:

54
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.070
so that to go tobed after midnight

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.200
is to go to bed betimes.

56
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.000
Does not our life consistof the four elements?

57
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.330
Faith, so they say; but Ithink it rather consists

58
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.900
of eating and drinking.

59
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.130
Thou'rt a scholar; let ustherefore eat and drink.

60
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.330
Marian, I say! a stoup ofwine!

61
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.570
Here comes the fool, i'faith.

62
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.870
How now, my hearts! didyou never see the picture

63
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.070
of 'we three'?

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.270
Welcome, ass. Now let'shave a catch.

65
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.700
By my troth, the fool hasan excellent breast.

66
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.970
I had rather than fortyshillings I had such a leg,

67
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.100
and so sweet a breath tosing, as the fool has.

68
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.830
Come on; there is sixpencefor thee: let's have a song.

69
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.130
There's a testril of metoo: if one knight give a--

70
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.770
Would you have a love-song,or a song of good life?

71
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.430
A love-song, a love-song.

72
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.070
Ay, ay: I care not forgood life.

73

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.530
O mistress mine, where areyou roaming?

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.470
O, stay and hear; yourtrue love's coming,

76
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.230
That can sing both highand low:

77

Trip no further, prettysweeting;

78
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.830
Journeys end in loversmeeting,

Every wise man's son dothknow.

80
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.670
Excellent good, i' faith.

Youth's a stuff will notendure.

A mellifluous voice, as Iam true knight.

90
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.830
A contagious breath.

91
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.470
Very sweet and contagious,i' faith.

92
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.000
To hear by the nose, it isdulcet in contagion.

93
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.370
But shall we make thewelkin dance indeed?

94
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.130
shall we rouse the night-owl ina catch that will draw three

95

souls out of one weaver?shall we do that?

An you love me, let'sdo't: I am dog at a catch.

97
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.770
By'r lady, sir, and somedogs will catch well.

98
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.430
Most certain. Let ourcatch be, 'Thou knave.'

'Hold thy peace, thouknave,' knight?

100

I shall be constrained in'tto call thee knave, knight.

If my lady have not calledup her steward Malvolio

108
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.270
and bid him turn you outof doors, never trust me.

109
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.530
My lady's a Cataian, we arepoliticians, Malvolio's

Beshrew me, the knight'sin admirable fooling.

Ay, he does well enoughif he be disposed,

and so do I too: he doesit with a better grace,

but to gabble like tinkersat this time of night?

Do ye make an alehouseof my lady's house,

without any mitigationor remorse of voice?

127

Is there no respect of place,persons, nor time in you?

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:28.300
We did keep time, sir, inour catches. Sneck up!

129
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.130
Sir Toby, I must be round withyou. My lady bade me tell you,

130
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.070
that, though she harboursyou as her kinsman,

131
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.670
she's nothing alliedto your disorders.

132
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.470
If you can separate yourselfand your misdemeanors,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.530
you are welcome tothe house; if not,

134

'But I will never die.'

Sir Toby, there you lie.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.030
This is much credit toyou.

Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Artany more than a steward?

Yes, by Saint Anne, and gingershall be hot i' the mouth too.

166
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.870
let me alone with him: if I donot gull him into a nayword,

and make him acommon recreation,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.530
do not think I have wit enoughto lie straight in my bed:

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.600
I know I can do it.

Possess us, possess us;tell us something of him.

Marry, sir, sometimes heis a kind of puritan.

O, if I thought that I'ldbeat him like a dog!

173
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.900
What, for being a puritan? thyexquisite reason, dear knight?

174
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.330
I have no exquisitereason for't,

175
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.730
but I have reasongood enough.

176
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.200
The devil a puritan that heis, or any thing constantly,

177
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.030
but a time-pleaser;an affectioned ass,

178
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.500
that cons state without book

179
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.630
and utters it by great swarths:the best persuaded of himself,

180
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.070
so crammed, as he thinks,with excellencies,

181
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.330
that it is his grounds of faith

182
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.170
that all that lookon him love him;

183
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.270
and on that vicein him

184
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.870
will my revenge findnotable cause to work.

185
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.170
What wilt thou do?

186
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.730
I will drop in his way someobscure epistles of love;

187
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.800
wherein, by thecolour of his beard,

188
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.200
the shape of his leg,the manner of his gait,

189
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.030
the expressure of his eye,forehead, and complexion,

190
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.400
he shall find himself mostfeelingly personated.

191
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.570
I can write very likemy lady your niece:

192
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.670
on a forgotten matter

193
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.870
we can hardly makedistinction of our hands.

194
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.170
Excellent! I smell adevice.

195
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.000
I have't in my nose too.

196
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.830
He shall think, by theletters that thou wilt drop,

197
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.770
that they come from my niece,

198
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.230
and that she's inlove with him.

199
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.170
My purpose is, indeed, ahorse of that colour.

200
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.470
And your horse now wouldmake him an ass.

201
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.870
Ass, I doubt not.

202
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.530
O, 'twill be admirable!

203
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.630
Sport royal, I warrant you:

204
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.000
I know my physic will work withhim. I will plant you two,

205
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.300
and let the fool make a third,where he shall find the letter:

206
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.200
observe his construction of it.

207
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.600
For this night, to bed,and dream on the event.

208
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.270
Farewell. Goodnight, Penthesilea.

209
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.830
Before me, she's a goodwench.

210
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:13.200
She's a beagle, true-bred,and one that adores me:

211
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.700
what o' that?

212
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.130
I was adored once too.

213
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.470
Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadstneed send for more money.

214
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.270
If I cannot recover yourniece, I am a foul way out.

215
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.900
Send for money, knight: ifthou hast her not i' the end,

216
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.600
call me cut.

217
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.530
If I do not, never trustme, take it how you will.

218
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:53.200
Come, come, I'll go burnsome sack; 'tis too late

219
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.070
to go to bed now: come,knight; come, knight.

220
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.670
(â™ªSings a song)

221
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:18.370
What is love? 'tis nothereafter;

222
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:24.330
Present mirth hath presentlaughter;

223
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.570
What's to come is stillunsure:

224
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.000
In delay there lies noplenty;

225
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.330
Then come kiss me, sweetand twenty,

226
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:47.930
Youth's a stuff will notendure.

227
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.500
Give me some music. Now,good morrow, friends.

228
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.430
Now, good Cesario, butthat piece of song,

229
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.970
That old and antique songwe heard last night:

230
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.330
Methought it did relievemy passion much,

231
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.900
More than light airs andrecollected terms

232
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.800
Of these most brisk andgiddy-paced times:

233
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.300
Come, but one verse.

234
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.530
He is not here, so please yourlordship that should sing it.

235
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.600
Who was it?

236
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.270
Feste, the jester, mylord; a fool that the lady

237
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.330
Olivia's father tookmuch delight in.

238
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.470
He is about thehouse. Seek him out,

239
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.670
and play the tune the while.

240
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.370
Come hither, boy:

241
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.400
(â™ªMusic plays)

242
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.700
if ever thou shalt love,

243
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.030
In the sweet pangs of itremember me;

244
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.270
For such as I am all truelovers are,

245
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.570
Unstaid and skittish inall motions else,

246
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.770
Save in the constant imageof the creature

247
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:59.030
That is beloved. How dostthou like this tune?

248
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.070
It gives a very echo tothe seat

249
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.330
Where Love is throned.

250
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.300
Thou dost speak masterly:

251
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.700
My life upon't, youngthough thou art,

252
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.030
thine eye Hath stay'd uponsome favour that it loves:

253
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.000
Hath it not, boy?

254
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.530
A little, by your favour.

255
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.330
What kind of woman is't?

256
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.670
Of your complexion.

257
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.930
She is not worth thee,then. What years, i' faith?

258
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.130
About your years, my lord.

259
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.170
Too old by heaven: letstill the woman take

260
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.870
An elder than herself: sowears she to him,

261
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.930
So sways she level in herhusband's heart:

262
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.730
For, boy, however we dopraise ourselves,

263
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.630
Our fancies are more giddyand unfirm,

264
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.870
More longing, wavering,sooner lost and worn,

265
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.730
Than women's are.

266
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.200
I think it well, my lord.

267
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.070
Then let thy love beyounger than thyself,

268
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.730
Or thy affection cannothold the bent;

269
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.670
For women are as roses,whose fair flower

270
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.270
Being once display'd, dothfall that very hour.

271
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.800
And so they are: alas,that they are so;

272
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.430
To die, even when they toperfection grow!

273
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.200
O, fellow, come, the songwe had last night.

274
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.330
Mark it, Cesario, it isold and plain;

275
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.130
The spinsters and theknitters in the sun

276
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.300
And the free maids that weavetheir thread with bones

277
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.300
Do use to chant it: it issilly sooth,

278
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.870
And dallies with theinnocence of love,

279
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.900
Like the old age.

280
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.330
Are you ready, sir?

281
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.630
Ay; prithee, sing.

282
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.630
(â™ªSONG)

283
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.830
Come away, come away,death,

284
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:40.630
And in sad cypress let mebe laid;

285
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:46.300
Fly away, fly away breath;

286
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:53.230
I am slain by a fair cruelmaid.

287
00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:01.430
My shroud of white, stuckall with yew,

288
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:07.470
O, prepare it!

289
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:14.530
My part of death, no oneso true

290
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:25.000
No one, no one, Did share it.

291
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.230
Not a flower, not a flowersweet

292
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:39.300
On my black coffin letthere be strown;

293
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.570
Not a friend, not a friendgreet

294
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:53.570
My poor corpse, where mybones shall be thrown:

295
00:17:53.570 --> 00:18:00.130
A thousand thousand sighsto save,

296
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:06.870
Lay me, O, where

297
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:13.570
Sad true lover never findmy grave,

298
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:23.500
To weep there! â™ª

299
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.970
There's for thy pains.

300
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.170
No pains, sir: I takepleasure in singing, sir.

301
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.000
I'll pay thy pleasurethen.

302
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.030
Truly, sir, and pleasure willbe paid, one time or another.

303
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.300
Give me now leave to leavethee.

304
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.700
Now, the melancholygod protect thee;

305
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.430
and the tailor make thy doubletof changeable taffeta,

306
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.130
for thy mind is a very opal.

307
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.030
I would have men of suchconstancy put to sea,

308
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.530
that their businessmight be every thing

309
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.400
and their intent every where;

310
00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.070
for that's it that always makesa good voyage of nothing.

311
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.500
Farewell. Let all therest give place.

312
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.200
Once more, Cesario,

313
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.130
Get thee to yond samesovereign cruelty:

314
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.930
Tell her, my love, morenoble than the world,

315
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.070
Prizes not quantity ofdirty lands;

316
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.900
The parts that fortunehath bestow'd upon her,

317
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.470
Tell her, I hold asgiddily as fortune;

318
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.370
But 'tis that miracle andqueen of gems

319
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.600
That nature pranks her inattracts my soul.

320
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.100
But if she cannot loveyou, sir?

321
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.370
I cannot be so answer'd.

322
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.500
Sooth, but you must.

323
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.970
Say that some lady, asperhaps there is,

324
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.330
Hath for your love a greata pang of heart

325
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.070
As you have for Olivia:you cannot love her;

326
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.800
You tell her so; must shenot then be answer'd?

327
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.930
There is no woman's sides

328
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.700
Can bide the beating of sostrong a passion

329
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.700
As love doth give myheart; no woman's heart

330
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.800
So big, to hold so much;they lack retention

331
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.500
Alas, their love may becall'd appetite,

332
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.100
No motion of the liver,but the palate,

333
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.200
That suffer surfeit,cloyment and revolt;

334
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.000
But mine is all as hungryas the sea,

335
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.370
And can digest as much:make no compare

336
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.470
Between that love a womancan bear me

337
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.600
And that I owe Olivia.

338
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.200
Ay, but I know--

339
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.070
What dost thou know?

340
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.100
Too well what love womento men may owe:

341
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:39.630
In faith, they are as trueof heart as we.

342
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.630
My father had a daughterloved a man,

343
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.500
As it might be, perhaps,were I a woman,

344
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.600
I should your lordship.

345
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.270
And what's her history?

346
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:54.370
A blank, my lord. Shenever told her love,

347
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.100
But let concealment, likea worm i' the bud,

348
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.170
Feed on her damask cheek:she pined in thought,

349
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.930
And with a green andyellow melancholy

350
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.470
She sat like patience on amonument,

351
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:13.030
Smiling at grief. Was notthis love indeed?

352
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.530
We men may say more, swearmore: but indeed

353
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.570
Our shows are more thanwill; for still we prove

354
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.130
Much in our vows, butlittle in our love.

355
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.070
But died thy sister of herlove, my boy?

356
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.000
I am all the daughters ofmy father's house,

357
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.530
And all the brothers too:and yet I know not.

358
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.270
Sir, shall I to this lady?

359
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.870
Ay, that's the theme.

360
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.770
To her in haste; give herthis jewel; say,

361
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:55.900
My love can give no place,bide no denay.

362
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.870


363
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.530
Come thy ways, SigniorFabian.

364
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.570
Nay, I'll come: if I losea scruple of this sport,

365
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.700
let me be boiled to deathwith melancholy.

366
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.330
Wouldst thou not be gladto have the niggardly

367
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.330
rascally sheep-biter comeby some notable shame?

368
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.170
I would exult, man: youknow, he brought me out o'

369
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.300
favour with my lady abouta bear-baiting here.

370
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.200
To anger him we'llhave the bear again;

371
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.400
and we will fool him black andblue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?

372
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.370
An we do not, it is pityof our lives.

373
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.100
Here comes the littlevillain.

374
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.530
How now, my metal ofIndia!

375
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.300
Get ye all threeinto the box-tree:

376
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.330
Malvolio's comingdown this walk:

377
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.470
he has been yonder i' the sun

378
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.630
practising behavior to hisown shadow this half hour:

379
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.500
observe him, for thelove of mockery;

380
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.930
for I know this letter will makea contemplative idiot of him.

381
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:44.330
Close, in the name ofjesting! Lie thou there,

382
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.000
for here comes the trout thatmust be caught with tickling.

383
00:22:53.970 --> 00:23:00.300
'Tis but fortune;all is fortune.

384
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.400
Maria once told meshe did affect me:

385
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.230
and I have heard herselfcome thus near,

386
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.770
that, should she fancy,it should be one

387
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.100
of my complexion. Besides,she uses me with a more

388
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.370
exalted respect than anyone else that follows her.

389
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.130
What should I think on't?

390
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.870
Here's an overweeningrogue!

391
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.170
O, peace! Contemplation makesa rare turkey-cock of him:

392
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.670
how he jets under hisadvanced plumes!

393
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.630
'Slight, I could so beatthe rogue!

394
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.030
Peace, I say.

395
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.730
To be Count Malvolio!

396
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.300
Ah, rogue!

397
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:30.930
Pistol him, pistol him.

398
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.470
Peace, peace!

399
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.970
There is example for't;the lady of the Strachy

400
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.330
married the yeoman of thewardrobe.

401
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.370
Fie on him, Jezebel!

402
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.800
O, peace!

403
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.970
now he's deeply in: lookhow imagination blows him.

404
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.400
Having been threemonths married to her,

405
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.300
sitting in my state,--

406
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.700
O, for a stone-bow, to hithim in the eye!

407
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.770
Calling my officers about me,in my branched velvet gown;

408
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.300
having come froma day-bed,

409
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.670
where I have leftOlivia sleeping,--

410
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.370
Fire and brimstone!

411
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.770
O, peace, peace!

412
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.230
And then to have thehumour of state;

413
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.430
and after a demuretravel of regard,

414
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:17.870
telling them I know my place asI would they should do theirs,

415
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.930
to for my kinsman Toby,--

416
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.570
Bolts and shackles!

417
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.570
O peace, peace, peace!now, now.

418
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.930
Seven of my people, withan obedient start,

419
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.230
make out for him: Ifrown the while;

420
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:35.930
and perchance wind up watch, orplay with my--some rich jewel.

421
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:40.330
Toby approaches;courtesies there to me,--

422
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.570
Shall this fellow live?

423
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.970
Though our silence be drawnfrom us with cars, yet peace.

424
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.070
I extend my hand to himthus, quenching my familiar

425
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.970
smile with an austereregard of control,--

426
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.400
And does not Toby take youa blow o' the lips then?

427
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.270
Saying, 'Cousin Toby, myfortunes having cast me on

428
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.230
your niece give me thisprerogative of speech,'--

429
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.230
What, what?

430
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200
'You must amend yourdrunkenness.'

431
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.670
Out, scab!

432
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.930
Nay, patience, or we breakthe sinews of our plot.

433
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.830
'Besides, you waste thetreasure of your time with

434
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.000
a foolish knight,'--

435
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.400
That's me, I warrant you.

436
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.670
'One Sir Andrew,'--

437
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.370
I knew 'twas I; for manydo call me fool.

438
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.400
What employment have wehere?

439
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.430
Now is the woodcock nearthe gin.

440
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.630
O, peace! and the spiritof humour intimate reading

441
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.900
aloud to him!

442
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.670
By my life, this is mylady's hand these be her

443
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.230
very C's, her U's and herT's and thus makes she her

444
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.600
great P's. It is, in contemptof question, her hand.

445
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.930
Her C's, her U's and herT's: why that?

446
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.530
'To the unknown beloved,this, and my good wishes:'

447
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:49.570
--her very phrases!By your leave, wax.

448
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.630
Soft! and the impressureher Lucrece,

449
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.930
with which she uses toseal: 'tis my lady.

450
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.870
To whom should this be?

451
00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.330
This wins him, liver andall.

452
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.430
Jove knows I love: Butwho?

453
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.330
Lips, do not move;

454
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.800
No man must know.

455
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.100
'No man must know.'What follows?

456
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.300
the numbers altered!'No man must know:'

457
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.500
if this should bethee, Malvolio?

458
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.930
Marry, hang thee, brock!

459
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.670
I may command where Iadore;

460
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.370
But silence, like aLucrece knife,

461
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.370
With bloodless stroke myheart doth gore:

462
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:30.230
M, O, A, I, doth sway mylife.

463
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.870
A fustian riddle!

464
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.770
Excellent wench, say I.

465
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.400
'M, O, A, I, dothsway my life.'

466
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.530
Nay, but first, let me see,let me see, let me see.

467
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.600
What dish o' poison hasshe dressed him!

468
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.170
And with what wing thestaniel cheques at it!

469
00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.600
'I may command where I adore.'Why, she may command me:

470
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.300
I serve her; she is my lady.

471
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.000
Why, this is evident toany formal capacity;

472
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.570
there is no obstructionin this: and the end,

473
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.430
--what should that alphabeticalposition portend?

474
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.070
If I could make thatresemble something in me,

475
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.470
--Softly! M, O, A, I,--

476
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.500
O, ay, make up that: he isnow at a cold scent.

477
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.900
Sowter will cryupon't for all this,

478
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.630
though it be asrank as a fox.

479
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.100
M,--Malvolio; M,--why,that begins my name.

480
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.070
Did not I say hewould work it out?

481
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.570
the cur is excellentat faults.

482
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.030
M,--but then there is noconsonancy in the sequel;

483
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.470
that suffers under probationA should follow but O does.

484
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.500
And O shall end, I hope.

485
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.830
Ay, or I'll cudgel him,and make him cry O!

486
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.200
And then I comes behind.

487
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.270
Ay, an you had anyeye behind you,

488
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.700
you might see moredetraction at your heels

489
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.730
than fortunes before you.

490
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:42.170
M, O, A, I; this simulationis not as the former:

491
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.730
and yet, to crush this alittle, it would bow to me,

492
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.100
for every one of these lettersare in my name. Soft!

493
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.570
here follows prose.

494
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:55.970
'If this fall intothy hand, revolve.

495
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:03.900
In my stars I am above thee; butbe not afraid of greatness:

496
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.400
some are born great,some achieve greatness,

497
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.070
and some have greatnessthrust upon 'em.

498
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.970
Thy Fates open their hands;

499
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.400
let thy blood andspirit embrace them;

500
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.370
and, to inure thyself towhat thou art like to be,

501
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.530
cast thy humble sloughand appear fresh.

502
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.970
Be opposite with a kinsman,surly with servants;

503
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.070
let thy tongue tang argumentsof state; put thyself into

504
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.500
the trick of singularity:

505
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.970
she thus advises theethat sighs for thee.

506
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.130
Remember who commendedthy yellow stockings,

507
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.300
and wished to see theeever cross-gartered:

508
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.200
I say, remember. Goto, thou art made,

509
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.030
if thou desirest to beso; if not, let me see

510
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.170
thee a steward still,the fellow of servants,

511
00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.400
and not worthy to touchFortune's fingers. Farewell.

512
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.770
She that would alterservices with thee,

513
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.900
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'

514
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.130
Daylight and champaigndiscovers not more:

515
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:58.700
this is open. I will be proud,I will read politic authors,

516
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.800
I will baffle Sir Toby, I willwash off gross acquaintance,

517
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.530
I will be point-devisethe very man.

518
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.500
I do not now fool myself, tolet imagination jade me;

519
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:16.270
for every reason excites tothis, that my lady loves me.

520
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.270
She did commend my yellowstockings of late,

521
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.100
she did praise my legbeing cross-gartered;

522
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.130
and in this she manifestsherself to my love,

523
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.370
and with a kind of injunctiondrives me to these habits

524
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.270
of her liking. I thankmy stars I am happy.

525
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.970
I will be strange, stout,in yellow stockings,

526
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.200
and cross-gartered, even withthe swiftness of putting on.

527
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.100
Jove and my stars be praised!

528
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.400
Here is yet a postscript.

529
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.330
'Thou canst not choosebut know who I am.

530
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:50.270
If thou entertainest my love,let it appear in thy smiling;

531
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.270
thy smiles become thee well;

532
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.370
therefore in mypresence still smile,

533
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.070
dear my sweet, I prithee.'

534
00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:00.470
Jove, I thank thee:I will smile;

535
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:05.030
I will do everythingthat thou wilt have me.

536
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.430
I will not give my part ofthis sport for a pension

537
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.600
of thousands to be paidfrom the Sophy.

538
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.130
I could marry this wenchfor this device.

539
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.330
So could I too.

540
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.230
And ask no other dowry withher but such another jest.

541
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.130
Nor I neither.

542
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.800
Here comes my noblegull-catcher.

543
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.270
Wilt thou set thy foot o'my neck?

544
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.900
Or o' mine either?

545
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.570
Shall I play myfreedom at traytrip,

546
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.670
and become thybond-slave?

547
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.800
I' faith, or I either?

548
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.500
Why, thou hast puthim in such a dream,

549
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.400
that when the image of itleaves him he must run mad.

550
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.900
Nay, but say true; does itwork upon him?

551
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.730
Like aqua-vitae with amidwife.

552
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.230
If you will then see thefruits of the sport,

553
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.670
mark his first approachbefore my lady:

554
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.500
he will come to herin yellow stockings,

555
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.330
and 'tis a colour sheabhors, and cross-gartered,

556
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.630
a fashion she detests; andhe will smile upon her,

557
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.370
which will now be so unsuitableto her disposition,

558
00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.470
being addicted to amelancholy as she is,

559
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.470
that it cannot but turn himinto a notable contempt.

560
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.470
If you will see it, follow me.

561
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.530
To the gates of Tartar,

562
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.930
thou most excellentdevil of wit!

563
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.370
I'll make one too.

564
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.670
