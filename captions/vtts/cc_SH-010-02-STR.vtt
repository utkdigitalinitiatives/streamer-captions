00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100


2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.400
Will you stay no longer?

3
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.270
nor will you not that I go with you?

4
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.600
By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over me:

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.170
the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours;

6
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.870
therefore I shall crave of you your leave

7
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.970
that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad

8
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.470
recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.530
: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.

10
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.400
No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy.

11
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.770
But I perceive in you so excellent

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.000
a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me

13
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.930
what I am willing to keep in;

14
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.870
therefore it charges me

15
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.670
in manners the rather to express myself.

16
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.870
You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,

17
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.570
which I called Roderigo. My father was that

18
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.830
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard of.

19
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.630
He left behind him myself and a sister,

20
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.300
both born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,

21
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.700
would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;

22
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.800
for some hour before you took me from the breach of

23
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.370
the sea was my sister drowned.

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.630
Alas the day!

25
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.170
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me,

26
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.900
was yet of many accounted beautiful:

27
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.170
but, though I could not with such estimable wonder

28
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.770
overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her;

29
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.070
she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair.

30
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.000
She is drowned already, sir, with salt water,

31
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.230
though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.

32
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.200
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

33
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.630
O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

34
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.170
If you will not murder me for my love,

35
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.430
let me be your servant.

36
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.530
If you will not undo what you have done, that is,

37
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.570
kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.

38
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.270
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,

39
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.130
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother,

40
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.770
that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell

41
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.800
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

42
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.170
The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!

43
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.070
I have many enemies in Orsino's court,

44
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.530
Else would I very shortly see thee there.

45
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.370
But, come what may, I do adore thee so,

46
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.100
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.

47
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.130
Approach, Sir Andrew:

48
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.130
not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes;

49
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.500
and 'diluculo surgere,' thou know'st,--

50
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.800
Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know,

51
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.000
to be up late is to be up late.

52
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.430
A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.

53
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.070
To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is early:

54
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.070
so that to go to bed after midnight

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.200
is to go to bed betimes.

56
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.000
Does not our life consist of the four elements?

57
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.330
Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists

58
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.900
of eating and drinking.

59
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.130
Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.

60
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.330
Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!

61
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.570
Here comes the fool, i' faith.

62
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:46.870
How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture

63
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.070
of 'we three'?

64
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.270
Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.

65
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.700
By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast.

66
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.970
I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,

67
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.100
and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has.

68
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.830
Come on; there is sixpence for thee: let's have a song.

69
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.130
There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--

70
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.770
Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?

71
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.430
A love-song, a love-song.

72
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.070
Ay, ay: I care not for good life.

73
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.600
[â™ªSings]

74
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.530
O mistress mine, where are you roaming?

75
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.470
O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,

76
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.230
That can sing both high and low:

77
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.430
Trip no further, pretty sweeting;

78
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.830
Journeys end in lovers meeting,

79
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.430
Every wise man's son doth know.

80
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.670
Excellent good, i' faith.

81
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.730
Good, good.

82
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.370
[Sings]

83
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.670
What is love? 'tis not hereafter;

84
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.300
Present mirth hath present laughter;

85
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.870
What's to come is still unsure:

86
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.870
In delay there lies no plenty;

87
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.670
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,

88
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:45.470
Youth's a stuff will not endure.

89
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.730
A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.

90
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:53.830
A contagious breath.

91
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.470
Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.

92
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.000
To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.

93
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.370
But shall we make the welkin dance indeed?

94
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.130
shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three

95
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.470
souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?

96
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.530
An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.

97
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.770
By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.

98
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.430
Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'

99
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.030
'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight?

100
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.030
I shall be constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.

101
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.370
'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to

102
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.430
call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'

103
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.770
I shall never begin if I hold my peace.

104
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.400
Good, i' faith. Come, begin.

105
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.670
(singing) Hold thy peace. Thou knave hold thy peace.

106
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.600
What a caterwauling do you keep here!

107
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.470
If my lady have not called up her steward Malvolio

108
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.270
and bid him turn you out of doors, never trust me.

109
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.530
My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's

110
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.700
a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.'

111
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.730
Am not I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?

112
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.630
Tillyvally. Lady!

113
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.700
(Sings)

114
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:35.330
'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'

115
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.500
Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.

116
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.930
Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed,

117
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.570
and so do I too: he does it with a better grace,

118
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.730
but I do it more natural.

119
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.830
[Sings] 'O, the twelfth day of December,'--

120
00:07:52.830 --> 00:08:05.870
For the love o' God, peace!

121
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.700
My masters, are you mad? or what are you?

122
00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.030
Have ye no wit, manners, nor honesty,

123
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.530
but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night?

124
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.370
Do ye make an alehouse of my lady's house,

125
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:15.900
that ye squeak out your coziers' catches

126
00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.830
without any mitigation or remorse of voice?

127
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:21.430
Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you?

128
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:28.300
We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!

129
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.130
Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me tell you,

130
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.070
that, though she harbours you as her kinsman,

131
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.670
she's nothing allied to your disorders.

132
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.470
If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors,

133
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.530
you are welcome to the house; if not,

134
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.700
an it would please you to take leave of her,

135
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.270
she is very willing to bid you farewell.

136
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.930
'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'

137
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.630
Nay, good Sir Toby.

138
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.070
'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'

139
00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.100
Is't even so?

140
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.000
'But I will never die.'

141
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.830
Sir Toby, there you lie.

142
00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.030
This is much credit to you.

143
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.230
'Shall I bid him go?'

144
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.300
'What an if you do?'

145
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.870
'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'

146
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.800
'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'

147
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:21.300
Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a steward?

148
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.570
Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous,

149
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.470
there shall be no more cakes and ale?

150
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.570
Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too.

151
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:36.530
Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with crumbs.

152
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.970
A stoup of wine, Maria!

153
00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.330
Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour

154
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:45.530
at any thing more than contempt,

155
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.770
you would not give means for this uncivil rule:

156
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.330
she shall know of it, by this hand.

157
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.070
Go shake your ears.

158
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.970
'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's

159
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.430
a-hungry, to challenge him the field,

160
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.330
and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him.

161
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.700
Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge:

162
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.500
or I'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.

163
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.130
Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight:

164
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:12.800
since the youth of the count's was today with thy lady,

165
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.130
she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio,

166
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.870
let me alone with him: if I do not gull him into a nayword,

167
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.330
and make him a common recreation,

168
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.530
do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:

169
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.600
I know I can do it.

170
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.430
Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.

171
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.470
Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.

172
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.400
O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!

173
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.900
What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason, dear knight?

174
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.330
I have no exquisite reason for't,

175
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.730
but I have reason good enough.

176
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.200
The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing constantly,

177
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.030
but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,

178
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.500
that cons state without book

179
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.630
and utters it by great swarths: the best persuaded of himself,

180
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.070
so crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies,

181
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.330
that it is his grounds of faith

182
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:00.170
that all that look on him love him;

183
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.270
and on that vice in him

184
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.870
will my revenge find notable cause to work.

185
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.170
What wilt thou do?

186
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.730
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love;

187
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.800
wherein, by the colour of his beard,

188
00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.200
the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait,

189
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.030
the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion,

190
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:22.400
he shall find himself most feelingly personated.

191
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.570
I can write very like my lady your niece:

192
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.670
on a forgotten matter

193
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:28.870
we can hardly make distinction of our hands.

194
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.170
Excellent! I smell a device.

195
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.000
I have't in my nose too.

196
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.830
He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,

197
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.770
that they come from my niece,

198
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.230
and that she's in love with him.

199
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.170
My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.

200
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:41.470
And your horse now would make him an ass.

201
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.870
Ass, I doubt not.

202
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.530
O, 'twill be admirable!

203
00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.630
Sport royal, I warrant you:

204
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.000
I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two,

205
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.300
and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:

206
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.200
observe his construction of it.

207
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.600
For this night, to bed, and dream on the event.

208
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:05.270
Farewell. Good night, Penthesilea.

209
00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.830
Before me, she's a good wench.

210
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:13.200
She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:

211
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.700
what o' that?

212
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.130
I was adored once too.

213
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.470
Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money.

214
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.270
If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.

215
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.900
Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i' the end,

216
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.600
call me cut.

217
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:47.530
If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.

218
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:53.200
Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late

219
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.070
to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.

220
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:11.670
(â™ªSings a song)

221
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:18.370
What is love? 'tis not hereafter;

222
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:24.330
Present mirth hath present laughter;

223
00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:28.570
What's to come is still unsure:

224
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.000
In delay there lies no plenty;

225
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.330
Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,

226
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:47.930
Youth's a stuff will not endure.

227
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.500
Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.

228
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.430
Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,

229
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.970
That old and antique song we heard last night:

230
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.330
Methought it did relieve my passion much,

231
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.900
More than light airs and recollected terms

232
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.800
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:

233
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.300
Come, but one verse.

234
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.530
He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.

235
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:25.600
Who was it?

236
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.270
Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady

237
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.330
Olivia's father took much delight in.

238
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:30.470
He is about the house. Seek him out,

239
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.670
and play the tune the while.

240
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.370
Come hither, boy:

241
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.400
(â™ªMusic plays)

242
00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.700
if ever thou shalt love,

243
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.030
In the sweet pangs of it remember me;

244
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.270
For such as I am all true lovers are,

245
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.570
Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,

246
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.770
Save in the constant image of the creature

247
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:59.030
That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?

248
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.070
It gives a very echo to the seat

249
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:03.330
Where Love is throned.

250
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.300
Thou dost speak masterly:

251
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.700
My life upon't, young though thou art,

252
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.030
thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:

253
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.000
Hath it not, boy?

254
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.530
A little, by your favour.

255
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:15.330
What kind of woman is't?

256
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.670
Of your complexion.

257
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.930
She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?

258
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.130
About your years, my lord.

259
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.170
Too old by heaven: let still the woman take

260
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.870
An elder than herself: so wears she to him,

261
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:31.930
So sways she level in her husband's heart:

262
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.730
For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,

263
00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.630
Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,

264
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.870
More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,

265
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.730
Than women's are.

266
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.200
I think it well, my lord.

267
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.070
Then let thy love be younger than thyself,

268
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.730
Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;

269
00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:51.670
For women are as roses, whose fair flower

270
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.270
Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.

271
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.800
And so they are: alas, that they are so;

272
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.430
To die, even when they to perfection grow!

273
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.200
O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.

274
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.330
Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;

275
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.130
The spinsters and the knitters in the sun

276
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.300
And the free maids that weave their thread with bones

277
00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.300
Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,

278
00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.870
And dallies with the innocence of love,

279
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.900
Like the old age.

280
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.330
Are you ready, sir?

281
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.630
Ay; prithee, sing.

282
00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:27.630
(â™ªSONG)

283
00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.830
Come away, come away, death,

284
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:40.630
And in sad cypress let me be laid;

285
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:46.300
Fly away, fly away breath;

286
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:53.230
I am slain by a fair cruel maid.

287
00:16:54.570 --> 00:17:01.430
My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,

288
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:07.470
O, prepare it!

289
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:14.530
My part of death, no one so true

290
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:25.000
No one, no one, Did share it.

291
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.230
Not a flower, not a flower sweet

292
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:39.300
On my black coffin let there be strown;

293
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:44.570
Not a friend, not a friend greet

294
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:53.570
My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:

295
00:17:53.570 --> 00:18:00.130
A thousand thousand sighs to save,

296
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:06.870
Lay me, O, where

297
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:13.570
Sad true lover never find my grave,

298
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:23.500
To weep there! â™ª

299
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.970
There's for thy pains.

300
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.170
No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.

301
00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:34.000
I'll pay thy pleasure then.

302
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.030
Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.

303
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:41.300
Give me now leave to leave thee.

304
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.700
Now, the melancholy god protect thee;

305
00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.430
and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta,

306
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.130
for thy mind is a very opal.

307
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.030
I would have men of such constancy put to sea,

308
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.530
that their business might be every thing

309
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.400
and their intent every where;

310
00:18:54.400 --> 00:19:00.070
for that's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing.

311
00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.500
Farewell. Let all the rest give place.

312
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.200
Once more, Cesario,

313
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.130
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:

314
00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.930
Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,

315
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:24.070
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;

316
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.900
The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,

317
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.470
Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;

318
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.370
But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems

319
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.600
That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

320
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.100
But if she cannot love you, sir?

321
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.370
I cannot be so answer'd.

322
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.500
Sooth, but you must.

323
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:46.970
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,

324
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.330
Hath for your love a great a pang of heart

325
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.070
As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;

326
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.800
You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?

327
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.930
There is no woman's sides

328
00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.700
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion

329
00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.700
As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart

330
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.800
So big, to hold so much; they lack retention

331
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.500
Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,

332
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.100
No motion of the liver, but the palate,

333
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.200
That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;

334
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.000
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,

335
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.370
And can digest as much: make no compare

336
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.470
Between that love a woman can bear me

337
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.600
And that I owe Olivia.

338
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.200
Ay, but I know--

339
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.070
What dost thou know?

340
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.100
Too well what love women to men may owe:

341
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:39.630
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.

342
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:41.630
My father had a daughter loved a man,

343
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.500
As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,

344
00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.600
I should your lordship.

345
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.270
And what's her history?

346
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:54.370
A blank, my lord. She never told her love,

347
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.100
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,

348
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.170
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,

349
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.930
And with a green and yellow melancholy

350
00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:07.470
She sat like patience on a monument,

351
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:13.030
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?

352
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.530
We men may say more, swear more: but indeed

353
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.570
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove

354
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:23.130
Much in our vows, but little in our love.

355
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.070
But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

356
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.000
I am all the daughters of my father's house,

357
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.530
And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.

358
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.270
Sir, shall I to this lady?

359
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:41.870
Ay, that's the theme.

360
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:45.770
To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,

361
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:55.900
My love can give no place, bide no denay.

362
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.870


363
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.530
Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.

364
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.570
Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,

365
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.700
let me be boiled to death with melancholy.

366
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.330
Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly

367
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.330
rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?

368
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.170
I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'

369
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.300
favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.

370
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.200
To anger him we'll have the bear again;

371
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.400
and we will fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?

372
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.370
An we do not, it is pity of our lives.

373
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.100
Here comes the little villain.

374
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.530
How now, my metal of India!

375
00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.300
Get ye all three into the box-tree:

376
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.330
Malvolio's coming down this walk:

377
00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:31.470
he has been yonder i' the sun

378
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.630
practising behavior to his own shadow this half hour:

379
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.500
observe him, for the love of mockery;

380
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.930
for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.

381
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:44.330
Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,

382
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:47.000
for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.

383
00:22:53.970 --> 00:23:00.300
'Tis but fortune; all is fortune.

384
00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.400
Maria once told me she did affect me:

385
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.230
and I have heard herself come thus near,

386
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.770
that, should she fancy, it should be one

387
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.100
of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more

388
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:15.370
exalted respect than any one else that follows her.

389
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.130
What should I think on't?

390
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.870
Here's an overweening rogue!

391
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:22.170
O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock of him:

392
00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.670
how he jets under his advanced plumes!

393
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.630
'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

394
00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.030
Peace, I say.

395
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.730
To be Count Malvolio!

396
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:30.300
Ah, rogue!

397
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:30.930
Pistol him, pistol him.

398
00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:32.470
Peace, peace!

399
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:34.970
There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy

400
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:37.330
married the yeoman of the wardrobe.

401
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.370
Fie on him, Jezebel!

402
00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.800
O, peace!

403
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.970
now he's deeply in: look how imagination blows him.

404
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.400
Having been three months married to her,

405
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.300
sitting in my state,--

406
00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.700
O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!

407
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.770
Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet gown;

408
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.300
having come from a day-bed,

409
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.670
where I have left Olivia sleeping,--

410
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.370
Fire and brimstone!

411
00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.770
O, peace, peace!

412
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.230
And then to have the humour of state;

413
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.430
and after a demure travel of regard,

414
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:17.870
telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs,

415
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.930
to for my kinsman Toby,--

416
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.570
Bolts and shackles!

417
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.570
O peace, peace, peace! now, now.

418
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.930
Seven of my people, with an obedient start,

419
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.230
make out for him: I frown the while;

420
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:35.930
and perchance wind up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel.

421
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:40.330
Toby approaches; courtesies there to me,--

422
00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.570
Shall this fellow live?

423
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.970
Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.

424
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.070
I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar

425
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.970
smile with an austere regard of control,--

426
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.400
And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?

427
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.270
Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on

428
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:00.230
your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--

429
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.230
What, what?

430
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.200
'You must amend your drunkenness.'

431
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.670
Out, scab!

432
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.930
Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.

433
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.830
'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with

434
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.000
a foolish knight,'--

435
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.400
That's me, I warrant you.

436
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.670
'One Sir Andrew,'--

437
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.370
I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.

438
00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.400
What employment have we here?

439
00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.430
Now is the woodcock near the gin.

440
00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:26.630
O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading

441
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:27.900
aloud to him!

442
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.670
By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her

443
00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:34.230
very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her

444
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.600
great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.

445
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.930
Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?

446
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.530
'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes:'

447
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:49.570
--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.

448
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:52.630
Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece,

449
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.930
with which she uses to seal: 'tis my lady.

450
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.870
To whom should this be?

451
00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.330
This wins him, liver and all.

452
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:03.430
Jove knows I love: But who?

453
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:04.330
Lips, do not move;

454
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:05.800
No man must know.

455
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.100
'No man must know.' What follows?

456
00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:12.300
the numbers altered! 'No man must know:'

457
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.500
if this should be thee, Malvolio?

458
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.930
Marry, hang thee, brock!

459
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.670
I may command where I adore;

460
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.370
But silence, like a Lucrece knife,

461
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:24.370
With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:

462
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:30.230
M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.

463
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.870
A fustian riddle!

464
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.770
Excellent wench, say I.

465
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.400
'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.'

466
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.530
Nay, but first, let me see, let me see, let me see.

467
00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:45.600
What dish o' poison has she dressed him!

468
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.170
And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!

469
00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:51.600
'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command me:

470
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.300
I serve her; she is my lady.

471
00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.000
Why, this is evident to any formal capacity;

472
00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.570
there is no obstruction in this: and the end,

473
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.430
--what should that alphabetical position portend?

474
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:03.070
If I could make that resemble something in me,

475
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:05.470
--Softly! M, O, A, I,--

476
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.500
O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.

477
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.900
Sowter will cry upon't for all this,

478
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.630
though it be as rank as a fox.

479
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.100
M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.

480
00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.070
Did not I say he would work it out?

481
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.570
the cur is excellent at faults.

482
00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.030
M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;

483
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:24.470
that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.

484
00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.500
And O shall end, I hope.

485
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.830
Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!

486
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.200
And then I comes behind.

487
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.270
Ay, an you had any eye behind you,

488
00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:33.700
you might see more detraction at your heels

489
00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.730
than fortunes before you.

490
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:42.170
M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former:

491
00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.730
and yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me,

492
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:48.100
for every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!

493
00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.570
here follows prose.

494
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:55.970
'If this fall into thy hand, revolve.

495
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:03.900
In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness:

496
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.400
some are born great, some achieve greatness,

497
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.070
and some have greatness thrust upon 'em.

498
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:12.970
Thy Fates open their hands;

499
00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:14.400
let thy blood and spirit embrace them;

500
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.370
and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,

501
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.530
cast thy humble slough and appear fresh.

502
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.970
Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;

503
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.070
let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into

504
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.500
the trick of singularity:

505
00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.970
she thus advises thee that sighs for thee.

506
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.130
Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,

507
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.300
and wished to see thee ever cross-gartered:

508
00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.200
I say, remember. Go to, thou art made,

509
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.030
if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see

510
00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.170
thee a steward still, the fellow of servants,

511
00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.400
and not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.

512
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.770
She that would alter services with thee,

513
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:50.900
THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'

514
00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:53.130
Daylight and champaign discovers not more:

515
00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:58.700
this is open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,

516
00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.800
I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross acquaintance,

517
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.530
I will be point-devise the very man.

518
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.500
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me;

519
00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:16.270
for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me.

520
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.270
She did commend my yellow stockings of late,

521
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.100
she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;

522
00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.130
and in this she manifests herself to my love,

523
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.370
and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits

524
00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.270
of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy.

525
00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.970
I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings,

526
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.200
and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on.

527
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.100
Jove and my stars be praised!

528
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.400
Here is yet a postscript.

529
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.330
'Thou canst not choose but know who I am.

530
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:50.270
If thou entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;

531
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.270
thy smiles become thee well;

532
00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:54.370
therefore in my presence still smile,

533
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:57.070
dear my sweet, I prithee.'

534
00:29:57.070 --> 00:30:00.470
Jove, I thank thee: I will smile;

535
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:05.030
I will do everything that thou wilt have me.

536
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.430
I will not give my part of this sport for a pension

537
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:15.600
of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.

538
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.130
I could marry this wench for this device.

539
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.330
So could I too.

540
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.230
And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.

541
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.130
Nor I neither.

542
00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.800
Here comes my noble gull-catcher.

543
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.270
Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?

544
00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.900
Or o' mine either?

545
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.570
Shall I play my freedom at traytrip,

546
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:31.670
and become thy bond-slave?

547
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.800
I' faith, or I either?

548
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.500
Why, thou hast put him in such a dream,

549
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.400
that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.

550
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.900
Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?

551
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.730
Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.

552
00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.230
If you will then see the fruits of the sport,

553
00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.670
mark his first approach before my lady:

554
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.500
he will come to her in yellow stockings,

555
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.330
and 'tis a colour she abhors, and cross-gartered,

556
00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.630
a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her,

557
00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.370
which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition,

558
00:30:57.370 --> 00:30:59.470
being addicted to a melancholy as she is,

559
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:03.470
that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt.

560
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.470
If you will see it, follow me.

561
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:07.530
To the gates of Tartar,

562
00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.930
thou most excellent devil of wit!

563
00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:12.370
I'll make one too.

564
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.670
