00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.170


2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.330
Take the boy to you: he sotroubles me,

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.870
'Tis past enduring.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.370
Come, my gracious lord,

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.230
Shall I be yourplayfellow?

6
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.230
No, I'll none of you.

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.230
You'll kiss me hardand speak to me as

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.770
if I were a baby still.I love you better.

9
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.370
And why so, my lord?

10
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.430
Not for because

11
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.870
Your brows are blacker;yet black brows, they say,

12
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.830
Become some women best, sothat there be not

13
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.500
Too much hair there, butin a semicircle

14
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.070
Or a half-moon made with apen.

15
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.430
Who taught you this?

16
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.870
I learnt it out ofwomen's faces.

17
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.500
Pray now what colourare your eyebrows?

18
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.730
Blue, my lord.

19
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.930
Nay, that's a mock: I haveseen a lady's nose

20
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.500
That has been blue, butnot her eyebrows.

21
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.630
Hark ye;

22
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.170
The queen your motherrounds apace: we shall

23
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.070
Present our services to afine new prince

24
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.330
One of these days; and thenyou'ld wanton with us,

25
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.570
If we would have you.

26
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.700
She is spread of late

27
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600
Into a goodly bulk: goodtime encounter her!

28
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.730
What wisdom stirsamongst you? Come, sir,

29
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.300
now I am for you again:pray you, sit by us,

30
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.300
And tell 's a tale.

31
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.300
Merry or sad shall't be?

32
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.300
As merry as you will.

33
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.370
A sad tale's best for winter:

34
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.270
I have one of spritesand goblins.

35
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.370
Let's have that, good sir.

36
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.700
Come on, sit down: comeon, and do your best

37
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.900
To fright me with your sprites;you're powerful at it.

38
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.570
There was a man--

39
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.030
Nay, come, sit down; thenon.

40
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.900
Dwelt by a churchyard: Iwill tell it softly;

41
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.900
Yond crickets shall nothear it.

42
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.730
Come on, then,

43
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.530
And give't me in mine ear.

44
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.370
Was he met there? histrain? Camillo with him?

45
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.300
Behind the tuft of pines Imet them; never

46
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.630
Saw I men scour so ontheir way: I eyed them

47
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.870
Even to their ships.

48
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.400
How blest am I

49
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.100
In my just censure, in mytrue opinion!

50
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.800
Alack, for lesserknowledge! how accursed

51
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.030
In being so blest! Theremay be in the cup

52
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.970
A spider steep'd, and onemay drink, depart,

53
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.230
And yet partake no venom,for his knowledge

54
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.470
Is not infected: but ifone present

55
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.500
The abhorr'd ingredient tohis eye, make known

56
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.000
How he hath drunk, he crackshis gorge, his sides,

57
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.300
With violent hefts. I havedrunk,

58
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.870
and seen the spider.

59
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.600
Camillo was his help inthis, his pander:

60
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.100
There is a plot against mylife, my crown;

61
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.530
All's true that is mistrusted:that false villain

62
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.070
Whom I employ'd waspre-employ'd by him:

63
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.400
He has discover'd mydesign, and I

64
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.000
Remain a pinch'd thing;yea, a very trick

65
00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.900
For them to play at will.

66
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.970
How came the posternsSo easily open?

67
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.370
By his great authority;

68
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.000
Which often hath no lessprevail'd than so

69
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.930
On your command.

70
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.370
I know't too well.

71
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.870
Give me the boy: I am gladyou did not nurse him:

72
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.630
Though he does bearsome signs of me,

73
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.370
yet you have toomuch blood in him.

74
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.800
What is this? sport?

75
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.470
Bear the boy hence; heshall not come about her;

76
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.200
Away with him! and let hersport herself

77
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.430
With that she's big with;for 'tis Polixenes

78
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.100
Has made thee swell thus.

79
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.870
But I'ld say he had not,

80
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.700
And I'll be sworn youwould believe my saying,

81
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.900
Howe'er you lean to thenayward.

82
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.930
You, my lords,

83
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.500
Look on her, mark herwell; be but about

84
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.370
To say 'she is a goodly lady,'

85
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.200
and the justice of yourbearts will thereto add

86
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.270
'Tis pity she's nothonest, honourable:'

87
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.700
Praise her but for thisher without-door form,

88
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.870
Which on my faith deserveshigh speech, and straight

89
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.430
The shrug, the hum or ha,these petty brands

90
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.370
That calumny doth use--O,I am out--

91
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.770
That mercy does, forcalumny will sear

92
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.630
Virtue itself:

93
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.470
these shrugs, these humsand ha's,

94
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.370
When you have said 'she'sgoodly,' come between

95
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.430
Ere you can say 'she'shonest:' but be 't known,

96
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.830
From him that has most causeto grieve it should be,

97
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.230
She's an adulteress.

98
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.900
Should a villain say so,

99
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.700
The most replenish'dvillain in the world,

100
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.730
He were as much morevillain: you, my lord,

101
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.330
Do but mistake.

102
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.830
You have mistook, my lady,

103
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.700
Polixenes for Leontes: Othou thing!

104
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.970
Which I'll not call acreature of thy place,

105
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.500
Lest barbarism, making methe precedent,

106
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.630
Should a like language useto all degrees

107
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.170
And mannerlydistinguishment leave out

108
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.570
Betwixt the prince andbeggar: I have said

109
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.900
She's an adulteress; Ihave said with whom:

110
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.200
More, she's a traitor andCamillo is

111
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.400
A federary with her, andone that knows

112
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.130
What she should shame toknow herself

113
00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.370
But with her most vileprincipal, that she's

114
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.270
A bed-swerver, even as badas those

115
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.900
That vulgars give bold'sttitles, ay, and privy

116
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.670
To this their late escape.

117
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.130
No, by my life.

118
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.370
Privy to none of this. Howwill this grieve you,

119
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.230
When you shall come toclearer knowledge,

120
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.300
that You thus have publish'dme! Gentle my lord,

121
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.370
You scarce can right methroughly then to say

122
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.600
You did mistake.

123
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.770
No; if I mistake

124
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.900
In those foundations whichI build upon,

125
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.870
The centre is not bigenough to bear

126
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.630
A school-boy's top. Awaywith her! to prison!

127
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.830
He who shall speak for heris afar off guilty

128
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.330
But that he speaks.

129
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.330
There's some ill planetreigns:

130
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.300
I must be patient till theheavens look

131
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.130
With an aspect morefavourable.

132
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.970
Good my lords,

133
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.930
I am not prone to weeping,as our sex

134
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.900
Commonly are; the want ofwhich vain dew

135
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.330
Perchance shall dry yourpities: but I have

136
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.270
That honourable grieflodged here which burns

137
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.330
Worse than tears drown:beseech you all, my lords,

138
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.600
With thoughts so qualifiedas your charities

139
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.930
Shall best instructyou, measure me;

140
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.530
and so the king'swill be perform'd!

141
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.700
Shall I be heard?

142
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.830
Who is't that goes withme? Beseech your highness,

143
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.570
My women may be with me;for you see

144
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:35.470
My plight requires it. Donot weep, good fools;

145
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.670
There is no cause: when youshall know your mistress

146
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.570
Has deserved prison, thenabound in tears

147
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.630
As I come out: this actionI now go on

148
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:52.370
Is for my better grace.Adieu, my lord:

149
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.400
I never wish'd tosee you sorry;

150
00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.400
now I trust I shall.

151
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.030
My women, come;you have leave.

152
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.400
Go, do our bidding; hence!

153
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.570
Beseech your highness,call the queen again.

154
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.600
Be certain what you do,sir, lest your justice

155
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.570
Prove violence; in the whichthree great ones suffer,

156
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.630
Yourself, your queen, yourson.

157
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.600
For her, my lord,

158
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.100
I dare my life lay downand will do't, sir,

159
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.230
Please you to accept it,that the queen is spotless

160
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.830
I' the eyes of heaven andto you; I mean,

161
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.570
In this which you accuseher.

162
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.500
If it prove she's otherwise,

163
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.600
I'll keep my stables

164
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.170
where I lodge my wife; I'llgo in couples with her;

165
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.730
Than when I feel and seeher no farther trust her;

166
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.570
For every inch of woman inthe world,

167
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.800
Ay, every dram of woman'sflesh is false, If she be.

168
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.130
Hold your peaces.

169
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.730
Good my lord,--

170
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.030
It is for you we speak,not for ourselves:

171
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.370
You are abused and by someputter-on

172
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.500
That will be damn'd for't;would I knew the villain,

173
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.670
I would land-damn him. Beshe honour-flaw'd,

174
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.770
I have three daughters;the eldest is eleven

175
00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.430
The second and the third,nine, and some five;

176
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.200
If this prove true,they'll pay for't:

177
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.270
by mine honour,

178
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.870
I'll geld 'em all; fourteenthey shall not see,

179
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.630
To bring false generations:they are co-heirs;

180
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.330
And I had rather glibmyself than they

181
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.830
Should not produce fairissue.

182
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.170
Cease; no more.

183
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:36.300
You smell this businesswith a sense as cold

184
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.430
As is a dead man's nose:but I do see't and feel't

185
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.400
As you feel doing thus;and see withal

186
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.570
The instruments that feel.

187
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:51.830
If it be so,

188
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.600
We need no grave to buryhonesty:

189
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.770
There's not a grain of itthe face to sweeten

190
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.370
Of the whole dungy earth.

191
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.100
What! lack I credit?

192
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.400
I had rather you did lackthan I, my lord,

193
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.330
Upon this ground; and moreit would content me

194
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.230
To have her honour truethan your suspicion,

195
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.470
Be blamed for't how youmight.

196
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:12.930
Why, what need we

197
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.700
Commune with you of this,but rather follow

198
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.570
Our forceful instigation?Our prerogative

199
00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.800
Calls not your counsels,but our natural goodness

200
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.400
Imparts this; which ifyou, or stupefied

201
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.970
Or seeming so in skill,cannot or will not

202
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.200
Relish a truth like us,inform yourselves

203
00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.870
We need no more of youradvice: the matter,

204
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.530
The loss, the gain, theordering on't, is all

205
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.700
Properly ours.

206
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:38.800
And I wish, my liege,

207
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:41.170
You had only in yoursilent judgment tried it,

208
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.830
Without more overture.

209
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.770
How could that be?

210
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.400
Either thou art mostignorant by age,

211
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.800
Or thou wert born a fool.Camillo's flight,

212
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.270
Added to theirfamiliarity,

213
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.470
Which was as gross as evertouch'd conjecture,

214
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.500
That lack'd sight only,nought for approbation

215
00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.700
But only seeing, all othercircumstances

216
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.870
Made up to the deed, dothpush on this proceeding:

217
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.570
Yet, for a greaterconfirmation,

218
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.070
For in an act of thisimportance 'twere

219
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.130
Most piteous to be wild, Ihave dispatch'd in post

220
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.770
To sacred Delphos, toApollo's temple,

221
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:17.800
Cleomenes and Dion, whomyou know

222
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.600
Of stuff'd sufficiency:now from the oracle

223
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.700
They will bring all; whosespiritual counsel had,

224
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.470
Shall stop or spur me.Have I done well?

225
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.000
Well done, my lord.

226
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.700
Though I am satisfied andneed no more

227
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.500
Than what I know, yetshall the oracle

228
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.600
Give rest to the minds ofothers, such as he

229
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.500
Whose ignorant credulitywill not

230
00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.670
Come up to the truth. Sohave we thought it good

231
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.470
From our free person sheshould be confined,

232
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.230
Lest that the treachery ofthe two fled hence

233
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:55.800
Be left her to perform.Come, follow us;

234
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.470
We are to speak in public;for this business

235
00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.170
Will raise us all.

236
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.270
To laughter, as I take it,

237
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.270
If the good truth wereknown.

238
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.230
The keeper of the prison,call to him;

239
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.730
let him have knowledge whoI am.

240
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.000
Good lady,

241
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.330
No court in Europe is toogood for thee;

242
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.730
What dost thou then inprison?

243
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.300
Now, good sir,

244
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.830
You know me, do you not?

245
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:25.530
For a worthy lady

246
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:26.830
And one whom much Ihonour.

247
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.430
Pray you then,

248
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.870
Conduct me to the queen.

249
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.300
I may not, madam:

250
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.370
To the contrary I haveexpress commandment.

251
00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.300
Here's ado,

252
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.430
To lock up honesty andhonour

253
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:36.830
from the access ofgentle visitors!

254
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.730
Is't lawful, pray you,

255
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.430
To see her women? any ofthem? Emilia?

256
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.770
So please you, madam,

257
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.170
To put apart theseyour attendants,

258
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.870
I shall bring Emilia forth.

259
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.230
I pray now, call her.

260
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.400
Withdraw yourselves.

261
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:53.500
And, madam,

262
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.730
I must be present at yourconference.

263
00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.570
Well, be't so, prithee.

264
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.870
Here's such ado to make nostain a stain

265
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.830
As passes colouring.

266
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.770
Dear gentlewoman,

267
00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.400
How fares our graciouslady?

268
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.070
As well as one so greatand so forlorn

269
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.830
May hold together: on herfrights and griefs,

270
00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.970
Which never tender ladyhath born greater,

271
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:17.200
She is something beforeher time deliver'd.

272
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.070
A boy?

273
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.600
A daughter, and a goodlybabe,

274
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.900
Lusty and like to live:the queen receives

275
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.330
Much comfort in't; says'My poor prisoner,

276
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.770
I am innocent as you.'

277
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.000
I dare be sworn

278
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.030
These dangerous unsafelunes i' the king,

279
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.300
beshrew them!

280
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.830
He must be told on't, andhe shall: the office

281
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:35.400
Becomes a woman best; I'lltake't upon me:

282
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.000
If I prove honey-mouth'dlet my tongue blister

283
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.270
And never to my red-look'danger be

284
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.030
The trumpet any more. Prayyou, Emilia,

285
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.430
Commend my best obedienceto the queen:

286
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.570
If she dares trust me withher little babe,

287
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.270
I'll show't the king andundertake to be

288
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.230
Her advocate to theloud'st. We do not know

289
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.700
How he may soften at thesight o' the child:

290
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.670
The silence often of pureinnocence

291
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.700
Persuades when speakingfails.

292
00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.700
Most worthy madam,

293
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.870
Your honour and yourgoodness is so evident

294
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.500
That your free undertakingcannot miss

295
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.800
A thriving issue: there isno lady living

296
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.670
So meet for this greaterrand. Please your ladyship

297
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.470
To visit the next room,I'll presently

298
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.900
Acquaint the queen of yourmost noble offer;

299
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.370
Who but to-day hammer'd ofthis design,

300
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.400
But durst not tempt aminister of honour,

301
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.870
Lest she should be denied.

302
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:19.900
Tell her, Emilia.

303
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.700
I'll use that tongue Ihave: if wit flow from't

304
00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.870
As boldness from my bosom,let 't not be doubted

305
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.070
I shall do good.

306
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.170
Now be you blest for it!

307
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.330
I'll to the queen: pleaseyou,

308
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.330
come something nearer.

309
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.430
Madam, if't please thequeen to send the babe,

310
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.730
I know not what I shallincur to pass it,

311
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.830
Having no warrant.

312
00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:38.530
You need not fear it, sir:

313
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.770
This child was prisoner tothe womb and is

314
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.970
By law and process ofgreat nature thence

315
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.070
Freed and enfranchised,not a party to

316
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.630
The anger of the king norguilty of,

317
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.630
If any be, the trespass ofthe queen.

318
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.330
I do believe it.

319
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.600
Do not you fear: upon minehonour,

320
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.530
I will stand betwixt youand danger.

321
00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.370
Nor night nor day no rest:it is but weakness

322
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.230
To bear the matter thus;mere weakness. If

323
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:20.100
The cause were not inbeing,--part o' the cause,

324
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.570
She the adulteress; forthe harlot king

325
00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:24.870
Is quite beyond mine arm,out of the blank

326
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.070
And level of my brain,plot-proof; but she

327
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:33.170
I can hook to me: say thatshe were gone,

328
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.900
Given to the fire, amoiety of my rest

329
00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.730
Might come to me again.Who's there?

330
00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.900
My lord?

331
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.300
How does the boy?

332
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.830
He took good restto-night;

333
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.870
'Tis hoped his sickness isdischarged.

334
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.100
To see his nobleness!

335
00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.230
Conceiving the dishonourof his mother,

336
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.800
He straight declined,droop'd, took it deeply,

337
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.370
Fasten'd and fix'd theshame on't in himself,

338
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:58.830
Threw off his spirit, hisappetite, his sleep,

339
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:02.170
And downright languish'd.Leave me solely: go,

340
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.830
See how he fares.

341
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:11.200
Fie, fie! no thought ofhim:

342
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.800
The thought of my revengesthat way

343
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.170
Recoil upon me: in himselftoo mighty,

344
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.700
And in his parties, hisalliance; let him be

345
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.530
Until a time may serve:for present vengeance,

346
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.370
Take it on her. Camilloand Polixenes

347
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.600
Laugh at me, make theirpastime at my sorrow:

348
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.170
They should not laugh if Icould reach them, nor

349
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.470
Shall she within my power.

350
00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:36.630
You must not enter.

351
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.070
Nay, rather, good mylords, be second to me:

352
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.430
Fear you his tyrannouspassion

353
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.100
more, alas, than thequeen's life?

354
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.500
a gracious innocent soul,

355
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.200
More free than he isjealous.

356
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.000
That's enough.

357
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.530
Madam, he hath not slepttonight;

358
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:48.830
commanded none should comeat him.

359
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.430
Not so hot, good sir:

360
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.970
I come to bring him sleep.

361
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:52.730
'Tis such as you,

362
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.330
That creep like shadows byhim

363
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.500
and do sigh at each hisneedless heavings,

364
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.130
such as you nourish thecause of his awaking:

365
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.430
I do come with words asmedicinal as true,

366
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.530
Honest as either, to purgehim of that humour

367
00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.130
That presses him fromsleep.

368
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:06.500
What noise there, ho?

369
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.700
No noise, my lord; butneedful conference

370
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.430
About some gossips foryour highness.

371
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:11.600
How!

372
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.430
Away with that audaciouslady! Antigonus,

373
00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:17.000
I charged thee that sheshould not come about me:

374
00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.930
I knew she would.

375
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.370
I told her so, my lord,

376
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.070
On your displeasure'speril and on mine,

377
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.700
She should not visit you.

378
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.800
What, canst not rule her?

379
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.970
From all dishonesty hecan: in this,

380
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:28.630
Unless he take the coursethat you have done,

381
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.970
Commit me for committinghonour,

382
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:30.670
trust it,

383
00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:32.370
He shall not rule me.

384
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.070
La you now, you hear:

385
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.070
When she will take therein I let her run;

386
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.630
But she'll not stumble.

387
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.200
Good my liege, I come;

388
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.630
And, I beseech you,hear me,

389
00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.100
who profess myself your loyalservant, your physician,

390
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.030
Your most obedientcounsellor,

391
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.400
yet that dare less appear soin comforting your evils,

392
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.270
Than such as most seemyours:

393
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.030
I say, I come

394
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:54.200
From your good queen.

395
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.970
Good queen!

396
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.970
Good queen, my lord,

397
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.600
Good queen; I say goodqueen;

398
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.170
And would by combat makeher good,

399
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.870
so were I a man, the worstabout you.

400
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.830
Force her hence.

401
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:04.270
Let him that makes buttrifles of his eyes

402
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.870
First hand me: on mine ownaccord I'll off;

403
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.000
But first I'll do myerrand.

404
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.300
The good queen,

405
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.930
For she is good, hath broughtyou forth a daughter;

406
00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.330
Here 'tis;

407
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.630
commends it to yourblessing.

408
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.630
Out!

409
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.330
A mankind witch! Hencewith her, out o' door:

410
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.230
A most intelligencingbawd!

411
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.000
Not so:

412
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.330
I am as ignorant in thatas you

413
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.030
In so entitling me, and noless honest

414
00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:50.930
Than you are mad;

415
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.030
which is enough, I'llwarrant,

416
00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.670
As this world goes, topass for honest.

417
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.100
Traitors!

418
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.000
Will you not push her out?

419
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.600
Give her the bastard. Thoudotard!

420
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.170
thou art woman-tired, unroostedthy dame Partlet here.

421
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.200
Take up the bastard;

422
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.470
Take't up, I say; give'tto thy crone.

423
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.870
For ever unvenerable bethy hands,

424
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.770
if thou takest up the princessby that forced baseness

425
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.000
Which he has put upon't!

426
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.900
He dreads his wife.

427
00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.870
So I would you did;

428
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.000
then 'twere past alldoubt,

429
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.530
you'ld call your childrenyours.

430
00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.130
A nest of traitors!

431
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.970
I am none, by this goodlight.

432
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.500
Nor I, nor any but onethat's here,

433
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.800
and that's himself, for he

434
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.170
The sacred honour ofhimself, his queen's,

435
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.830
His hopeful son's, hisbabe's, betrays to slander,

436
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.670
Whose sting is sharperthan the sword's;

437
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:29.630
and will not--

438
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.730
For, as the case nowstands,

439
00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:31.670
it is a curse

440
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:33.470
He cannot be compell'dto't--once remove

441
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.630
The root of his opinion,which is rotten

442
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.470
As ever oak or stone wassound.

443
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:38.530
A callat

444
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.170
Of boundless tongue, wholate hath beat her husband

445
00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:45.930
And now baits me! Thisbrat is none of mine;

446
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.570
It is the issue ofPolixenes:

447
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.930
Hence with it, andtogether with the dam

448
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:52.300
Commit them to the fire!

449
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.770
It is yours;

450
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.330
And, might we lay the oldproverb to your charge,

451
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:59.730
So like you, 'tis theworse. Behold, my lords,

452
00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:01.230
Although the print belittle,

453
00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.200
the whole matter and copyof the father,

454
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.800
eye, nose, lip,

455
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.700
The trick of's frown, hisforehead, nay, the valley,

456
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.670
The pretty dimples of hischin and cheek,

457
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.100
His smiles,

458
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.700
The very mould and frameof hand, nail, finger:

459
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.100
And thou, good goddessNature, which hast made it

460
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.300
So like to him

461
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.470
that got it, if thou hast theordering of the mind too,

462
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:20.430
'mongst all colours

463
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.430
No yellow in't, lest shesuspect, as he does,

464
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:23.900
Her children not herhusband's!

465
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.400
A gross hag

466
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.230
And, lozel, thou artworthy to be hang'd,

467
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.700
That wilt not stay hertongue.

468
00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.830
Hang all the husbands

469
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.600
That cannot do that feat,

470
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.870
you'll leave yourselfhardly one subject.

471
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:36.730
Once more, take her hence.

472
00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.500
A most unworthy andunnatural lord

473
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:39.500
Can do no more.

474
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.430
I'll ha' thee burnt.

475
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.470
I care not:

476
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:42.970
It is an heretic thatmakes the fire,

477
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.530
Not she which burns in't.

478
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.270
I'll not call you tyrant;

479
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.330
But this most cruel usageof your queen,

480
00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.300
Not able to produce moreaccusation

481
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.130
Than your own weak-hingedfancy, something savours

482
00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.300
Of tyranny and willignoble make you,

483
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.870
Yea, scandalous to theworld.

484
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.170
On your allegiance,

485
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.130
Out of the chamber withher! Were I a tyrant,

486
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.430
Where were her life? shedurst not call me so,

487
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:08.000
If she did know me one.Away with her!

488
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.670
I pray you, do not pushme; I'll be gone.

489
00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:16.300
Look to your babe, mylord; 'tis yours:

490
00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.330
Jove send her

491
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:20.300
A better guiding spirit!What needs these hands?

492
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.730
You, that are thus sotender o'er his follies,

493
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.330
Will never do him good,not one of you.

494
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:36.270
So, so: farewell; we aregone.

495
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:48.700
Thou, traitor, hast set onthy wife to this.

496
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.430
My child? away with't!Even thou, that hast

497
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.700
A heart so tender o'er it,take it hence

498
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.270
And see it instantlyconsumed with fire;

499
00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.130
Even thou and none butthou. Take it up straight:

500
00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.800
Within this hour bring meword 'tis done,

501
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.230
And by good testimony,

502
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.300
or I'll seize thy life, withwhat thou else call'st thine.

503
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.170
If thou refuse and wiltencounter with my wrath,

504
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:11.700
say so;

505
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.200
The bastard brains withthese my proper hands

506
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.170
Shall I dash out. Go, takeit to the fire;

507
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.930
For thou set'st on thywife.

508
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.400
I did not, sir:

509
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.630
These lords, my noblefellows, if they please,

510
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.030
Can clear me in't.

511
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.370
We can: my royal liege,

512
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.770
He is not guilty of hercoming hither.

513
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:29.000
You're liars all.

514
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.230
Beseech your highness,give us better credit:

515
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.870
We have always trulyserved you, and beseech

516
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:39.000
So to esteem of us, and onour knees we beg,

517
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.770
As recompense of our dearservices

518
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:44.970
Past and to come, that youdo change this purpose,

519
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.300
Which being so horrible,so bloody,

520
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:53.770
must lead on to some foulissue: we all kneel.

521
00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:02.430
I am a feather for eachwind that blows:

522
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.070
Shall I live on to seethis bastard kneel

523
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.530
And call me father? betterburn it now

524
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:15.770
Than curse it then. But beit; let it live.

525
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:20.670
It shall not neither. You,sir, come you hither;

526
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.070
You that have been sotenderly officious

527
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:23.730
With Lady Margery, yourmidwife there,

528
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.930
To save this bastard'slife,--for 'tis a bastard,

529
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.170
So sure as this beard'sgrey,

530
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.900
--what will you adventure

531
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.270
To save this brat's life?

532
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.570
Any thing, my lord,

533
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:36.100
That my ability mayundergo

534
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.700
And nobleness impose: atleast thus much:

535
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.670
I'll pawn the little bloodwhich I have left

536
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:44.830
To save the innocent: anything possible.

537
00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:51.270
It shall be possible.Swear by this sword

538
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:55.230
Thou wilt perform mybidding.

539
00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:56.700
I will, my lord.

540
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.370
Mark and perform it,see'st thou!

541
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.700
for the fail of any pointin't

542
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.530
shall not only be Ddeathto thyself

543
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.800
but to thy lewd-tonguedwife,

544
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.030
Whom for this time wepardon. We enjoin thee,

545
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.430
As thou art liege-man tous, that thou carry

546
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.300
This female bastard henceand that thou bear it

547
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.130
To some remote and desertplace quite out

548
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.270
Of our dominions, and thatthere thou leave it,

549
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.370
Without more mercy, to itsown protection

550
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:24.170
And favour of the climate.As by strange fortune

551
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.970
It came to us, I do injustice charge thee,

552
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.730
On thy soul's peril andthy body's torture,

553
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.300
That thou commend itstrangely to some place

554
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:37.530
Where chance may nurse orend it. Take it up.

555
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.600
I swear to do this,

556
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.730
though a present death hadbeen more merciful.

557
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.730
Come on, poor babe:

558
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:03.570
Some powerful spirit instructthe kites and ravens

559
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.730
To be thy nurses! Wolvesand bears, they say

560
00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:11.200
Casting their savagenessaside have done

561
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.200
Like offices of pity.

562
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.030
Sir, be prosperous

563
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.130
In more than this deeddoes require!

564
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:23.730
And blessing against thiscruelty fight on thy side,

565
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.430
Poor thing, condemn'd toloss!

566
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.570
No, I'll not rear

567
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:39.830
Another's issue.

568
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:40.870
Please your highness,

569
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.270

571
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:44.730
Cleomenes and Dion,

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:46.230
Being well arrived fromDelphos, are both landed,

573
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.400

So please you, sir, theirspeed

575
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:51.070
Hath been beyond account.

576
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.600
Twenty-three days theyhave been absent:

577
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.230
'tis good speed;

578
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:55.370

579
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:57.770

580
00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.770
Prepare you, lords; Summona session,

582

so shall she have a justand open trial.

584
00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.100
While she lives

585
00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.400
My heart will be a burthento me.

586
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.430
Leave me, and think uponmy bidding.

587
