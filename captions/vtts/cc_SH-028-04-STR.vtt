00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570


2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.670


3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.900
than still contemned and flattered.

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.830
To be worst,

5
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.270
the lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.630
stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.930
The lamentable change is from the best.

8
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.500
The worst returns to laughter.

9
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.000
Welcome, then,

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.770
thou unsubstantial air that I embrace.

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.700
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.730
owes nothing to thy blasts.

13
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.730
But who comes here?

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.500
My father, poorly led?

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.100
World, world, O world.

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.530
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,

17
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.770
life would not yield to age.

18
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.870
O, my good lord, I have been your tenant

19
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.430
and your father's tenant these fourscore years.

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.800
Away, get thee away.

21
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.300
Good friend, be gone.

22
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.830
Thy comforts can do me no good at all.

23
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.900
Thee, they may hurt.

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.700
But you cannot see your way.

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.230
I have no way and therefore want no eyes.

26
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.430
I stumbled when I saw.

27
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.730
Full oft 'tis seen, our means secure us,

28
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.070
and our mere defects prove our commodities.

29
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.000
O dear son Edgar,

30
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.270
the food of thy abused father's wrath.

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.600
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,

32
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.370
I'd say I had eyes again.

33
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.300
How now?

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.370
Who's there?

35
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.400
O gods!

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.070
Who is't can say "I am at the worst"?

37
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.600
I am worse than e'er I was.

38
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.970
'Tis poor mad Tom.

39
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.770
And worse I may be yet.

40
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.600
The worst is not

41
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.430
so long as we can say, "This is the worst."

42
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.970
Fellow, where goest?

43
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.470
Is it a beggar man?

44
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.830
Madman and beggar too.

45
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.870
He has some reason, else he could not beg.

46
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.930
In the last night's storm, I such a fellow saw

47
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.330
that made me think a man a worm.

48
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.600
My son came then into my mind,

49
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.830
and yet my mind was then scarce friends with him.

50
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.900
I have heard more since.

51
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.800
As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods!

52
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.300
They kill us for their sport.

53
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.270
How should this be?

54
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.800
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,

55
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.770
angering itself and others.

56
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.600
Bless thee, master!

57
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.500
Is it the naked fellow?

58
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.800
Aye, my lord.

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.170
Then, prithee, get thee gone.

60
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.700
If, for my sake, thou wilt o'ertake us,

61
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.500
hence a mile or twain, i' the way toward Dover,

62
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.130
do it for ancient love,

63
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.930
and bring some covering for this naked soul,

64
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.130
which I'll entreat to lead me.

65
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.100
Alack, sir, he is mad.

66
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.200
'Tis the times' plague when madmen lead the blind.

67
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.930
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.

68
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.630
Above the rest, be gone.

69
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.600
I'll get him the best apparel that I have,

70
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.270
come on't what will.

71
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.330
Sirrah, naked fellow.

72
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.700
Poor Tom's a-cold.

73
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.930
I cannot daub it further.

74
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.800
Come hither, fellow.

75
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.330
And yet I must.

76
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.630
Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.

77
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.170
Dost thou know the way to Dover?

78
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.930
Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath.

79
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.970
Poor Tom hath been scared out of his good wits.

80
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.370
Bless thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend!

81
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.800
Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once:

82
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.630
of lust, as Obidicut;

83
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.500
Hobbididence, prince of dumbness;

84
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.000
Mahu, of murder; Modo, of stealing;

85
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.200
Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing,

86
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.470
who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women.

87
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.430
So bless thee, master.

88
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.130
Here, take this purse,

89
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.570
thou whom the heavens' plagues have humbled to all strokes.

90
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.730
That I am wretched makes thee the happier.

91
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.600
Heavens, deal so still.

92
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.370
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man

93
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.170
that slaves your ordinance,

94
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.170
that will not see because he doth not feel,

95
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.700
feel your power quickly.

96
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.900
So distribution should undo excess

97
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.330
and each man have enough.

98
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.600
Dost thou know Dover?

99
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.670
Aye, master.

100
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.570
There is a cliff, whose high and bending head

101
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.300
looks fearfully in the confined deep.

102
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.500
Bring me but to the very brim of it,

103
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.830
and I'll repair the misery thou dost bear

104
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.030
with something rich about me.

105
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.770
From that place, I shall no leading need.

106
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.030
Give me thy hand.

107
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.130
Poor Tom shall lead thee.

108
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.000
Welcome, my lord.

109
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.600
I marvel our mild husband not met us on the way.

110
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.300
Now, where's your master?

111
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.970
Madam, within, but never man so changed.

112
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.830
I told him of the army that was landed;

113
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.270
he smiled at it.

114
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.830
I told him you were coming; his answer was, "The worse."

115
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.900
Of Gloucester's treachery

116
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.530
and of the loyal service of his son,

117
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.830
when I informed him, then he called me sot

118
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.170
and told me I had turned the wrong side out.

119
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.030
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;

120
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.270
what like, offensive.

121
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.930
Then shall you go no further.

122
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.570
It is the cowish terror of his spirit

123
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.000
that dares not undertake.

124
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.030
He'll not feel wrongs which tie him to an answer.

125
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.530
Our wishes on the way may prove effects.

126
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.200
Back, Edmund, to my brother.

127
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.270
Hasten his musters, and conduct his powers.

128
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.030
I must change arms at home

129
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.400
and give the distaff into my husband's hands.

130
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.130
This trusty servant shall pass between us.

131
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.970
Ere long you are like to hear,

132
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.230
if you dare venture in your own behalf,

133
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.430
a mistress's command.

134
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.470
Wear this.

135
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.430
No, spare speech.

136
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.770
Decline your head.

137
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.600
This kiss, if it durst speak,

138
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.300
would stretch thy spirits up into the air.

139
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.100
Conceive, and fare thee well.

140
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.070
Yours in the ranks of death.

141
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.770
My most dear Gloucester.

142
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.030
O, the difference of man and man.

143
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.600
To thee, a woman's services are due.

144
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.070
My fool usurps my body.

145
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.530
Madam, here comes my lord.

146
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.070
I have been worth the whistle.

147
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.470
O Goneril.

148
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.170
You are not worth the dust

149
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.400
which the rude wind blows in your face.

150
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.100
I fear your disposition.

151
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.830
That nature, which contemns its origin,

152
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.000
cannot be bordered certain in itself.

153
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.100
She that herself will sliver and disbranch

154
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.070
from her material sap

155
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.770
perforce must wither and come to deadly use.

156
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.870
No more; the text is foolish.

157
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.700
Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile.

158
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.400
Filths savor but themselves.

159
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.600
What have you done?

160
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.530
Tigers, not daughters, what have you performed?

161
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.830
A father and a gracious aged man

162
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.070
whose reverence even the head-lugged bear would lick

163
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.600
most barbarous, most degenerate,

164
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.270
have you madded.

165
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.600
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?

166
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.570
A man, a prince, by him so benefited?

167
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.600
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits

168
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.930
send quickly down to tame these vile offenses,

169
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.270
it will come.

170
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.970
Humanity must perforce prey on itself

171
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.630
like monsters of the deep.

172
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.070
Milk-livered man

173
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.400
that bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs,

174
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.730
who hast not in thy brows

175
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.230
an eye discerning thine honor from thy suffering,

176
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.500
that not know'st fools do those villains pity

177
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.800
who are punished ere they have done their mischief.

178
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800
Where's thy drum?

179
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.300
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land.

180
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.270
With plumed helm, thy state begins to threat

181
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.570
whilst thou, a moral fool,

182
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.630
sit'st still and criest, "Alack, why does he so?"

183
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.130
See thyself, devil.

184
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.700
Proper deformity shows not in the fiend

185
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.970
so horrid as in woman.

186
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.330
O, vain fool!

187
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.300
Thou changed and self-covered thing, for shame.

188
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.500
Be-monster not thy feature.

189
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.770
Were it my fitness to let these hands obey my blood,

190
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.930
they are apt enough to dislocate and tear thy flesh and bones.

191
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.370
Howe'er thou art a fiend,

192
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.430
a woman's shape doth shield thee.

193
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.570
Marry, your manhood.

194
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.830
What news?

195
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.800
O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead,

196
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.970
slain by his servant,

197
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.130
going to put out the other eye of Gloucester.

198
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.930
Gloucester's eye?

199
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.200
A servant that he bred, thrilled with remorse,

200
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.470
opposed against the act,

201
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.530
bending his sword to his great master,

202
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.300
who, thereat enraged, flew on him

203
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.100
and amongst them felled him dead

204
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.900
but not without that harmful stroke

205
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.970
which since hath plucked him after.

206
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.830
This shows you are above, you justicers,

207
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.630
that these, our nether crimes, so speedily can venge.

208
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.800
O poor Gloucester, lost he his other eye?

209
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.800
Both, both, my lord.

210
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.200
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.

211
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.870
'Tis from your sister.

212
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.600
One way I like this well.

213
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.170
But being widow and my Gloucester with her,

214
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.230
may all the building of my fancy pluck

215
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.600
upon my hateful life.

216
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.000
Another way, the news is not so tart.

217
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.870
I'll read and answer.

218
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.730
Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

219
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.070
Come with my lady hither.

220
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.230
He is not here.

221
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.970
No, my good lord; I met him back again.

222
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.430
Knows he the wickedness?

223
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.070
Aye, my good lord; 'twas he informed against him

224
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.930
and quit the house on purpose

225
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.570
that their punishment might have the freer course.

226
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.230
Gloucester, I live to thank thee

227
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.930
for the love thou show'dst the king

228
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.000
and to revenge thine eyes.

229
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.530
Come hither, friend. Tell me what more thou know'st.

230
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.630
Alack, 'tis he.

231
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.670
Why, he was met even now as mad as the vexed sea,

232
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.970
singing aloud,

233
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.770
crowned with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,

234
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.470
with hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, Darnel,

235
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.630
and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn.

236
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.070
A century send forth.

237
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.100
Search every acre in the high-grown field,

238
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.030
and bring him to our eye.

239
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.000
What can man's wisdom

240
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.030
in the restoring his bereaved sense?

241
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.800
He that helps him take all my outward worth.

242
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.700
There is means, madam.

243
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.370
Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,

244
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.670
the which he lacks.

245
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.770
That to provoke in him are many simples operative

246
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.870
whose power will close the eye of anguish.

247
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.200
All blest secrets,

248
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.270
all you unpublished virtues of the Earth,

249
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.300
spring with my tears.

250
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.500
Be aidant and remediate in the good man's distress.

251
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.330
Seek, seek for him, lest his ungoverned rage

252
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.400
dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it.

253
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.770
News, madam.

254
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.570
The British powers are marching hitherward.

255
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.730
'Tis known before;

256
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.470
our preparation stands in expectation of them.

257
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.030
O dear father,

258
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.470
it is thy business that I go about.

259
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.030
Therefore, great France

260
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.270
my mourning and importune tears hath pitied.

261
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.200
No blown ambition doth our arms incite

262
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:38.770
but love, dear love, and our aged father's right.

263
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:45.270
Soon may I hear and see him.

264
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.930
But are my brother's powers set forth?

265
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.130
Aye, madam.

266
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.770
Himself in person there?

267
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.470
Madam, with much ado.

268
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.370
Your sister is the better soldier.

269
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.530
Lord Edmund spoke not to your lord at home?

270
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.000
No, madam.

271
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.100
What might import my sister's letter to him?

272
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.470
I know not, lady.

273
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.200
'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.

274
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.470
It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,

275
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.570
to let him live.

276
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.730
Where he arrives, he moves all hearts against us.

277
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.100
Edmund, I think, is gone, in pity of his misery,

278
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.070
to dispatch his nighted life

279
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.170
moreover, to descry the strength o' the enemy.

280
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.070
I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

281
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.330
Our troops set forth tomorrow.

282
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.870
Stay with us; the ways are dangerous.

283
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.430
I may not, madam.

284
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.530
My lady charged my duty in this business.

285
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.400
Why should she write to Edmund?

286
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.400
Might not you transport her purposes by word?

287
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.100
Belike, somethings I know not what.

288
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.200
I'll love thee much; let me unseal the letter.

289
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.370
Madam, I had rather

290
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.030
I know your lady does not love her husband.

291
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.430
I'm sure of that.

292
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.200
And at her late being here, she gave strange oeillades

293
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.270
and most speaking looks to noble Edmund.

294
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.370
- I know you are of her bosom. - I?

295
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.730
I speak in understanding. You are; I know it.

296
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.900
Therefore I do advise thee, take this note.

297
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.330
My lord is dead.

298
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.070
Edmund and I have talked.

299
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.600
And more convenient is he for my hand

300
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.000
than for your lady's.

301
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.300
You may gather more.

302
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.630
If you do find him, pray you, give him this.

303
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:38.400
And when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray,

304
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.400
desire her call her wisdom to her.

305
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.400
And so farewell.

306
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.370
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,

307
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:55.500
preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

308
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.130
Would I could meet him, madam.

309
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.670
I should show what party I do follow.

310
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.100
Fare thee well.

311
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.170
When shall I come to the top of that same hill?

312
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.730
You do climb up it now.

313
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.130
Look how we labor.

314
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.470
Methinks the ground is even.

315
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.730
Horrible steep.

316
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.730
Hark, do you hear the sea?

317
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.430
No, truly.

318
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.130
Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect

319
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.630
by your eyes' anguish.

320
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.630
So may it be, indeed.

321
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.630
Methinks thy voice is altered and thou speak'st

322
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.570
in better phrase and matter than thou didst.

323
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.730
You are much deceived.

324
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.500
In nothing am I changed but in my garments.

325
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.770
Methinks you're better spoken.

326
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.930
Come on, sir.

327
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.330
Here's the place.

328
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.570
Stand still.

329
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:05.000
How fearful and dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low.

330
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.670
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air

331
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.500
show scarce so gross as beetles.

332
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.670
Halfway down hangs one

333
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.700
that gathers samphire, dreadful trade.

334
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.270
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.

335
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.370
The fishermen that walk upon the beach

336
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.270
appear like mice

337
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:35.770
and yond tall anchoring bark, diminished to her cock,

338
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.200
her cock a buoy almost too small for sight.

339
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.500
The murmuring surge

340
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.700
that on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes

341
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.770
cannot be heard so high.

342
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:51.300
I'll look no more lest my brain turn

343
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.230
and the deficient sight topple down headlong.

344
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.200
Set me where you stand.

345
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.570
Give me your hand.

346
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.670
You are now within a foot of the extreme verge.

347
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.200
For all beneath the moon would I not leap upright.

348
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.870
Let go my hand.

349
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.730
Here, friend, 's another purse,

350
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.300
in it a jewel well worth a poor man's taking.

351
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.600
Fairies and gods prosper it with thee.

352
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.930
Go thou further off.

353
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.970
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

354
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.300
Now fare you well, good sir!

355
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.370
With all my heart.

356
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.870
Why I do trifle thus with his despair

357
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.300
is done to cure it.

358
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.530
O you mighty gods.

359
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.530
This world I do renounce and, in your sights,

360
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.670
shake patiently my great affliction off.

361
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.230
If I could bear it longer and not fall to quarrel

362
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.530
with your great opposeless wills,

363
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.400
my snuff and loathed part of nature

364
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.070
should burn itself out.

365
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.570
If Edgar live, O, bless him.

366
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.070
Now, fellow, fare thee well.

367
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.870
Gone, sir! Farewell!

368
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.030
And yet I know not how conceit may rob the treasury of life

369
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.270
when life itself yields to the theft.

370
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.630
Had he been where he thought, by this, had thought been past.

371
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.800
Alive or dead?

372
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.200
Ho, you sir.

373
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.130
Friend?

374
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.000
Hear you, sir.

375
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.830
Speak.

376
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.630
Thus might he pass indeed.

377
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.370
Yet he revives.

378
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.670
What are you, sir?

379
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.600
Away, and let me die.

380
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.930
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,

381
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.230
so many fathoms down precipitating,

382
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.970
thou'dst shiver'st like an egg.

383
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.800
But thou dost breathe, hast heavy substance,

384
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.100
bleed'st not, speak'st, art sound.

385
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.170
Ten masts at each make not the altitude

386
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.930
which thou hast perpendicularly fell.

387
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.600
Thy life's a miracle.

388
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.100
Speak yet again.

389
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.600
Have I fallen, or no?

390
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.000
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.

391
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.300
Look up a-height.

392
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.530
The shrill-gorged lark cannot be seen or heard so far.

393
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.570
Do but look up.

394
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.170
Alack, I have no eyes.

395
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.070
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit

396
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.470
to end itself by death?

397
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.930
'Twas yet some comfort,

398
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.530
when misery could beguile the tyrant's rage

399
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.430
and frustrate his proud will.

400
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.500
Give me your arm.

401
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.030
Up.

402
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.600
So.

403
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.630
How is 't?

404
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.970
Feel you your legs?

405
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.030
You stand.

406
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.030
Too well, too well.

407
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.030
This is above all strangeness.

408
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.170
Upon the crown o' the cliff,

409
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.770
what thing was that which parted from you?

410
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.530
A poor unfortunate beggar.

411
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.630
As I stood here below,

412
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.330
methought his eyes were two full moons.

413
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.800
He had a thousand noses,

414
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.930
horns whelked and waved like the enridged sea.

415
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.930
It was some fiend.

416
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:06.030
Therefore, thou happy father, think that the clearest gods,

417
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.730
who make them honors of men's impossibilities,

418
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.670
have preserved thee.

419
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.700
I do remember now.

420
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.870
Henceforth, I'll bear affliction

421
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.300
till it do cry out itself, "Enough, enough," and die.

422
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.570
That thing you speak of, I took it for a man.

423
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.300
Often 'twould say, "The fiend, the fiend."

424
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.930
He led me to that place.

425
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.600
Bear free and patient thoughts.

426
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.830
Huh?

427
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.130
Who comes here?

428
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.930
No, they cannot touch me for coining;

429
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.830
I am the king himself.

430
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.330
O thou side-piercing sight.

431
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.300
Nature's above art in that respect.

432
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.300
There's your press-money.

433
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.470
The fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper.

434
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.700
Draw me a clothier's yard!

435
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.570
Look, look, a mouse.

436
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.070
See, see, this piece of toasted cheese will do it.

437
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.030
There's my gauntlet.

438
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.370
I'll prove it on a giant.

439
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.100
Bring up the brown bills!

440
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:39.970
O, well flown, bird.

441
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.170
I' the clout, i' the clout, pssshw!

442
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.030
Give the word.

443
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.170
Sweet marjoram.

444
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.200
Pass.

445
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.570
I know that voice.

446
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.630
Ah!

447
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.400
Goneril, with a white beard!

448
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.770
They flattered me like a dog,

449
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.830
told me I had white hairs in my beard

450
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.530
before the black ones were there.

451
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.670
To say "aye" and "no" to everything that I said.

452
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.900
"Aye" and "no" too was no good divinity.

453
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.600
When the rain came to wet me once

454
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.170
and the wind to make me chatter,

455
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.330
when the thunder would not peace at my bidding,

456
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.200
there I found 'em.

457
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.400
There I smelt 'em out.

458
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.900
Go to, they're not men o' their words.

459
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.870
They told me I was everything.

460
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.470
'Tis a lie; I am not ague-proof.

461
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.200
The trick of that voice I do well remember.

462
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.770
Is it not the king?

463
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:49.970
Aye, every inch a king.

464
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.330
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.

465
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:58.400
I pardon that man's life.

466
00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:58.770
What was thy cause?

467
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.130
Adultery?

468
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.700
Thou shalt not die.

469
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.930
Die for adultery? No.

470
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.030
The wren goes to 't.

471
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.100
The small gilded fly does lecher in my sight.

472
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.900
Let copulation thrive,

473
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.130
for Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to his father

474
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.630
than my daughters got 'tween the lawful sheets.

475
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.530
To it, luxury, pell-mell.

476
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.930
For I lack soldiers.

477
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.300
Behold yond simpering dame,

478
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.570
whose face between her forks presages snow,

479
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.900
that minces virtue

480
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.600
and does shake the head to hear of pleasure's name.

481
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.070
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse,

482
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.330
goes to 't with a more riotous appetite.

483
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.970
Down from the waist, they are centaurs,

484
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.200
though women all above.

485
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.430
But to the girdle do the gods inherit;

486
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.970
beneath is all the fiends'.

487
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.730
There's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulfurous pit.

488
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.830
Burning, scalding, stench, consumption.

489
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.170
Fie, fie, fie!

490
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.830
Agh!

491
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.770
Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary,

492
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.670
to sweeten my imagination.

493
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.500
There's money for thee.

494
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.200
O, let me kiss that hand.

495
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.800
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

496
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.770
O ruined piece of nature.

497
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.430
This great world shall so wear out to naught.

498
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.870
Dost thou know me?

499
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.330
I remember thine eyes well enough.

500
00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.130
Dost squinny at me?

501
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.730
No, do thy worst, blind Cupid;

502
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.970
I'll not love.

503
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.600
Read thou this challenge.

504
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.530
Mark but the penning of it.

505
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.800
Were all thy letters suns, I could not see one.

506
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.630
I would not take this from report.

507
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.630
It is, and my heart breaks at it.

508
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:09.700
Read!

509
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.430
What, with the case of eyes?

510
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.000
O, ho, are you there with me?

511
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.300
No eyes in your head nor no money in your purse?

512
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.270
Your eyes are in a heavy case and your purse in a light.

513
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.200
Yet you may see how this world goes.

514
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.430
I see it feelingly.

515
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.170
What, art mad?

516
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.830
A man may see how this world goes with no eyes.

517
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.270
Look with thine ears.

518
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:37.730
See how yond justice rails on yond simple thief.

519
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.770
Hark, in thine ear.

520
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.730
Change places and, handy-dandy,

521
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.970
which is the justice and which the thief?

522
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.700
Hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?

523
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.730
Aye, sir.

524
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.370
And the creature run from the cur?

525
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:56.070
There thou mightst behold the great image of authority.

526
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.400
A dog's obeyed in office.

527
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.870
Woof, woof, woof!

528
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.970
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!

529
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.900
Why dost thou lash that whore?

530
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.630
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind

531
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.230
for which thou whipp'st her.

532
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.330
The usurer hangs the cozener.

533
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:25.570
Through tattered clothes, small vices do appear.

534
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.570
Robes and furred gowns hide all.

535
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.970
Plate sin with gold,

536
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.030
and the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks.

537
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.400
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.

538
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.970
None does offend, none, I say, none.

539
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.170
I'll able 'em.

540
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.730
Take this of me, my friend,

541
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:54.130
who have the power to seal the accuser's lips.

542
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:58.530
Get thee glass eyes and, like a scurvy politician,

543
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.230
seem to see the things thou dost not.

544
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.900
Now, now, now, now.

545
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.100
Pull off my boots.

546
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.230
Harder, harder.

547
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.530
So.

548
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.770
O, matter and impertinency mixed.

549
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.900
Reason in madness.

550
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.430
If thou wilt weep my fortune, take my eyes.

551
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.600
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.

552
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.800
Thou must be patient!

553
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.470
We came crying hither.

554
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.770
Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,

555
00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.200
we wawl and cry.

556
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.400
I will preach to thee. Mark.

557
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.270
Alack, alack the day.

558
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.330
When we are born, we cry that we are come

559
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.970
to this great stage of fools.

560
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.500
This a good block.

561
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.300
It were a delicate stratagem

562
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:12.430
to shoe a troop of horse with felt.

563
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.100
I'll put it in proof,

564
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.630
and when I've stolen upon these son-in-laws,

565
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.970
then, kill, kill...

566
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.670
Here he is. Lay a hand upon him.

567
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.470
Sir, your most dear daughter

568
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.730
No rescue?

569
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.700
What, a prisoner?

570
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.270
I am even the natural fool of fortune.

571
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.770
Use me well; you shall have ransom.

572
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:46.200
Let me have surgeons; I am cut to the brains.

573
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.370
You shall have anything.

574
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.830
No seconds?

575
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.230
All myself?

576
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.830
Why, this would make a man a man of salt,

577
00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.630
to use his eyes for garden water-pots,

578
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.970
aye, and laying autumn's dust.

579
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.030
Good sir.

580
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:09.670
I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom.

581
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.370
What?

582
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.430
I will be jovial.

583
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.470
Come, come.

584
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:24.500
I am a king, my masters.

585
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.530
Know you that?

586
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.330
You are a royal one, and we obey you.

587
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.400
Then there's life in't.

588
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.770
And you shall get it, you shall get it by running!

589
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.630
A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,

590
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.830
past speaking of in a king.

591
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.530
Hail, gentle sir.

592
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.500
Sir, speed you. What's your will?

593
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.100
Do you know aught, sir, of a battle toward?

594
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.900
Most sure and vulgar.

595
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.330
Everyone hears that, which can distinguish sound.

596
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.170
But, by your favor, how near's the other army?

597
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.970
Near and on speedy foot.

598
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.570
The main descry stands on the hourly thought.

599
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.270
I thank you, sir. That's all.

600
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.870
Though that the queen on special cause is here,

601
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.930
her army is moved on.

602
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.500
I thank you, sir.

603
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:21.900
You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me.

604
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.230
Let not my worser spirit tempt me again

605
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.670
to die before you please.

606
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.070
Well pray you, father.

607
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:34.930
Now, good sir, what are you?

608
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:40.270
A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows

609
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.970
who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,

610
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.630
am pregnant to good pity.

611
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.330
Give me your arm; I'll lead you to some biding.

612
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.900
Hearty thanks.

613
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.570
The bounty and the benison of heaven to boot and boot.

614
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.000
A proclaimed prize.

615
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.300
Most happy.

616
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.970
That eyeless head of thine

617
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.470
was first framed flesh to raise my fortunes.

618
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.900
Thou old unhappy traitor, briefly thyself remember.

619
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.300
The sword is out that must destroy thee.

620
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.270
O, let thy friendly hand put strength enough to't.

621
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.930
Wherefore, bold peasant,

622
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.230
darest thou support a published traitor?

623
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.330
Hence, lest that the infection of his fortune take

624
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.500
like hold on thee.

625
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.470
Let go his arm.

626
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:37.970
Let go, slave, or thou diest.

627
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.630
Out, dunghill!

628
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.970
Slave, thou hast slain me.

629
00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.400
Villain, take my purse.

630
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:07.400
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body.

631
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:14.700
And take the letters which thou find'st about me

632
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.130
to Edmund, Earl of Gloucester.

633
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.930
Seek him out upon the English party.

634
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.530
O, untimely death.

635
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.030
Death.

636
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:42.470
I know thee well: a serviceable villain,

637
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.130
as duteous to the vices of thy mistress

638
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.930
as badness would desire.

639
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.430
What, is he dead?

640
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.130
Let's see; the letter that he speaks of

641
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.830
may be my friend.

642
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.230
Leave, gentle wax.

643
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.270
And, manners, blame us not.

644
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.400
To know our enemies' minds, we'd rip their hearts.

645
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.600
Their papers is most lawful.

646
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.330
"Let our reciprocal vowsbe remembered.

647
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.830
"You have many opportunities to cut him off.

648
00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.500
"If your will want not,

649
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.270
"time and place will be fruitfully offered.

650
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.370
"There is nothing done if he return the conqueror.

651
00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.930
"Then am I the prisoner and his bed my jail,

652
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:22.730
"from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me

653
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.900
"and supply the place for your labor.

654
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.670
"Your wife so I would say

655
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:31.230
Affectionate servant, Goneril."

656
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:36.130
O indistinguished space of woman's will.

657
00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.000
A plot upon her virtuous husband's life

658
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.400
and the exchange my brother.

659
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.670
The king is mad.

660
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:59.930
How stiff is my vile sense, that I stand up

661
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.930
and have ingenious feelings of my huge sorrows.

662
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.730
Better I were distract.

663
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.370
So should my thoughts be severed from my griefs

664
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:12.130
and woes by wrong imaginations

665
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.700
lose the knowledge of themselves.

666
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.470
Give me your hand.

667
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.270
Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum.

668
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:28.270
Come, father; I'll bestow you with a friend.

669
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:35.830
O thou good Kent,

670
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.730
how shall I live and work to match thy goodness?

671
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:43.130
My life will be too short and every measure fail me.

672
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.130
To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.

673
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.830
All my reports go with the modest truth

674
00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.700
nor more nor clipped, but so.

675
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.470
Be better suited.

676
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.900
These weeds are memories of those worser hours.

677
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.000
I prithee, put them off.

678
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.030
Pardon, dear madam.

679
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.070
Yet to be known shortens my made intent.

680
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.230
My boon I make it that you know me not

681
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.070
till time and I think meet.

682
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:06.100
Then be it so, my good lord.

683
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.970
How does the king?

684
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.800
Madam, sleeps still.

685
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.530
O you kind gods,

686
00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.400
cure this great breach in his abused nature.

687
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.430
The untuned and jarring senses,

688
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.300
O, wind up of this child-changed father.

689
00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.570
So please Your Majesty that we may wake the king.

690
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:22.800
He hath slept long.

691
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.530
Be governed by your knowledge,

692
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.370
and proceed in the sway of your own will.

693
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.900
Is he arrayed?

694
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.500
Aye, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep,

695
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.230
we put fresh garments on him.

696
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.300
Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.

697
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.100
I doubt not of his temperance.

698
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.300
Very well.

699
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.300
Please you, draw near.

700
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.130
O my dear father.

701
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.570
Restoration, hang thy medicine on my lips,

702
00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:02.430
and let this kiss repair those violent harms

703
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:07.230
that my two sisters have in thy reverence made.

704
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.270
Kind and dear princess.

705
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.230
Had you not been their father,

706
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.630
these white flakes did challenge pity of them.

707
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:26.100
Was this a face to be opposed against the warring winds?

708
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.300
Mine enemy's dog, though he had bit me,

709
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.200
should have stood that night against my fire.

710
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.300
And wast thou fain, poor father, to hovel thee

711
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.670
with swine and rogues forlorn in short and musty straw?

712
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.900
Alack, alack.

713
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.500
'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once

714
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.670
had not concluded all.

715
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.470
He wakes. Speak to him.

716
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:57.630
Madam, do you. 'Tis fittest.

717
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.030
How does my royal lord?

718
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.600
How fares Your Majesty?

719
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:21.400
You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave.

720
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:29.430
Thou art a soul in bliss,

721
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.000
but I am bound upon a wheel of fire

722
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.170
which mine own tears do scald like molten lead.

723
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:47.600
Sir, do you know me?

724
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:55.070
You are a spirit, I know.

725
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:59.330
Where did you die?

726
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.400
Still, still, far wide.

727
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.400
He's scarce awake; let him alone awhile.

728
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.270
Where have I been?

729
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.000
Where am I?

730
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.900
Fair daylight?

731
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.830
I am mightily abused.

732
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:32.730
I would e'en die with pity to see another thus.

733
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.900
I know not what to say.

734
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:48.170
I will not swear these are my hands.

735
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.230
Let's see.

736
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.830
I feel this pinprick.

737
00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:02.700
Would I were assured of my condition.

738
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.100
O, look upon me, sir,

739
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.930
and hold your hands in benediction o'er me.

740
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.830
No, sir, you must not kneel.

741
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.730
Pray, do not mock me.

742
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.500
I am a very foolish, fond old man,

743
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:37.170
fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less.

744
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:45.730
And, to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

745
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:57.870
Methinks I should know you and know this man.

746
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:05.370
Yet I am doubtful,

747
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:09.530
for I am mainly ignorant what place this is.

748
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:17.770
All my skill remembers not these garments.

749
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:22.730
Nor I know not where I did lodge last night.

750
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:37.530
Do not laugh at me, for as I am a man,

751
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:43.830
I think this lady to be my child Cordelia.

752
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:48.430
So I am. I am.

753
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.800
Be thy tears wet?

754
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.570
Yes, 'faith.

755
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.470
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.

756
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:09.470
I know you do not love me, for your sisters have,

757
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.970
as I remember, done me wrong.

758
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.770
You have some cause; they have not.

759
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.400
No cause.

760
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.830
Am I in France?

761
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.770
In your own kingdom, sir.

762
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.130
Do not abuse me.

763
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.970
Be comforted, good madam.

764
00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.630
The great rage, you see, is killed in him,

765
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.900
and yet it is danger

766
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.670
to make him even o'er the time he has lost.

767
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.970
Will it please your highness walk?

768
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.470
You must bear with me.

769
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:04.730
Pray you now, forget and forgive.

770
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.300
I am old and foolish.

771
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.400
Holds it true, sir,

772
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.470
that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?

773
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.970
Most certain, sir.

774
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.370
Who is the conductor of his people?

775
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:25.170
As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.

776
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.900
They say Edgar, his banished son,

777
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.330
is with the Earl of Kent in Germany.

778
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.500
Report is changeable.

779
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.600
'Tis time to look about.

780
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.330
The powers of the kingdom approach apace.

781
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:36.970
The arbitrament is like to be bloody.

782
00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:38.630
Fare you well, sir.

783
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.600
My point and period will be truly wrought,

784
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.430
or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

785
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.200
