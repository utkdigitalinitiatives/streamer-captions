00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.570


2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.670


3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.900
than still contemned andflattered.

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.830
To be worst,

5
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.270
the lowest and mostdejected thing of fortune,

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.630
stands still in esperance,lives not in fear.

7
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.930
The lamentable change isfrom the best.

8
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.500
The worst returns tolaughter.

9
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.000
Welcome, then,

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.770
thou unsubstantial airthat I embrace.

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.700
The wretch that thou hastblown unto the worst

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.730
owes nothing to thyblasts.

13
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.730
But who comes here?

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.500
My father, poorly led?

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.100
World, world, O world.

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.530
But that thy strangemutations make us hate thee,

17
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.770
life would not yield toage.

18
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.870
O, my good lord, I havebeen your tenant

19
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.430
and your father's tenantthese fourscore years.

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.800
Away, get thee away.

21
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.300
Good friend, be gone.

22
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.830
Thy comforts can do me nogood at all.

23
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.900
Thee, they may hurt.

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.700
But you cannot see yourway.

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.230
I have no way andtherefore want no eyes.

26
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.430
I stumbled when I saw.

27
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.730
Full oft 'tis seen, ourmeans secure us,

28
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.070
and our mere defects proveour commodities.

29
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.000
O dear son Edgar,

30
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.270
the food of thy abusedfather's wrath.

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.600
Might I but live to seethee in my touch,

32
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.370
I'd say I had eyes again.

33
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.300
How now?

34
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.370
Who's there?

35
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.400
O gods!

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.070
Who is't can say "I am atthe worst"?

37
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.600
I am worse than e'er Iwas.

38
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.970
'Tis poor mad Tom.

39
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.770
And worse I may be yet.

40
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.600
The worst is not

41
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.430
so long as we can say,"This is the worst."

42
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.970
Fellow, where goest?

43
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.470
Is it a beggar man?

44
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.830
Madman and beggar too.

45
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.870
He has some reason, elsehe could not beg.

46
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.930
In the last night's storm,I such a fellow saw

47
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.330
that made me think a man aworm.

48
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.600
My son came then into mymind,

49
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.830
and yet my mind was thenscarce friends with him.

50
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.900
I have heard more since.

51
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.800
As flies to wanton boysare we to the gods!

52
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.300
They kill us for theirsport.

53
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.270
How should this be?

54
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.800
Bad is the trade that mustplay fool to sorrow,

55
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.770
angering itself andothers.

56
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.600
Bless thee, master!

57
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.500
Is it the naked fellow?

58
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.800
Aye, my lord.

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.170
Then, prithee, get theegone.

60
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.700
If, for my sake, thou wilto'ertake us,

61
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.500
hence a mile or twain, i'the way toward Dover,

62
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.130
do it for ancient love,

63
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.930
and bring some coveringfor this naked soul,

64
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.130
which I'll entreat to leadme.

65
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.100
Alack, sir, he is mad.

66
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.200
'Tis the times' plague whenmadmen lead the blind.

67
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.930
Do as I bid thee, orrather do thy pleasure.

68
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.630
Above the rest, be gone.

69
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.600
I'll get him the bestapparel that I have,

70
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.270
come on't what will.

71
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.330
Sirrah, naked fellow.

72
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.700
Poor Tom's a-cold.

73
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.930
I cannot daub it further.

74
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.800
Come hither, fellow.

75
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.330
And yet I must.

76
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.630
Bless thy sweet eyes, theybleed.

77
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.170
Dost thou know the way toDover?

78
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.930
Both stile and gate,horseway and footpath.

79
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.970
Poor Tom hath been scaredout of his good wits.

80
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.370
Bless thee, good man'sson, from the foul fiend!

81
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.800
Five fiends have been inpoor Tom at once:

82
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.630
of lust, as Obidicut;

83
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.500
Hobbididence, prince ofdumbness;

84
00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.000
Mahu, of murder; Modo, ofstealing;

85
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.200
Flibbertigibbet, ofmopping and mowing,

86
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:39.470
who since possesseschambermaids and waitingwomen.

87
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.430
So bless thee, master.

88
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.130
Here, take this purse,

89
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.570
thou whom the heavens'plagues have humbled toall strokes.

90
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.730
That I am wretched makesthee the happier.

91
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.600
Heavens, deal so still.

92
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.370
Let the superfluous andlust-dieted man

93
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.170
that slaves yourordinance,

94
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.170
that will not see becausehe doth not feel,

95
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.700
feel your power quickly.

96
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.900
So distribution shouldundo excess

97
00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.330
and each man have enough.

98
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.600
Dost thou know Dover?

99
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.670
Aye, master.

100
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.570
There is a cliff, whosehigh and bending head

101
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.300
looks fearfully in theconfined deep.

102
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.500
Bring me but to the verybrim of it,

103
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.830
and I'll repair the miserythou dost bear

104
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.030
with something rich aboutme.

105
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.770
From that place, I shallno leading need.

106
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.030
Give me thy hand.

107
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.130
Poor Tom shall lead thee.

108
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.000
Welcome, my lord.

109
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.600
I marvel our mild husbandnot met us on the way.

110
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.300
Now, where's your master?

111
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.970
Madam, within, but neverman so changed.

112
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.830
I told him of the armythat was landed;

113
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.270
he smiled at it.

114
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.830
I told him you werecoming; his answer was,"The worse."

115
00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.900
Of Gloucester's treachery

116
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.530
and of the loyal serviceof his son,

117
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.830
when I informed him, thenhe called me sot

118
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.170
and told me I had turnedthe wrong side out.

119
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.030
What most he shoulddislike seems pleasant tohim;

120
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.270
what like, offensive.

121
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.930
Then shall you go nofurther.

122
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.570
It is the cowish terror ofhis spirit

123
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.000
that dares not undertake.

124
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.030
He'll not feel wrongswhich tie him to ananswer.

125
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.530
Our wishes on the way mayprove effects.

126
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.200
Back, Edmund, to mybrother.

127
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.270
Hasten his musters, andconduct his powers.

128
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.030
I must change arms at home

129
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.400
and give the distaff intomy husband's hands.

130
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.130
This trusty servant shallpass between us.

131
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.970
Ere long you are like tohear,

132
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.230
if you dare venture inyour own behalf,

133
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.430
a mistress's command.

134
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.470
Wear this.

135
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.430
No, spare speech.

136
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.770
Decline your head.

137
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.600
This kiss, if it durstspeak,

138
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.300
would stretch thy spiritsup into the air.

139
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.100
Conceive, and fare theewell.

140
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.070
Yours in the ranks ofdeath.

141
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.770
My most dear Gloucester.

142
00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.030
O, the difference of manand man.

143
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:05.600
To thee, a woman'sservices are due.

144
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.070
My fool usurps my body.

145
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.530
Madam, here comes my lord.

146
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.070
I have been worth thewhistle.

147
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.470
O Goneril.

148
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:26.170
You are not worth the dust

149
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:29.400
which the rude wind blowsin your face.

150
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.100
I fear your disposition.

151
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.830
That nature, whichcontemns its origin,

152
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.000
cannot be bordered certainin itself.

153
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.100
She that herself willsliver and disbranch

154
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.070
from her material sap

155
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.770
perforce must wither andcome to deadly use.

156
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.870
No more; the text isfoolish.

157
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.700
Wisdom and goodness to thevile seem vile.

158
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.400
Filths savor butthemselves.

159
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.600
What have you done?

160
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.530
Tigers, not daughters,what have you performed?

161
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.830
A father and a graciousaged man

162
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.070
whose reverence even thehead-lugged bear would lick

163
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.600
most barbarous, mostdegenerate,

164
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.270
have you madded.

165
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.600
Could my good brothersuffer you to do it?

166
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.570
A man, a prince, by him sobenefited?

167
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.600
If that the heavens do nottheir visible spirits

168
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.930
send quickly down to tamethese vile offenses,

169
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.270
it will come.

170
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.970
Humanity must perforceprey on itself

171
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.630
like monsters of the deep.

172
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.070
Milk-livered man

173
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.400
that bear'st a cheek forblows, a head for wrongs,

174
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.730
who hast not in thy brows

175
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.230
an eye discerning thinehonor from thy suffering,

176
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.500
that not know'st fools dothose villains pity

177
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.800
who are punished ere theyhave done their mischief.

178
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.800
Where's thy drum?

179
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.300
France spreads his bannersin our noiseless land.

180
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.270
With plumed helm, thystate begins to threat

181
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.570
whilst thou, a moral fool,

182
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.630
sit'st still and criest,"Alack, why does he so?"

183
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:02.130
See thyself, devil.

184
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.700
Proper deformity shows notin the fiend

185
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.970
so horrid as in woman.

186
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.330
O, vain fool!

187
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.300
Thou changed and self-coveredthing, for shame.

188
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.500
Be-monster not thyfeature.

189
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.770
Were it my fitness to letthese hands obey my blood,

190
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.930
they are apt enough todislocate and tear thyflesh and bones.

191
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:18.370
Howe'er thou art a fiend,

192
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.430
a woman's shape dothshield thee.

193
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:25.570
Marry, your manhood.

194
00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.830
What news?

195
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.800
O, my good lord, the Dukeof Cornwall's dead,

196
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:30.970
slain by his servant,

197
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.130
going to put out the othereye of Gloucester.

198
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.930
Gloucester's eye?

199
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.200
A servant that he bred,thrilled with remorse,

200
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.470
opposed against the act,

201
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.530
bending his sword to hisgreat master,

202
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.300
who, thereat enraged, flewon him

203
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.100
and amongst them felledhim dead

204
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.900
but not without thatharmful stroke

205
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.970
which since hath pluckedhim after.

206
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.830
This shows you are above,you justicers,

207
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.630
that these, our nethercrimes, so speedily canvenge.

208
00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.800
O poor Gloucester, lost hehis other eye?

209
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.800
Both, both, my lord.

210
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.200
This letter, madam, cravesa speedy answer.

211
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.870
'Tis from your sister.

212
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.600
One way I like this well.

213
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.170
But being widow and myGloucester with her,

214
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.230
may all the building of myfancy pluck

215
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.600
upon my hateful life.

216
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.000
Another way, the news isnot so tart.

217
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.870
I'll read and answer.

218
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.730
Where was his son whenthey did take his eyes?

219
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.070
Come with my lady hither.

220
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.230
He is not here.

221
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.970
No, my good lord; I methim back again.

222
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.430
Knows he the wickedness?

223
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:40.070
Aye, my good lord; 'twashe informed against him

224
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.930
and quit the house onpurpose

225
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.570
that their punishmentmight have the freercourse.

226
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.230
Gloucester, I live tothank thee

227
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.930
for the love thou show'dstthe king

228
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:53.000
and to revenge thine eyes.

229
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.530
Come hither, friend. Tellme what more thou know'st.

230
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.630
Alack, 'tis he.

231
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.670
Why, he was met even nowas mad as the vexed sea,

232
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:06.970
singing aloud,

233
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.770
crowned with rank fumiterand furrow-weeds,

234
00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:13.470
with hardocks, hemlock,nettles, cuckoo-flowers,Darnel,

235
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.630
and all the idle weedsthat grow in oursustaining corn.

236
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.070
A century send forth.

237
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.100
Search every acre in thehigh-grown field,

238
00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.030
and bring him to our eye.

239
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.000
What can man's wisdom

240
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.030
in the restoring hisbereaved sense?

241
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.800
He that helps him take allmy outward worth.

242
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.700
There is means, madam.

243
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.370
Our foster-nurse of natureis repose,

244
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.670
the which he lacks.

245
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.770
That to provoke in him aremany simples operative

246
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.870
whose power will close theeye of anguish.

247
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.200
All blest secrets,

248
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.270
all you unpublishedvirtues of the Earth,

249
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.300
spring with my tears.

250
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.500
Be aidant and remediate inthe good man's distress.

251
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.330
Seek, seek for him, lesthis ungoverned rage

252
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.400
dissolve the life thatwants the means to lead it.

253
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.770
News, madam.

254
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.570
The British powers aremarching hitherward.

255
00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:06.730
'Tis known before;

256
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.470
our preparation stands inexpectation of them.

257
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.030
O dear father,

258
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.470
it is thy business that Igo about.

259
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.030
Therefore, great France

260
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.270
my mourning and importunetears hath pitied.

261
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.200
No blown ambition doth ourarms incite

262
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:38.770
but love, dear love, andour aged father's right.

263
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:45.270
Soon may I hear and seehim.

264
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.930
But are my brother'spowers set forth?

265
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.130
Aye, madam.

266
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.770
Himself in person there?

267
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.470
Madam, with much ado.

268
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.370
Your sister is the bettersoldier.

269
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.530
Lord Edmund spoke not toyour lord at home?

270
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.000
No, madam.

271
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.100
What might import mysister's letter to him?

272
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.470
I know not, lady.

273
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.200
'Faith, he is posted henceon serious matter.

274
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.470
It was great ignorance,Gloucester's eyes being out,

275
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.570
to let him live.

276
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.730
Where he arrives, he movesall hearts against us.

277
00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.100
Edmund, I think, is gone,in pity of his misery,

278
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.070
to dispatch his nightedlife

279
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.170
moreover, to descry thestrength o' the enemy.

280
00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:29.070
I must needs after him,madam, with my letter.

281
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.330
Our troops set forthtomorrow.

282
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:34.870
Stay with us; the ways aredangerous.

283
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:36.430
I may not, madam.

284
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.530
My lady charged my duty inthis business.

285
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.400
Why should she write toEdmund?

286
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:44.400
Might not you transporther purposes by word?

287
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:51.100
Belike, somethings I knownot what.

288
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.200
I'll love thee much; letme unseal the letter.

289
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.370
Madam, I had rather

290
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.030
I know your lady does notlove her husband.

291
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.430
I'm sure of that.

292
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.200
And at her late beinghere, she gave strangeoeillades

293
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.270
and most speaking looks tonoble Edmund.

294
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.370
- I know you are of herbosom. - I?

295
00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.730
I speak in understanding.You are; I know it.

296
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.900
Therefore I do advisethee, take this note.

297
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.330
My lord is dead.

298
00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.070
Edmund and I have talked.

299
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.600
And more convenient is hefor my hand

300
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.000
than for your lady's.

301
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.300
You may gather more.

302
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.630
If you do find him, prayyou, give him this.

303
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:38.400
And when your mistresshears thus much from you,I pray,

304
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.400
desire her call her wisdomto her.

305
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.400
And so farewell.

306
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.370
If you do chance to hearof that blind traitor,

307
00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:55.500
preferment falls on himthat cuts him off.

308
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.130
Would I could meet him,madam.

309
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.670
I should show what party Ido follow.

310
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.100
Fare thee well.

311
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.170
When shall I come to thetop of that same hill?

312
00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.730
You do climb up it now.

313
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.130
Look how we labor.

314
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.470
Methinks the ground iseven.

315
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.730
Horrible steep.

316
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.730
Hark, do you hear the sea?

317
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.430
No, truly.

318
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.130
Why, then, your othersenses grow imperfect

319
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:29.630
by your eyes' anguish.

320
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.630
So may it be, indeed.

321
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.630
Methinks thy voice isaltered and thou speak'st

322
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.570
in better phrase andmatter than thou didst.

323
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.730
You are much deceived.

324
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.500
In nothing am I changedbut in my garments.

325
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.770
Methinks you're betterspoken.

326
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.930
Come on, sir.

327
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.330
Here's the place.

328
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.570
Stand still.

329
00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:05.000
How fearful and dizzy 'tisto cast one's eyes so low.

330
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.670
The crows and choughs thatwing the midway air

331
00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.500
show scarce so gross asbeetles.

332
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.670
Halfway down hangs one

333
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.700
that gathers samphire,dreadful trade.

334
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.270
Methinks he seems nobigger than his head.

335
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.370
The fishermen that walkupon the beach

336
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:30.270
appear like mice

337
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:35.770
and yond tall anchoring bark,diminished to her cock,

338
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.200
her cock a buoy almost toosmall for sight.

339
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.500
The murmuring surge

340
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.700
that on the unnumberedidle pebbles chafes

341
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.770
cannot be heard so high.

342
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:51.300
I'll look no more lest mybrain turn

343
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.230
and the deficient sighttopple down headlong.

344
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.200
Set me where you stand.

345
00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.570
Give me your hand.

346
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:05.670
You are now within a footof the extreme verge.

347
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.200
For all beneath the moonwould I not leap upright.

348
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.870
Let go my hand.

349
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.730
Here, friend, 's anotherpurse,

350
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:17.300
in it a jewel well worth apoor man's taking.

351
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.600
Fairies and gods prosperit with thee.

352
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.930
Go thou further off.

353
00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:25.970
Bid me farewell, and letme hear thee going.

354
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.300
Now fare you well, goodsir!

355
00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.370
With all my heart.

356
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.870
Why I do trifle thus withhis despair

357
00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:33.300
is done to cure it.

358
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.530
O you mighty gods.

359
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.530
This world I do renounceand, in your sights,

360
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.670
shake patiently my greataffliction off.

361
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.230
If I could bear it longerand not fall to quarrel

362
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:45.530
with your great opposelesswills,

363
00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.400
my snuff and loathed partof nature

364
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.070
should burn itself out.

365
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.570
If Edgar live, O, blesshim.

366
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.070
Now, fellow, fare theewell.

367
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.870
Gone, sir! Farewell!

368
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.030
And yet I know not howconceit may rob thetreasury of life

369
00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.270
when life itself yields tothe theft.

370
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.630
Had he been where hethought, by this, hadthought been past.

371
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.800
Alive or dead?

372
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:20.200
Ho, you sir.

373
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.130
Friend?

374
00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.000
Hear you, sir.

375
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.830
Speak.

376
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:31.630
Thus might he pass indeed.

377
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.370
Yet he revives.

378
00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.670
What are you, sir?

379
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.600
Away, and let me die.

380
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.930
Hadst thou been aught butgossamer, feathers, air,

381
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.230
so many fathoms downprecipitating,

382
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.970
thou'dst shiver'st like anegg.

383
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.800
But thou dost breathe,hast heavy substance,

384
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.100
bleed'st not, speak'st,art sound.

385
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.170
Ten masts at each make notthe altitude

386
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.930
which thou hastperpendicularly fell.

387
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.600
Thy life's a miracle.

388
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.100
Speak yet again.

389
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.600
Have I fallen, or no?

390
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.000
From the dread summit ofthis chalky bourn.

391
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.300
Look up a-height.

392
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.530
The shrill-gorged lark cannotbe seen or heard so far.

393
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.570
Do but look up.

394
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.170
Alack, I have no eyes.

395
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.070
Is wretchedness deprivedthat benefit

396
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.470
to end itself by death?

397
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:17.930
'Twas yet some comfort,

398
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.530
when misery could beguilethe tyrant's rage

399
00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:23.430
and frustrate his proudwill.

400
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.500
Give me your arm.

401
00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.030
Up.

402
00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.600
So.

403
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.630
How is 't?

404
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:33.970
Feel you your legs?

405
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.030
You stand.

406
00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.030
Too well, too well.

407
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.030
This is above allstrangeness.

408
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.170
Upon the crown o' thecliff,

409
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.770
what thing was that whichparted from you?

410
00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.530
A poor unfortunate beggar.

411
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.630
As I stood here below,

412
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.330
methought his eyes weretwo full moons.

413
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.800
He had a thousand noses,

414
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:58.930
horns whelked and wavedlike the enridged sea.

415
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:00.930
It was some fiend.

416
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:06.030
Therefore, thou happyfather, think that theclearest gods,

417
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.730
who make them honors ofmen's impossibilities,

418
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.670
have preserved thee.

419
00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.700
I do remember now.

420
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.870
Henceforth, I'll bearaffliction

421
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:20.300
till it do cry out itself,"Enough, enough," and die.

422
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.570
That thing you speak of, Itook it for a man.

423
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.300
Often 'twould say, "Thefiend, the fiend."

424
00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.930
He led me to that place.

425
00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:30.600
Bear free and patientthoughts.

426
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.830
Huh?

427
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.130
Who comes here?

428
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.930
No, they cannot touch mefor coining;

429
00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:44.830
I am the king himself.

430
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.330
O thou side-piercingsight.

431
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.300
Nature's above art in thatrespect.

432
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.300
There's your press-money.

433
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.470
The fellow handles his bowlike a crow-keeper.

434
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:59.700
Draw me a clothier's yard!

435
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:05.570
Look, look, a mouse.

436
00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.070
See, see, this piece oftoasted cheese will do it.

437
00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.030
There's my gauntlet.

438
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:28.370
I'll prove it on a giant.

439
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.100
Bring up the brown bills!

440
00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:39.970
O, well flown, bird.

441
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:44.170
I' the clout, i' theclout, pssshw!

442
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.030
Give the word.

443
00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:47.170
Sweet marjoram.

444
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.200
Pass.

445
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.570
I know that voice.

446
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.630
Ah!

447
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.400
Goneril, with a whitebeard!

448
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.770
They flattered me like adog,

449
00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.830
told me I had white hairsin my beard

450
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:00.530
before the black ones werethere.

451
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:04.670
To say "aye" and "no" toeverything that I said.

452
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.900
"Aye" and "no" too was nogood divinity.

453
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.600
When the rain came to wetme once

454
00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.170
and the wind to make mechatter,

455
00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.330
when the thunder would notpeace at my bidding,

456
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.200
there I found 'em.

457
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.400
There I smelt 'em out.

458
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.900
Go to, they're not men o'their words.

459
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.870
They told me I waseverything.

460
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.470
'Tis a lie; I am notague-proof.

461
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.200
The trick of that voice Ido well remember.

462
00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.770
Is it not the king?

463
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:49.970
Aye, every inch a king.

464
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.330
When I do stare, see howthe subject quakes.

465
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:58.400
I pardon that man's life.

466
00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:58.770
What was thy cause?

467
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.130
Adultery?

468
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.700
Thou shalt not die.

469
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.930
Die for adultery? No.

470
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.030
The wren goes to 't.

471
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:11.100
The small gilded fly doeslecher in my sight.

472
00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.900
Let copulation thrive,

473
00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:17.130
for Gloucester's bastardson was kinder to hisfather

474
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.630
than my daughters got'tween the lawful sheets.

475
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.530
To it, luxury, pell-mell.

476
00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.930
For I lack soldiers.

477
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:37.300
Behold yond simperingdame,

478
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.570
whose face between herforks presages snow,

479
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.900
that minces virtue

480
00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.600
and does shake the head tohear of pleasure's name.

481
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.070
The fitchew, nor thesoiled horse,

482
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.330
goes to 't with a moreriotous appetite.

483
00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:54.970
Down from the waist, theyare centaurs,

484
00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:57.200
though women all above.

485
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.430
But to the girdle do thegods inherit;

486
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:01.970
beneath is all thefiends'.

487
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.730
There's hell, there'sdarkness, there is thesulfurous pit.

488
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.830
Burning, scalding, stench,consumption.

489
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.170
Fie, fie, fie!

490
00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:14.830
Agh!

491
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.770
Give me an ounce of civet,good apothecary,

492
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.670
to sweeten my imagination.

493
00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:20.500
There's money for thee.

494
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.200
O, let me kiss that hand.

495
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.800
Let me wipe it first; itsmells of mortality.

496
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.770
O ruined piece of nature.

497
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.430
This great world shall sowear out to naught.

498
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.870
Dost thou know me?

499
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.330
I remember thine eyes wellenough.

500
00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.130
Dost squinny at me?

501
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:47.730
No, do thy worst, blindCupid;

502
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.970
I'll not love.

503
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.600
Read thou this challenge.

504
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.530
Mark but the penning ofit.

505
00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.800
Were all thy letters suns,I could not see one.

506
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.630
I would not take this fromreport.

507
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.630
It is, and my heart breaksat it.

508
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:09.700
Read!

509
00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.430
What, with the case ofeyes?

510
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.000
O, ho, are you there withme?

511
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.300
No eyes in your head norno money in your purse?

512
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.270
Your eyes are in a heavy caseand your purse in a light.

513
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.200
Yet you may see how thisworld goes.

514
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.430
I see it feelingly.

515
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.170
What, art mad?

516
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.830
A man may see how thisworld goes with no eyes.

517
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.270
Look with thine ears.

518
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:37.730
See how yond justice railson yond simple thief.

519
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:38.770
Hark, in thine ear.

520
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.730
Change places and,handy-dandy,

521
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.970
which is the justice andwhich the thief?

522
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.700
Hast seen a farmer's dogbark at a beggar?

523
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:47.730
Aye, sir.

524
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:49.370
And the creature run fromthe cur?

525
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:56.070
There thou mightst beholdthe great image ofauthority.

526
00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.400
A dog's obeyed in office.

527
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:03.870
Woof, woof, woof!

528
00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:06.970
Thou rascal beadle, holdthy bloody hand!

529
00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.900
Why dost thou lash thatwhore?

530
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.630
Thou hotly lust'st to useher in that kind

531
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:13.230
for which thou whipp'sther.

532
00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:20.330
The usurer hangs thecozener.

533
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:25.570
Through tattered clothes,small vices do appear.

534
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:29.570
Robes and furred gownshide all.

535
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.970
Plate sin with gold,

536
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.030
and the strong lance ofjustice hurtless breaks.

537
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.400
Arm it in rags, a pigmy'sstraw does pierce it.

538
00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.970
None does offend, none, Isay, none.

539
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.170
I'll able 'em.

540
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.730
Take this of me, myfriend,

541
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:54.130
who have the power to sealthe accuser's lips.

542
00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:58.530
Get thee glass eyes and,like a scurvy politician,

543
00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.230
seem to see the thingsthou dost not.

544
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.900
Now, now, now, now.

545
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.100
Pull off my boots.

546
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:10.230
Harder, harder.

547
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.530
So.

548
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.770
O, matter and impertinencymixed.

549
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:17.900
Reason in madness.

550
00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.430
If thou wilt weep myfortune, take my eyes.

551
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.600
I know thee well enough;thy name is Gloucester.

552
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.800
Thou must be patient!

553
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.470
We came crying hither.

554
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:32.770
Thou know'st, the firsttime that we smell the air,

555
00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.200
we wawl and cry.

556
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.400
I will preach to thee.Mark.

557
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.270
Alack, alack the day.

558
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:45.330
When we are born, we crythat we are come

559
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.970
to this great stage offools.

560
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.500
This a good block.

561
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.300
It were a delicatestratagem

562
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:12.430
to shoe a troop of horsewith felt.

563
00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:16.100
I'll put it in proof,

564
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.630
and when I've stolen uponthese son-in-laws,

565
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.970
then, kill, kill...

566
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.670
Here he is. Lay a handupon him.

567
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.470
Sir, your most deardaughter

568
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:25.730
No rescue?

569
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.700
What, a prisoner?

570
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:31.270
I am even the natural foolof fortune.

571
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:34.770
Use me well; you shallhave ransom.

572
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:46.200
Let me have surgeons; I amcut to the brains.

573
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.370
You shall have anything.

574
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.830
No seconds?

575
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:54.230
All myself?

576
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.830
Why, this would make a mana man of salt,

577
00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.630
to use his eyes for gardenwater-pots,

578
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:02.970
aye, and laying autumn'sdust.

579
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.030
Good sir.

580
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:09.670
I will die bravely, like asmug bridegroom.

581
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:11.370
What?

582
00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.430
I will be jovial.

583
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.470
Come, come.

584
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:24.500
I am a king, my masters.

585
00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.530
Know you that?

586
00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.330
You are a royal one, andwe obey you.

587
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.400
Then there's life in't.

588
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.770
And you shall get it, youshall get it by running!

589
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.630
A sight most pitiful inthe meanest wretch,

590
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:46.830
past speaking of in aking.

591
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:48.530
Hail, gentle sir.

592
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:50.500
Sir, speed you. What'syour will?

593
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.100
Do you know aught, sir, ofa battle toward?

594
00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.900
Most sure and vulgar.

595
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.330
Everyone hears that, whichcan distinguish sound.

596
00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.170
But, by your favor, hownear's the other army?

597
00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.970
Near and on speedy foot.

598
00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:03.570
The main descry stands onthe hourly thought.

599
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:05.270
I thank you, sir. That'sall.

600
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:07.870
Though that the queen onspecial cause is here,

601
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.930
her army is moved on.

602
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:14.500
I thank you, sir.

603
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:21.900
You ever-gentle gods, takemy breath from me.

604
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:25.230
Let not my worser spirittempt me again

605
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:26.670
to die before you please.

606
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:29.070
Well pray you, father.

607
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:34.930
Now, good sir, what areyou?

608
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:40.270
A most poor man, made tameto fortune's blows

609
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.970
who, by the art of knownand feeling sorrows,

610
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:46.630
am pregnant to good pity.

611
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.330
Give me your arm; I'lllead you to some biding.

612
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.900
Hearty thanks.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:56.570
The bounty and the benisonof heaven to boot andboot.

614
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.000
A proclaimed prize.

615
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.300
Most happy.

616
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.970
That eyeless head of thine

617
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:08.470
was first framed flesh toraise my fortunes.

618
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.900
Thou old unhappy traitor,briefly thyself remember.

619
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:15.300
The sword is out that mustdestroy thee.

620
00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.270
O, let thy friendly handput strength enough to't.

621
00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.930
Wherefore, bold peasant,

622
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:23.230
darest thou support apublished traitor?

623
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.330
Hence, lest that theinfection of his fortune take

624
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.500
like hold on thee.

625
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:33.470
Let go his arm.

626
00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:37.970
Let go, slave, or thoudiest.

627
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.630
Out, dunghill!

628
00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.970
Slave, thou hast slain me.

629
00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.400
Villain, take my purse.

630
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:07.400
If ever thou wilt thrive,bury my body.

631
00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:14.700
And take the letters whichthou find'st about me

632
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.130
to Edmund, Earl ofGloucester.

633
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.930
Seek him out upon theEnglish party.

634
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:31.530
O, untimely death.

635
00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.030
Death.

636
00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:42.470
I know thee well: aserviceable villain,

637
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.130
as duteous to the vices ofthy mistress

638
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.930
as badness would desire.

639
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:51.430
What, is he dead?

640
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.130
Let's see; the letter thathe speaks of

641
00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.830
may be my friend.

642
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.230
Leave, gentle wax.

643
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.270
And, manners, blame usnot.

644
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:03.400
To know our enemies'minds, we'd rip theirhearts.

645
00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.600
Their papers is mostlawful.

646
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.330
"Let our reciprocal vowsberemembered.

647
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.830
"You have many opportunitiesto cut him off.

"If your will want not,

"time and place will befruitfully offered.

"There is nothing done ifhe return the conqueror.

Affectionate servant,Goneril."

656
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:36.130
O indistinguished space ofwoman's will.

657
00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:39.000
A plot upon her virtuoushusband's life

658
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.400
and the exchange mybrother.

659
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.670
The king is mad.

660
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:59.930
How stiff is my vilesense, that I stand up

661
00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.930
and have ingeniousfeelings of my hugesorrows.

662
00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.730
Better I were distract.

663
00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.370
So should my thoughts besevered from my griefs

664
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:12.130
and woes by wrongimaginations

665
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.700
lose the knowledge ofthemselves.

666
00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.470
Give me your hand.

667
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.270
Far off, methinks, I hearthe beaten drum.

668
00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:28.270
Come, father; I'll bestowyou with a friend.

669
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:35.830
O thou good Kent,

670
00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.730
how shall I live and workto match thy goodness?

671
00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:43.130
My life will be too shortand every measure fail me.

672
00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:45.130
To be acknowledged, madam,is o'erpaid.

673
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.830
All my reports go with themodest truth

674
00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.700
nor more nor clipped, butso.

675
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.470
Be better suited.

676
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.900
These weeds are memoriesof those worser hours.

677
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.000
I prithee, put them off.

678
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.030
Pardon, dear madam.

679
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.070
Yet to be known shortensmy made intent.

680
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.230
My boon I make it that youknow me not

681
00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.070
till time and I thinkmeet.

682
00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:06.100
Then be it so, my goodlord.

683
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.970
How does the king?

684
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.800
Madam, sleeps still.

685
00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.530
O you kind gods,

687
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.430
The untuned and jarringsenses,

688
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.300
O, wind up of thischild-changed father.

689

So please Your Majestythat we may wake the king.

690
00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:22.800
He hath slept long.

Be governed by yourknowledge,

692
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.370
and proceed in the sway ofyour own will.

693
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.900
Is he arrayed?

694
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.500
Aye, madam; in theheaviness of his sleep,

695
00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.230

Please you, draw near.

700
00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.130
O my dear father.

that my two sisters havein thy reverence made.

704
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:09.270
Kind and dear princess.

705
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.230
Had you not been theirfather,

706
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.630
these white flakes didchallenge pity of them.

707
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:26.100
Was this a face to beopposed against thewarring winds?

708
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.300
Mine enemy's dog, thoughhe had bit me,

709
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.200
should have stood thatnight against my fire.

710
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.300
And wast thou fain, poorfather, to hovel thee

711
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:41.670
with swine and roguesforlorn in short and mustystraw?

712
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:42.900
Alack, alack.

713
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.500
'Tis wonder that thy lifeand wits at once

714
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.670
had not concluded all.

715
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.470
He wakes. Speak to him.

716
00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:57.630
Madam, do you. 'Tisfittest.

717
00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.030
How does my royal lord?

718
00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.600
How fares Your Majesty?

719
00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:21.400
You do me wrong to take meout o' the grave.

720
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:29.430
Thou art a soul in bliss,

721
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.000
but I am bound upon awheel of fire

722
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.170

723
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:47.600
Sir, do you know me?

724
00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:55.070
You are a spirit, I know.

725
00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:59.330
Where did you die?

726
00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.400
Still, still, far wide.

727
00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.400
He's scarce awake; let himalone awhile.

728
00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.270
Where have I been?

729
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:18.000
Where am I?

730
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.900
Fair daylight?

731
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.830
I am mightily abused.

732
00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:32.730
I would e'en die with pityto see another thus.

733
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.900
I know not what to say.

734
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:48.170
I will not swear these aremy hands.

735
00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.230
Let's see.

736
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.830
I feel this pinprick.

737
00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:02.700
Would I were assured of mycondition.

738
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.100
O, look upon me, sir,

739
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.930
and hold your hands inbenediction o'er me.

740
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:19.830
No, sir, you must notkneel.

741
00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:24.730
Pray, do not mock me.

742
00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:28.500
I am a very foolish, fondold man,

743
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:37.170
fourscore and upward, notan hour more nor less.

744
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:45.730
And, to deal plainly, Ifear I am not in myperfect mind.

745
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:57.870
Methinks I should know youand know this man.

746
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:05.370
Yet I am doubtful,

747
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:09.530
for I am mainly ignorantwhat place this is.

748
00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:17.770
All my skill remembers notthese garments.

749
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:22.730
Nor I know not where I didlodge last night.

750
00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:37.530
Do not laugh at me, for asI am a man,

751
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:43.830
I think this lady to be mychild Cordelia.

752
00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:48.430
So I am. I am.

753
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.800
Be thy tears wet?

754
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.570
Yes, 'faith.

755
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.470
If you have poison for me,I will drink it.

756
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:09.470
I know you do not love me,for your sisters have,

757
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:13.970
as I remember, done mewrong.

758
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:18.770
You have some cause; theyhave not.

759
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:21.400
No cause.

760
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.830
Am I in France?

761
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:26.770
In your own kingdom, sir.

762
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:29.130
Do not abuse me.

763
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.970
Be comforted, good madam.

764
00:42:30.970 --> 00:42:33.630
The great rage, you see,is killed in him,

765
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:34.900
and yet it is danger

766
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.670
to make him even o'er thetime he has lost.

767
00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.970
Will it please yourhighness walk?

768
00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.470
You must bear with me.

769
00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:04.730
Pray you now, forget andforgive.

770
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.300
I am old and foolish.

771
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.400
Holds it true, sir,

772
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.470
that the Duke of Cornwallwas so slain?

773
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:18.970
Most certain, sir.

774
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:21.370
Who is the conductor ofhis people?

775
00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:25.170
As 'tis said, the bastardson of Gloucester.

776
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.900
They say Edgar, hisbanished son,

777
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.330
is with the Earl of Kentin Germany.

778
00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.500
Report is changeable.

779
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.600
'Tis time to look about.

780
00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.330
The powers of the kingdomapproach apace.

781
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:36.970
The arbitrament is like tobe bloody.

782
00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:38.630
Fare you well, sir.

783
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.600
My point and period willbe truly wrought,

784
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.430
or well or ill, as thisday's battle's fought.

785
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.200
