00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.000


3
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.330
Escalus.

4
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.970
My lord.

5
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.170
Of government the properties to unfold,

6
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.470
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;

7
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.930
Since I am put to know that your own science

8
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.730
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice

9
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.200
My strength can give you: then no more remains,

10
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.000
But that to your sufficiency

11
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.430
as your Worth is able,

12
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.930
And let them work.

13
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.570
The nature of our people,

14
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.670
Our city's institutions,

15
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.930
and the terms for common justice,

16
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.700
you're as pregnant in as art and practise

17
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.300
hath enriched any that we remember.

18
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.300
There is our commission,

19
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.470
From which we would not have you warp.

20
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.570
Bid come before us Angelo.

21
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.500
What figure of us think you he will bear?

22
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500
For you must know, we have with special soul

23
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.870
Elected him our absence to supply,

24
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.130
Lent him our terror,

25
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.400
dress'd him with our love,

26
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.330
And given his deputation

27
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.000
all the organs of our own power:

28
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.370
what think you of it?

29
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.800
If any in Vienna be of worth

30
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.230
To undergo such ample grace and honour,

31
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.770
It is Lord Angelo.

32
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.000
Always obedient to your grace's will,

33
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.570
I come to know your pleasure.

34
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.130
Angelo,

35
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.070
There is a kind of character in thy life,

36
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.900
That to the observer doth thy history

37
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.200
Fully unfold.

38
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.730
Thyself and thy belongings

39
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.700
Are not thine own so proper as to waste

40
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.100
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.

41
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.470
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,

42
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.870
Not light them for themselves;

43
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.330
(laughing)

44
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.630
for if our virtues did not go forth of us,

45
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.200
'twere all alike as if we had them not.

46
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.230
Spirits are not finely touch'd

47
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.000
But to fine issues,

48
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.330
nor Nature never lends

49
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.900
The smallest scruple of her excellence

50
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.100
But, like a thrifty goddess,

51
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.470
she determines herself the glory of a creditor,

52
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.170
Both thanks and use.

53
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.670
But I do bend my speech

54
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.830
to one that can my part in him advertise;

55
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.470
Hold therefore, Angelo:--

56
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.300
In our remove be thou at full ourself;

57
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.430
Mortality and mercy in Vienna

58
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.730
Live in thy tongue and heart:

59
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.700
old Escalus, though first in question,

60
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.530
is thy secondary.

61
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.030
Take thy commission.

62
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.330
Now, good my lord,

63
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.130
Let there be some more test made of my metal,

64
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.800
Before so noble and so great a figure

65
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.330
Be stamp'd upon it.

66
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.830
No more evasion:

67
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.370
We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice

68
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.530
Proceeded to you;

69
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.900
therefore take your honours.

70
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.430
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition

71
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.730
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd

72
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.470
Matters of needful value.

73
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.930
We shall write to you,

74
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.200
As time and our concernings shall importune,

75
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.230
How it goes with us, and do seek to know

76
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.730
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;

77
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.530
To the hopeful execution do I leave you

78
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.470
Of your commissions.

79
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.470
Yet give leave, my lord,

80
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.570
That we may bring you something on the way.

81
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.400
My haste may not admit it;

82
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.800
Nor need you, on mine honour,

83
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.900
have to do with any scruple;

84
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.000
your scope is as mine own

85
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.830
So to enforce or qualify the laws

86
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.530
As to your soul seems good.

87
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.570
Give me your hand:

88
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.500
I'll privily away.

89
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.670
I love the people,

90
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.370
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:

91
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.870
Through it do well,

92
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.200
I do not relish well

93
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.730
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;

94
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.100
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion

95
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.530
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

96
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.430
The heavens give safety to your purposes!

97
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.500
Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

98
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.100
I shall desire you, sir,

99
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.830
to give me leave to have free speech with you;

100
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.170
and it concerns me

101
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.770
to look into the bottom of my place:

102
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.670
A power I have, but of what strength and nature

103
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.930
I am not yet instructed.

104
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.130
'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,

105
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.130
And we may soon our satisfaction have

106
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.900
Touching that point.

107
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.830
I'll wait upon your honour.

108
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.070
If the duke with the other dukes come not

109
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.500
to composition with the King of Hungary,

110
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.870
why then all the dukes fall upon the king.

111
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.530
Heaven grant us its peace,

112
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.800
but not the King of Hungary's!

113
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.370
Amen.

114
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.400
Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate

115
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.170
that went to sea with the Ten Commandments,

116
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.070
but scraped one out of the table.

117
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.170
'Thou shalt not steal'?

118
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.630
Ay, that he razed.

119
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.270
Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain

120
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.030
and all the rest from their functions:

121
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.630
they put forth to steal.

122
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.600
There's not a soldier of us all, that,

123
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.470
in the thanksgiving before meat,

124
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.830
do relish the petition well that prays for peace.

125
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.430
I never heard any soldier dislike it.

126
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.530
I believe thee;

127
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.000
for I think thou never wast where grace was said.

128
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.270
No? a dozen times at least.

129
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.470
What, in metre?

130
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.000
In any proportion or in any language.

131
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.370
I think, or in any religion.

132
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.930
Ay, why not? Grace is grace,

133
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.030
despite of all controversy:

134
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.570
as, for example, thou thyself art a wicked villain,

135
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.730
despite of all grace.

136
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.400
Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

137
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.600
I grant; as there may between the lists

138
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.670
and the velvet. Thou art the list.

139
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.770
And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet;

140
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.500
thou'rt a three-piled piece, I warrant thee:

141
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.400
I had as lief be a list of an English kersey

142
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.970
as be piled, as thou art piled,

143
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.270
for a French velvet.

144
00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:05.600
Do I speak feelingly now?

145
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.200
I think thou dost; and, indeed,

146
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.070
with most painful feeling of thy speech:

147
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.870
I will, out of thine own confession,

148
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.270
learn to begin thy health;

149
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.070
but, whilst I live, forget to drink after thee.

150
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.270
I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

151
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.070
Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.

152
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.030
Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes!

153
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.330
I have purchased as many diseases

154
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.500
under her roof as come to--

155
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.600
How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

156
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.900
Well, well; there's one yonder arrested

157
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.800
and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

158
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.870
Who's that, I pray thee?

159
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.400
Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

160
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.600
Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

161
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.700
Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested,

162
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.800
saw him carried away; and, which is more,

163
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.200
within these three days his head to be chopped off.

164
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.270
But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.

165
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.670
Art thou sure of this?

166
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:06.730
I am too sure of it:

167
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.670
and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child.

168
00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.700
Believe me, this may be:

169
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.670
he promised to meet me two hours since,

170
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.370
and he was ever precise in promise-keeping.

171
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.800
Besides, you know, it draws something near

172
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.230
to the speech we had to such a purpose.

173
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.570
But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

174
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.670
Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

175
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.830
Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat,

176
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.130
what with the gallows and what with poverty,

177
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.930
I am custom-shrunk.

178
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.270
How now!

179
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.870
How now! what's the news with you?

180
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.700
Yonder man is carried to prison.

181
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.600
Well; what has he done?

182
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.930
A woman.

183
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.970
(laughing)

184
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.830
But what's his offence?

185
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:02.630
Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

186
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.470
What, is there a maid with child by him?

187
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:11.330
No, but there's a woman with maid by him.

188
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.930
You have not heard of the proclamation, have you?

189
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.700
What proclamation, man?

190
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.570
All houses in the suburbs of Vienna

191
00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:24.730
must be plucked down.

192
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.430
And what shall become of those in the city?

193
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.530
They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,

194
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.430
but that a wise burgher put in for them.

195
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:35.230
But shall all our houses of resort

196
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.170
in the suburbs be pulled down?

197
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.230
To the ground, mistress.

198
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.600
Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!

199
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.670
What shall become of me?

200
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.470
Come; fear not you:

201
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.730
good counsellors lack no clients:

202
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.200
though you change your place,

203
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.330
you need not change your trade;

204
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.900
I'll be your tapster still.

205
00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.500
Courage! there will be pity taken on you:

206
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.370
you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service,

207
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.130
you will be considered.

208
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.270
(laughing)

209
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.130
Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?

210
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.870
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

211
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.470
I do it not in evil disposition,

212
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.600
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

213
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.470
Thus can the demigod Authority

214
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.430
Make us pay down for our offence by weight

215
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.530
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;

216
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.630
On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

217
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.170
Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

218
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.530
From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:

219
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.830
As surfeit is the father of much fast,

220
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.270
So every scope by the immoderate use

221
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.370
Turns to restraint.

222
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.430
Our natures do pursue,

223
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.430
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,

224
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.470
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

225
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.630
If could speak so wisely under an arrest,

226
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.100
I would send for certain of my creditors:

227
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.200
and yet, to say the truth,

228
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.530
I had as lief have the foppery of freedom

229
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.170
as the morality of imprisonment.

230
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.430
What's thy offence, Claudio?

231
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.300
What but to speak of would offend again.

232
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.470
What, is't murder?

233
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.400
No.

234
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.130
Lechery?

235
00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:10.770
Call it so.

236
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:11.800
Away, sir! you must go.

237
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.870
One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

238
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.970
A hundred, if they'll do you any good.

239
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.670
Is lechery so look'd after?

240
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.570
Thus stands it with me:

241
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.670
upon a true contract

242
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.430
I got possession of Julietta's bed:

243
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:27.770
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,

244
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.270
Save that we do the denunciation lack

245
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.670
Of outward order:

246
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:32.200
this we came not to,

247
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.000
Only for propagation of a dower

248
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.800
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,

249
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.770
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love

250
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.800
Till time had made them for us.

251
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.830
But it chances the stealth

252
00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.570
of our most mutual entertainment

253
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.900
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

254
00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.330
With child, perhaps?

255
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.570
Unhappily, even so.

256
00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:55.230
And the new deputy now for the duke--

257
00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.300
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,

258
00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.270
Or whether that the body public

259
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.670
be a horse whereon the governor doth ride,

260
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:01.970
Who, newly in the seat,

261
00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.170
that it may know he can command,

262
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:04.570
lets it straight feel the spur;

263
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.230
Whether the tyranny be in his place,

264
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.370
Or in his emmence that fills it up,

265
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.200
I stagger in:-

266
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.500
but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties

267
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.630
Which have, like unscour'd armour,

268
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.330
hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs

269
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.100
have gone round

270
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.270
And none of them been worn;

271
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.600
and, for a name,

272
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.330
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act

273
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.970
Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

274
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.070
I warrant it is:

275
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.400
and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders

276
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.230
that a milkmaid, if she be in love,

277
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.300
may sigh it off.

278
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.570
(crying)

279
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.200
Send after the duke and appeal to him.

280
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.730
I have done so, but he's not to be found.

281
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:57.170
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:

282
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.270
This day my sister should the cloister enter

283
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.070
And there receive her approbation:

284
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.470
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:

285
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.670
Implore her, in my voice,

286
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.370
that she make friends to the strict deputy;

287
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.070
bid herself assay him:

288
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.400
I have great hope in that; for in her youth

289
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.570
There is a prone and speechless dialect,

290
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.800
Such as move men;

291
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.430
beside, she hath prosperous art

292
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.930
When she will play with reason and discourse,

293
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.700
And well she can persuade.

294
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.630
I pray she may;

295
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.430
as well for the encouragement of the like,

296
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:25.100
which else would stand under grievous imposition,

297
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.100
as for the enjoying of thy life,

298
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.830
who I would be sorry should be thus

299
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.570
foolishly lost at a game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

300
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:38.630
I thank you, good friend Lucio.

301
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.100
No, holy father; throw away that thought;

302
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.330
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love

303
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.400
Can pierce a complete bosom.

304
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.530
Why I desire thee

305
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:53.600
To give me secret harbour,

306
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.530
hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled

307
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.100
than the aims and ends of burning youth.

308
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.100
May your grace speak of it?

309
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.370
My holy sir, none better knows than you

310
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.800
How I have ever loved the life removed

311
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.770
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies

312
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.930
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.

313
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.530
I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,

314
00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.130
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,

315
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.000
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,

316
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.100
And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;

317
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.670
For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,

318
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.730
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,

319
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.730
You will demand of me why I do this?

320
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.600
Gladly, my lord.

321
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:35.130
We have strict statutes and most biting laws.

322
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.170
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,

323
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.800
Which for this fourteen years we have let slip;

324
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800
Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,

325
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.800
That goes not out to prey.

326
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.000
Now, as fond fathers,

327
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.500
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,

328
00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.230
Only to stick it in their children's sight

329
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.170
For terror, not to use,

330
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:58.000
in time the rod becomes more mock'd

331
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.070
than fear'd; so our decrees,

332
00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:03.370
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;

333
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.200
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;

334
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.570
The baby beats the nurse,

335
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.800
and quite athwart goes all decorum.

336
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.730
It rested in your grace

337
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.730
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:

338
00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.170
And it in you more dreadful

339
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.000
would have seem'd than in Lord Angelo.

340
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.430
I do fear, too dreadful:

341
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.630
Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,

342
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.370
'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them

343
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.600
For what I bid them do:

344
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.400
for we bid this be done,

345
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.270
When evil deeds have their permissive pass

346
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.300
And not the punishment.

347
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.100
Therefore indeed, my father,

348
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:42.470
I have on Angelo imposed the office;

349
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.630
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,

350
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.600
But my nature never in the fight

351
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.830
To do in slander.

352
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:54.300
And to behold his sway,

353
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.100
I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,

354
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.730
Visit both prince and people:

355
00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:00.670
therefore, I prithee,

356
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.630
Supply me with the habit and instruct me

357
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.130
How I may formally in person

358
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.600
bear me like a true friar.

359
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.100
More reasons for this action

360
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.500
At our more leisure shall I render you;

361
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.430
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;

362
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.030
Stands at a guard with envy;

363
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.130
scarce confesses that his blood flows,

364
00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.200
or that his appetite is more to bread than stone:

365
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.170
hence shall we see,

366
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.300
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

367
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:32.300
And have you nuns no farther privileges?

368
00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.330
Are not these large enough?

369
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.600
Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;

370
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.470
But rather wishing a more strict restraint

371
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.230
Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

372
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.630
Ho! Peace be in this place!

373
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.000
Who's that which calls?

374
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.900
It is a man's voice.

375
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.100
Gentle Isabella, turn you the key,

376
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.300
and know his business of him;

377
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.770
You may, I may not; you are yet not sworn.

378
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.730
When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men

379
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.030
But in the presence of the prioress:

380
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.630
Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,

381
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:09.430
Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.

382
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.000
Hello! (off camera)

383
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.570
He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

384
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.870
Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls

385
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:29.830
Hail, virgin, if you be,

386
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.800
as those cheek-roses proclaim you are no less!

387
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.670
Can you so stead me

388
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.200
as bring me to the sight of Isabella,

389
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.070
A novice of this place and the fair sister

390
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.200
To her unhappy brother Claudio?

391
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.630
Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,

392
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.630
The rather for I now must make you know

393
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.100
I am that Isabella and his sister.

394
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.330
Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:

395
00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.030
Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

396
00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:01.000
Woe me! for what?

397
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.470
For that which, if myself might be his judge,

398
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.200
He should receive his punishment in thanks:

399
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.730
He hath got his friend with child.

400
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.800
Sir, make me not your story.

401
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.730
It is true.

402
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.470
I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin

403
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.600
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,

404
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.630
Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:

405
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.570
I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.

406
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:26.530
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,

407
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:27.600
And to be talk'd with in sincerity,

408
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.530
As with a saint.

409
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.430
You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

410
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.630
Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:

411
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:44.330
Your brother and his lover have embraced:

412
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.230
As those that feed grow full,

413
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.130
as blossoming time that from the seedness

414
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.770
the bare fallow brings to teeming foison,

415
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.430
even so her plenteous womb

416
00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:56.130
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

417
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.530
Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

418
00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.870
Is she your cousin?

419
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.000
Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names

420
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.930
By vain though apt affection.

421
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:05.870
She it is.

422
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.870
O, let him marry her.

423
00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:09.330
This is the point.

424
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.400
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;

425
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.700
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,

426
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.370
In hand and hope of action:

427
00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:17.430
but we do learn

428
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.430
By those that know the very nerves of state,

429
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.800
His givings-out were of an infinite distance

430
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.900
From his true-meant design.

431
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.900
Upon his place,

432
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.600
And with full line of his authority,

433
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.830
Governs Lord Angelo;

434
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.800
a man whose blood is very snow-broth;

435
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800
one who never feels

436
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.570
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,

437
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.070
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge

438
00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.630
With profits of the mind, study and fast.

439
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:45.870
He--to give fear to use and liberty,

440
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.000
Which have for long run by the hideous law,

441
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.330
As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,

442
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.530
Under whose heavy sense your brother's life

443
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.170
Falls into forfeit:

444
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.000
he arrests him on it;

445
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.870
And follows close the rigour of the statute,

446
00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.870
To make him an example.

447
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.630
All hope is gone,

448
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.530
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer

449
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:08.970
To soften Angelo:

450
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.900
and that's my pith of business

451
00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.300
'Twixt you and your poor brother.

452
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.770
Doth he so seek his life?

453
00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.630
Has censured him already;

454
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:24.200
and, as I hear, the provost hath a warrant for his execution.

455
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.030
Alas! what poor ability's in me

456
00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.130
To do him good?

457
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.900
Assay the power you have.

458
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.470
My power? Alas, I doubt--

459
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.300
Our doubts are traitors

460
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.670
And make us lose the good we oft might win

461
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.730
By fearing to attempt.

462
00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:41.970
Go to Lord Angelo,

463
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.730
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,

464
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.470
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,

465
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:50.700
All their petitions are as freely theirs

466
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.070
As they themselves would owe them.

467
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.730
I'll see what I can do.

468
00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.100
But speedily.

469
00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.500
I will about it straight;

470
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.170
No longer staying but to give the mother

471
00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.330
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:

472
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:09.930
Commend me to my brother:

473
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.800
soon at night I'll send him certain word of my success.

474
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.500
I humbly take my leave.

475
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.330
Good sir, adieu.

476
00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.700
We must not make a scarecrow of the law,

477
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.100
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,

478
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.570
And let it keep one shape,

479
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.170
till custom make it their perch

480
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.570
and not their terror.

481
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.670
Ay, but yet let us be keen,

482
00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.900
and rather cut a little,

483
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.630
Than fall, and bruise to death.

484
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:36.600
Alas, this gentleman

485
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.130
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!

486
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.400
Let but your honour know,

487
00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.130
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,

488
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.430
That, in the working of your own affections,

489
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:51.570
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,

490
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:52.970
Or that the resolute acting of your blood

491
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.100
Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,

492
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.570
Whether you had not sometime in your life

493
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:03.630
Err'd in this point which now you censure him,

494
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.100
And pull'd the law upon you.

495
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.000
'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,

496
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.270
Another thing to fall.

497
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:15.800
I not deny,

498
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.830
The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,

499
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:20.230
May in the sworn twelve

500
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:22.670
have a thief or two guiltier than him they try.

501
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.600
What's open made to justice, that justice seizes:

502
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.470
what know the laws

503
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.300
That thieves do pass on thieves?

504
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.700
'Tis very pregnant,

505
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.900
The jewel that we find,

506
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.770
we stoop and take't because we see it;

507
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.170
but what we do not see we tread upon,

508
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.400
and never think of it.

509
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.870
You may not so extenuate his offence

510
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.430
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,

511
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.730
When I, that censure him, do so offend,

512
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:48.130
Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,

513
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:56.630
And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

514
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:58.770
Be it as your wisdom will.

515
00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.670
Where is the provost?

516
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.900
Here, if it like your honour.

517
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:02.800
See that Claudio

518
00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.800
Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:

519
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.070
Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;

520
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:12.300
For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

521
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.770
Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!

522
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:20.530
Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:

523
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.200
Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:

524
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.670
And some condemned for a fault alone.

525
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.070
How now, sir! What's your name?

526
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.570
and what's the matter?

527
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:45.230
If it Please your honour,

528
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:49.470
I am the poor duke's constable,

529
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.700
and my name is Elbow:

530
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.970
I do lean upon justice, sir,

531
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.930
and do bring in here before your good honour

532
00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.730
two notorious benefactors.

533
00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.170
Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they?

534
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:02.670
are they not malefactors?

535
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.130
If it? please your honour,

536
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.830
I know not well what they are:

537
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.230
but precise villains they are,

538
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.170
that I am sure of; and void of all profanation

539
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.630
in the world that good Christians ought to have.

540
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.900
Here's a wise officer; This comes off well.

541
00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:21.530
Go to: what quality are they of?

542
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.630
Elbow is your name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

543
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.170
He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

544
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.870
(laughing)

545
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.870
What are you, sir?

546
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:37.870
He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd;

547
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.930
one that serves a bad woman; whose house, sir,

548
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.800
was, as they say, plucked down in the suburbs;

549
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.500
but now she professes a hot-house, which, I believe,

550
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.570
is a very ill house too.

551
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.930
How know you that?

552
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.470
My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven

553
00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.000
and your honour,--

554
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.200
How? thy wife?

555
00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.370
Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

556
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.530
Dost thou detest her therefore?

557
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:11.000
I say, sir, I will detest myself also,

558
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.770
as well as she, that this house,

559
00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.170
if it be not a bawd's house, it is pity of her life,

560
00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:17.100
for it is a naughty house.

561
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.930
How dost thou know that, constable?

562
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.600
Marry, sir, by my wife;

563
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.270
who, if she had been a woman cardinally given,

564
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.230
might have been accused in fornication, adultery,

565
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:31.070
and all kinds of uncleanliness there.

566
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.500
By the woman's means?

567
00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.770
Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means:

568
00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:37.000
but as she spit in his face,

569
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.700
so she defied him.

570
00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.670
Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

571
00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.730
Prove it before these varlets here,

572
00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.170
thou honourable man; prove it.

573
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.800
Do you hear how he misplaces?

574
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.800
Sir, she came in great with child;

575
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.700
and longing, saving your honour's reverence,

576
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.470
for stewed prunes;

577
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.870
sir, we had but two in the house,

578
00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.070
which at that very distant time stood, as it were,

579
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.970
in a fruit-dish, a dish of some three-pence;

580
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.700
your honours have seen such dishes;

581
00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.870
they are not China dishes, but very good dishes,

582
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.000
Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

583
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.800
No, indeed, sir,

584
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.370
and having but two in the dish, as I said,

585
00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:18.170
Master Froth here, this very man,

586
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.930
having eaten the rest, as I said,

587
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.570
and, as I say, paying for them very honestly;

588
00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.470
for, as you know, Master Froth,

589
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.130
I could not give you three-pence again.

590
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:28.500
No, indeed.

591
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.200
Very well: you being then,

592
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200
if you be remembered,

593
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.230
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,

594
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:37.930
Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose.

595
00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.870
What was done to Elbow's wife,

596
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.530
that he hath cause to complain of?

597
00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.170
Come me to what was done to her.

598
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.130
Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

599
00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.330
No, sir, nor I mean it not.

600
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.200
Sir, but you shall come to it,

601
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.300
by your honour's leave.

602
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.230
And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth here, sir;

603
00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:01.330
a man of four-score pound a year;

604
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.900
whose father died at Hallowmas:

605
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.270
was't not at Hallowmas, Master Froth?

606
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.170
All-hallond eve.

607
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.900
This will last out a night in Russia,

608
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:15.330
When nights are longest there:

609
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.300
I'll take my leave.

610
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.700
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;

611
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.900
Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

612
00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:23.100
I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.

613
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.970
Now, sir, come on:

614
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.930
what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

615
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.030
Once? there was nothing done to her once.

616
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:35.370
I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

617
00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:37.030
I beseech your honour, ask me.

618
00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.370
Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

619
00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:43.200
I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.

620
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.830
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour;

621
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.870
'tis for a good purpose.

622
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.500
Doth your honour mark his face?

623
00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.300
Ay, sir, very well.

624
00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.730
Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

625
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:54.670
Well, I do so.

626
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.270
Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

627
00:27:57.270 --> 00:27:58.300
Why, no.

628
00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.870
I'll be supposed upon a book,

629
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.570
his face is the worst thing about him.

630
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:05.300
Very good; if his face be the worst thing about him,

631
00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.900
how could Master Froth do the constable's wife any harm?

632
00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.900
I would know that of your honour.

633
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.400
He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

634
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.230
First, an it like you,

635
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:23.070
the house is a respected house;

636
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.470
next, this is a respected fellow;

637
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:28.970
and his mistress is a respected woman.

638
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.100
By this hand, sir,

639
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.230
his wife is a more respected person

640
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.030
than any of us all.

641
00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.930
Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet!

642
00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.370
the time has yet to come that she was ever respected.

643
00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:45.700
Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, prove this

644
00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.500
or I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

645
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.330
If he took you a box o' the ear,

646
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:52.800
you might have your action of slander too.

647
00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.270
Marry, I thank your good worship for it.

648
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.470
What is't your worship's pleasure

649
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:01.900
I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

650
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.370
Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him

651
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:09.370
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst,

652
00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:13.170
let him continue in his courses, till thou knowest what they are.

653
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:17.030
Marry, I thank your worship for it.

654
00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.630
Thou seest now, thou varlet,

655
00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.630
what's come upon thee:

656
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.700
thou art to continue now, thou varlet;

657
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.500
thou art to continue.

658
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.800
Where were you born, friend?

659
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.170
Here in Vienna, sir.

660
00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:30.400
Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

661
00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.600
Yes, an't please you, sir.

662
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.930
So. What trade are you of, sir?

663
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.830
Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

664
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:40.670
Your mistress' name?

665
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.530
Mistress Overdone.

666
00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:43.970
Hath she had any more than one husband?

667
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.900
Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

668
00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.600
Nine!

669
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.770
Come hither to me, Master Froth.

670
00:29:51.770 --> 00:29:54.470
Master Froth, I would not have you acquainted

671
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:57.200
with tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth,

672
00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.870
and you will hang them.

673
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.300
Get you gone, and let me hear no more of you.

674
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.870
I thank your worship.

675
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.130
For mine own part,

676
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.370
I never come into any room in a tap-house,

677
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.670
but I am drawn in.

678
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:11.330
Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.

679
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:16.670
Come you hither to me, Master tapster.

680
00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.730
What's your name, Master tapster?

681
00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:18.500
Pompey.

682
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.330
What else?

683
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.470
Bum, sir.

684
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:24.470
Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;

685
00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:28.730
so that in the beastliest sense you are

686
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.970
Pompey the Great. Pompey,

687
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.030
you are partly a bawd, Pompey,

688
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.870
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster,

689
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:38.300
are you not? come, tell me true:

690
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.100
it shall be the better for you.

691
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.070
Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow who would live.

692
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:45.470
How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd?

693
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.770
What do you think of the trade, Pompey?

694
00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.100
is it a lawful trade?

695
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.770
If the law would allow it, sir.

696
00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:53.970
But the law will not allow it, Pompey;

697
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.530
nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna.

698
00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:59.500
Does your worship mean to geld and splay

699
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.930
all the youth of the city?

700
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.100
No, Pompey.

701
00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.930
Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.

702
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.670
If your worship will take order

703
00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:08.930
for the drabs and the knaves,

704
00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.270
you need not to fear the bawds.

705
00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.330
There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:

706
00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.070
it is but heading and hanging.

707
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.670
If you head and hang all that offend that way

708
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.300
but for ten year together,

709
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.770
you'll be glad to give out a commission for more heads:

710
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.730
if this law hold in Vienna ten year,

711
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.700
I'll rent the fairest house in it after three-pence a bay:

712
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.200
if you live to see this come to pass,

713
00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.670
say Pompey told you so.

714
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.470
Thank you, good Pompey;

715
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:44.000
and, in requital of your prophecy, hark you:

716
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.400
I advise you, let me not find you before me again

717
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.700
upon any complaint whatsoever;

718
00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.400
no, not for dwelling where you do:

719
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.630
if I do, Pompey,

720
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.370
I shall beat you to your tent,

721
00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.530
and prove a shrewd Caesar to you;

722
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.930
in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall have you whipt:

723
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.270
so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

724
00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:09.830
I thank your worship for your good counsel:

725
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.400
but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune

726
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.400
shall better determine.

727
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.000
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:

728
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.130
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.

729
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.400
Come hither to me, Master Elbow;

730
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.600
come hither, Master constable.

731
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.500
How long have you been in this place of constable?

732
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.170
Seven year and a half, sir.

733
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:38.770
I thought, by your readiness in the office,

734
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.570
you had continued in it some time.

735
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:42.730
You say, seven years together?

736
00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.000
And a half, sir.

737
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.470
Alas, it hath been great pains to you.

738
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.230
They do you wrong to put you so oft upon 't:

739
00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.700
are there not men in your ward sufficient to serve it?

740
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.070
Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters:

741
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.300
as they are chosen,

742
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.530
they are glad to choose me for them;

743
00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.630
I do it for some piece of money,

744
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.070
and go through with all.

745
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:07.370
Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,

746
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.930
the most sufficient of your parish.

747
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.900
To your worship's house, sir?

748
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.330
To my house. Fare you well.

749
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.830
I pray you home to dinner with me.

750
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.900
I humbly thank you.

751
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:33.030
It grieves me for the death of Claudio;

752
00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.200
But there's no remedy.

753
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.330
Lord Angelo is severe.

754
00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:40.100
It is but needful:

755
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.700
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;

756
00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.070
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:

757
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:50.830
But yet,--poor Claudio!

758
00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.330
Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

759
00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:03.600
Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?

760
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.930
Why dost thou ask again?

761
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:09.900
Lest I might be too rash:

762
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.230
Under your good correction, I have seen,

763
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:13.670
When, after execution,

764
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:15.830
judgment hath repented o'er his doom.

765
00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.970
Go to; let that be mine:

766
00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:20.870
Do you your office, or give up your place,

767
00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:22.500
And you shall well be spared.

768
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.330
I crave your honour's pardon.

769
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.630
What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?

770
00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:29.100
She's very near her hour.

771
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.130
Dispose of her

772
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.100
To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

773
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.070
Here is the sister of the man condemn'd

774
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.930
Desires access to you.

775
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:38.030
Hath he a sister?

776
00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.870
Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,

777
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.530
And to be shortly of a sisterhood,

778
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.170
If not already.

779
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:47.930
Well, let her be admitted.

780
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.330
See you the fornicatress be removed:

781
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.500
Let have needful, but not lavish, means;

782
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.000
There shall be order for't.

783
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.200
You're welcome:

784
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:05.630
what's your will?

785
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.370
I am a woeful suitor to your honour,

786
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.130
Please but your honour hear me.

787
00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:11.570
Well; what's your suit?

788
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.200
There is a vice that most I do abhor,

789
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.570
And most desire should meet the blow of justice;

790
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.500
For which I would not plead, but that I must;

791
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.770
For which I must not plead,

792
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.100
but that I am at war 'twixt will and will not.

793
00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.630
Well; the matter?

794
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:29.600
I have a brother is condemn'd to die:

795
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:31.300
I do beseech you, let it be his fault,

796
00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.770
And not my brother.

797
00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.500
Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?

798
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:43.000
Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:

799
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.730
Mine were the very cipher of a function,

800
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:47.200
To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,

801
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.100
And let go by the actor.

802
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.470
O just but severe law!

803
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:58.370
I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

804
00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:02.470
Give't not o'er so: to him again, entreat him;

805
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.530
Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:

806
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:08.670
You are too cold; if you should need a pin,

807
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.930
You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:

808
00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.130
To him, I say!

809
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:13.670
Must he needs die?

810
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.430
Maiden, no remedy.

811
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.400
Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,

812
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.370
And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

813
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:21.100
I will not do't.

814
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.800
But can you, if you would?

815
00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.170
Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

816
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.600
But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,

817
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.600
If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse

818
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.470
A s mine is to him?

819
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.200
He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

820
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.430
You are too cold.

821
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:37.200
Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.

822
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.730
May call it back again.

823
00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:42.570
Well, believe this,

824
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.530
No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,

825
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:47.500
Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,

826
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.100
The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,

827
00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.030
Become them with one half so good a grace

828
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:56.400
As mercy does.

829
00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.770
If he had been as you and you as he,

830
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:04.570
You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,

831
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.170
Would not have been so stern.

832
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.270
Pray you, be gone.

833
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:09.030
I would to heaven I had your potency,

834
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.270
And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?

835
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.570
No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,

836
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:14.930
And what a prisoner.

837
00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:16.970
Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

838
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:20.270
Your brother is a forfeit of the law,

839
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.030
And you but waste your words.

840
00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:23.100
Alas, alas!

841
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:27.200
Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;

842
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.270
And He that might the vantage best have took

843
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.270
Found out the remedy.

844
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:33.270
How would you be,

845
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.070
If He, which is the top of judgment,

846
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:39.800
should but judge you as you are?

847
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.830
O, think on that;

848
00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:42.930
And mercy then will breathe within your lips,

849
00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.570
Like man new made.

850
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.200
Be you content, fair maid;

851
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.370
It is the law, not I condemn your brother:

852
00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.030
Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,

853
00:37:56.030 --> 00:38:00.200
It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

854
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.400
To-morrow! O, that's sudden!

855
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.570
Spare him, spare him!

856
00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.530
He's not prepared for death.

857
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:12.270
Even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season:

858
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.870
shall we serve heaven with less respect

859
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:20.330
than we do minister to our gross selves?

860
00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.570
Good, good my lord, bethink you;

861
00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.100
Who is it that hath died for this offence?

862
00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:29.800
There's many have committed it.

863
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.800
Ay, well said.

864
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:38.130
The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:

865
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.370
Those many had not dared to do that evil,

866
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:42.800
If the first that did the edict infringe

867
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.330
Had answer'd for his deed:

868
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:48.800
now 'tis awake takes note of what is done;

869
00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.400
and, like a prophet,

870
00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.770
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,

871
00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:54.600
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,

872
00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.770
And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,

873
00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:00.600
Are now to have no successive degrees,

874
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.400
But, ere they live, to end.

875
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.430
Yet show some pity.

876
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.600
I show it most of all when I show justice;

877
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.000
For then I pity those I do not know,

878
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.870
Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;

879
00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.970
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,

880
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:27.630
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;

881
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:34.000
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

882
00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:40.530
So you must be the first that gives this sentence,

883
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.670
And he, that suffer's.

884
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:44.970
O, it is excellent

885
00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.000
To have a giant's strength;

886
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.730
but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant.

887
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.630
That's well said.

888
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.030
Could great men thunder

889
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.930
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,

890
00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:57.270
For every pelting, petty officer

891
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.000
Would use his heaven for thunder;

892
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.770
Nothing but thunder!

893
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.630
Merciful Heaven,

894
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:07.500
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt

895
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.230
Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak

896
00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:13.630
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,

897
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.300
Drest in a little brief authority,

898
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.830
Most ignorant of what he's most assured,

899
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.400
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,

900
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.700
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven

901
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:27.770
As make the angels weep;

902
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.470
who, with our spleens,

903
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.500
Would all themselves laugh mortal.

904
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.100
O, to him, to him, wench! he will relent;

905
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.530
He's coming; I perceive 't.

906
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:40.570
We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:

907
00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:46.030
Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,

908
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.600
But in the less foul profanation.

909
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.000
Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.

910
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.100
That in the captain's but a choleric word,

911
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:57.830
Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

912
00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:02.070
Art avised o' that? more on 't.

913
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:05.300
Why do you put these sayings upon me?

914
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.470
Because authority, though it err like others,

915
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.530
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,

916
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.430
That skins the vice o' the top.

917
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:15.930
Go to your bosom;

918
00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.300
Knock there, and ask your heart

919
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.270
what it doth know

920
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.300
That's like my brother's fault:

921
00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:25.430
if it confess a natural guiltiness such as is his,

922
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:28.400
Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue

923
00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.430
Against my brother's life.

924
00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.530
She speaks, and 'tis such sense,

925
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.400
that my sense breathes with it.

926
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:44.230
Fare ye well.

927
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:47.600
Gentle my lord, turn back.

928
00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:59.930
I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

929
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:05.070
Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

930
00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.030
How! bribe me?

931
00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.430
Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

932
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.200
Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,

933
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.700
Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor

934
00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.870
As fancy values them;

935
00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:20.170
but with true prayers

936
00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.030
That shall be up at heaven and enter there

937
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:26.870
Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,

938
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:29.430
From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate

939
00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.430
To nothing temporal.

940
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:39.230
Well; come to me to-morrow.

941
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:41.430
Go to; 'tis well; away!

942
00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.130
Heaven keep your honour safe!

943
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:47.000
Amen: For I am that way going to temptation,

944
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.630
Where prayers cross.

945
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.700
At what hour to-morrow

946
00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.400
Shall I attend your lordship?

947
00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.100
At any time 'fore noon.

948
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.930
'Save your honour!

949
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:09.930
From thee, even from thy virtue!

950
00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:12.430
What's this, what's this?

951
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.330
Is this her fault or mine?

952
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:19.000
The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?

953
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.230
Ha!

954
00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:31.030
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I

955
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:32.570
That, lying by the violet in the sun,

956
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.400
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,

957
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.930
Corrupt with virtuous season.

958
00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.600
Can it be that modesty may more betray our sense

959
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.570
Than woman's lightness?

960
00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.130
Having waste ground enough,

961
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:44.870
Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary

962
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:51.630
And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!

963
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:58.530
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?

964
00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.430
Dost thou desire her foully for those things

965
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:10.270
That make her good? O, let her brother live!

966
00:44:10.270 --> 00:44:11.530
Thieves for their robbery have authority

967
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:16.370
When judges steal themselves.

968
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:22.570
What, do I love her,

969
00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.570
That I desire to hear her speak again,

970
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:30.000
And feast upon her eyes?

971
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.500
What is't I dream on?

972
00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.570
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,

973
00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.470
With saints dost bait thy hook!

974
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.930
Most dangerous is that temptation that doth goad us on

975
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.100
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,

976
00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.030
With all her double vigour, art and nature,

977
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:53.370
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid

978
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:57.470
Subdues me quite.

979
00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:03.870
Even till now,

980
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:12.870
When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

981
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.230
Bound by my charity and my blest order,

982
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.070
I come to visit the afflicted spirits

983
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.070
Here in the prison. Do me the common right

984
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:40.570
To let me see them and to make me know

985
00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.030
The nature of their crimes,

986
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.100
that I may minister to them accordingly.

987
00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:47.230
I would do more than that, if more were needful.

988
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.470
Look, here's a gentlewoman of mine,

989
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:52.630
Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,

990
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:56.730
Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;

991
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.270
And he that got it, sentenced;

992
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:01.000
a young man more fit to do another such offence

993
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.470
Than die for this.

994
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:03.830
When must he die?

995
00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:06.330
As I do think, to-morrow.

996
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.570
I have provided for you: stay awhile,

997
00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.770
And you shall be conducted.

998
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.700
Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

999
00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.030
I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

1000
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.870
I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,

1001
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:29.930
And try your penitence, if it be sound,

1002
00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:31.530
Or hollowly put on.

1003
00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.300
I'll gladly learn.

1004
00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:34.930
Love you the man that wrong'd you?

1005
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.530
Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

1006
00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.130
So then it seems your most offenceful act

1007
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:42.770
Was mutually committed?

1008
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:44.100
Mutually.

1009
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.770
Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

1010
00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:49.800
I do confess it, and repent it, father.

1011
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.170
'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,

1012
00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:54.930
As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,

1013
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.870
Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,

1014
00:46:56.870 --> 00:47:00.570
Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,

1015
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:02.330
But as we stand in fear,

1016
00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.070
I do repent me, as it is an evil,

1017
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.530
And take the shame with joy.

1018
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:07.570
There rest.

1019
00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:12.170
Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,

1020
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.000
And I am going with instruction to him.

1021
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Grace go with you, Benedicite!

1022
00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:29.530
Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,

1023
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.170
That respites me a life,

1024
00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:37.700
whose very comfort is still a dying horror!

1025
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:48.070
When I would pray and think, I think and pray

1026
00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:55.030
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;

1027
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:56.930
Whilst my invention,

1028
00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:00.370
hearing not my tongue,

1029
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:07.030
Anchors on Isabel:

1030
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.030
Heaven in my mouth,

1031
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:10.270
As if I did but only chew his name;

1032
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:15.930
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil

1033
00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.200
Of my conception.

1034
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.970
The state, whereon I studied

1035
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.300
Is like a good thing, being often read,

1036
00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:35.230
Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,

1037
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.930
Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,

1038
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:40.300
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,

1039
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.770
Which the air beats for vain.

1040
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:50.730
O place, O form,

1041
00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.130
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,

1042
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.030
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls

1043
00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:00.270
To thy false seeming!

1044
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:06.270
Blood, thou art blood:

1045
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:08.370
Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:

1046
00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:10.270
'Tis not the devil's crest.

1047
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:13.400
How now! who's there?

1048
00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.370
One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

1049
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.500
Teach her the way.

1050
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.630
O heavens!

1051
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.930
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,

1052
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.370
Making both it unable for itself,

1053
00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.300
And dispossessing

1054
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.770
all my other parts of necessary fitness?

1055
00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:45.300
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;

1056
00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:46.730
Come all to help him, and so stop the air

1057
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:50.070
By which he should revive:

1058
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.470
How now, fair maid?

1059
00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.030
I am come to know your pleasure.

1060
00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.870
That you might know it,

1061
00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:04.330
would much better please me than to demand what 'tis.

1062
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:09.170
Your brother cannot live.

1063
00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:18.700
Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

1064
00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.470
Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,

1065
00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:25.300
As long as you or I yet he must die.

1066
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.930
Under your sentence?

1067
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:28.000
Yea.

1068
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.330
When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,

1069
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:31.570
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted

1070
00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.700
That his soul sicken not.

1071
00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:40.570
Ha! fie, these filthy vices!

1072
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:41.830
It were as good to pardon him

1073
00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:42.930
that hath from nature stolen

1074
00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:44.030
A man already made,

1075
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.200
as to remit their saucy sweetness

1076
00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.430
that do coin heaven's image

1077
00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.970
In stamps that are forbid:

1078
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:51.470
'tis all as easy

1079
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:53.530
Falsely to take away a life true made

1080
00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:54.970
As to put metal in restrained means

1081
00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:56.800
To make a false one.

1082
00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.370
'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

1083
00:50:59.370 --> 00:51:03.430
Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.

1084
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:07.270
Which had you rather, that the most just law

1085
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:11.370
Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,

1086
00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:15.070
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness

1087
00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:17.030
As she that he hath stain'd?

1088
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.970
Sir, believe this,

1089
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.870
I had rather give my body than my soul.

1090
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:25.500
I talk not of your soul:

1091
00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:26.400
our compell'd sins

1092
00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.570
Stand more for number than for accompt.

1093
00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:29.470
How say you?

1094
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:30.400
Nay, I'll not warrant that;

1095
00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.900
for I can speak against the thing I say.

1096
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:35.430
Answer to this:

1097
00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:37.800
I, now the voice of the recorded law,

1098
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.370
Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:

1099
00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:45.300
Might there not be a charity in sin

1100
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.800
To save this brother's life?

1101
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:47.770
Please you to do't,

1102
00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:49.500
I'll take it as a peril to my soul,

1103
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.930
It is no sin at all, but charity.

1104
00:51:51.930 --> 00:51:53.830
Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,

1105
00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:56.870
Were equal poise of sin and charity.

1106
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:58.800
That I do beg his life, if it be sin,

1107
00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.830
Heaven let me bear it!

1108
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.270
you granting of my suit,

1109
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.870
If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer

1110
00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:07.230
To have it added to the faults of mine,

1111
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:08.400
And nothing of your answer.

1112
00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.430
Nay, but hear me.

1113
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:11.930
Your sense pursues not mine:

1114
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.930
either you are ignorant,

1115
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:20.230
Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

1116
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:22.000
Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,

1117
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.270
But graciously to know I am no better.

1118
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.430
Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright

1119
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:27.970
When it doth tax itself;

1120
00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:28.970
as these black masks

1121
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.330
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder

1122
00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:33.600
Than beauty could, display'd.

1123
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.230
But mark me;

1124
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:40.930
To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:

1125
00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:44.670
Your brother is to die.

1126
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:46.870
So.

1127
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:48.530
And his offence is so, as it appears,

1128
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:52.900
Accountant to the law upon that pain.

1129
00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.970
True.

1130
00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:57.230
Admit no other way to save his life,--

1131
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:58.970
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,

1132
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:01.930
But in the loss of question,

1133
00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:04.870
--that you, his sister,

1134
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:06.770
Finding yourself desired of such a person,

1135
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.370
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,

1136
00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.300
Could fetch your brother from the manacles

1137
00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:12.930
Of the all-building law;

1138
00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:16.130
and that there were no earthly mean to save him,

1139
00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:17.930
but that either you must lay down

1140
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:19.300
the treasures of your body

1141
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:25.370
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;

1142
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:29.100
What would you do?

1143
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.770
As much for my poor brother as myself:

1144
00:53:32.770 --> 00:53:35.370
That is, were I under the terms of death,

1145
00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.330
The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,

1146
00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:41.400
And strip myself to death, as to a bed

1147
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:42.930
That longing have been sick for,

1148
00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:45.200
ere I'ld yield my body up to shame.

1149
00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.230
Then must your brother die.

1150
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:48.870
And 'twere the cheaper way:

1151
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:50.770
Better it were a brother died at once,

1152
00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:53.170
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,

1153
00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:54.830
Should die for ever.

1154
00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:56.430
Were not you then as cruel as the sentence

1155
00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:58.400
That you have slander'd so?

1156
00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.800
Ignomy in ransom and free pardon

1157
00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.200
Are of two houses:

1158
00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.530
lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption.

1159
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:07.300
You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;

1160
00:54:07.300 --> 00:54:09.130
And rather proved the sliding of your brother

1161
00:54:09.130 --> 00:54:11.870
A merriment than a vice.

1162
00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.630
O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,

1163
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:17.930
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:

1164
00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:20.130
I something do excuse the thing I hate,

1165
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:24.930
For his advantage that I dearly love.

1166
00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:29.900
We are all frail.

1167
00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:34.270
Nay, women are frail too.

1168
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:38.330
Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;

1169
00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:42.730
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.

1170
00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.130
Women! Help Heaven!

1171
00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:48.600
men their creation mar in profiting by them.

1172
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.200
Nay, call us ten times frail;

1173
00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.170
For we are soft as our complexions are,

1174
00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.330
And credulous to false prints.

1175
00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.030
I think it well:

1176
00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:00.370
And from this testimony of your own sex,--

1177
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:02.400
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger

1178
00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:07.930
Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;

1179
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:14.130
Be that you are, That is, a woman;

1180
00:55:14.130 --> 00:55:16.330
if you be more, you're none;

1181
00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:19.030
If you be one, as you are well express'd

1182
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:22.030
By all external warrants, show it now,

1183
00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:28.230
By putting on the destined livery.

1184
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:32.230
I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,

1185
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:35.470
Let me entreat you speak the former language.

1186
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:43.070
Plainly conceive, I love you.

1187
00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:45.500
My brother did love Juliet,

1188
00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.300
And you tell me that he shall die for it.

1189
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:55.670
He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

1190
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:02.400
I know your virtue hath a licence in't,

1191
00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.200
Which seems a little fouler than it is,

1192
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.230
To pluck on others.

1193
00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:10.430
Believe me, on mine honour,

1194
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:13.670
My words express my purpose.

1195
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:23.730
Ha! little honour to be much believed,

1196
00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:35.100
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!

1197
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.630
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:

1198
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:40.870
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,

1199
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.130
Or with an outstretch'd throat

1200
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:47.530
I'll tell the world aloud what man thou art.

1201
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:51.830
Who will believe thee, Isabel?

1202
00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:56.700
My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,

1203
00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.070
My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,

1204
00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:00.470
Will so your accusation overweigh,

1205
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:02.500
That you shall stifle in your own report

1206
00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.500
And smell of calumny.

1207
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:07.800
I have begun,

1208
00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.930
And now I give my sensual race the rein:

1209
00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:15.630
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;

1210
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:17.930
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,

1211
00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:20.570
That banish what they sue for;

1212
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:21.800
redeem thy brother

1213
00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.070
By yielding up thy body to my will;

1214
00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:24.270
Or else he must not only die the death,

1215
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:27.500
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out

1216
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:31.600
To lingering sufferance.

1217
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.600
Answer me to-morrow,

1218
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.130
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,

1219
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:44.500
I'll prove a tyrant to him.

1220
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:51.730
As for you, say what you can,

1221
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:57.470
my false o'erweighs your true.

1222
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:11.230
To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,

1223
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:18.670
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,

1224
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.430
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,

1225
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:25.400
Either of condemnation or approof;

1226
00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:30.100
Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:

1227
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.870
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,

1228
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:38.830
To follow as it draws!

1229
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:45.000
I'll to my brother:

1230
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.630
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,

1231
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:50.900
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.

1232
00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.400
That, had he twenty heads to tender down

1233
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.670
On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,

1234
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:58.870
Before his sister should her body stoop

1235
00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:06.270
To such abhorr'd pollution.

1236
00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:14.270
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:

1237
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:23.330
More than our brother is our chastity.

1238
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.870
I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,

1239
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:33.730
And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

1240
00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:49.030
The miserable have no other medicine

1241
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:50.730
But only hope:

1242
00:59:50.730 --> 00:59:55.470
I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

1243
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:59.270
Be absolute for death; either death or life

1244
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:01.070
Shall thereby be the sweeter.

1245
01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:03.300
Reason thus with life:

1246
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.400
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing

1247
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.930
That none but fools would keep:

1248
01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:08.470
a breath thou art,

1249
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:10.200
Servile to all the skyey influences,

1250
01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.000
That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,

1251
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.300
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;

1252
01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:18.830
For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun

1253
01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:24.070
And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;

1254
01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:25.730
For all the accommodations that thou bear'st

1255
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:29.670
Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;

1256
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.000
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork

1257
01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.900
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,

1258
01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:38.700
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st

1259
01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:42.930
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;

1260
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:45.400
For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains

1261
01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.770
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;

1262
01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:53.300
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,

1263
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:58.600
And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;

1264
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.500
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,

1265
01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:05.030
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;

1266
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.830
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,

1267
01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:11.430
Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,

1268
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:16.000
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;

1269
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.600
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,

1270
01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.530
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,

1271
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:23.170
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,

1272
01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:27.030
For ending thee no sooner.

1273
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:31.130
Thou hast nor youth nor age,

1274
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:34.830
But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,

1275
01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:38.970
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth

1276
01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:42.500
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms

1277
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:47.830
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,

1278
01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:54.400
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,

1279
01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.630
To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this thing

1280
01:01:59.630 --> 01:02:03.300
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life

1281
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:07.870
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,

1282
01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:11.370
That makes these odds all even.

1283
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:19.470
I humbly thank you.

1284
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:25.370
To sue to live, I find I seek to die;

1285
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:32.230
And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

1286
01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:42.770
Provost, a word.

1287
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:43.930
As many as you please.

1288
01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:48.000
Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

1289
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.170
Now, sister, what's the comfort?

1290
01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:59.700
Why, as all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.

1291
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:02.730
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,

1292
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.270
Intends you for his swift ambassador,

1293
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:10.570
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:

1294
01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:13.230
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;

1295
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:16.030
To-morrow you set on.

1296
01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:17.100
Is there no remedy?

1297
01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:21.100
None, but such remedy as, to save a head,

1298
01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.270
To cleave a heart in twain.

1299
01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:24.030
But is there any?

1300
01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:26.600
Yes, brother, you may live:

1301
01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.730
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,

1302
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:31.670
If you'll implore it, that will free your life,

1303
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:34.170
But fetter you till death.

1304
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:35.170
Perpetual durance?

1305
01:03:35.170 --> 01:03:39.530
Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,

1306
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:42.300
Though all the world's vastidity you had,

1307
01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:43.700
To a determined scope.

1308
01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.070
But in what nature?

1309
01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:47.500
In such a one as, you consenting to't,

1310
01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.630
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,

1311
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.130
And leave you naked.

1312
01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:54.200
Let me know the point.

1313
01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.230
O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,

1314
01:03:59.230 --> 01:04:02.330
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,

1315
01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:04.800
And six or seven winters more respect

1316
01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:11.430
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?

1317
01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:15.300
The sense of death is most in apprehension;

1318
01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.400
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,

1319
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:20.270
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great

1320
01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:21.870
As when a giant dies.

1321
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:24.530
Why give you me this shame?

1322
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:25.830
Think you I can a resolution fetch

1323
01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:29.030
From flowery tenderness?

1324
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:30.200
If I must die,

1325
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.370
I will encounter darkness as a bride,

1326
01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.070
And hug it in mine arms.

1327
01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:38.200
There spake my brother; there my father's grave

1328
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:42.070
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:

1329
01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:45.000
Thou art too noble to conserve a life

1330
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.500
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,

1331
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.730
Whose settled visage and deliberate word

1332
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.500
Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew

1333
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:59.330
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil

1334
01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:02.200
His filth within being cast, he would appear

1335
01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:04.400
A pond as deep as hell.

1336
01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.730
The precise Angelo!

1337
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:07.570
O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,

1338
01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.400
The damned'st body to invest and cover

1339
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.970
In precise guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?

1340
01:05:15.970 --> 01:05:18.600
If I would yield him my virginity,

1341
01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.670
Thou mightst be freed.

1342
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:23.630
O heavens! it cannot be.

1343
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:26.670
Yes, he would give't thee, out this rank offence,

1344
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:31.170
So to offend him still. This night's the time

1345
01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:32.570
That I should do what I abhor to name,

1346
01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:36.500
Or else thou diest to-morrow.

1347
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.130
Thou shalt not do't.

1348
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:41.330
O, were it but my life,

1349
01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:43.770
I'ld throw it down for your deliverance

1350
01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:46.470
As frankly as a pin.

1351
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:55.200
Thanks, dear Isabel.

1352
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.130
Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

1353
01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:05.470
Yes.

1354
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:13.870
Has he affections in him,

1355
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:18.200
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,

1356
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:23.930
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,

1357
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:25.400
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

1358
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:28.430
Which is the least?

1359
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:31.170
If it were damnable, he being so wise,

1360
01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:35.000
Why would he for the momentary trick

1361
01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.630
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

1362
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:42.430
What says my brother?

1363
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:44.300
Death is a fearful thing.

1364
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.470
And shamed life a hateful.

1365
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:52.630
Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;

1366
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:56.130
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;

1367
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:59.830
This sensible warm motion to become

1368
01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:04.700
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit

1369
01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:08.600
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside

1370
01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:12.070
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;

1371
01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:13.600
To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,

1372
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.930
And blown with restless violence round about

1373
01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:19.330
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst

1374
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:21.100
Of those that lawless and incertain thought

1375
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:26.370
Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!

1376
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:30.930
The weariest and most loathed worldly life

1377
01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:33.600
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment

1378
01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.600
Can lay on nature is a paradise

1379
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.200
To what we fear of death.

1380
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.530
Alas, alas!

1381
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:44.930
Sweet sister, let me live:

1382
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:46.330
What sin you do to save a brother's life,

1383
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.800
Nature dispenses with the deed so far

1384
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:48.930
That it becomes a virtue.

1385
01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:50.230
O you beast!

1386
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:53.400
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!

1387
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:56.900
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?

1388
01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:58.770
Is't not a kind of incest, to take life

1389
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:04.330
From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?

1390
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.900
Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!

1391
01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.400
For such a warped slip of wilderness

1392
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.870
Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!

1393
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:15.770
Die, perish! Might but my bending down

1394
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:18.600
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:

1395
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.600
I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,

1396
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:22.030
No word to save thee.

1397
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:23.330
Nay, hear me, Isabel.

1398
01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:24.530
O, fie, fie, fie!

1399
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:27.200
Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.

1400
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.670
Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:

1401
01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:31.600
'Tis best thou diest quickly.

1402
01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:35.470
O hear me, Isabella!

1403
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:37.270
Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

1404
01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:38.570
What is your will?

1405
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:40.000
Might you dispense with your leisure,

1406
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.230
I would by and by have some speech with you:

1407
01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:43.630
the satisfaction I would require

1408
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:45.300
is likewise your own benefit.

1409
01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.730
I have no superfluous leisure;

1410
01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:49.130
my stay must be stolen out of other affairs;

1411
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:50.970
but I will attend you awhile.

1412
01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.970
Son, I have overheard what hath passed

1413
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:58.870
between you and your sister.

1414
01:08:58.870 --> 01:09:01.370
Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her;

1415
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:04.100
only he hath made an essay of her virtue

1416
01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:08.470
to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures:

1417
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:10.870
she, having the truth of honour in her,

1418
01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:12.530
hath made him that gracious denial

1419
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:15.430
which he is most glad to receive.

1420
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:16.800
I am confessor to Angelo,

1421
01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:19.300
and I know this to be true;

1422
01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:22.400
therefore prepare yourself to death:

1423
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.100
do not satisfy your resolution with hopes

1424
01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:25.000
that are fallible:

1425
01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.800
tomorrow you must die;

1426
01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.230
go to your knees and make ready.

1427
01:09:28.230 --> 01:09:30.730
Let me ask my sister pardon.

1428
01:09:30.730 --> 01:09:32.930
I am so out of love with life

1429
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:34.530
that I will sue to be rid of it.

1430
01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:36.930
Hold you there: farewell.

1431
01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:52.400
The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:

1432
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.830
the goodness that is cheap in beauty

1433
01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:56.500
makes beauty brief in goodness;

1434
01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.300
but grace, being the soul of your complexion,

1435
01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.070
shall keep the body of it ever fair.

1436
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:06.630
The assault that Angelo hath made to you,

1437
01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:10.100
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding;

1438
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.970
and, but that frailty hath examples for his falling,

1439
01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:17.500
I should wonder at Angelo.

1440
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.700
How will you do to content this substitute,

1441
01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.800
and to save your brother?

1442
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.000
I am now going to resolve him:

1443
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.930
I had rather my brother die by the law

1444
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:32.500
than my son should be unlawfully born.

1445
01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.330
But, O, how much is the good duke

1446
01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:37.400
deceived in Angelo!

1447
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.900
If ever he return and I can speak to him,

1448
01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.470
I will open my lips in vain,

1449
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.400
or discover his government.

1450
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:45.570
That shall not be much amiss:

1451
01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:47.700
Yet, as the matter now stands,

1452
01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.400
he will avoid your accusation;

1453
01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.800
he made trial of you only.

1454
01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.770
Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings:

1455
01:10:56.770 --> 01:11:01.370
to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself.

1456
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:03.770
I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously

1457
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:07.330
do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit;

1458
01:11:07.330 --> 01:11:09.430
redeem your brother from the angry law;

1459
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:12.000
do no stain to your own gracious person;

1460
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.600
and much please the absent duke,

1461
01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.100
if peradventure he shall ever return

1462
01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.700
to have hearing of this business.

1463
01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:19.600
Let me hear you speak farther.

1464
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:20.600
I have spirit to do anything

1465
01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.030
that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

1466
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:25.830
Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful.

1467
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:28.970
Have you not heard speak of Mariana,

1468
01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:30.900
the sister of Frederick the great soldier

1469
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.170
who miscarried at sea?

1470
01:11:32.170 --> 01:11:35.430
I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.

1471
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:38.870
She should this Angelo have married;

1472
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:43.670
was affianced to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed:

1473
01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:44.770
between which time of the contract

1474
01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:46.630
and limit of the solemnity,

1475
01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:49.400
her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,

1476
01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.370
having in that perished vessel

1477
01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:53.200
the dowry of his sister.

1478
01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.070
But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman:

1479
01:11:57.070 --> 01:12:00.130
there she lost a most renowned brother,

1480
01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:03.530
in his love toward her ever most kind and natural;

1481
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:06.700
with him, the portion and sinew of her fortune,

1482
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:09.800
her marriage-dowry; with both, her combinate husband,

1483
01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.830
this well-seeming Angelo.

1484
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:15.030
Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

1485
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.100
Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them

1486
01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.900
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,

1487
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:26.130
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour:

1488
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:28.400
in few, bestowed her on her own lamentation,

1489
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.870
which she yet wears for his sake; and he,

1490
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:32.500
a marble to her tears,

1491
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.100
is washed with them, but relents not.

1492
01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.700
What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid

1493
01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:42.830
from the world! What corruption in this life,

1494
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:48.170
that it will let this man live!

1495
01:12:48.170 --> 01:12:50.270
But how out of this can she avail?

1496
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.800
It is a rupture that you may easily heal:

1497
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.200
and the cure of it not only saves your brother,

1498
01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:57.830
but keeps you from dishonour in doing it.

1499
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:59.930
Show me how, good father.

1500
01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:04.100
This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance

1501
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.570
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness,

1502
01:13:06.570 --> 01:13:09.430
that in all reason should have quenched her love,

1503
01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:13.470
hath made it more violent and unruly.

1504
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:15.870
Go you to Angelo; answer his requiring

1505
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:17.270
with a plausible obedience;

1506
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:20.000
agree with his demands to the point;

1507
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.800
only refer yourself to this advantage,

1508
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.100
first, that your stay with him may not be long;

1509
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:29.700
that the time may have all shadow and silence in it;

1510
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:32.270
and the place answer to convenience.

1511
01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:33.200
This being granted in course,

1512
01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.000
and now follows all,

1513
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.230
we shall advise this wronged maid

1514
01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.970
to stead up your appointment,

1515
01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:41.330
go in your place;

1516
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:42.770
if the encounter

1517
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:43.930
acknowledge itself hereafter,

1518
01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:45.730
it may compel him to her recompense:

1519
01:13:45.730 --> 01:13:48.700
and here, by this, is your brother saved,

1520
01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:50.200
your honour untainted,

1521
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.230
the poor Mariana advantaged,

1522
01:13:52.230 --> 01:13:54.870
and the corrupt deputy scaled.

1523
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:55.870
The maid will I frame

1524
01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:58.370
and make fit for his attempt.

1525
01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:01.430
If you think well to carry this as you may,

1526
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:02.500
the doubleness of the benefit

1527
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.100
defends the deceit from reproof.

1528
01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.200
What think you of it?

1529
01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.370
The image of it gives me content already;

1530
01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:10.230
and I trust it will grow

1531
01:14:10.230 --> 01:14:12.030
to a most prosperous perfection.

1532
01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.330
It lies much in your holding up.

1533
01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:16.400
Haste you speedily to Angelo:

1534
01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.670
if for this night he entreat you

1535
01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.870
to his bed, give him promise of satisfaction.

1536
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:21.930
I will presently to Saint Luke's:

1537
01:14:21.930 --> 01:14:23.170
there, at the moated grange,

1538
01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:25.230
resides this dejected Mariana.

1539
01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:27.030
At that place call upon me;

1540
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:28.800
and dispatch with Angelo,

1541
01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.030
that it may be quickly.

1542
01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:35.370
I thank you for this comfort.

1543
01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:37.270
Fare you well, good father.

1544
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:49.930
Nay, you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts,

1545
01:14:49.930 --> 01:14:51.070
we shall have all the world

1546
01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:53.030
drink brown and white bastard.

1547
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.830
O heavens! what stuff is here

1548
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:57.270
'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries,

1549
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:59.000
the merriest was put down,

1550
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.270
and the worser allowed by order of law

1551
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:03.800
a furred gown to keep him warm;

1552
01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.300
and furred with fox and lamb-skins too,

1553
01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.530
to signify, that craft, being richer than innocency,

1554
01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:10.700
stands for the facing.

1555
01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.570
Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

1556
01:15:13.570 --> 01:15:14.900
And you, good brother father.

1557
01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.030
What offence hath this man made you, sir?

1558
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.170
Marry, sir, he hath offended the law:

1559
01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:21.270
and, sir, we take him to be a thief too, sir;

1560
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:23.300
for we have found upon him

1561
01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:25.330
a strange picklock,

1562
01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:27.900
which we have sent to the deputy.

1563
01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.500
Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!

1564
01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.200
The evil that thou causest to be done,

1565
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:33.730
That is thy means to live.

1566
01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:34.970
Do thou but think

1567
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:36.930
What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back

1568
01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:38.800
From such a filthy vice:

1569
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.730
say to thyself,

1570
01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:41.670
From their abominable and beastly touches

1571
01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:45.030
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.

1572
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:47.130
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,

1573
01:15:47.130 --> 01:15:48.500
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

1574
01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:53.200
Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir;

1575
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.070
but yet, sir, I would prove--

1576
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:57.270
Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,

1577
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:58.830
Thou wilt prove his.

1578
01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:00.300
Take him to prison, officer:

1579
01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:02.200
Correction and instruction must both work

1580
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.130
Ere this rude beast will profit.

1581
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:05.200
He must before the deputy, sir;

1582
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.330
he has given him warning:

1583
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:09.070
the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster:

1584
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:10.030
if he be a whoremonger,

1585
01:16:10.030 --> 01:16:10.970
and comes before him,

1586
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:13.170
he were as good go a mile on his errand.

1587
01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:16.770
His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.

1588
01:16:16.770 --> 01:16:18.670
I spy comfort; I cry bail.

1589
01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:22.270
Here's a gentleman and a friend of mine.

1590
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:27.270
How now, noble Pompey!

1591
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:29.300
What, at the wheels of Caesar?

1592
01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:33.430
art thou led in triumph?

1593
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:36.170
What, is there none of Pygmalion's images,

1594
01:16:36.170 --> 01:16:39.000
newly made woman, to be had now,

1595
01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.700
for putting the hand in the pocket

1596
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:45.600
and extracting it clutch'd?

1597
01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:46.730
What sayest thou, Trot?

1598
01:16:46.730 --> 01:16:48.670
Is the world as it was, man?

1599
01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:52.670
Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how?

1600
01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:53.630
The trick of it?

1601
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:55.970
Still thus, and thus; still worse!

1602
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:57.930
How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress?

1603
01:16:57.930 --> 01:16:59.630
Procures she still, ha?

1604
01:16:59.630 --> 01:17:01.670
Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef,

1605
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:03.870
she is herself in the tub.

1606
01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:05.830
Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it;

1607
01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:07.400
it must be so:

1608
01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.600
ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:

1609
01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.930
an unshunned consequence; it must be so.

1610
01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:15.400
Art going to prison, Pompey?

1611
01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.630
Yes, faith, sir.

1612
01:17:17.630 --> 01:17:19.800
Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey.

1613
01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.230
Farewell: go, say I sent thee thither.

1614
01:17:23.230 --> 01:17:25.270
For debt, Pompey? or how?

1615
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:27.630
For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

1616
01:17:27.630 --> 01:17:29.570
Well, then, imprison him:

1617
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:31.770
if imprisonment be the due of a bawd,

1618
01:17:31.770 --> 01:17:36.130
why, 'tis his right: bawd is he doubtless,

1619
01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:40.730
and of antiquity too; bawd-born.

1620
01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:44.570
Farewell, good Pompey.

1621
01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.930
Commend me to the prison, Pompey:

1622
01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:53.330
you will turn good husband now, Pompey;

1623
01:17:53.330 --> 01:17:55.500
you will keep the house.

1624
01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.800
Sir, I hope your good worship will be my bail.

1625
01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:02.430
No, indeed, will I not, Pompey;

1626
01:18:02.430 --> 01:18:04.130
it is not the wear.

1627
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:08.100
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage:

1628
01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.000
If you take it not patiently,

1629
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.170
why, your mettle is the more.

1630
01:18:13.170 --> 01:18:18.000
Adieu, trusty Pompey.

1631
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:18.830
'Bless you, friar.

1632
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:20.430
And you.

1633
01:18:20.430 --> 01:18:23.370
Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

1634
01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:25.270
Come your ways, sir; come.

1635
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:28.930
You will not bail me, then, sir?

1636
01:18:28.930 --> 01:18:30.530
Then, Pompey, nor now.

1637
01:18:30.530 --> 01:18:35.730
What news abroad, friar? what news?

1638
01:18:35.730 --> 01:18:37.970
Come your ways, sir; come.

1639
01:18:37.970 --> 01:18:41.970
Go to kennel, Pompey; go.

1640
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:46.200
What news, friar, of the duke?

1641
01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.570
I know none. Can you tell me of any?

1642
01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:52.070
Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia;

1643
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:54.130
other some, he is in Rome:

1644
01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.730
but where is he, think you?

1645
01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:57.030
I know not where; but wheresoever,

1646
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.570
I wish him well.

1647
01:18:58.570 --> 01:19:00.730
It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal

1648
01:19:00.730 --> 01:19:03.300
from the state, and usurp the beggary

1649
01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:05.170
he was never born to.

1650
01:19:05.170 --> 01:19:07.730
Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence;

1651
01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:09.570
he puts transgression to 't.

1652
01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:11.630
He does well in 't.

1653
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:13.170
A little more lenity to lechery

1654
01:19:13.170 --> 01:19:14.630
would do no harm in him:

1655
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:16.800
something too crabbed that way, friar.

1656
01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.970
It is too general a vice,

1657
01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.400
and severity must cure it.

1658
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.370
Yes, in good sooth,

1659
01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:22.800
the vice is of a great kindred;

1660
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.130
it is well allied:

1661
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:26.870
but it is impossible to extirp it quite,

1662
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:28.770
friar, till eating and drinking be put down.

1663
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:31.930
They say this Angelo was not made

1664
01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:33.230
by man and woman

1665
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:35.370
after this downright way of creation:

1666
01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:36.900
is it true, think you?

1667
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.800
How should he be made, then?

1668
01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.530
Some report a sea-maid spawned him;

1669
01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:45.400
some, that he was begot between two stock-fishes.

1670
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.770
But it is certain that when he makes water

1671
01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:50.430
his urine is congealed ice;

1672
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:52.170
that I know to be true:

1673
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:56.730
and he is a motion generative;

1674
01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:57.630
that's infallible.

1675
01:19:57.630 --> 01:19:59.070
You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

1676
01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:01.570
Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him,

1677
01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:03.300
for the rebellion of a codpiece

1678
01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:05.370
to take away the life of a man!

1679
01:20:05.370 --> 01:20:07.830
Would the duke that is absent have done this?

1680
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:09.270
Ere he would have hanged a man

1681
01:20:09.270 --> 01:20:11.070
for the getting a hundred bastards,

1682
01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:14.430
he would have paid for the nursing a thousand:

1683
01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:16.170
he had some feeling of the sport:

1684
01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:17.400
he knew the service,

1685
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:19.200
and that instructed him to mercy.

1686
01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.700
I never heard the absent duke

1687
01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:21.870
much detected for women;

1688
01:20:21.870 --> 01:20:23.130
he was not inclined that way.

1689
01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:25.700
O, sir, you are deceived.

1690
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:26.530
'Tis not possible.

1691
01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.270
Who, not the duke?

1692
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:30.200
yes, your beggar of fifty;

1693
01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.600
and his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish:

1694
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.300
the duke had crotchets in him.

1695
01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.270
He would be drunk too;

1696
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:39.970
that let me inform you.

1697
01:20:39.970 --> 01:20:41.800
You do him wrong, surely.

1698
01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.900
Sir, I was an inward of his.

1699
01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:48.870
A shy fellow was the duke:

1700
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:52.330
and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing.

1701
01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:55.470
What, I prithee, might be the cause?

1702
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:58.370
No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked

1703
01:20:58.370 --> 01:21:02.000
within the teeth and the lips:

1704
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.530
but this I can let you understand,

1705
01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:05.700
the greater file of the subject

1706
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:07.100
held the duke to be wise.

1707
01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:09.800
Wise! why, no question but he was.

1708
01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.200
A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

1709
01:21:14.170 --> 01:21:15.600
Either this is the envy in you,

1710
01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:18.100
folly, or mistaking:

1711
01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:19.930
the very stream of his life

1712
01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:21.330
and the business he hath helmed

1713
01:21:21.330 --> 01:21:22.570
must upon a warranted need

1714
01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:24.330
give him a better proclamation.

1715
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:25.800
Let him be but testimonied

1716
01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:27.000
in his own bringings-forth,

1717
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.200
and he shall appear to the envious a scholar,

1718
01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.770
a statesman and a soldier.

1719
01:21:31.770 --> 01:21:33.630
Therefore you speak unskilfully:

1720
01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:35.500
or if your knowledge be more

1721
01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.770
it is much darkened in your malice.

1722
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:39.370
Sir, I know him, and I love him.

1723
01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:41.000
Love talks with better knowledge,

1724
01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.530
and knowledge with dearer love.

1725
01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:44.470
Come, sir, I know what I know.

1726
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:45.970
I can hardly believe that,

1727
01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:47.470
since you know not what you speak.

1728
01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:49.870
But, if ever the duke return,

1729
01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:52.270
as our prayers are he may,

1730
01:21:52.270 --> 01:21:55.270
let me desire you to make your answer before him.

1731
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:56.270
If it be honest you have spoke,

1732
01:21:56.270 --> 01:21:58.830
you have courage to maintain it:

1733
01:21:58.830 --> 01:21:59.900
I am bound to call upon you;

1734
01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.030
and, I pray you, your name?

1735
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:04.870
Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

1736
01:22:04.870 --> 01:22:05.630
He shall know you better, sir,

1737
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:07.300
if I live to report you.

1738
01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:09.730
I fear you not.

1739
01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:12.500
O, you hope the duke will return no more;

1740
01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:16.400
or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite.

1741
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.670
But indeed I can do you little harm;

1742
01:22:18.670 --> 01:22:20.670
you'll forswear this again.

1743
01:22:20.670 --> 01:22:23.430
I'll be hanged first:

1744
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:26.430
thou art deceived in me, friar.

1745
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:29.730
But no more of that.

1746
01:22:29.730 --> 01:22:32.370
Canst thou tell if Claudio die to-morrow or no?

1747
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:34.170
Why should he die, sir?

1748
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:37.330
Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish.

1749
01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:40.730
I would the duke we talk of were returned again:

1750
01:22:40.730 --> 01:22:41.900
the ungenitured agent

1751
01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.830
will unpeople the province with continency;

1752
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:46.600
sparrows must not build in his house-eaves,

1753
01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.030
because they are lecherous.

1754
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:52.370
The duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered;

1755
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:54.400
he would never bring them to light:

1756
01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:57.200
would he were returned!

1757
01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.130
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.

1758
01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:07.670
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me.

1759
01:23:07.670 --> 01:23:09.030
The duke, I say to thee again,

1760
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:11.130
would eat mutton on Fridays.

1761
01:23:11.130 --> 01:23:13.370
He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,

1762
01:23:13.370 --> 01:23:14.870
he would mouth with a beggar,

1763
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:16.970
though she smelt brown bread and garlic:

1764
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:19.930
say that I said so. Farewell.

1765
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:26.270
No might nor greatness in mortality

1766
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:27.770
Can censure 'scape;

1767
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:29.230
back-wounding calumny

1768
01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:31.900
The whitest virtue strikes.

1769
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.230
What king so strong

1770
01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:38.400
Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?

1771
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:47.770
Go; away with her to prison!

1772
01:23:47.770 --> 01:23:49.330
Good my lord, be merciful to me;

1773
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:52.330
you are accounted a merciful man; good my lord.

1774
01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:54.500
Double and treble admonition,

1775
01:23:54.500 --> 01:23:57.300
and still forfeit in the same kind!

1776
01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:59.270
This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant.

1777
01:23:59.270 --> 01:24:01.000
A bawd of eleven years' continuance,

1778
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.170
may it please your honour.

1779
01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:03.700
My lord, this is one Lucio's

1780
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.970
information against me.

1781
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:06.600
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him

1782
01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:09.670
in the duke's time; he promised her marriage:

1783
01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:11.170
his child is a year and a quarter old,

1784
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:11.900
come Philip and Jacob:

1785
01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.030
I have kept it myself;

1786
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:15.470
and see how he goes about to abuse me!

1787
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:17.030
That fellow is a fellow of much licence:

1788
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:18.030
let him be called before us.

1789
01:24:18.030 --> 01:24:19.970
Away with her to prison!

1790
01:24:19.970 --> 01:24:22.900
Go to; no more words.

1791
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:32.500
Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;

1792
01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:35.600
Claudio must die to-morrow:

1793
01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.700
let him be furnished with divines,

1794
01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:42.070
and have all charitable preparation.

1795
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:45.670
if my brother wrought by my pity,

1796
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:48.600
it should not be so with him.

1797
01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.700
So please you,

1798
01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.730
this friar hath been with him,

1799
01:24:51.730 --> 01:24:53.930
and advised him for the entertainment of death.

1800
01:24:53.930 --> 01:24:54.930
Good even, good father.

1801
01:24:54.930 --> 01:24:57.170
Bliss and goodness on you!

1802
01:24:57.170 --> 01:24:58.100
Of whence are you?

1803
01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:59.670
Not of this country,

1804
01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:00.770
though my chance is now

1805
01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:02.130
To use it for my time:

1806
01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.530
I am a brother of gracious order,

1807
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:05.530
late come from the See

1808
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:09.270
In special business from his holiness.

1809
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:11.230
What news abroad i' the world?

1810
01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:14.730
None, but that there is so great

1811
01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:15.830
a fever on goodness,

1812
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:18.200
that the dissolution of it must cure it:

1813
01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.930
novelty is only in request;

1814
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:23.630
and it is as dangerous to be aged

1815
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:24.970
in any kind of course,

1816
01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:26.170
as it is virtuous

1817
01:25:26.170 --> 01:25:29.300
to be constant in any undertaking.

1818
01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:31.030
There is scarce truth enough alive

1819
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:33.800
to make societies secure;

1820
01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:38.030
but security enough to make fellowships accurst:

1821
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:41.270
much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world.

1822
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:43.070
This news is old enough,

1823
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:45.770
yet it is every day's news.

1824
01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:53.400
I pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

1825
01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.630
One that, above all other strifes,

1826
01:25:56.630 --> 01:26:00.230
contended especially to know himself.

1827
01:26:00.230 --> 01:26:03.530
What pleasure was he given to?

1828
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:06.430
Rather rejoicing to see another merry,

1829
01:26:06.430 --> 01:26:07.770
than merry at any thing

1830
01:26:07.770 --> 01:26:10.270
which professed to make him rejoice:

1831
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:12.770
a gentleman of all temperance.

1832
01:26:12.770 --> 01:26:14.570
But leave we him to his events,

1833
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.770
with a prayer they may prove prosperous;

1834
01:26:16.770 --> 01:26:17.870
and let me desire to know

1835
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:20.770
how you find Claudio prepared.

1836
01:26:20.770 --> 01:26:22.730
I am made to understand

1837
01:26:22.730 --> 01:26:25.270
that you have lent him visitation.

1838
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:27.370
He professes to have received no sinister measure

1839
01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:29.130
from his judge,

1840
01:26:29.130 --> 01:26:30.930
but most willingly humbles himself

1841
01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:33.070
to the determination of justice:

1842
01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:35.770
yet had he framed to himself,

1843
01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:37.670
by the instruction of his frailty,

1844
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:40.300
many deceiving promises of life;

1845
01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:44.530
which I by my good patience have discredited to him,

1846
01:26:44.530 --> 01:26:47.100
and now is he resolved to die.

1847
01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:50.770
You have paid the heavens your function,

1848
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:53.930
and the prisoner the very debt of your calling.

1849
01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:57.370
I have laboured for the poor gentleman

1850
01:26:57.370 --> 01:27:00.300
to the extremest shore of my modesty:

1851
01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:05.470
but my brother justice have I found so severe,

1852
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:07.670
that he hath forced me to tell him

1853
01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:10.100
he is indeed Justice.

1854
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.270
If his own life answer

1855
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:12.870
the straitness of his proceeding,

1856
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:15.200
it shall become him well;

1857
01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.900
wherein if he chance to fail,

1858
01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:18.700
he hath sentenced himself.

1859
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:23.930
I am going to visit the prisoner.

1860
01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:24.900
Fare you well.

1861
01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:27.400
Peace be with you!

1862
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:36.900
He who the sword of heaven will bear

1863
01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.800
Should be as holy as severe;

1864
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:42.570
Pattern in himself to know,

1865
01:27:42.570 --> 01:27:45.630
Grace to stand, and virtue go;

1866
01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:47.070
More nor less to others paying

1867
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:50.800
Than by self-offences weighing.

1868
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:53.600
Shame to him whose cruel striking

1869
01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:56.500
Kills for faults of his own liking!

1870
01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.470
Twice treble shame on Angelo,

1871
01:27:58.470 --> 01:28:03.170
To weed my vice and let his grow!

1872
01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:05.330
O, what may man within him hide,

1873
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:08.730
Though angel on the outward side!

1874
01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:10.400
How may likeness made in crimes,

1875
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.800
Making practise on the times,

1876
01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.800
To draw with idle spiders' strings

1877
01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:22.470
Most ponderous and substantial things!

1878
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:27.130
Craft against vice I must apply:

1879
01:28:27.130 --> 01:28:29.300
With Angelo to-night shall lie

1880
01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:33.300
His old betrothed but despised;

1881
01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:36.070
So disguise shall, by the disguised,

1882
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:39.170
Pay with falsehood false exacting,

1883
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:41.300
And perform an old contracting.

1884
01:28:49.630 --> 01:28:59.730
(♪singing) Take, O, take those lips away,

1885
01:28:59.730 --> 01:29:08.800
That so sweetly were forsworn;

1886
01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:15.230
And those eyes, the break of day,

1887
01:29:15.230 --> 01:29:23.430
Lights that do mislead the morn:

1888
01:29:23.430 --> 01:29:31.400
But my kisses bring again,

1889
01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:39.770
Seals of love, but sealed in vain,

1890
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:47.800
But my kisses bring again,

1891
01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:59.930
Seals of love, but sealed in vain.

1892
01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:02.230
I cry you mercy, sir;

1893
01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:03.130
and well could wish

1894
01:30:03.130 --> 01:30:06.470
you had not found me here so musical:

1895
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:10.130
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,

1896
01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:13.900
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

1897
01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:17.770
'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm

1898
01:30:17.770 --> 01:30:20.870
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.

1899
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:22.430
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired

1900
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:23.630
for me here to-day?

1901
01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:26.170
much upon this time have I promised here to meet.

1902
01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:28.100
You have not been inquired after:

1903
01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.530
I have sat here all day.

1904
01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:31.970
I do constantly believe you.

1905
01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:33.730
The time is come even now.

1906
01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:35.770
I shall crave your forbearance a little:

1907
01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:37.730
may be I will call upon you anon,

1908
01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:39.270
for some advantage to yourself.

1909
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:44.130
I am always bound to you.

1910
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:45.770
Very well met, and well come.

1911
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:47.730
What is the news from this good deputy?

1912
01:30:47.730 --> 01:30:49.930
He hath a garden circummured with brick,

1913
01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:52.630
Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;

1914
01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:55.270
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,

1915
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:57.830
That makes his opening with this bigger key:

1916
01:30:57.830 --> 01:30:59.800
This other doth command a little door

1917
01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.000
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;

1918
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.370
There have I made my promise

1919
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:06.230
Upon the heavy middle of the night

1920
01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:08.070
To call upon him.

1921
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:09.930
But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

1922
01:31:09.930 --> 01:31:12.670
I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:

1923
01:31:12.670 --> 01:31:15.100
With whispering and most guilty diligence,

1924
01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:18.000
In action all of precept, he did show me

1925
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.100
The way twice o'er.

1926
01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:21.300
Are there no other tokens

1927
01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.170
Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

1928
01:31:23.170 --> 01:31:25.100
No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;

1929
01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:27.370
And that I have possess'd him my most stay

1930
01:31:27.370 --> 01:31:28.670
Can be but brief;

1931
01:31:28.670 --> 01:31:30.130
for I have made him know

1932
01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:31.700
I have a servant comes with me along,

1933
01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:33.470
That stays upon me,

1934
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:36.030
whose persuasion is I come about my brother.

1935
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:38.170
'Tis well borne up.

1936
01:31:38.170 --> 01:31:40.200
I have not yet made known to Mariana

1937
01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:44.400
A word of this.

1938
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.700
I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;

1939
01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.770
She comes to do you good.

1940
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:50.630
I do desire the like.

1941
01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.500
Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

1942
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.970
Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

1943
01:31:54.970 --> 01:31:57.400
Take, then, this your companion by the hand,

1944
01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.830
Who hath a story ready for your ear.

1945
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:00.900
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;

1946
01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:02.370
The vaporous night approaches.

1947
01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:04.600
Will't please you walk aside?

1948
01:32:10.130 --> 01:32:12.700
O place and greatness!

1949
01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.270
millions of false eyes

1950
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:16.400
Are stuck upon thee:

1951
01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.500
volumes of report

1952
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.500
Run with these false

1953
01:32:19.500 --> 01:32:20.670
and most contrarious quests

1954
01:32:20.670 --> 01:32:23.370
Upon thy doings:

1955
01:32:23.370 --> 01:32:25.170
thousand escapes of wit

1956
01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:28.430
Make thee the father of their idle dreams

1957
01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:32.430
And rack thee in their fancies.

1958
01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.930
Welcome, how agreed?

1959
01:32:35.930 --> 01:32:37.600
She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,

1960
01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:38.700
If you advise it.

1961
01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:39.570
It is not my consent,

1962
01:32:39.570 --> 01:32:41.130
But my entreaty too.

1963
01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:42.530
Little have you to say

1964
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:45.800
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,

1965
01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:48.400
'Remember now my brother.'

1966
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.670
Fear me not.

1967
01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:51.030
Nor, gentle daughter,

1968
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:52.070
fear you not at all.

1969
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:53.970
He is your husband on a pre-contract:

1970
01:32:53.970 --> 01:32:54.970
To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,

1971
01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:58.270
Sith that the justice of your title to him

1972
01:32:58.270 --> 01:33:00.330
Doth flourish the deceit.

1973
01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:01.830
Come, let us go:

1974
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:02.800
Our corn's to reap,

1975
01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.100
for yet our tithe's to sow.

1976
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:10.830
Come hither, sirrah.

1977
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:22.730
Can you cut off a man's head?

1978
01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:26.100
If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can;

1979
01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.330
but if he be a married man,

1980
01:33:27.330 --> 01:33:29.070
he's his wife's head,

1981
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.130
and I can never cut off a woman's head.

1982
01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:33.430
Come, sir, leave me your snatches,

1983
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:35.970
and yield me a direct answer.

1984
01:33:35.970 --> 01:33:38.130
To-morrow morning are to die Claudio

1985
01:33:38.130 --> 01:33:39.370
and Barnardine.

1986
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:42.430
Here is in our prison a common executioner,

1987
01:33:42.430 --> 01:33:45.130
who in his office lacks a helper:

1988
01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:47.570
if you will take it on you to assist him,

1989
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:49.500
it shall redeem you from your gyves;

1990
01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.200
if not,

1991
01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:53.670
you shall have your full time of imprisonment

1992
01:33:53.670 --> 01:33:57.000
and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping,

1993
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.100
for you have been a notorious bawd.

1994
01:33:59.930 --> 01:34:03.870
Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;

1995
01:34:03.870 --> 01:34:08.430
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman.

1996
01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:12.730
I would be glad to

1997
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:15.770
receive some instruction from my fellow partner.

1998
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:16.870
What, ho! Abhorson!

1999
01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:19.030
Do you call, sir?

2000
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:22.730
Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow

2001
01:34:22.730 --> 01:34:24.800
in your execution.

2002
01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.530
If you think it meet,

2003
01:34:25.530 --> 01:34:27.200
compound with him by the year,

2004
01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.130
and let him abide here with you;

2005
01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:32.200
if not, use him for the present and dismiss him.

2006
01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.030
He cannot plead his estimation with you;

2007
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:36.370
he hath been a bawd.

2008
01:34:36.370 --> 01:34:40.030
A bawd, sir? fie upon him!

2009
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:41.930
he will discredit our mystery.

2010
01:34:41.930 --> 01:34:45.330
Go to, sir; you weigh equally;

2011
01:34:45.330 --> 01:34:46.870
a feather will turn the scale.

2012
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:49.730
Pray, sir, by your good favour,

2013
01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:53.900
for surely, sir, a good favour you have,

2014
01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:56.600
but that you have a hanging look,

2015
01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:00.270
do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?

2016
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:02.400
Ay, sir; a mystery

2017
01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:04.230
Painting, sir, I have heard say,

2018
01:35:04.230 --> 01:35:05.930
is a mystery; and your whores, sir,

2019
01:35:05.930 --> 01:35:07.900
being members of my occupation,

2020
01:35:07.900 --> 01:35:08.900
using painting,

2021
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.000
do prove my occupation a mystery:

2022
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.730
but what mystery there should be in hanging,

2023
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:16.300
if I should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

2024
01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:21.070
Sir, it is a mystery.

2025
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:22.870
Proof?

2026
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:26.630
Every true man's apparel fits your thief:

2027
01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:28.530
if it be too little for your thief,

2028
01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:30.200
your true man thinks it big enough;

2029
01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.770
if it be too big for your thief,

2030
01:35:31.770 --> 01:35:34.000
your thief thinks it little enough:

2031
01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.900
so every true man's apparel fits your thief.

2032
01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:39.700
Are you agreed?

2033
01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:42.400
Sir, I will serve him;

2034
01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:43.430
for I do find your hangman

2035
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:48.100
is a more penitent trade than your bawd;

2036
01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:52.400
he doth oftener ask forgiveness.

2037
01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.400
You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe

2038
01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:58.270
to-morrow four o'clock.

2039
01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.770
I will instruct thee in my trade.

2040
01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:12.500
I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope,

2041
01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.730
if you have occasion to use me

2042
01:36:14.730 --> 01:36:16.130
for your own turn,

2043
01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:18.630
you shall find me yare;

2044
01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:19.530
for truly, sir,

2045
01:36:19.530 --> 01:36:26.100
for your kindness I owe you a good turn.

2046
01:36:28.270 --> 01:36:31.170
Here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:

2047
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:34.300
'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow

2048
01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:37.830
Thou must be made immortal.

2049
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:43.930
Where's Barnardine?

2050
01:36:43.930 --> 01:36:46.870
As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour

2051
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:50.970
When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:

2052
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:52.900
He will not wake.

2053
01:36:54.170 --> 01:36:57.800
Who can do good on him?

2054
01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.630
Well, go, prepare yourself.

2055
01:37:00.630 --> 01:37:02.230
(♪bells ring)

2056
01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:05.170
But, hark, what noise?

2057
01:37:05.170 --> 01:37:08.570
Heaven give your spirits comfort!

2058
01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:10.930
I hope it is some pardon or reprieve

2059
01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:12.500
For the most gentle Claudio.

2060
01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.800
Welcome father.

2061
01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.370
The best and wholesomest spirts of the night

2062
01:37:15.370 --> 01:37:16.700
Envelope you, good Provost!

2063
01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:18.130
Who came here of late?

2064
01:37:18.130 --> 01:37:20.270
None, since the curfew rung.

2065
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:21.130
Not Isabel?

2066
01:37:21.130 --> 01:37:22.370
No.

2067
01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:24.230
They will, then, ere't be long.

2068
01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:26.030
What comfort is for Claudio?

2069
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:28.030
There's some in hope.

2070
01:37:31.170 --> 01:37:33.100
It is a bitter deputy.

2071
01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:36.570
Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd

2072
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:37.470
Even with the stroke

2073
01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:39.300
and line of his great justice:

2074
01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.970
He doth with holy abstinence subdue

2075
01:37:41.970 --> 01:37:44.300
That in himself which he spurs on his power

2076
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:46.500
To qualify in others:

2077
01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.170
were he meal'd with that which he corrects,

2078
01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:49.330
then were he tyrannous;

2079
01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:52.170
But this being so, he's just.

2080
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,

2081
01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:56.300
But he must die to-morrow?

2082
01:37:56.300 --> 01:37:59.770
None, sir, none.

2083
01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:01.370
As near the dawning, provost, as it is,

2084
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:03.330
You shall hear more ere morning.

2085
01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:05.900
Happily you something know;

2086
01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.630
yet I believe there comes no countermand;

2087
01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:11.030
no such example have we:

2088
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:14.000
Besides, upon the very siege of justice

2089
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.030
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear

2090
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:18.030
Profess'd the contrary.

2091
01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:19.470
How now? What noise?

2092
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:21.100
That spirit's possessed with haste

2093
01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:22.470
that would the insisting posting

2094
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:24.600
with these strokes

2095
01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.300
This is his lordship's man.

2096
01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.100
And here comes Claudio's pardon.

2097
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:31.100
My lord hath sent you this note;

2098
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.030
and by me this further charge,

2099
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:34.200
that you swerve not

2100
01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.800
from the smallest article of it,

2101
01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:39.530
neither in time, matter, or other circumstance.

2102
01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:42.430
Good morrow; for, as I take it, it is almost day.

2103
01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:46.130
I shall obey him.

2104
01:38:46.130 --> 01:38:50.500
This is his pardon, purchased by such sin

2105
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.400
For which the pardoner himself is in.

2106
01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.700
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,

2107
01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.230
When it is born in high authority:

2108
01:38:57.230 --> 01:39:01.330
When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,

2109
01:39:01.330 --> 01:39:05.930
That for the fault's love is the offender friended.

2110
01:39:06.130 --> 01:39:07.570
Now, sir, what news?

2111
01:39:07.570 --> 01:39:09.900
I told you. Lord Angelo,

2112
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:11.630
belike thinking me remiss

2113
01:39:11.630 --> 01:39:12.600
in mine office,

2114
01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:14.930
awakens me with this unwonted putting-on;

2115
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:19.230
methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

2116
01:39:19.230 --> 01:39:22.200
Pray you, let's hear.

2117
01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.570
'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary,

2118
01:39:24.570 --> 01:39:28.430
let Claudio be executed by four of the clock;

2119
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:30.870
and in the afternoon Barnardine:

2120
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:35.000
for my better satisfaction,

2121
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.670
let me have Claudio's head sent me by five.

2122
01:39:39.670 --> 01:39:42.430
Let this be duly performed;

2123
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:44.200
with a thought that more depends on it

2124
01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:47.700
than we must yet deliver.

2125
01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:50.230
Thus fail not to do your office,

2126
01:39:50.230 --> 01:39:54.630
as you will answer it at your peril.'

2127
01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:58.270
What say you to this, sir?

2128
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:59.170
What is that Barnardine

2129
01:39:59.170 --> 01:40:01.330
who is to be executed in the afternoon?

2130
01:40:01.330 --> 01:40:02.800
A Bohemian born,

2131
01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:04.500
but here nursed un and bred;

2132
01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:07.130
one that is a prisoner nine years old.

2133
01:40:07.130 --> 01:40:08.870
How came it that the absent duke

2134
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:10.370
had not either delivered him to his liberty

2135
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:11.400
or executed him?

2136
01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:13.700
I have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

2137
01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:16.130
His friends still wrought reprieves for him:

2138
01:40:16.130 --> 01:40:19.070
and, indeed, his fact, till now in the government

2139
01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:21.600
of Lord Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.

2140
01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:22.900
It is now apparent?

2141
01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:26.330
Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

2142
01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.970
Hath he conducted himself penitently in prison?

2143
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:37.030
how seems he to be touched?

2144
01:40:37.030 --> 01:40:39.100
A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully

2145
01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:41.800
but as a drunken sleep;

2146
01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:44.600
careless, reckless, and fearless

2147
01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:47.070
of what's past, present, or to come;

2148
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:50.130
insensible of mortality, and desperately mortal.

2149
01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:51.170
He wants advice.

2150
01:40:51.170 --> 01:40:52.930
He will hear none:

2151
01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:56.030
he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison;

2152
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:58.630
give him leave to escape hence, he would not:

2153
01:40:58.630 --> 01:41:00.200
drunk many times a day,

2154
01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:03.300
if not many days entirely drunk.

2155
01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.330
We have very oft awaked him,

2156
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:07.070
as if to carry him to execution,

2157
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:09.300
and showed him a seeming warrant for it:

2158
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.970
it hath not moved him at all.

2159
01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:14.930
More of him anon.

2160
01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:18.070
There is written in your brow,

2161
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:19.870
provost, honesty and constancy:

2162
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:20.870
if I read it not truly,

2163
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:23.030
my ancient skill beguiles me;

2164
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:24.630
but, in the boldness of my cunning,

2165
01:41:24.630 --> 01:41:27.600
I will lay myself in hazard.

2166
01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:29.900
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute,

2167
01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:32.200
is no greater forfeit to the law

2168
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:34.300
than Angelo who hath sentenced him.

2169
01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:36.530
To make you understand this in a manifested effect,

2170
01:41:36.530 --> 01:41:39.030
I crave but four days' respite;

2171
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:41.000
for the which you are to do me a present

2172
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.600
and a dangerous courtesy.

2173
01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.730
Pray, sir, in what?

2174
01:41:44.730 --> 01:41:47.500
In the delaying death.

2175
01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:51.800
A lack, how may I do it,

2176
01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:52.900
having the hour limited,

2177
01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:54.900
and an express command, under penalty,

2178
01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:57.370
to deliver his head in the view of Angelo?

2179
01:41:57.370 --> 01:41:59.000
I may make my case as Claudio's,

2180
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.870
to cross this in the smallest.

2181
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:03.700
By the vow of mine order I warrant you,

2182
01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:07.330
if my instructions may be your guide.

2183
01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:09.270
Have this Barnardine be this morning executed,

2184
01:42:09.270 --> 01:42:11.600
and his head born to Angelo.

2185
01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:13.070
Angelo hath seen them both,

2186
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:14.500
and will discover the favour.

2187
01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.000
O, death's a great disguiser;

2188
01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.500
and you may add to it.

2189
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.570
Shave the head, and tie the beard;

2190
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:21.870
and say it was the desire of the penitent

2191
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:24.070
to be so bared before his death:

2192
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:26.630
you know the course is common.

2193
01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:30.270
If any thing fall to you upon this,

2194
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:31.730
more than thanks and good fortune,

2195
01:42:31.730 --> 01:42:33.570
by the saint whom I profess,

2196
01:42:33.570 --> 01:42:36.730
I will plead against it with my life.

2197
01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:41.700
Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

2198
01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:43.630
Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

2199
01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:45.370
To him, and to his substitutes.

2200
01:42:45.370 --> 01:42:46.670
You will think you have made no offence,

2201
01:42:46.670 --> 01:42:49.400
if the duke avouch the justice of your dealing?

2202
01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.730
But what likelihood is in that?

2203
01:42:50.730 --> 01:42:55.070
Not a resemblance, but a certainty.

2204
01:42:55.070 --> 01:42:56.430
Yet since I see you fearful,

2205
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:58.030
that neither my coat, integrity,

2206
01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:00.470
nor persuasion can with ease attempt you,

2207
01:43:00.470 --> 01:43:02.070
I will go further than I meant,

2208
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:04.100
to pluck all fears out of you.

2209
01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:05.800
Look you, sir,

2210
01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:08.670
here is the hand and seal of the duke:

2211
01:43:08.670 --> 01:43:10.300
you know the character, I doubt not;

2212
01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:13.970
and the signet is not strange to you.

2213
01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.070
I know them both.

2214
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:19.100
The contents of this is the return of the duke:

2215
01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.370
you shall anon over-read it at your pleasure;

2216
01:43:21.370 --> 01:43:22.670
where you shall find,

2217
01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:24.700
within these two days he will be here.

2218
01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:28.070
This is a thing that Angelo knows not;

2219
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:29.170
for he this very day

2220
01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:31.100
receives letters of strange tenor;

2221
01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:32.630
perchance of the duke's death;

2222
01:43:32.630 --> 01:43:34.330
perchance entering into some monastery;

2223
01:43:34.330 --> 01:43:37.500
but, by chance, nothing of what is writ.

2224
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:42.430
Look, the unfolding star calls up the shepherd.

2225
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:45.300
Put not yourself into amazement

2226
01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:46.830
how these things should be:

2227
01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:49.800
all difficulties are but easy when they are known.

2228
01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:51.370
Call your executioner,

2229
01:43:51.370 --> 01:43:53.370
and off with Barnardine's head:

2230
01:43:53.370 --> 01:43:54.700
I will give him a present shrift

2231
01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:57.730
and advise him for a better place.

2232
01:43:57.730 --> 01:43:59.230
Yet you are amazed;

2233
01:43:59.230 --> 01:44:01.570
but this shall absolutely resolve you.

2234
01:44:02.830 --> 01:44:06.730
It is almost clear dawn.

2235
01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:11.370
I am as well acquainted here

2236
01:44:11.370 --> 01:44:14.300
as I was in our house of profession:

2237
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.870
one would think it were Mistress Overdone's own house,

2238
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:19.570
for here be many of her old customers.

2239
01:44:19.570 --> 01:44:23.330
First, here's young Master Rash;

2240
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:25.630
he's in for a commodity of brown paper

2241
01:44:25.630 --> 01:44:26.870
and old ginger,

2242
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:30.070
ninescore and seventeen pounds;

2243
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:32.330
of which he made five marks, ready money:

2244
01:44:32.330 --> 01:44:35.130
marry, then ginger was not much in request,

2245
01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:38.070
for the old ladies were all dead.

2246
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:41.300
Then is there here one Master Caper,

2247
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:43.700
at the suit of Master Three-pile the mercer,

2248
01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:47.300
for some four suits of peach-coloured satin,

2249
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:50.170
which now peaches him a beggar.

2250
01:44:50.170 --> 01:44:51.730
Then have we here young Dizy,

2251
01:44:51.730 --> 01:44:53.100
and young Master Deep-vow,

2252
01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.000
and Master Copperspur,

2253
01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.770
and Master Starve-lackey the rapier

2254
01:44:57.770 --> 01:45:00.430
and dagger man,

2255
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:01.800
and young Drop-heir

2256
01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.170
that killed lusty Pudding,

2257
01:45:03.170 --> 01:45:04.900
and Master Forthlight the tilter,

2258
01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:07.900
and brave Master Shooty the great traveller,

2259
01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:14.270
and wild Half-can that stabbed Pots,

2260
01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:21.130
and, I think, forty more;

2261
01:45:21.130 --> 01:45:24.570
all great doers in our trade,

2262
01:45:24.570 --> 01:45:29.330
and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'

2263
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:31.900
Sirrah, rouse Barnardine.

2264
01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:39.670
Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.

2265
01:45:39.670 --> 01:45:41.700
Master Barnardine!

2266
01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:43.400
What, ho, Barnardine!

2267
01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.100
A pox o' your throats!

2268
01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:47.770
Who makes that noise there? What are you?

2269
01:45:47.770 --> 01:45:49.330
Your friends, sir; the hangman.

2270
01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:52.870
You must be so good to rise and be put to death.

2271
01:45:52.870 --> 01:45:56.230
Away, you rogue, away! I'm sleepy.

2272
01:45:56.230 --> 01:45:59.270
Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

2273
01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:00.700
Pray, Master Barnardine,

2274
01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.430
awake till you are executed,

2275
01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:04.930
and sleep afterwards.

2276
01:46:04.930 --> 01:46:08.170
Go in to him, and fetch him out.

2277
01:46:08.170 --> 01:46:10.370
He is coming, sir, he is coming;

2278
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:12.900
I hear his straw rustle.

2279
01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:14.570
Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

2280
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:15.670
Very ready, sir.

2281
01:46:15.670 --> 01:46:19.330
How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

2282
01:46:19.330 --> 01:46:21.730
Truly, sir, I would desire you

2283
01:46:21.730 --> 01:46:23.530
to clap into your prayers;

2284
01:46:23.530 --> 01:46:26.170
for, look you, the warrant's come.

2285
01:46:26.170 --> 01:46:28.630
You rogue, I have been drinking all night;

2286
01:46:28.630 --> 01:46:30.570
I am not fitted for 't.

2287
01:46:30.570 --> 01:46:32.070
O, the better, sir;

2288
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:33.000
for he that drinks all night,

2289
01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:34.930
and is hanged betimes in the morning,

2290
01:46:34.930 --> 01:46:38.370
may sleep the sounder all the next day.

2291
01:46:38.370 --> 01:46:39.330
Look you;

2292
01:46:39.330 --> 01:46:41.470
here comes your ghostly father:

2293
01:46:41.470 --> 01:46:45.270
do we jest now, think you?

2294
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:47.930
Sir, induced by my charity,

2295
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:50.670
and hearing how hastily you are to depart,

2296
01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:53.700
I come to comfort you, advise you, and pray with you.

2297
01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:57.970
Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,

2298
01:46:57.970 --> 01:46:59.970
and I will have more time to repair me,

2299
01:46:59.970 --> 01:47:02.500
or they'll beat out my brains with billets:

2300
01:47:02.500 --> 01:47:05.300
I will not consent to die this day, that's certain.

2301
01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:07.130
O, sir, you must:

2302
01:47:07.130 --> 01:47:08.170
and therefore I beseech you

2303
01:47:08.170 --> 01:47:10.330
Look forward on the journey you shall go.

2304
01:47:10.330 --> 01:47:11.570
I swear I will not die to-day

2305
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:13.130
for any man's persuasion.

2306
01:47:13.130 --> 01:47:14.070
But hear you.

2307
01:47:14.070 --> 01:47:15.700
Not a word: if you have any thing

2308
01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:17.930
to say to me, come to my ward;

2309
01:47:17.930 --> 01:47:20.730
for thence will not I to-day.

2310
01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:26.930
Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

2311
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:29.800
A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;

2312
01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.200
And to transport him in the mind he is

2313
01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.370
Were damnable.

2314
01:47:36.170 --> 01:47:37.930
Here in the prison, father,

2315
01:47:37.930 --> 01:47:40.400
There died this morning of a cruel fever

2316
01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:43.400
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,

2317
01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:45.400
A man of Claudio's years;

2318
01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:48.300
his beard and head just of his colour.

2319
01:47:48.300 --> 01:47:50.830
What if we do omit this reprobate

2320
01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:52.130
till he were well inclined;

2321
01:47:52.130 --> 01:47:53.270
And satisfy the deputy

2322
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:55.000
with the visage of Ragozine,

2323
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.300
more like to Claudio?

2324
01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:59.200
O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!

2325
01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.630
Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on

2326
01:48:00.630 --> 01:48:02.070
Prefix'd by Angelo:

2327
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:03.170
see this be done,

2328
01:48:03.170 --> 01:48:04.330
And sent according to command;

2329
01:48:04.330 --> 01:48:05.700
whiles I persuade this rude wretch

2330
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.070
willingly to die.

2331
01:48:07.070 --> 01:48:09.870
This shall be done, good father, presently.

2332
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:12.570
But Barnardine must die this afternoon:

2333
01:48:12.570 --> 01:48:14.830
And how shall we continue Claudio,

2334
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:16.600
To save me from the danger that might come

2335
01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:18.470
If he were known alive?

2336
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:20.370
See this be done.

2337
01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:22.230
Put them in secret holds,

2338
01:48:22.230 --> 01:48:23.870
both Barnardine and Claudio:

2339
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:26.070
Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting

2340
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:27.430
To the under generation,

2341
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:30.170
you shall find your safety manifested.

2342
01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:31.430
I am your free dependant.

2343
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:34.830
Quick, dispatch, and see the head send to Angelo.

2344
01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:41.500
Now will I write letters to Angelo,

2345
01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:43.830
The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents

2346
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:46.830
Shall witness to him I am near at home,

2347
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:48.870
And that, by great injunctions, I am bound

2348
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:52.230
To enter publicly: him I'll desire

2349
01:48:52.230 --> 01:48:53.730
To meet me at the consecrated fount

2350
01:48:53.730 --> 01:48:56.800
A league below the city; and from thence,

2351
01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:00.570
By cold gradation and well-balanced form,

2352
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:03.270
We shall proceed with Angelo.

2353
01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:15.170
Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

2354
01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:17.630
Convenient is it. Make a swift return;

2355
01:49:17.630 --> 01:49:19.030
For I would commune with you of such things

2356
01:49:19.030 --> 01:49:20.970
That want no ear but yours.

2357
01:49:20.970 --> 01:49:23.470
I'll make all speed.

2358
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:24.670
(♪bells ring)

2359
01:49:24.670 --> 01:49:26.830
(from outside) Ho, peace be here!

2360
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:29.500
The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know

2361
01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.900
If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:

2362
01:49:31.900 --> 01:49:35.130
But I will keep her ignorant of her good,

2363
01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:38.370
To make her heavenly comforts of despair,

2364
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:40.800
When it is least expected.

2365
01:49:53.570 --> 01:49:57.470
Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

2366
01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:05.900
He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:

2367
01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.770
His head is off and sent to Angelo.

2368
01:50:08.770 --> 01:50:10.100
Nay, but it is not so.

2369
01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:12.070
It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,

2370
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:13.470
In your close patience.

2371
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:15.500
O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

2372
01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:20.270
You shall not be admitted to his sight.

2373
01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:33.300
Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!

2374
01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:39.530
Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

2375
01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.530
This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;

2376
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:45.170
Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.

2377
01:50:45.170 --> 01:50:47.700
Mark what I say, which you shall find

2378
01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:51.200
By every syllable a faithful verity:

2379
01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:53.300
The duke comes home to-morrow;

2380
01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:56.100
nay, dry your eyes;

2381
01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:57.700
One of our convent, and his confessor,

2382
01:50:57.700 --> 01:50:59.600
Gives me this instance: already he hath carried

2383
01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.630
Notice to Escalus and Angelo,

2384
01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:03.770
Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,

2385
01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:05.700
There to give up their power.

2386
01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:07.470
If you can, pace your wisdom

2387
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:10.230
In that good path that I would wish it go,

2388
01:51:10.230 --> 01:51:11.870
And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,

2389
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:14.400
Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,

2390
01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.730
And general honour.

2391
01:51:16.730 --> 01:51:19.830
I am directed by you.

2392
01:51:19.830 --> 01:51:22.570
This letter, then, to Friar Thomas give;

2393
01:51:22.570 --> 01:51:24.400
'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:

2394
01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.500
Say, by this token, I desire his company

2395
01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:28.400
At Mariana's house to-night.

2396
01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.170
Her cause and yours I'll perfect him withal,

2397
01:51:31.170 --> 01:51:33.070
and he shall bring you before the duke,

2398
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:35.370
and to the head of Angelo

2399
01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:38.330
Accuse him home and home.

2400
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:39.300
For my poor self,

2401
01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:40.870
I am combined by a sacred vow

2402
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:45.070
And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:

2403
01:51:45.070 --> 01:51:47.070
Command these fretting waters from your eyes

2404
01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:51.430
With a light heart; trust not my holy order,

2405
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:55.300
If I pervert your course. Who's here?

2406
01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:58.900
Good morning. Friar, where's the provost?

2407
01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:01.700
Not within, sir.

2408
01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:03.730
O pretty Isabella,

2409
01:52:03.730 --> 01:52:05.100
I am pale at mine heart

2410
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:08.370
to see thine eyes so red:

2411
01:52:08.370 --> 01:52:11.330
thou must be patient.

2412
01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:21.370
I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran;

2413
01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:23.700
I dare not for my head fill my belly;

2414
01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:26.970
one fruitful meal would set me to 't.

2415
01:52:26.970 --> 01:52:30.970
But they say the duke will be here to-morrow.

2416
01:52:30.970 --> 01:52:33.930
By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:

2417
01:52:33.930 --> 01:52:35.200
if the old fantastical duke

2418
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:38.730
of dark corners had been at home, he had lived.

2419
01:52:38.730 --> 01:52:43.900
Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding

2420
01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:45.800
to your reports; but the best is,

2421
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.330
he lives not in them.

2422
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:48.730
Friar, thou knowest not the duke

2423
01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:50.070
so well as I do:

2424
01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:52.870
he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

2425
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:55.130
Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

2426
01:52:55.130 --> 01:52:56.470
Nay, tarry; I'll go with thee

2427
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:59.030
I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.

2428
01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:01.530
You have told me too many of him already, sir,

2429
01:53:01.530 --> 01:53:02.400
if they be true;

2430
01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.400
if not true, none were enough.

2431
01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:05.570
I was once before him

2432
01:53:05.570 --> 01:53:07.470
for getting a wench with child.

2433
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:08.930
Did you such a thing?

2434
01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:10.030
Yes, marry, did I

2435
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:11.600
but I was fain to forswear it;

2436
01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:12.630
they would else have married me

2437
01:53:12.630 --> 01:53:14.570
to the rotten medlar.

2438
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:16.630
Sir, your company is fairer than honest.

2439
01:53:16.630 --> 01:53:17.900
Rest you well.

2440
01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:19.200
By my troth, I'll go with thee

2441
01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.570
to the lane's end:

2442
01:53:20.570 --> 01:53:22.070
if bawdy talk offend you,

2443
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:23.130
we'll have very little of it.

2444
01:53:23.130 --> 01:53:27.100
Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.

2445
01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:30.970
Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

2446
01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:33.530
In most uneven and distracted manner.

2447
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:34.930
His actions show much like to madness:

2448
01:53:34.930 --> 01:53:37.600
pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted!

2449
01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:40.100
And why meet him at the gates,

2450
01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:42.070
and redeliver our authorities there

2451
01:53:42.070 --> 01:53:44.600
I guess not.

2452
01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:45.500
And why should we proclaim it

2453
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:46.470
in an hour before his entering,

2454
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:48.370
that if any crave redress of injustice,

2455
01:53:48.370 --> 01:53:51.230
they should exhibit their petitions in the street?

2456
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:53.330
He shows his reason for that:

2457
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:56.130
to have a dispatch of complaints,

2458
01:53:56.130 --> 01:53:57.770
and to deliver us from devices hereafter,

2459
01:53:57.770 --> 01:54:00.870
which shall then have no power

2460
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:04.270
to stand against us.

2461
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:06.300
Well, I beseech you,

2462
01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:10.600
let it be proclaimed betimes i' the morn;

2463
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:12.670
I'll call you at your house:

2464
01:54:13.330 --> 01:54:15.030
give notice to such men of sort and suit

2465
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:16.670
as are to meet him.

2466
01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:19.170
I shall, sir. Fare you well.

2467
01:54:23.170 --> 01:54:28.200
This deed unshapes me quite,

2468
01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:29.930
makes me unpregnant

2469
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:35.370
And dull to all proceedings.

2470
01:54:35.370 --> 01:54:38.970
A deflower'd maid!

2471
01:54:38.970 --> 01:54:40.730
And by an eminent body that enforced

2472
01:54:40.730 --> 01:54:42.970
The law against it!

2473
01:54:42.970 --> 01:54:44.630
But that her tender shame

2474
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:46.470
Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,

2475
01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:50.100
How might she tongue me!

2476
01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:53.330
Yet reason dares her no;

2477
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:55.400
For my authority bears of a credent bulk,

2478
01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.770
That no particular scandal once can touch

2479
01:54:56.770 --> 01:54:59.100
But it confounds the breather.

2480
01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:05.830
He should have lived,

2481
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:08.200
Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,

2482
01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:10.200
Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,

2483
01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.400
By so receiving a dishonour'd life

2484
01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:14.900
With ransom of such shame.

2485
01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:19.700
Would yet he had lived!

2486
01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:26.000
A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,

2487
01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:33.100
Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

2488
01:55:35.130 --> 01:55:37.400
To speak so indirectly I am loath:

2489
01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:39.930
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,

2490
01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:41.600
That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;

2491
01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:43.530
He says, to veil full purpose.

2492
01:55:43.530 --> 01:55:44.630
Be ruled by him.

2493
01:55:44.630 --> 01:55:46.230
Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure

2494
01:55:46.230 --> 01:55:47.900
He speak against me on the adverse side,

2495
01:55:47.900 --> 01:55:49.930
I should not think it strange;

2496
01:55:49.930 --> 01:55:52.400
for 'tis a physic that's bitter to sweet end.

2497
01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:53.500
I would Friar Thomas--

2498
01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.670
O, peace! the friar is come.

2499
01:55:55.670 --> 01:55:57.300
Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,

2500
01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:58.870
Where you may have such vantage on the duke,

2501
01:55:58.870 --> 01:56:00.630
He shall not pass you.

2502
01:56:00.630 --> 01:56:02.130
Twice have the trumpets sounded;

2503
01:56:02.130 --> 01:56:04.200
The generous and gravest citizens have hent the gates,

2504
01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:05.200
and very near upon

2505
01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.670
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!

2506
01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:15.030
(♪Music and cheering)

2507
01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:30.130
(applause and cheering)

2508
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.700
My very worthy cousin, fairly met!

2509
01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:51.630
Happy return be to your royal grace!

2510
01:56:51.630 --> 01:56:52.770
Our old and faithful friend,

2511
01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:54.000
we are glad to see you.

2512
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.230
Happy return be to your royal grace!

2513
01:56:56.230 --> 01:56:58.870
Many and hearty thankings to you both.

2514
01:56:58.870 --> 01:57:00.730
We have made inquiry of you;

2515
01:57:00.730 --> 01:57:03.270
and we hear such goodness of your justice,

2516
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:04.270
that our soul

2517
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:06.100
Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,

2518
01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:08.200
Forerunning more requital.

2519
01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:10.030
You make my bonds still greater.

2520
01:57:10.030 --> 01:57:11.230
O, your desert speaks loud;

2521
01:57:11.230 --> 01:57:12.230
and I should wrong it,

2522
01:57:12.230 --> 01:57:14.970
To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,

2523
01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:16.570
When it deserves, with characters of brass,

2524
01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:19.130
A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time

2525
01:57:19.130 --> 01:57:21.430
And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,

2526
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:25.300
And let the subject see, to make them know

2527
01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:26.800
That outward courtesies would fain proclaim

2528
01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:29.700
Favours that keep within.

2529
01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.600
Escalus, come!

2530
01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:33.300
You must walk by us on our other hand;

2531
01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:34.930
And good supporters are you.

2532
01:57:34.930 --> 01:57:38.470
Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

2533
01:57:38.470 --> 01:57:42.070
Justice, O royal duke!

2534
01:57:42.070 --> 01:57:43.000
Vail your regard

2535
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.870
Upon a wrong'd,

2536
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:47.930
I would fain have said, a maid!

2537
01:57:47.930 --> 01:57:50.070
O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye

2538
01:57:50.070 --> 01:57:51.900
By throwing it on any other object

2539
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.970
Till you have heard me in my true complaint

2540
01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:59.900
And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

2541
01:58:00.670 --> 01:58:04.330
Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.

2542
01:58:04.330 --> 01:58:05.800
Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:

2543
01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:06.900
Reveal yourself to him.

2544
01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:07.830
O worthy prince,

2545
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:10.530
You bid me seek redemption of the devil:

2546
01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:12.670
Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak

2547
01:58:12.670 --> 01:58:14.300
Must either punish me, not being believed,

2548
01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:16.130
Or wring redress from you.

2549
01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:18.870
Hear me, O hear me, here!

2550
01:58:18.870 --> 01:58:21.630
My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:

2551
01:58:21.630 --> 01:58:23.600
She hath been a suitor to me for her brother

2552
01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:24.570
Cut off by course of justice

2553
01:58:24.570 --> 01:58:25.630
By course of justice!

2554
01:58:25.630 --> 01:58:28.130
And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

2555
01:58:28.130 --> 01:58:32.930
Most strange, and yet most truly, will I speak:

2556
01:58:32.930 --> 01:58:37.930
That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?

2557
01:58:37.930 --> 01:58:40.900
That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?

2558
01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:42.630
That Angelo is an adulterous thief,

2559
01:58:42.630 --> 01:58:44.870
An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;

2560
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:47.000
Is it not strange and strange?

2561
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Nay, it is ten times strange.

2562
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.330
It is not truer he is Angelo

2563
01:58:50.330 --> 01:58:53.570
Than this is all as true as it is strange:

2564
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:56.130
Nay, it is ten times true;

2565
01:58:56.130 --> 01:58:58.630
for truth is truth to the end of reckoning.

2566
01:58:58.630 --> 01:58:59.770
Away with her!

2567
01:58:59.770 --> 01:59:02.130
Poor soul, She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

2568
01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:04.470
O prince, I conjure thee,

2569
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:05.330
as thou believest

2570
01:59:05.330 --> 01:59:07.400
There is another comfort than this world,

2571
01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:08.730
That thou dismiss me not, with that opinion

2572
01:59:08.730 --> 01:59:11.400
That I am touch'd with madness!

2573
01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:12.870
Make not impossible

2574
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:15.030
That which but seems unlike:

2575
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:16.170
'tis not impossible

2576
01:59:16.170 --> 01:59:18.570
But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,

2577
01:59:18.570 --> 01:59:21.930
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute

2578
01:59:21.930 --> 01:59:24.600
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,

2579
01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:27.430
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,

2580
01:59:27.430 --> 01:59:30.470
Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:

2581
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:33.270
If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,

2582
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:35.570
Had I more name for badness.

2583
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:36.500
By mine honesty,

2584
01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:38.470
If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--

2585
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:41.270
Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,

2586
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:42.600
Such a dependency of thing on thing,

2587
01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:44.370
As e'er I heard in madness.

2588
01:59:44.370 --> 01:59:45.000
O gracious duke,

2589
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.770
Harp not on that,

2590
01:59:46.770 --> 01:59:48.470
nor do not banish reason for inequality;

2591
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:50.030
but let your reason serve

2592
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:52.800
To make the truth appear where it seems hid,

2593
01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:55.800
And hide the false seems true.

2594
01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:57.430
Many that are not mad

2595
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:59.070
Have, sure, more lack of reason.

2596
01:59:59.070 --> 02:00:02.930
What would you say?

2597
02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:05.670
I am the sister of one Claudio,

2598
02:00:05.670 --> 02:00:07.700
Condemn'd upon the act of fornication

2599
02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:10.770
To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:

2600
02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:12.200
I, in probation of a sisterhood,

2601
02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:14.300
Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio

2602
02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:15.770
As then the messenger

2603
02:00:15.770 --> 02:00:18.400
That's I, an't like your grace:

2604
02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.370
I came to her from Claudio, and desired her

2605
02:00:20.370 --> 02:00:23.100
To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo

2606
02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:24.900
For her poor brother's pardon.

2607
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:25.900
That's he indeed.

2608
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:27.000
You were not bid to speak.

2609
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:27.870
No, my good lord;

2610
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:29.770
Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

2611
02:00:29.770 --> 02:00:30.930
I pray you now, then;

2612
02:00:30.930 --> 02:00:32.200
Pray you, take note of it:

2613
02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:33.870
and when you have a business for yourself,

2614
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:35.270
pray heaven you then be perfect.

2615
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:36.870
I warrant your honour.

2616
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:38.700
The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

2617
02:00:40.830 --> 02:00:42.770
This gentleman told somewhat of my tale

2618
02:00:42.770 --> 02:00:43.670
Right.

2619
02:00:43.670 --> 02:00:45.300
It may be right; but you are i' the wrong

2620
02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:49.030
To speak before your time. Proceed.

2621
02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:51.370
I went to this pernicious caitiff deputy

2622
02:00:51.370 --> 02:00:53.270
That's somewhat madly spoken.

2623
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.970
Pardon it;

2624
02:00:53.970 --> 02:00:55.430
The phrase is to the matter.

2625
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:57.900
Mended again. The matter; proceed.

2626
02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:00.970
In brief, to set the needless process by,

2627
02:01:00.970 --> 02:01:03.630
How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,

2628
02:01:03.630 --> 02:01:05.370
How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--

2629
02:01:05.370 --> 02:01:07.400
For this was of much length,

2630
02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:08.330
--the vile conclusion

2631
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:12.300
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:

2632
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:16.700
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body

2633
02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:18.800
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,

2634
02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:21.830
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,

2635
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:24.200
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,

2636
02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:27.500
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,

2637
02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:30.330
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant

2638
02:01:30.330 --> 02:01:31.970
For my poor brother's head.

2639
02:01:31.970 --> 02:01:33.430
This is most likely!

2640
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:35.930
O, that it were as like as it is true!

2641
02:01:35.930 --> 02:01:36.900
By heaven, fond wretch,

2642
02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:39.470
thou knowist not what thou speak'st,

2643
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:41.700
Or else thou art suborn'd in hateful practise

2644
02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:43.570
against his honour.

2645
02:01:43.570 --> 02:01:48.030
First, his integrity stands without question.

2646
02:01:48.030 --> 02:01:49.200
Next, it imports no reason

2647
02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.830
That with such vehemency he should pursue

2648
02:01:50.830 --> 02:01:53.030
Faults proper to himself:

2649
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:54.830
if he had so offended,

2650
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:56.700
He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself

2651
02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.330
And not have cut him off.

2652
02:01:59.330 --> 02:02:02.100
Some one hath set you on:

2653
02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:04.530
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice

2654
02:02:04.530 --> 02:02:08.130
Thou camest here to complain.

2655
02:02:08.130 --> 02:02:11.630
And is this all?

2656
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:13.300
Then, O you blessed ministers above,

2657
02:02:13.300 --> 02:02:15.770
Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time

2658
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:17.770
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up

2659
02:02:17.770 --> 02:02:23.570
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,

2660
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:26.400
As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

2661
02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:28.100
I know you'ld fain be gone.

2662
02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:29.870
An officer! To prison with her!

2663
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:30.700
Shall we thus permit

2664
02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:32.070
A blasting and a scandalous breath

2665
02:02:32.070 --> 02:02:34.170
to fall on him so near us?

2666
02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:36.530
This needs must be a practise.

2667
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:38.300
Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

2668
02:02:38.300 --> 02:02:41.870
One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

2669
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:43.730
A ghostly father, belike.

2670
02:02:43.730 --> 02:02:45.130
Who knows that Lodowick?

2671
02:02:45.130 --> 02:02:48.770
My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;

2672
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:50.170
I do not like the man:

2673
02:02:50.170 --> 02:02:51.330
had he been lay, my lord

2674
02:02:51.330 --> 02:02:53.130
For certain words he spake against your grace

2675
02:02:53.130 --> 02:02:55.670
In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

2676
02:02:55.670 --> 02:02:59.870
Words against me? a good friar, belike!

2677
02:02:59.870 --> 02:03:01.570
And to set on this wretched woman here

2678
02:03:01.570 --> 02:03:04.830
Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

2679
02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:06.500
My lord. but yesternight, she and that friar,

2680
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:08.600
I saw them at the prison:

2681
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.670
a saucy friar, a very scurvy fellow.

2682
02:03:11.670 --> 02:03:13.670
Blessed be your royal grace!

2683
02:03:13.670 --> 02:03:15.270
I have stood by, my lord,

2684
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:17.500
and I have heard your royal ear abused.

2685
02:03:17.500 --> 02:03:18.600
First, hath this woman

2686
02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:20.370
Most wrongfully accused your substitute,

2687
02:03:20.370 --> 02:03:22.770
Who is as free from touch or soil with her

2688
02:03:22.770 --> 02:03:24.670
As she from one ungot.

2689
02:03:24.670 --> 02:03:27.330
We did believe no less.

2690
02:03:27.330 --> 02:03:28.900
Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

2691
02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:31.730
I know him for a man divine and holy;

2692
02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:34.100
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,

2693
02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:36.170
As he's reported by this gentleman;

2694
02:03:36.170 --> 02:03:38.430
And, on my trust, a man that never yet

2695
02:03:38.430 --> 02:03:41.000
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

2696
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.300
My lord, most villanously; believe it.

2697
02:03:43.300 --> 02:03:45.400
Well, he in time may come to clear himself;

2698
02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.370
But at this instant he is sick my lord,

2699
02:03:47.370 --> 02:03:51.270
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,

2700
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:52.430
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint

2701
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:54.830
Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,

2702
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:57.370
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know

2703
02:03:57.370 --> 02:03:59.270
Is true and false;

2704
02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:00.370
and what he with his oath

2705
02:04:00.370 --> 02:04:02.730
And all probation will make up full clear,

2706
02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:05.670
Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.

2707
02:04:05.670 --> 02:04:07.800
To justify this worthy nobleman,

2708
02:04:07.800 --> 02:04:10.630
So vulgarly and personally accused,

2709
02:04:10.630 --> 02:04:13.800
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,

2710
02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:16.130
Till she herself confess it.

2711
02:04:16.130 --> 02:04:19.230
Good friar, let's hear it.

2712
02:04:19.230 --> 02:04:24.330
Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?

2713
02:04:24.330 --> 02:04:26.500
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!

2714
02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.370
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;

2715
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:29.930
In this I'll be impartial;

2716
02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:34.670
you be judge of your own cause.

2717
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:41.600
Is this the witness, friar?

2718
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:49.700
First, let her show her face, and after speak.

2719
02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:51.900
Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face

2720
02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:54.470
Until my husband bid me.

2721
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:55.670
What, are you married?

2722
02:04:55.670 --> 02:04:56.900
No, my lord.

2723
02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.030
Are you a maid?

2724
02:04:58.030 --> 02:04:58.730
No, my lord.

2725
02:04:58.730 --> 02:04:59.970
A widow, then?

2726
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:01.370
Neither, my lord.

2727
02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:02.200
Why, you are nothing then:

2728
02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:04.570
neither maid, widow, nor wife?

2729
02:05:04.570 --> 02:05:07.800
My lord, she may be a punk;

2730
02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:08.900
for many of them

2731
02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:12.070
are neither maid, widow, nor wife.

2732
02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:13.130
Silence that fellow:

2733
02:05:13.130 --> 02:05:14.400
I would he had some cause

2734
02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:15.500
To prattle for himself.

2735
02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:16.770
Well, my lord.

2736
02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:20.100
My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;

2737
02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:23.070
And I confess besides I am no maid:

2738
02:05:23.070 --> 02:05:25.470
I have known my husband; yet my husband

2739
02:05:25.470 --> 02:05:28.830
Knows not that ever he knew me.

2740
02:05:29.100 --> 02:05:31.600
He was drunk then, my lord:

2741
02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:33.000
it can be no better.

2742
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.430
For the benefit of silence,

2743
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:37.600
would thou wert so too!

2744
02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:38.730
Well, my lord.

2745
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:40.030
This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

2746
02:05:40.030 --> 02:05:42.400
Now I come to't my lord

2747
02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.600
She that accuses him of fornication,

2748
02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:48.170
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,

2749
02:05:48.170 --> 02:05:49.500
And charges him my lord,

2750
02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:50.870
with such a time

2751
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:53.330
When I'll depose I had him in mine arms

2752
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:56.530
With all the effect of love.

2753
02:05:56.530 --> 02:05:58.170
Charges she more than me?

2754
02:05:58.170 --> 02:06:00.130
Not that I know.

2755
02:06:00.130 --> 02:06:01.330
No? you say your husband.

2756
02:06:01.330 --> 02:06:05.470
Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,

2757
02:06:05.470 --> 02:06:08.300
Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,

2758
02:06:08.300 --> 02:06:14.300
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

2759
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:18.500
This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

2760
02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:23.970
My husband bids me; now I will unmask.

2761
02:06:24.830 --> 02:06:28.500
This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,

2762
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:31.870
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;

2763
02:06:31.870 --> 02:06:33.930
This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,

2764
02:06:33.930 --> 02:06:36.700
Was fast belock'd in thine;

2765
02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:37.800
this is the body

2766
02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:40.470
That took away the match from Isabel,

2767
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:42.170
And did supply thee at thy garden-house

2768
02:06:42.170 --> 02:06:45.430
In her imagined person.

2769
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:47.270
Know you this woman?

2770
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:49.030
Carnally, she says.

2771
02:06:49.030 --> 02:06:50.470
Sirrah, no more!

2772
02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:52.270
Enough, my lord.

2773
02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:55.970
My lord, I must confess I know this woman:

2774
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:57.230
And five years since there was

2775
02:06:57.230 --> 02:06:58.670
some speech of marriage

2776
02:06:58.670 --> 02:07:01.300
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,

2777
02:07:01.300 --> 02:07:02.600
Partly for that her promised proportions

2778
02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.270
Came short of composition, but in chief

2779
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:09.070
For that her reputation was disvalued

2780
02:07:09.070 --> 02:07:12.900
In levity: since which time of five years

2781
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.730
I never spake with her, saw her,

2782
02:07:14.730 --> 02:07:15.500
nor heard from her,

2783
02:07:15.500 --> 02:07:16.800
Upon my faith and honour.

2784
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:18.470
Noble prince,

2785
02:07:18.470 --> 02:07:20.370
As there comes light from heaven

2786
02:07:20.370 --> 02:07:22.170
and words from breath,

2787
02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:26.170
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,

2788
02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:28.670
I am affianced this man's wife as strongly

2789
02:07:28.670 --> 02:07:31.670
As words could make up vows:

2790
02:07:31.670 --> 02:07:33.370
and, my good lord,

2791
02:07:33.370 --> 02:07:37.030
But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house

2792
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:39.730
He knew me as a wife.

2793
02:07:39.730 --> 02:07:40.730
As this is true,

2794
02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:43.670
Let me in safety raise me from my knees

2795
02:07:43.670 --> 02:07:46.330
Or else for ever be confixed here,

2796
02:07:46.330 --> 02:07:49.770
A marble monument!

2797
02:07:49.770 --> 02:07:53.170
I did but smile till now:

2798
02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:57.700
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice

2799
02:07:57.700 --> 02:07:59.870
My patience here is touch'd.

2800
02:07:59.870 --> 02:08:00.830
I do perceive

2801
02:08:00.830 --> 02:08:02.270
These poor informal women are no more

2802
02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:03.900
But instruments of some more mightier member

2803
02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:06.470
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,

2804
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:08.030
To find this practise out.

2805
02:08:08.030 --> 02:08:09.970
Ay, with my heart

2806
02:08:09.970 --> 02:08:12.300
And punish them to your height of pleasure.

2807
02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:14.200
Thou foolish friar,

2808
02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:15.600
and thou pernicious woman,

2809
02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:17.600
Compact with her that's gone,

2810
02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:19.270
think'st thou thy oaths,

2811
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:21.870
Though they would swear down each particular saint,

2812
02:08:21.870 --> 02:08:24.070
Were testimonies against his worth and credit

2813
02:08:24.070 --> 02:08:28.000
That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,

2814
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.070
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains

2815
02:08:30.070 --> 02:08:33.730
To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.

2816
02:08:33.730 --> 02:08:34.970
There is another friar that set them on;

2817
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:36.030
Let him be sent for.

2818
02:08:36.030 --> 02:08:37.730
Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed

2819
02:08:37.730 --> 02:08:39.230
Hath set the women on to this complaint:

2820
02:08:39.230 --> 02:08:42.200
Your provost knows the place where he abides

2821
02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:43.900
And he may fetch him.

2822
02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:45.400
Go do it instantly.

2823
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.030
And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,

2824
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:49.300
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,

2825
02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:51.400
Do with your injuries as seems you best,

2826
02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:54.270
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;

2827
02:08:54.270 --> 02:08:57.730
But stir not you till you have well determined

2828
02:08:57.730 --> 02:09:00.470
Upon these slanderers.

2829
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:03.200
My lord, we'll do it throughly.

2830
02:09:03.730 --> 02:09:12.430
(applause)

2831
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:15.600
Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that

2832
02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:18.170
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

2833
02:09:18.170 --> 02:09:21.370
'Cucullus non facit monachum:'

2834
02:09:21.370 --> 02:09:23.900
honest in nothing but in his clothes;

2835
02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:24.870
and one that hath spoke

2836
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:26.900
most villanous speeches of the duke.

2837
02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:28.470
We shall entreat you to abide here

2838
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:31.930
till he come and enforce them against him:

2839
02:09:31.930 --> 02:09:33.770
we shall find this friar a notable fellow.

2840
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:36.270
As any in Vienna, on my word.

2841
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:38.130
Call that same Isabel here once again;

2842
02:09:38.130 --> 02:09:40.500
I would speak with her.

2843
02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:44.430
Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question;

2844
02:09:44.430 --> 02:09:45.870
you shall see how I'll handle her.

2845
02:09:45.870 --> 02:09:48.130
Not better than he, by her own report.

2846
02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:49.300
Say you?

2847
02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:51.770
Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,

2848
02:09:51.770 --> 02:09:54.430
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,

2849
02:09:54.430 --> 02:09:55.300
she'll be ashamed.

2850
02:09:55.300 --> 02:09:57.270
I will go darkly to work with her.

2851
02:09:57.270 --> 02:10:03.770
That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

2852
02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:06.130
Come on, mistress:

2853
02:10:06.130 --> 02:10:08.770
here's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said.

2854
02:10:08.770 --> 02:10:10.570
My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of;

2855
02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:12.170
here with the provost.

2856
02:10:12.170 --> 02:10:13.570
In very good time:

2857
02:10:13.570 --> 02:10:15.230
speak not you to him till we call upon you.

2858
02:10:15.230 --> 02:10:17.630
Mum.

2859
02:10:17.630 --> 02:10:19.570
Come, sir: did you set these women on

2860
02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:21.700
to slander Lord Angelo?

2861
02:10:21.700 --> 02:10:23.030
they have confessed you did.

2862
02:10:23.030 --> 02:10:24.730
'Tis false.

2863
02:10:24.730 --> 02:10:26.030
How! know you where you are?

2864
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:28.270
Respect to your great place!

2865
02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:29.300
and let the devil

2866
02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:30.900
Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!

2867
02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:32.600
Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

2868
02:10:32.600 --> 02:10:35.870
The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:

2869
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:38.730
Look you speak justly.

2870
02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:41.300
Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,

2871
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:43.670
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?

2872
02:10:43.670 --> 02:10:47.500
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?

2873
02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:51.230
Then is your cause gone too.

2874
02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:52.400
The duke's unjust,

2875
02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.630
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,

2876
02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:57.170
And put your trial in the villain's mouth

2877
02:10:57.170 --> 02:11:00.500
Which here you come to accuse.

2878
02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.830
This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

2879
02:11:02.830 --> 02:11:04.800
Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,

2880
02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:06.900
Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women

2881
02:11:06.900 --> 02:11:08.700
To accuse this worthy man,

2882
02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:10.530
but, in foul mouth

2883
02:11:10.530 --> 02:11:12.100
And in the witness of his proper ear,

2884
02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:14.500
To call him villain?

2885
02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.830
and then to glance from him to the duke himself,

2886
02:11:16.830 --> 02:11:18.900
to tax him with injustice?

2887
02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:21.500
Take him hence; to the rack with him!

2888
02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.630
We'll touse you joint by joint,

2889
02:11:23.630 --> 02:11:27.470
but we will know his purpose. What 'unjust'!

2890
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:29.930
Be not so hot; the duke

2891
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:32.330
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he

2892
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:36.730
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,

2893
02:11:36.730 --> 02:11:39.230
Nor here provincial.

2894
02:11:39.230 --> 02:11:40.330
My business in this state

2895
02:11:40.330 --> 02:11:43.330
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,

2896
02:11:43.330 --> 02:11:45.570
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble

2897
02:11:45.570 --> 02:11:48.730
Till it o'er-run the stew;

2898
02:11:48.730 --> 02:11:52.270
laws for all faults,

2899
02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:54.600
But faults so countenanced,

2900
02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:56.070
that the strong statutes

2901
02:11:56.070 --> 02:11:58.570
Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,

2902
02:11:58.570 --> 02:12:00.230
As much in mock as mark.

2903
02:12:00.230 --> 02:12:04.400
Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

2904
02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.700
What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?

2905
02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:08.070
Is this the man that you did tell us of?

2906
02:12:08.070 --> 02:12:10.230
'Tis he, my lord.

2907
02:12:10.230 --> 02:12:14.700
Come hither, goodman baldpate:

2908
02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:16.100
do you know me?

2909
02:12:16.100 --> 02:12:17.500
I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice:

2910
02:12:17.500 --> 02:12:18.430
I met you at the prison,

2911
02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:19.830
in the absence of the duke.

2912
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:21.370
O, did you so?

2913
02:12:21.370 --> 02:12:23.630
And do you remember what you said of the duke?

2914
02:12:23.630 --> 02:12:25.430
Most notedly, sir.

2915
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:29.130
Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger,

2916
02:12:29.130 --> 02:12:31.100
a fool, and a coward,

2917
02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:32.930
as you then reported him to be?

2918
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:35.070
You must, sir, change persons with me,

2919
02:12:35.070 --> 02:12:37.400
ere you make that my report:

2920
02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.030
for you sir, indeed, spoke of him;

2921
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:41.600
and much more, much worse.

2922
02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:42.730
O thou damnable fellow!

2923
02:12:42.730 --> 02:12:46.370
Did not I tweak thee by the nose for thy speeches?

2924
02:12:46.370 --> 02:12:49.470
I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

2925
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:51.100
Hark, how the villain would close now,

2926
02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:53.070
after his treasonable abuses!

2927
02:12:53.070 --> 02:12:55.270
Such a fellow is not to be talked withal.

2928
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:58.100
Away with him to prison!

2929
02:12:58.100 --> 02:13:00.730
Where is the provost? Away with him to prison!

2930
02:13:00.730 --> 02:13:03.400
lay bolts enough upon him:

2931
02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:04.830
let him speak no more.

2932
02:13:04.830 --> 02:13:06.700
Away with those giglots too,

2933
02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:09.200
and with the other confederate companion!

2934
02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:11.030
Stay, sir; stay awhile.

2935
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:13.170
What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

2936
02:13:13.170 --> 02:13:16.700
Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir!

2937
02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:20.400
Why, you bald-pated, lying rascal,

2938
02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:23.570
you must be hooded, must you?

2939
02:13:23.570 --> 02:13:26.630
Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!

2940
02:13:26.630 --> 02:13:30.470
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!

2941
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:35.070
Will't not off?

2942
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Thou art the first knave

2943
02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.200
that e'er madest a duke.

2944
02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.300
First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.

2945
02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:50.930
Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you

2946
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:53.700
Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

2947
02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:56.600
This may prove worse than hanging.

2948
02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:58.470
What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:

2949
02:13:58.470 --> 02:14:02.700
We'll borrow place of him.

2950
02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:12.670
Sir, by your leave.

2951
02:14:12.670 --> 02:14:15.300
Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,

2952
02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:17.700
That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,

2953
02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:20.530
Rely upon it till my tale be told,

2954
02:14:20.530 --> 02:14:23.370
And hold no longer out.

2955
02:14:23.370 --> 02:14:25.270
O my dread lord,

2956
02:14:25.270 --> 02:14:27.230
I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,

2957
02:14:27.230 --> 02:14:28.600
To think I can be undiscernible,

2958
02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:30.800
When I perceive your grace, like power divine,

2959
02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:37.470
Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,

2960
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:38.730
No longer session hold upon my shame,

2961
02:14:38.730 --> 02:14:41.030
But let my trial be mine own confession:

2962
02:14:41.030 --> 02:14:43.500
Immediate sentence then and sequent death

2963
02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:45.900
Is all the grace I beg.

2964
02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:52.270
Come hither, Mariana.

2965
02:14:52.270 --> 02:14:56.530
Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

2966
02:14:56.530 --> 02:14:58.630
I was, my lord.

2967
02:14:58.630 --> 02:15:01.270
Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.

2968
02:15:01.270 --> 02:15:03.400
Do you the office, friar; which consummate,

2969
02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:06.400
Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

2970
02:15:17.530 --> 02:15:20.300
My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour

2971
02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:23.070
Than at the strangeness of it.

2972
02:15:23.070 --> 02:15:25.830
Come hither, Isabel.

2973
02:15:32.530 --> 02:15:34.900
Your friar is now your prince: as I was then

2974
02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:37.230
Advertising and holy to your business,

2975
02:15:37.230 --> 02:15:38.770
Not changing heart with habit, I am still

2976
02:15:38.770 --> 02:15:41.100
Attorney'd at your service.

2977
02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:42.230
O, give me pardon,

2978
02:15:42.230 --> 02:15:44.200
That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd

2979
02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:45.930
Your unknown sovereignty!

2980
02:15:45.930 --> 02:15:47.870
You are pardon'd, Isabel:

2981
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:50.700
And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.

2982
02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:53.670
Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;

2983
02:15:53.670 --> 02:15:56.530
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,

2984
02:15:56.530 --> 02:15:59.200
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather

2985
02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:01.500
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power

2986
02:16:01.500 --> 02:16:04.670
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,

2987
02:16:04.670 --> 02:16:08.200
It was the swift celerity of his death,

2988
02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:10.070
Which I did think with slower foot came on,

2989
02:16:10.070 --> 02:16:13.870
That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!

2990
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:16.230
That life is better life, past fearing death,

2991
02:16:16.230 --> 02:16:18.900
Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,

2992
02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:20.670
So happy is your brother.

2993
02:16:20.670 --> 02:16:22.400
I do, my lord.

2994
02:16:24.670 --> 02:16:27.270
For this new-married man approaching here,

2995
02:16:27.270 --> 02:16:29.400
Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd

2996
02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:32.330
Your well defended honour, you must pardon

2997
02:16:32.330 --> 02:16:36.870
For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother

2998
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:38.830
Being criminal, in double violation

2999
02:16:38.830 --> 02:16:42.430
Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach

3000
02:16:42.430 --> 02:16:44.370
Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,

3001
02:16:44.370 --> 02:16:47.070
The very mercy of the law cries out

3002
02:16:47.070 --> 02:16:50.430
Most audible, even from his proper tongue,

3003
02:16:50.430 --> 02:16:54.630
'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'

3004
02:16:54.630 --> 02:16:56.200
Haste still pays haste,

3005
02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:58.230
and leisure answers leisure;

3006
02:16:58.230 --> 02:17:03.070
Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.

3007
02:17:03.070 --> 02:17:05.200
Thus, Angelo, your fault's thus manifested;

3008
02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:06.770
Which, though thou wouldst deny,

3009
02:17:06.770 --> 02:17:09.000
denies thee vantage.

3010
02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.930
We do condemn thee to the very block

3011
02:17:10.930 --> 02:17:14.200
Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.

3012
02:17:14.200 --> 02:17:15.130
Away with him!

3013
02:17:15.130 --> 02:17:16.200
O my most gracious lord,

3014
02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:18.230
I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

3015
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:20.400
It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.

3016
02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:22.500
Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,

3017
02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:25.330
I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,

3018
02:17:25.330 --> 02:17:26.870
For that he knew you, might reproach your life

3019
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:29.030
And choke your good to come;

3020
02:17:29.030 --> 02:17:30.000
for his possessions,

3021
02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.830
Although by confiscation they are ours,

3022
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:33.530
We do instate and widow you withal,

3023
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:34.830
To buy you a better husband.

3024
02:17:34.830 --> 02:17:36.270
O my dear lord,

3025
02:17:36.270 --> 02:17:38.370
I crave no other, nor no better man.

3026
02:17:38.370 --> 02:17:40.200
Never crave him; we are definitive.

3027
02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:41.130
Gentle my liege,--

3028
02:17:41.130 --> 02:17:41.800
You do but lose your labour.

3029
02:17:41.800 --> 02:17:42.930
Away with him to death!

3030
02:17:42.930 --> 02:17:44.700
Now, sir, to you.

3031
02:17:44.700 --> 02:17:49.400
O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;

3032
02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:51.400
Lend me your knees, and all my life to come

3033
02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:54.870
I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

3034
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:57.830
Against all sense you do importune her:

3035
02:17:57.830 --> 02:18:00.200
Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,

3036
02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.030
Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,

3037
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:04.100
And take her hence in horror.

3038
02:18:04.100 --> 02:18:06.100
Isabel,

3039
02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:10.800
Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;

3040
02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:15.230
Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.

3041
02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:21.170
They say, best men are moulded out of faults;

3042
02:18:21.170 --> 02:18:23.430
And, for the most, become much more the better

3043
02:18:23.430 --> 02:18:30.300
For being a little bad: so may my husband.

3044
02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:36.500
O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

3045
02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:38.300
He dies for Claudio's death.

3046
02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:42.170
Most bounteous sir,

3047
02:18:42.170 --> 02:18:44.930
Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,

3048
02:18:44.930 --> 02:18:48.430
As if my brother lived:

3049
02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:49.300
I partly think

3050
02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:50.830
A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,

3051
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:53.270
Till he did look on me:

3052
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:57.100
since it is so, let him not die.

3053
02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:58.870
My brother had but justice,

3054
02:18:58.870 --> 02:19:01.870
In that he did the thing for which he died:

3055
02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:02.770
For Angelo,

3056
02:19:02.770 --> 02:19:05.800
His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,

3057
02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:07.570
And must be buried but as an intent

3058
02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:14.200
That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;

3059
02:19:14.200 --> 02:19:16.670
Intents but merely thoughts.

3060
02:19:16.670 --> 02:19:18.600
Merely, my lord.

3061
02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:22.230
Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.

3062
02:19:29.170 --> 02:19:30.670
I have bethought me of another fault.

3063
02:19:30.670 --> 02:19:35.800
Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded

3064
02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:37.430
At an unusual hour?

3065
02:19:37.430 --> 02:19:38.830
It was commanded so.

3066
02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:40.330
Had you a special warrant for the deed?

3067
02:19:40.330 --> 02:19:43.030
No, my good lord; it was by private message.

3068
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:44.930
For which I do discharge you of your office:

3069
02:19:44.930 --> 02:19:47.070
Give up your keys.

3070
02:19:49.330 --> 02:19:50.900
Pardon me, noble lord:

3071
02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:54.170
I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;

3072
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:56.770
Yet did repent me, after more advice;

3073
02:19:56.770 --> 02:19:59.770
For testimony whereof, one in the prison,

3074
02:19:59.770 --> 02:20:01.430
That should by private order else have died,

3075
02:20:01.430 --> 02:20:03.230
I have reserved alive.

3076
02:20:03.230 --> 02:20:04.530
What's he?

3077
02:20:04.530 --> 02:20:06.100
His name is Barnardine.

3078
02:20:06.100 --> 02:20:09.270
I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.

3079
02:20:09.270 --> 02:20:12.430
Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

3080
02:20:16.170 --> 02:20:18.830
I am sorry, one so learned and so wise

3081
02:20:18.830 --> 02:20:21.430
As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,

3082
02:20:21.430 --> 02:20:23.970
Should slip so grossly,

3083
02:20:23.970 --> 02:20:24.970
both in the heat of blood.

3084
02:20:24.970 --> 02:20:27.700
And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

3085
02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:30.900
I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:

3086
02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:33.170
And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart

3087
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:36.930
That I crave death more willingly than mercy;

3088
02:20:36.930 --> 02:20:40.400
'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

3089
02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:48.730
Which is that Barnardine?

3090
02:20:48.730 --> 02:20:52.200
This, my lord.

3091
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:54.900
There was a friar told me of this man.

3092
02:20:54.900 --> 02:20:57.100
Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.

3093
02:20:57.100 --> 02:20:59.470
That apprehends no further than this world,

3094
02:20:59.470 --> 02:21:01.370
And squarest thy life according.

3095
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:02.870
Thou'rt condemn'd:

3096
02:21:02.870 --> 02:21:05.800
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;

3097
02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:07.430
And pray thee take this mercy to provide

3098
02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:10.230
For better times to come. Advise him, ,Friar;

3099
02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:12.500
I leave him to your hand.

3100
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:15.170
What muffled fellow's that?

3101
02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:16.970
This is another prisoner that I saved.

3102
02:21:16.970 --> 02:21:19.670
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;

3103
02:21:19.670 --> 02:21:23.330
As like almost to Claudio as himself.

3104
02:21:28.570 --> 02:21:30.500
If he be like your brother, for his sake

3105
02:21:30.500 --> 02:21:35.200
Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,

3106
02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:37.630
Give me your hand and say you will be mine.

3107
02:21:37.630 --> 02:21:43.300
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.

3108
02:21:43.300 --> 02:21:44.900
By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;

3109
02:21:44.900 --> 02:21:47.730
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.

3110
02:21:47.730 --> 02:21:51.170
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:

3111
02:21:51.170 --> 02:21:52.600
Look that you love your wife;

3112
02:21:52.600 --> 02:21:55.630
her worth worth yours.

3113
02:21:55.630 --> 02:21:58.800
I find an apt remission in myself;

3114
02:21:58.800 --> 02:22:01.970
And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.

3115
02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:07.800
You, sirrah, that knew me for an ass, a fool,

3116
02:22:07.800 --> 02:22:10.470
One all of luxury, a coward;

3117
02:22:10.470 --> 02:22:13.070
Wherein have I so deserved of you,

3118
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:14.670
That you extol me so?

3119
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:15.530
'Faith, my lord.

3120
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:17.900
I spoke it but according to the trick.

3121
02:22:17.900 --> 02:22:18.970
If you will hang me for it, you may;

3122
02:22:18.970 --> 02:22:21.170
but I had rather it would please you

3123
02:22:21.170 --> 02:22:23.570
I might be whipt.

3124
02:22:23.570 --> 02:22:25.600
Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.

3125
02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:27.830
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.

3126
02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:30.830
Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,

3127
02:22:30.830 --> 02:22:32.830
As I have heard him swear himself there's one

3128
02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:35.300
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,

3129
02:22:35.300 --> 02:22:37.470
And he shall marry her instantly:

3130
02:22:37.470 --> 02:22:38.470
the nuptial finish'd,

3131
02:22:38.470 --> 02:22:40.530
Let him be whipt and hang'd.

3132
02:22:40.530 --> 02:22:41.930
I beseech your highness,

3133
02:22:41.930 --> 02:22:44.070
do not marry me to a whore.

3134
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:47.430
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:

3135
02:22:47.430 --> 02:22:48.400
good my lord,

3136
02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:50.970
do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

3137
02:22:50.970 --> 02:22:53.930
Upon mine honesty, thou shalt marry her.

3138
02:22:53.930 --> 02:22:56.070
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal

3139
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:59.100
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;

3140
02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:01.270
And see our pleasure herein executed.

3141
02:23:01.270 --> 02:23:03.270
Marrying a punk, my lord,

3142
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:05.430
is pressing to death, whipping, and hanging.

3143
02:23:05.430 --> 02:23:09.630
Slandering a prince deserves it.

3144
02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:22.100
She that you wrong'd, Claudio, look you restore.

3145
02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:26.100
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:

3146
02:23:26.100 --> 02:23:28.870
I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.

3147
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:31.130
Much thanks, good friend Escalus,

3148
02:23:31.130 --> 02:23:32.270
for thy much goodness:

3149
02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:35.600
There's more behind that is more gratulate.

3150
02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:39.000
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:

3151
02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.830
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.

3152
02:23:40.830 --> 02:23:42.500
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home

3153
02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:44.470
The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:

3154
02:23:44.470 --> 02:23:47.630
The offence pardons itself.

3155
02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:51.300
Dear Isabel,

3156
02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:53.770
I have a motion much imports your good;

3157
02:23:53.770 --> 02:23:56.370
Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,

3158
02:23:56.370 --> 02:24:02.030
What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.

3159
02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:15.670
So, bring us to our chamber where we'll show

3160
02:24:15.670 --> 02:24:19.870
What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

3161
02:24:20.270 --> 02:24:24.430
(♪applause, cheering and music)

3162
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:39.230


3163
02:25:41.070 --> 02:25:44.070
