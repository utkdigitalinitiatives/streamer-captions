FINANCIAL SEEDS PROVED TO BE

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:35.830
THE ITALIAN CITY-STATES.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.060
FIBONACCI'S HOMETOWN
OF PISA WAS ONE,

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.630
BUT IT WAS, ABOVE
ALL, VENICE--

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:44.260
MORE EXPOSED THAN ANY OF THE
OTHERS TO ORIENTAL INFLUENCES--

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:51.800
THAT BECAME THE GREAT
MONEY-LENDING LABORATORY...

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.500
AND THE HOME OF LITERATURE'S
MOST NOTORIOUS MONEYLENDER,

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:04.700
SHYLOCK, IN WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE'S THE
MERCHANT OF VENICE.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.830
MAY YOU STEAD ME?
WILL YOU PLEASURE ME?

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.800
SHALL I KNOW YOUR ANSWER?

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.560
CRUCIALLY, SHYLOCK'S ONLY
PREPARED TO LEND THE MONEY

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.000
IF BASSANIO'S FRIEND,
THE MERCHANT ANTONIO,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.860
IS PROVIDING THE SECURITY.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.700
3,000 DUCATS FOR 3
MONTHS AND ANTONIO BOUND.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.130
YOUR ANSWER TO THAT.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.000
ANTONIO IS A GOOD MAN.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.330
BY GOOD, SHYLOCK
DOESN'T MEAN VIRTUOUS.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.900
HE MEANS GOOD FOR THE MONEY
HE'S ABOUT TO LEND BASSANIO.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.330
IN OTHER WORDS, CREDITWORTHY.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.200
HAVE YOU HEARD ANY
IMPUTATION TO THE CONTRARY?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.000
HA HA. HO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.560
MY REASON IN SAYING
THAT HE'S A GOOD MAN IS

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.500
TO HAVE YOU UNDERSTAND ME

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.600
THAT HE IS SUFFICIENT.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.630
3,000 DUCATS.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:06.860
I THINK I MAY TAKE HIS BOND.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.260
Ferguson: WITH ANY LOAN,
THINGS CAN GO WRONG,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.760
AND THAT IS PRECISELY
WHY ANYONE WHO LENDS
MONEY TO A MERCHANT,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.960
IF ONLY FOR THE DURATION
OF AN OCEAN VOYAGE,
NEEDS TO BE COMPENSATED.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.930
WE USUALLY CALL THE
COMPENSATION INTEREST--

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:30.800
THE AMOUNT PAID TO THE
LENDER OVER AND ABOVE THE
SUM LENT, OR PRINCIPAL.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.500
OVERSEAS TRADE OF THE
SORT VENICE DEPENDED ON

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.500
COULDN'T OPERATE WITHOUT
SUCH TRANSACTIONS.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.230
AND THEY REMAIN THE FOUNDATION
OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:49.300
TO THIS DAY.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.500
BUT WHY DOES SHYLOCK TURN
OUT TO BE SUCH A VILLAIN,

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.430
DEMANDING LITERALLY
A POUND OF FLESH--

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:58.430
IN EFFECT ANTONIO'S DEATH--

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.460
IF HE CAN'T FULFILL
HIS OBLIGATIONS?

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.930
WHY IS SHAKESPEARE'S
MONEYLENDER SO HEARTLESS,

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.900
THE ORIGINAL OF THAT
BLOODSUCKING FINANCIER

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:18.130
WHO RECURS TIME AND AGAIN
IN WESTERN LITERATURE?

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.930
ONE CLUE IS THAT
SHYLOCK IS A JEW,

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.300
AND JEWS WERE AMONG HISTORY'S
EARLIEST MONEYLENDERS.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.030
JEWS WHO STAYED IN VENICE
FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.400
WERE SUPPOSED TO WEAR A
YELLOW O ON THEIR BACKS

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.500
OR A YELLOW HAT,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.400
AND THEY WERE CONFINED
TO A SPECIAL AREA,

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.200
WHICH BECAME KNOWN
AS THE GHETTO NUOVO.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.000
THIS IS THE ENTRANCE TO THE
JEWISH GHETTO IN VENICE,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.230
WHERE JEWS WERE OBLIGED TO LIVE
AND INDEED CONFINED AT NIGHT.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.960
JEWS WERE TOLERATED IN
VENICE BUT FOR A REASON.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.730
THE KEY WAS THAT JEWS
COULD PROVIDE A SERVICE

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.800
THAT CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS
WERE FORBIDDEN TO DO.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.260
THEY COULD CHARGE
INTEREST ON THEIR LOANS.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.830
FIBONACCI MIGHT HAVE FIGURED
OUT THE MATHEMATICS OF LENDING,

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:10.430
BUT IT TOOK SHYLOCK
TO DO THE DEAL.

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.700
THIS IS WHERE THE VENETIAN
JEWS USED TO DO BUSINESS.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.100
THIS BUILDING HERE WAS
THE OLD BANCO ROSSO.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.060
AND IT WAS OUTSIDE HERE
THAT THEY USED TO SIT,

00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.430
BEHIND THEIR TABLES,
THEIR TAVOLE,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.830
ON THEIR BENCHES,
THEIR BANCHI--

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:26.260
THE ROOTS OF THE ITALIAN
WORD FOR BANKS.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:30.500
NOW, THERE WAS A GOOD
REASON WHY MERCHANTS CAME
HERE TO THE JEWISH GHETTO

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.660
TO BORROW MONEY.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.230
FOR CHRISTIANS, WHAT
THE JEWS WERE DOING--

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:42.060
LENDING MONEY AT
INTEREST-- WAS A SIN.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.530
THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH'S
LAWS AGAINST USURY--

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.330
CHARGING INTEREST ON LOANS--
WERE A MAJOR OBSTACLE

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.100
TO THE DEVELOPMENT
OF FINANCE IN EUROPE.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.560
AFTER ALL, WHAT
GOD-FEARING CHRISTIAN
MERCHANT WISHED TO RISK

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:57.600
THE TORMENTS OF HELL?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.630
THIS ASTONISHING VISION OF
ETERNAL DAMNATION WAS PAINTED

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.000
BY GIORGIO VASARI
AND FEDERICO ZUCCARI

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.360
ON THE INSIDE OF THE GREAT
DOME OF FLORENCE'S CATHEDRAL--

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.430
AND BELOW THERE'S ANOTHER
FRESCO BY DOMENICO DI MICHELINO

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.300
OF FLORENCE'S GREATEST
POET, DANTE ALIGHIERI,

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.630
HOLDING HIS MASTERWORK,
THE DIVINE COMEDY.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.830
ACCORDING TO DANTE, THERE
WAS A SPECIAL PART OF THE
SEVENTH CIRCLE OF HELL

00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:36.760
THAT WAS EXCLUSIVELY
SET ASIDE FOR USURERS.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.430
THERE THE MONEYLENDERS
WERE ETERNALLY TORTURED

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.500
WITH SCORCHING EARTH
AND FREEZING SNOW,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:48.700
THEIR NECKS WEIGHED DOWN
WITH BULGING PURSES.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.760
JEWS, TOO, WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO LEND AT INTEREST,

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.160
BUT THERE WAS A
CONVENIENT GET-OUT CLAUSE

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.200
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT BOOK OF
DEUTERONOMY, CHAPTER 23.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.400
YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO LEND
TO YOUR BROTHER AT INTEREST,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.200
BUT TO A STRANGER? WELL,
THAT WAS A DIFFERENT MATTER.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.800
IN OTHER WORDS, A JEW
COULDN'T LEND TO A JEW,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.600
BUT HE COULD LEND
TO A CHRISTIAN.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.730
THE PRICE THE JEWS PAID FOR
PERFORMING THIS SERVICE WAS
SOCIAL EXCLUSION.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:24.000
HENCE THE GHETTO, AND HENCE
THE CENTURIES-LONG ASSOCIATION

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.360
BETWEEN JEWS AND FINANCE--

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.200
ONE OF THE FEW FORMS
OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:34.500
FROM WHICH JEWS WERE
NOT ONCE EXCLUDED.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.400
IN THE END, OF COURSE,
SHYLOCK IS THWARTED,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.860
FOR ALTHOUGH THE COURT
RECOGNIZES HIS RIGHTS
TO A POUND OF FLESH,

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:45.530
THE LAW ALSO PROHIBITS HIM
FROM SHEDDING ANTONIO'S BLOOD.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.960
AND BECAUSE HE'S A JEW,
THE LAW ALSO REQUIRES

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.900
THE LOSS OF HIS GOODS AND LIFE

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.160
FOR SO MUCH AS PLOTTING
THE DEATH OF A CHRISTIAN.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.560
HE ONLY ESCAPES BY
SUBMITTING TO BAPTISM.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:05.400
IT TURNS OUT TO BE A RISKY
BUSINESS TO BE A MONEYLENDER.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.560
BUT IT WAS IN ANOTHER ITALIAN
CITY-STATE, FLORENCE,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:13.060
THAT THE KEY FINANCIAL SERVICE
OF PROVIDING CREDIT MOVED

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:16.160
OUT OF THE GHETTO AND AWAY
FROM THE GATES OF HELL

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.730
TO BECOME THE LEGITIMATE
PRESERVE OF BANKS.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:24.730
THIS TRANSITION WAS SYMBOLIZED
BY THE RISE OF ONE FAMILY--

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.700
THE MEDICI.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.630
WITH THEIR ASCENT,
CREDIT CAME OF AGE.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:34.960
MONEY-LENDING CEASED
TO BE DISREPUTABLE.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:42.760
IT BECAME GLORIOUS
AND THE FOUNDATION OF
A NEW KIND OF POWER.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:47.460
THE DAZZLING LEGACY
OF THE MEDICI FAMILY'S
PAST STILL SURROUNDS YOU

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:50.230
IN FLORENCE TODAY.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:55.960
IN THE SPACE OF 400 YEARS, TWO
MEDICI BECAME QUEENS OF FRANCE,

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.600
3 BECAME POPE.

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.000
APPROPRIATELY IT
WAS MACHIAVELLI,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.630
THE SUPREME THEORIST OF POWER,
WHO WROTE THEIR HISTORY.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.230
PERHAPS NO OTHER FAMILY LEFT
SUCH AN IMPRINT ON AN AGE

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.560
AS THE MEDICI LEFT
ON THE RENAISSANCE.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.330
YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT THEY
PAID FOR THE RENAISSANCE,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.160
THEIR PATRONAGE RUNNING
THE GAMUT OF GENIUS

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:27.130
FROM MICHELANGELO TO GALILEO.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:32.630
AND THIS IN THE UFFIZI
GALLERY IS THE MEDICIS'
PRIVATE ART COLLECTION--

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:43.700
ONE OF THE MOST
SPECTACULAR EVER ASSEMBLED.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.030
WHAT THE MILLIONS OF
TOURISTS WHO FLOCK HERE

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:52.360
GENERALLY FORGET TO ASK IS HOW
THE MEDICI PAID FOR ALL THIS.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.400
THE SIMPLE ANSWER IS THAT THEY
WERE FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALERS,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.500
MEMBERS OF THE ARTE DE CAMBIO--
THE MONEY CHANGERS' GUILD--

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.600
WHO MADE IT BIG.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.560
THEY WERE KNOWN AS
BANCHIERI OR TAVOLIERI

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.660
BECAUSE LIKE THE JEWS
OF VENICE, THEY LITERALLY
DID THEIR BUSINESS

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.100
SITTING ON BENCHES
BEHIND TABLES.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.730
INDEED, THE ORIGINAL
MEDICI BANK, OR BENCH,

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.800
WAS LOCATED RIGHT HERE, IN
THE VIA DELL'ARTE DELLA LANA,

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:26.130
WOOL GUILD STREET.

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:30.630
PRIOR TO THE 1390s, THE
MEDICI WERE FLORENCE'S ANSWER

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.730
TO THE SOPRANOS,

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:35.800
A SMALL-TIME CLAN NOTABLE
MORE FOR LOW VIOLENCE

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.360
THAN FOR HIGH FINANCE.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.300
IN A 17-YEAR PERIOD,
NO FEWER THAN 5 MEDICI
WERE SENTENCED TO DEATH

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:50.060
BY THE CRIMINAL COURTS
FOR CAPITAL CRIMES.

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.660
THEN CAME GIOVANNI
DI BICCI DE'MEDICI.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.100
IT WAS HIS AIM TO MAKE THE
MEDICI TOTALLY LEGITIMATE.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.630
PART OF THE SECRET
OF HIS SUCCESS WAS

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.830
AN INGENIOUS BIT OF
CREATIVE ACCOUNTING

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:11.660
THAT GOT THE MEDICI OFF THE
HOOK OF THE ANTI-USURY LAWS.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.360
THESE LEDGERS OF THE
MEDICI BANK MAKE IT CLEAR

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:19.400
HOW IMPORTANT COMMERCIAL BILLS
FOR FINANCING FOREIGN TRADE

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.030
TRUE, THE CHURCH
PROHIBITED THE COLLECTION
OF INTEREST ON LOANS,

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.860
BUT THERE WAS NOTHING
TO PREVENT A SHREWD
TRADER FROM MAKING MONEY

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:28.300
ON TRANSACTIONS LIKE THESE,

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:33.030
WHICH INVOLVED
MULTIPLE CURRENCIES.

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:35.330
THERE WAS NO INTEREST
AND THEREFORE NO SIN,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:44.830
SIMPLY A COMMISSION DEDUCTED
FOR THE CONVERSION OF
ONE CURRENCY INTO ANOTHER.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:49.460
IF MONEY WAS ADVANCED
TO A PARTICULAR TRADER
FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME,

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:55.900
THE COMMISSION WAS
THAT BIT LARGER.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.600
IN THE SAME WAY,
DEPOSITORS WHO PUT THEIR
MONEY IN THE MEDICI BANK

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.760
WERE GIVEN DISCREZIONE
TO COMPENSATE THEM

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.130
FOR RISKING THEIR MONEY.

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.560
THIS WAS CREDIT, IN
OTHER WORDS, BUT WITH
THE INTEREST PAYMENTS

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.930
DISCREETLY CONCEALED.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:22.330
NOW FOR THE FIRST
TIME, MONEY-LENDING HAD
EVOLVED INTO BANKING.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:25.230
THE REAL STORY OF THE
SUCCESS OF THE MEDICI BANK

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.630
CAN BE FOUND HERE IN
THE LIBRO SEGRETO,

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.130
THE SECRET BOOK OF
GIOVANNI DI BICCI DE'MEDICI.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.160
THE KEY WAS NOT SO MUCH
SIZE AS DIVERSIFICATION.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.760
EARLIER ITALIAN BANKS
HAD BEEN MONOLITHIC

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.860
AND VERY VULNERABLE TO DEFAULT
BY A SINGLE BAD BORROWER.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:43.260
BUT A MEDICI BANK WAS MADE UP

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.530
OF MULTIPLE INTERLOCKING
PARTNERSHIPS,

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.800
EACH IN SOME MEASURE
INDEPENDENT OF THE REST.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.660
IT WAS THIS DECENTRALIZATION
THAT WAS THE KEY

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.830
TO THEIR ASTONISHING PROFITS.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:00.800
UNDER GIOVANNI'S GUIDANCE, THE
MEDICI BANKING NETWORK EXTENDED

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.360
FROM FLORENCE TO VENICE TO ROME.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.060
THE SCALE AND DIVERSITY OF
THE MEDICIS' OPERATIONS WAS

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.460
THE KEY TO REDUCING THE
RISKS OF MONEY-LENDING,

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.930
AND THEREFORE, ALSO,
THE COSTS TO BORROWERS.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:19.230
THAT'S THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN LOAN SHARKS AND BANKS,

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:24.660
BETWEEN SHYLOCK AND THE MEDICI.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.000
AND HERE'S THE PROOF
THAT IT WORKED--

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.160
PAGE AFTER PAGE OF
GIOVANNI'S ASSETS,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.260
DECLARED FOR TAX PURPOSES,

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:38.460
AND CULMINATING IN A GRAND
TOTAL OF 91,089 FLORINS.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:46.800
IN THOSE DAYS, THAT
WAS SERIOUS MONEY.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.300
WHEN GIOVANNI DIED IN 1429,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.660
HIS LAST WORDS WERE AN
EXHORTATION TO HIS HEIRS

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.460
TO MAINTAIN HIS STANDARDS
OF FINANCIAL ACUMEN.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:25:02.000
HIS FUNERAL WAS ATTENDED BY
26 MEN OF THE NAME MEDICI,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.800
WHO HAD MADE THE BUSINESS
OF BANKING RESPECTABLE
AND PROFITABLE

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:12.760
AS IT HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.460
FOR HIS SON COSIMO, THE
ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:19.230
COMBINED SEAMLESSLY WITH
THE ACCUMULATION OF POWER.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:24.230
WITHIN 20 YEARS OF HIS FATHER'S
DEATH, COSIMO DE'MEDICI WAS

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.960
THE FLORENTINE STATE.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.600
AS THE POPE HIMSELF PUT IT,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.030
POLITICAL QUESTIONS ARE
SETTLED AT HIS HOUSE.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.130
THE MAN HE CHOOSES
HOLDS OFFICE.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:40.300
HE IT IS WHO DECIDES PEACE
AND WAR AND CONTROLS THE LAWS.

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.960
HE IS KING IN
EVERYTHING BUT NAME.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.660
THIS BOTTICELLI'S MAINLY
FAMOUS FOR THE BEAUTY
OF ITS YOUNG SUBJECT,

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.160
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY INTENDED AS
A TRIBUTE TO A DEAD BANKER--

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.430
COSIMO DE'MEDICI.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.030
THAT'S HIM THERE
ON THE MEDALLION,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:57.800
AND YOU CAN JUST MAKE
OUT THE INSCRIPTION,

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:07.430
PATER PATRIAE-- THE
FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.800
IN 150 YEARS, THE MEDICI
HAD TRANSFORMED THEMSELVES

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.600
FROM BACKSTREET MONEYLENDERS

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:22.330
TO THE MOST POWERFUL
FINANCIAL FORCE IN EUROPE.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:27.230
NOTHING COULD BETTER
ILLUSTRATE THE EXTRAORDINARY
ASCENT OF MONEY,

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.700
FOR WHAT THE MEDICI HAD
ACHIEVED WAS NOTHING LESS

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.800
THAN THE BIRTH OF
MODERN BANKING.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.860
OTHERS HAD TRIED BEFORE,
BUT THE MEDICI WERE

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:39.930
THE FIRST BANKERS TO HIT
THE POLITICAL BIG TIME.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:43.230
AND THEY DID IT BY LEARNING
ONE CRUCIAL LESSON.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.530
IN FINANCE, SMALL
IS SELDOM BEAUTIFUL.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.300
BY MAKING THEIR BANK BIGGER
AND MORE DIVERSIFIED,

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.360
THE MEDICI HAD FOUND A WAY
OF SPREADING THEIR RISKS.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.160
AND BY FOCUSING ON
CURRENCY TRADING

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.330
RATHER THAN JUST LENDING,
THEY'D REDUCED THEIR EXPOSURE

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:00.760
TO DEFAULTS BY BORROWERS.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:07.160
FOR COSIMO AND
HIS FAMILY, IT WAS A TRULY
BEAUTIFUL BUSINESS MODEL.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.660
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:16.460
YET BANKING WAS ONLY ONE
OF ITALY'S CONTRIBUTIONS
TO THE ASCENT OF MONEY.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.160
OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE
WAS THE BOND MARKET.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.060
AS A GENERAL RULE, BANKS
FINANCED COMMERCE.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.700
THE BOND MARKET
AROSE TO FINANCE WAR.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.430
THE ANCIENT GREEK PHILOSOPHER
HERACLITUS HAD DECLARED

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.160
THAT WAR IS THE
FATHER OF ALL THINGS.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:42.700
IT WAS CERTAINLY THE
FATHER OF THE BOND MARKET.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.000
FOR MUCH OF THE 14th
AND 15th CENTURIES,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.860
THE MEDIEVAL CITY-STATES
OF TUSCANY, FLORENCE,
PISA, AND SIENNA WERE

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.730
AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:28:00.660
THIS WAS WAR WAGED AS
MUCH BY MONEY AS BY MEN.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.800
IN PIETER VAN DER HEYDEN'S
BATTLE OF THE MONEYBAGS
AND STRONGBOXES,

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.200
PIGGY BANKS, TREASURE CHESTS,
AND BARRELS FULL OF COINS

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:13.460
LAY INTO ONE ANOTHER
WITH LANCES AND SWORDS IN
A CHAOTIC FREE-FOR-ALL.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.630
THE DUTCH VERSES INSCRIBED
AT THE BOTTOM READ

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.600
IT'S ALL FOR MONEY AND GOODS,
THIS FIGHTING AND QUARRELING.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.200
BUT WHAT THEY MIGHT JUST
AS EASILY HAVE SAID IS

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:27.000
THAT WAR IS IMPOSSIBLE
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE
MONEY TO PAY FOR IT.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.560
[BELL RINGING]

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:38.030
AND THE WAY TO DO THAT,
THE ABILITY TO FINANCE WAR
THROUGH THE BOND MARKET, WAS

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:42.800
AN INVENTION OF THE
ITALIAN RENAISSANCE.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.930
RATHER THAN REQUIRE THEIR
OWN CITIZENS TO DO THE
DIRTY WORK OF FIGHTING,

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.660
EACH CITY HIRED MILITARY
CONTRACTORS-- CONDOTTIERI--

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:57.830
WHO RAISED ARMIES
TO ANNEX LAND AND LOOT
TREASURE FROM THE OTHERS.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:01.600
AMONG THE CONDOTTIERI
OF THE 1360s AND 1370s,

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.400
ONE STOOD HEAD AND
SHOULDERS ABOVE THE OTHERS.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.600
[DRUM BEATING ON SOUNDTRACK]

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.930
THIS IS HIS PORTRAIT
IN FLORENCE'S DUOMO,

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:14.830
A THANK YOU FROM
A GRATEFUL PUBLIC.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:22.200
UNLIKELY THOUGH IT MAY
SEEM, THIS MASTER MERCENARY
WAS AN ESSEX BOY.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.600
SO SKILLFULLY DID HE WAGE
WAR THAT THE ITALIANS CALLED

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.860
SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD,
GIOVANNI ACUTO,

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.600
JOHN THE ACUTE.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.560
THIS CASTLE WAS ONE OF MANY
PIECES OF PRIME REAL ESTATE

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:43.100
THE FLORENTINES GAVE HIM AS
A REWARD FOR HIS SERVICES.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:49.230
BUT HAWKWOOD WAS A MERCENARY
WHO WAS WILLING TO FIGHT
FOR ANYONE WHO'D PAY HIM--

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:59.360
MILAN, PADUA,
PISA, OR THE POPE.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.730
THESE DAZZLING FRESCOES IN
FLORENCE'S PALAZZO VECCHIO SHOW

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.700
THE ARMIES OF PISA AND
FLORENCE CLASHING IN 1364.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:11.030
AT THAT TIME, HAWKWOOD WAS
FIGHTING ON THE SIDE OF PISA,

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.860
BUT 15 YEARS LATER, HE'D
SWITCHED SIDES. WHY?

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.530
BECAUSE FLORENCE WAS
WHERE THE MONEY WAS.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:24.000
THE COST OF THESE INCESSANT WARS
PLUNGED ITALY'S CITY-STATES

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.060
INTO CRISIS.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.730
EXPENDITURES EVEN IN YEARS
OF PEACE WERE RUNNING

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:32.700
AT DOUBLE OR MORE TAX REVENUES.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.130
TO PAY THE LIKES OF
SIR JOHN HAWKWOOD,

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:42.900
FLORENCE WAS
DROWNING IN DEFICITS.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.960
THIS WONDERFUL DOCUMENT FROM THE
FLORENTINE STATE ARCHIVE SHOWS

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.500
HOW THE CITY'S
DEBTS HAD EXPLODED

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.100
FROM AROUND 50,000 FLORINS

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.730
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE 14th CENTURY

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.660
TO 5 MILLION BY 1427.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.460
IT WAS QUITE LITERALLY
A MOUNTAIN OF DEBT.

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.900
HENCE THE NAME,
THE MONTE COMUNE.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:05.130
BUT FROM WHOM
COULD THE FLORENTINES
POSSIBLY HAVE BORROWED

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.160
SUCH A VAST SUM?

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:13.100
THE ANSWER IS RIGHT
HERE-- FROM THEMSELVES.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.760
IT WAS A REVOLUTIONARY
IDEA THAT WOULD CHANGE THE
WORLD OF MONEY FOREVER.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.630
RATHER THAN PAYING DIRECT TAX,

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.230
CITIZENS WERE NOW
EFFECTIVELY OBLIGED

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.560
TO LEND MONEY TO
THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT.

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.100
AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE
FORCED TO LEND THE MONEY MEANT

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:34.330
THAT THE INTEREST
PAYMENTS THEY EARNED WERE
NOT DEEMED TO BE USURY

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:41.200
BY THE CHURCH.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.860
THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.360
SIMPLE LINES IN A LEDGER,

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.530
WERE THE ORIGINAL
GOVERNMENT BONDS.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:47.900
AND THE WONDERFUL
THING ABOUT THEM WAS

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.630
THAT IF YOU NEEDED
YOUR MONEY IN A HURRY,

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:52.660
YOU COULD SELL YOUR
BONDS TO OTHER CITIZENS.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.630
THEY WERE LIQUID ASSETS.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.130
WHAT THIS RECORD TELLS US IS

00:31:56.130 --> 00:32:05.500
HOW FLORENCE TURNED ITS CITIZENS
INTO ITS BIGGEST INVESTORS.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.930
THIS WARTIME EXPEDIENT
MARKED THE BIRTH OF
THE MODERN BOND MARKET.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.430
EVERYONE WAS A WINNER.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.430
BONDS HAD SAVED THE
CITY-STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.260
THE CITIZENS WERE HAPPY
EARNING THEIR INTEREST.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.360
AND THE BOND MARKET LET THEM
BUY OR SELL AS THEY SAW FIT.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.800
IT SEEMED AS IF THE PROBLEM OF
PUBLIC DEBT HAD BEEN SOLVED,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:31.100
ALLOWING THE CITIZENS OF
FLORENCE TO TURN THEIR
MINDS TO HIGHER THINGS.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:41.460
BUT THERE WAS JUST ONE PROBLEM
WITH THIS BRILLIANT IDEA.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:46.230
THERE WAS A LIMIT TO HOW MANY
MORE OR LESS UNPRODUCTIVE WARS

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.360
COULD BE WAGED.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.860
THE LARGER THE DEBTS OF
THE ITALIAN CITIES BECAME,

00:32:51.860 --> 00:33:00.330
AND THE MORE BONDS WERE
ISSUED, THE LESS VALUABLE
THEY LOOKED TO INVESTORS.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:06.730
AND THAT WAS EXACTLY THE
SEQUENCE OF EVENTS IN VENICE.

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:09.760
BY THE EARLY 16th CENTURY,
THE CITY HAD SUFFERED

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.960
A SERIES OF MILITARY REVERSES,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:21.960
AND THE VALUE OF VENETIAN
BONDS HAD TAKEN A HAMMERING.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.130
AT THE NADIR BETWEEN
1509 AND 1529,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:30.700
VENETIAN MONTE NUOVO
BONDS WERE TRADING AT JUST
10% OF THEIR FACE VALUE.

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:35.530
NOW, IF YOU BUY A BOND
WHEN WAR IS RAGING,
YOU'RE TAKING A RISK,

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:39.330
THE RISK THAT THE CITY WON'T PAY
YOU BACK OR PAY YOUR INTEREST.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.400
ON THE OTHER HAND, REMEMBER
THAT THE INTEREST IS PAID

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.030
ON THE FACE VALUE OF THE BOND,

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:46.860
SO IF YOU CAN BUY IT AT
JUST 10% OF ITS FACE VALUE,

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.060
YOU'RE EARNING A HANDSOME
RETURN OF MAYBE 50%.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:52.560
AND THAT IS HOW THE
BOND MARKET WORKS.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.160
IN A SENSE, YOU
GET RETURN FOR THE RISK
YOU'RE PREPARED TO TAKE.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:01.200
AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S THE BOND
MARKET THAT SETS INTEREST RATES

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.760
FOR THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.330
IF THE STATE HAS, IN
EFFECT, TO PAY 50%,

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:10.930
THEN SO DO ALL THE
OTHER BORROWERS.

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:14.960
THE BOND MARKET HAD
BEEN INVENTED TO HELP
PAY FOR ITS CITY'S WARS.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.460
BUT NOW IT WAS SETTING
INTEREST RATES FOR EVERYONE.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.300
ITS RISE TO POWER HAD BEGUN.

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.630
OVER THE NEXT TWO CENTURIES,

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:33.000
BONDS WOULD COME
TO RULE THE WORLD.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.400
IF THE 15th AND 16th
CENTURIES HAD SEEN

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.560
A REVOLUTION IN MONEY
AND CREDIT AND THE BIRTH
OF THE BOND MARKET,

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.630
THEN THE NEXT STEP IN THE STORY
OF THE ASCENT OF MONEY WAS

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:51.030
THE RISE OF THE JOINT STOCK
LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.830
BUT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY
TO TRANSFORM OUR LIVES

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.800
WOULD DEPEND ON
ANOTHER INNOVATION...

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.260
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:06.900
THE STOCK MARKET.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.930
THE PRICE THAT PEOPLE
ARE PREPARED TO PAY

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.930
FOR A COMPANY'S SHARES
IN THE MARKET TELLS YOU

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:16.660
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY THINK
IT'LL MAKE IN THE FUTURE.

00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:21.360
BUT AS WE'VE DISCOVERED
IN RECENT MONTHS
OF FINANCIAL TURMOIL,

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.430
STOCK MARKETS CAN
ALSO BE SHOCK MARKETS.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.560
THE FUTURE IS
ALWAYS UNCERTAIN,

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.760
BUT WE HUMAN BEINGS ARE
PRONE TO OVER-OPTIMISM.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.700
WHEN PRICES HERE IN THE
NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE
SURGE UPWARDS IN SYNCH,

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.460
IT'S AS IF INVESTORS ARE GRIPPED

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.060
BY A KIND OF
COLLECTIVE EUPHORIA,

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:42.830
WHAT THE FORMER
CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL
RESERVE, ALAN GREENSPAN,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.500
ONCE FAMOUSLY CALLED
IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.030
SO STOCK MARKETS REALLY
CAN BE LIKE SOAP BUBBLES.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:53.360
WE NEVER QUITE KNOW WHEN
THEY'RE GONNA BURST.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.330
NOTHING ILLUSTRATES MORE
CLEARLY THAN THE HISTORY
OF STOCK MARKET BUBBLES

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:14.560
HOW HARD HUMAN BEINGS FIND
IT TO LEARN FROM HISTORY.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.560
HIDDEN AWAY AMONG THE MANY
SPLENDORS OF VENICE IS

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:21.660
A SMALL CLUE TO ONE OF THE MOST
ASTONISHING TALES OF ADVENTURE

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:30.330
IN ALL FINANCIAL HISTORY.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.230
TO THE HONOR AND MEMORY

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.030
OF JOHN LAW OF EDINBURGH,

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.800
MOST DISTINGUISHED
COMPTROLLER

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.460
OF THE TREASURY

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.400
OF THE KINGS OF THE FRENCH.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.230
THIS IS THE FINAL RESTING PLACE

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.160
OF THE MAN WHO INVENTED
THE STOCK MARKET BUBBLE.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:51.830
AN AMBITIOUS SCOT, A CONVICTED
MURDERER, A COMPULSIVE GAMBLER,

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:56.730
HE NOT ONLY CAUSED
THE FIRST TRUE BOOM AND
BUST IN ASSET PRICES,

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:01.500
HE ALSO INDIRECTLY CAUSED
THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.400
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN JOHN LAW OWNED

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:06.430
A QUARTER OF WHAT IS
NOW THE UNITED STATES,

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:11.230
ONLY TO LOSE IT ALL IN
HISTORY'S FIRST GREAT CRASH.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.460
FROM EDINBURGH TO
AMSTERDAM TO PARIS,

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.730
ALL THE WAY HERE TO NEW
ORLEANS AND FINALLY TO VENICE,

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:20.700
LAW'S STORY IS A CLASSIC
TALE OF BOOM AND BUST.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:26.030
IT'S ALSO VERY MUCH A
STORY FOR OUR OWN TIMES.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:30.300
HIDDEN AWAY HERE
IN THE WAREHOUSE OF THE
LOUISIANA STATE MUSEUM IS

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:36.730
THE ONLY KNOWN PAINTING
OF JOHN LAW. HERE HE IS.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:40.860
WITH THAT LEAN AND HUNGRY LOOK,
HE REALLY IS FOR ALL THE WORLD

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:48.000
A SCOTSMAN ON THE MAKE.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.030
THE PATH THAT
LED LAW FROM OBSCURITY TO
CELEBRITY TO NOTORIETY IS

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:59.860
A PATH THAT MANY OF THE
GREAT STOCK MARKET PLAYERS
HAVE FOLLOWED SINCE.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:03.330
LAW WAS BORN HERE IN
EDINBURGH IN 1671,

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.300
THE SON OF A
SUCCESSFUL GOLDSMITH

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:09.060
AND HEIR TO THE
ESTATE OF LAURISTON.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.930
IN 1694 WHILE
LIVING IN LONDON,

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:19.260
LAW KILLED A MAN IN
A DUEL OVER A WOMAN AND
WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:24.530
SOMEHOW LAW MANAGED
TO ESCAPE FROM PRISON
AND FLED TO AMSTERDAM.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:31.960
HE COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A
BETTER TOWN TO LIE LOW IN.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:37.660
BY THE 1690s, AMSTERDAM
WAS THE WORLD CAPITAL OF
FINANCIAL INNOVATION.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.660
TO HELP FINANCE THEIR
WAR AGAINST SPAIN,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.760
THE DUTCH HAD INTRODUCED
ONE OF THE WORLD'S FIRST
NATIONAL LOTTERIES.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.100
TO PROTECT THEIR MERCHANTS
FROM DODGY COINAGE,

00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.430
THEY'D CREATED THE WORLD'S
FIRST CENTRAL BANK.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:54.200
BUT THE ONE THAT HAD THE
BIGGEST IMPACT ON LAW WAS

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:58.560
THE SINGLE GREATEST DUTCH
INVENTION OF THEM ALL--

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.100
THE COMPANY.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:08.030
THE STORY OF THE COMPANY
HAD BEGUN A HUNDRED YEARS
BEFORE LAW'S ARRIVAL,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.200
AS DUTCH TRADERS SPREAD
OUT ALL OVER THE WORLD

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.530
FROM MANHATTAN ISLAND TO
THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:21.560
BUT IT WAS ASIA THAT BECAME
THE PRIMARY TARGET OF DUTCH
COMMERCIAL EXPANSION? WHY?

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.860
THE EAST INDIES WERE SO ALLURING

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.800
BECAUSE OF THESE--SPICES.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.130
PEPPER, CLOVES,
NUTMEG, GINGER.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:33.760
EUROPEANS CRAVED THEM
TO FLAVOR THEIR FOOD,
BUT ALSO TO PRESERVE IT.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.630
TRADITIONALLY THEY HAD COME
OVERLAND BY THE SPICE ROAD.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:41.730
BUT THE DUTCH PLAN
WAS TO FETCH THEM THE
LONGER BUT QUICKER WAY,

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:52.160
AND THAT PUNGENT AROMA WAS THE
SMELL OF MONEY TO BE MADE.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.830
THIS PAINTING SHOWS THE RETURN
OF ONE OF THE FIRST DUTCH FLEETS

00:39:56.830 --> 00:40:01.560
THE INSCRIPTION READS 4 SHIPS
SAILED TO GO AND GET THE SPICES

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.130
TOWARDS BANTAM AND ALSO
ESTABLISH TRADING POSTS

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:09.500
AND CAME BACK RICHLY LADEN
TO THE POLES OF AMSTERDAM.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:19.530
DEPARTED 1 MAY 1598,
RETURNED 19 JULY 1599.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:22.000
THE ASIAN SPICE TRADE
WAS SO PROFITABLE

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.060
THAT JUST ONE RETURN TRIP COULD
PAY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.830
OF A SHIP LIKE THIS,

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:32.660
THE JOURNEY AROUND THE
CAPE OF GOOD HOPE TO THE
EAST AND SO HAZARDOUS

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:37.200
THAT MERCHANTS HAD TO POOL
THEIR RESOURCES AND THEIR RISK.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:51.000
THE RESULT WAS AROUND
6 FLEDGLING EAST
INDIA ENTERPRISES.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.430
IN 1602 AT THE INSTIGATION
OF THE DUTCH GOVERNMENT,

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.360
THESE VARIOUS COMPANIES
CAME TOGETHER TO FORM

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.560
THE UNITED DUTCH EAST
INDIA CHARTERED COMPANY...

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:04.200
OR VEREENIGDE OOSTINDISCHE
COMPAGNIE FOR SHORT.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.000
AND THIS IS ITS
ORIGINAL CHARTER,

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.460
WHICH SPELLS OUT THAT
THE COMPANY WAS TO ENJOY

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:12.300
A MONOPOLY ON ALL TRADE
FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.800
ALL THE WAY EAST TO THE
STRAITS OF MAGELLAN,

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.500
PRETTY MUCH HALF THE WORLD.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.230
THE STRUCTURE OF THE
NEW ENTITY WAS NOVEL.

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:24.100
THE CAPITAL OF THE COMPANY
WAS DIVIDED UNEQUALLY

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.300
BETWEEN ALL THE
MAJOR DUTCH CITIES.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:30.260
CITIZENS WERE INVITED TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE NEW VENTURE

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:30.300
BY INVESTING.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:31.460
BY INVESTING.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:38.460
IT WAS THE FORM OF
THIS INVESTMENT THAT
WAS THE REAL NOVELTY.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.200
THIS RATHER
WONDERFUL PAINTING IS

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.560
OF THE FAMILY OF
ONE OF THE FOUNDERS

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.200
OF THE DUTCH EAST
INDIA COMPANY--

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.500
FOR 6,000 GUILDERS, HE AND 16
OTHER SO-CALLED PARTICIPANTS

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.130
BECAME THE FIRM'S
MANAGING DIRECTORS--

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.260
THE BEWINDHEBBERS.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.130
AFTER 1606, HOWEVER,
ANYONE WHO PUT HIS MONEY

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:59.560
INTO THE EAST INDIA
COMPANY RECEIVED

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.830
AN ACTIE--LITERALLY AN ACTION--

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:03.860
OR AS WE WOULD SAY A
PIECE OF THE ACTION,

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.100
A SHARE IN THE COMPANY'S
FUTURE PROFITS.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.900
AND HERE IT IS--THE WORLD'S VERY
FIRST SHARE CERTIFICATE ISSUED

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:14.660
BY THE WORLD'S VERY FIRST
MULTINATIONAL COMPANY

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:21.360
ALMOST EXACTLY 4 CENTURIES AGO.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.130
THREE YEARS LATER, BAS AND
HIS FELLOW DIRECTORS DECLARED

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:27.260
THAT ANY SHAREHOLDERS WHO
WANTED THEIR CASH BACK

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:31.760
COULD NOT HAVE IT REFUNDED BUT
WOULD HAVE TO SELL THEIR SHARES

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.000
TO ANOTHER INVESTOR.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.930
OVERNIGHT, A MARKET FOR THE
COMPANY'S SHARES WAS BORN,

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:44.200
THE WORLD'S FIRST
TRUE STOCK MARKET.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.830
THIS INVENTION WAS TO CHANGE
THE FACE OF FINANCE FOREVER

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:51.530
BECAUSE IT CREATED A MECHANISM
WHEREBY THE PRICE OF SHARES

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.060
WAS DETERMINED BY THE
LAWS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND,

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.500
BY SELLERS AND BUYERS.

00:42:56.500 --> 00:43:00.830
AND AS THE
RENEGADE SCOTSMAN JOHN LAW
COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE,

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.230
THE TRADING OF THESE
COMPANY STOCKS WAS MAKING

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:24.130
THE WORLD'S FIRST SHAREHOLDERS
VERY RICH INDEED.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:27.600
BY 1610, THE WORLD'S FIRST
JOINT STOCK COMPANY,

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.700
THE DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY,
WAS READY TO CONQUER THE WORLD.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.560
IT HAD A NEW CHARTER,
NEW SHAREHOLDERS,

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.500
AND A BURGEONING
TRADE IN THESE SHARES.

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:46.700
BUT IT HAD TO FIGHT
TO SURVIVE. LITERALLY.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.300
[SPLASHING AND CLATTER]

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.400
HAVING ESTABLISHED A STRING
OF FACTORIES AND WAREHOUSES

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.030
ACROSS SOUTH ASIA
FROM JAVA TO INDIA,

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.560
THE COMPANY HAD TO STRUGGLE
TO KEEP THE SPANIARDS

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.200
AND THEIR ENGLISH
COMPETITORS AT BAY.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.800
WITH 40 WARSHIPS AND A PRIVATE
ARMY OF 10,000 SOLDIERS,

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.560
THE DIRECTORS OF THE
EAST INDIA COMPANY WERE

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:16.600
THE ORIGINAL CORPORATE RAIDERS.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.230
FOR THE DUTCH EAST
INDIA COMPANY,

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:21.100
FIREPOWER AND FOREIGN
TRADE WENT HAND IN HAND.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.960
BUT THE KEY TO THE
COMPANY'S SUCCESS WASN'T
JUST ITS CANNONS,

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.500
LIKE THESE ONES ABOARD
THE BATAVIA, THE
PRIDE OF ITS FLEET.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:33.100
LIKE ALL BIG COMPANIES,
IT WAS ABLE TO COMBINE
ECONOMIES OF SCALE

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.730
WITH REDUCED TRANSACTION COSTS

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:37.630
AND WHAT ECONOMISTS CALL
NETWORK EXTERNALITIES--

00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:42.430
THE ABILITY TO POOL
INFORMATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE
EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:45.060
THE BATAVIA WAS
PART MAN-OF-WAR,

00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.330
PART MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:55.300
THE BIG NETWORKED COMPANY
WAS SIMPLY MORE EFFICIENT.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.860
THAT WAS WHY BY THE
1620s, IT HAD ESTABLISHED

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.030
A VIRTUAL MONOPOLY ON SPICE
EXPORTS FROM ASIA TO EUROPE.

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:07.530
THE WORLD'S FIRST MULTINATIONAL
WAS MAKING ITS SHAREHOLDERS

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.960
ENORMOUSLY WEALTHY.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.560
I'M LOOKING HERE AT THE
ORIGINAL SHAREHOLDERS' REGISTER

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.330
OF THE DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.430
LITERALLY EVERY NAME
IN HERE WAS A WINNER.

00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:19.200
IF YOU'D PUT A THOUSAND
GUILDERS INTO THE COMPANY

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.330
AT ITS VERY INCEPTION,

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:27.000
BY 1736, YOUR INVESTMENT
WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH 7,000.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.230
OVER ITS ENTIRE LIFETIME,
THE COMPANY PAID

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:32.700
AN AVERAGE ANNUAL
DIVIDEND OF 16 1/2%.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:39.460
VIRTUALLY ALL ITS PROFITS WERE
PAID BACK TO THE SHAREHOLDERS.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:43.830
DIRCK BAS' ORIGINAL
SHAREHOLDING OF 6,000 GUILDERS

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:56.800
HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED INTO
A 500,000 GUILDER FORTUNE.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:59.800
TO JOHN LAW, LYING
LOW IN AMSTERDAM

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.700
HAVING ESCAPED THE
GALLOWS IN LONDON,

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.530
THE WORKINGS OF THE
DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.400
CAME AS A REVELATION.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.430
LAW WAS LIVING OFF HIS WINNINGS
AT THE GAMBLING TABLE,

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:13.130
BUT HE WAS FASCINATED
BY THE RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN THE COMPANY

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.130
WITH ITS SPLENDID OFFICES
IN THE HOOGSTRAAT,

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:21.000
THE NEARBY STOCK EXCHANGE
WHERE DEALERS BUSILY TRADED
THE COMPANY'S SHARES,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.300
AND THE BANK OF AMSTERDAM.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:31.460
YET THIS DUTCH FINANCIAL
SYSTEM STRUCK LAW
AS NOT QUITE COMPLETE.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.560
TO LAW'S FINANCIALLY
SUPERCHARGED MIND,

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.860
THE DUTCH WERE MISSING
A TRICK OR TWO.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.500
FOR ONE THING, IT SEEMED
COMPLETELY NUTS TO RESTRICT

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.630
THE NUMBER OF EAST
INDIA COMPANY SHARES

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:45.100
WHEN THE MARKETS WERE SO
CLEARLY ENAMORED OF THEM.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:49.500
LAW WAS ALSO PUZZLED
BY THE CONSERVATISM OF
THE BANK OF AMSTERDAM.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.330
IT HAD CREATED AN
INTERNAL SYSTEM

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:56.130
WHICH ALLOWED MERCHANTS
TO SETTLE THEIR ACCOUNTS BY
DIRECT CASHLESS TRANSFERS,

00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.560
BUT IT HADN'T ISSUED ANY REAL
BANK NOTES TO THE PUBLIC.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.960
THE IDEA WAS
ALREADY TAKING SHAPE

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.530
OF A BREATHTAKING MODIFICATION

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.200
OF THE INSTITUTIONS THAT
LAW HAD FIRST ENCOUNTERED

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.560
HERE IN AMSTERDAM.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.060
ONLY COMBINE THE PROPERTIES

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.460
OF A MONOPOLY TRADING
COMPANY AND A PUBLIC BANK,

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.560
AND THE SKY REALLY
WOULD BE THE LIMIT.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:20.830
LAW WAS PREPARING TO UNLEASH
A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM OF FINANCE

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:29.830
ON AN UNSUSPECTING NATION.

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:33.700
IN 1716, JOHN LAW
ARRIVED IN PARIS.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.230
HE HAD IDENTIFIED FRANCE
AS THE IDEAL LABORATORY

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.800
FOR WHAT WOULD BE THE
BIGGEST EXPERIMENT

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.960
IN THE HISTORY OF
THE STOCK MARKET.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:51.460
BUT WHY DID THE FRENCH
GIVE HIM HIS CHANCE?

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.230
THE ANSWER IS THAT FRANCE'S
FISCAL PROBLEMS WERE

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.860
EXCEPTIONALLY DESPERATE.

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.600
THE COUNTRY WAS SADDLED
WITH ENORMOUS PUBLIC DEBTS

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:03.400
AS A RESULT OF THE
WARS OF LOUIS XIV.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.930
WHEN THE SUN KING DIED IN
1715, THE DUKE OF ORLEANS,

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:11.560
WHO WAS ACTING AS REGENT FOR
THE UNDERAGE KING LOUIS XV,

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.560
FACED A COUNTRY ON THE BRINK
OF ITS THIRD BANKRUPTCY

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.860
IN LESS THAN A CENTURY.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.900
IT WAS THE PERFECT
OPPORTUNITY FOR LAW,

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.900
THE MAVERICK
SELF-TAUGHT ECONOMIST,

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:30.500
WHO DEVELOPED HIS
THEORY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE
CASINO AND THE STOCK MARKET.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.660
LAW'S AMBITION WAS TO REVIVE
ECONOMIC CONFIDENCE IN FRANCE

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.300
BY ESTABLISHING A BANK
ON THE DUTCH MODEL

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:38.400
BUT WITH THE DIFFERENCE

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.000
THAT THIS BANK WOULD
ISSUE PAPER MONEY,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.960
LIKE THIS 100 LIVRES NOTE.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.960
AS MONEY WAS
INVESTED IN THE BANK,

00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.000
THE GOVERNMENT'S HUGE DEBT
WOULD BE CONSOLIDATED.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.900
AND THIS WAS THE REALLY
IMPORTANT PART OF LAW'S SYSTEM--

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:56.130
PAPER MONEY WOULD
REVIVE FRENCH TRADE,

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:58.960
AND WITH IT FRENCH
ECONOMIC POWER.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.060
THE ROYAL GOVERNMENT
GAINED DOUBLY.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:05.330
CONSOLIDATION SIMPLY MEANT
THAT ITS ONEROUS DEBTS WERE

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:09.030
MAGICALLY TRANSFORMED INTO
SHARES IN LAW'S BANK.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.300
AT THE SAME TIME, THE
MONARCH GAINED THE ABILITY

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:17.030
TO PRINT AS MUCH
MONEY AS HE LIKED.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:20.400
AS LAW WROTE, I MAINTAIN
THAT AN ABSOLUTE PRINCE

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.060
WHO KNOWS HOW TO GOVERN CAN
EXTEND HIS CREDIT FURTHER

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.960
AND FIND NEEDED FUNDS
AT A LOWER INTEREST RATE

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.260
THAN A PRINCE WHO IS
LIMITED IN HIS AUTHORITY.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:39.900
IN CREDIT, SUPREME POWER MUST
RESIDE IN ONLY ONE PERSON.

00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:43.930
THAT ABSOLUTE POWER WAS IN THE
HANDS OF THE DUKE OF ORLEANS,

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:45.730
WHO LIVED HERE IN
THE PALAIS-ROYAL,

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:49.230
JUST A SHORT STEP FROM LAW'S
APARTMENT IN THE PLAATS VAN DAM.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:52.400
IT WAS TO HIM THAT LAW
NOW UNFOLDED HIS SCHEME.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:56.430
THE PRIZE WAS NOTHING LESS THAN
THE REVIVAL OF FRENCH POWER

00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:58.500
THROUGH FINANCIAL ENGINEERING,

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:04.030
BUT THAT WAS ONLY HALF
OF LAW'S INGENIOUS PLAN.

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.930
AS LAW WROTE...

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:10.730
THE BANK IS NOT THE ONLY,
NOR THE GRANDEST OF MY IDEAS.

00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:14.400
I WILL PRODUCE A WORK
WHICH WILL SURPRISE EUROPE

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.930
BY CHANGES MORE POWERFUL

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:22.630
THAN WERE PRODUCED BY THE
DISCOVERY OF THE INDIES.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:28.160
THE SECOND PART OF LAW'S
IDEA WAS THAT A HUGE
MONOPOLY TRADING COMPANY

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.500
SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED,
THE COMPAGNIE D'OCCIDENT,

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:36.900
AS HE PUT IT, THE WHOLE NATION
WOULD BECOME A BODY OF TRADERS.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:43.060
AND LAW HIMSELF, NAMED HERE AS
THE COMPANY'S CHIEF DIRECTOR,

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:50.530
WOULD BE AT ITS HEAD.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:55.400
THE FOCUS FOR THIS
WILDLY AMBITIOUS SCHEME
WOULD BE IN AMERICA,

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:58.630
WHERE THE FRENCH LAID CLAIM
TO A VAST TRACT OF LAND

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:02.060
EITHER SIDE OF THE
MISSISSIPPI, LOUISIANA.

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.560
THE REGENT GAVE LAW'S
COMPANY, WHAT WAS TO BECOME

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.030
THE MISSISSIPPI COMPANY,

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.130
A MONOPOLY ON TRADE
WITH THE NEW COLONY.

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.860
FRENCHMEN REGARDLESS
OF RANK WERE ENCOURAGED

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.730
TO BUY SHARES IN THE COMPANY.

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:23.700
LAW'S NAME HEADED THE
LIST OF DIRECTORS.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:27.860
IN MODERN PARLANCE, WHAT THESE
DOCUMENTS TELL US IS THAT LAW

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:30.760
WAS ATTEMPTING A
REFLATION. AND WHY NOT?

00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:33.160
FRANCE IN 1716 WAS
IN A DEPRESSION,

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:36.230
AND LAW'S BANK NOTES HELPED
STIMULATE A RECOVERY.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:40.160
AT THE SAME TIME,
WHAT HE WAS DOING WAS
EFFECTIVELY TRANSFORMING

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.530
A BURDENSOME AND BADLY
MANAGED PUBLIC DEBT

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.130
INTO SHARES IN WHAT WAS

00:51:45.130 --> 00:51:48.030
A PRIVATIZED TAX GATHERING
AND TRADE COMPANY.

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:51.830
WELL, WHAT WAS NOT
TO LIKE ABOUT THAT?

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:55.360
IN A FEVER OF MASS SPECULATION,
THE MISSISSIPPI COMPANY'S

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:01.230
SHARE PRICE SOARED FROM THE
ORIGINAL PRICE OF 500 LIVRES

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.360
TO 5,000 ON SEPTEMBER 4th.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:12.060
BY DECEMBER 1719, IT
HAD REACHED 10,000.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:13.530
AND THIS IS WHERE
IT ALL HAPPENED.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.100
THIS WAS WHERE LAW'S SHARE
ISSUING OFFICE WAS LOCATED,

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.560
THE RUE QUINCAMPOIX.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.600
AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE
SCENES OF FRENZY HERE

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.630
AS HALF OF PARIS DESCENDED
ON THIS NARROW ALLEYWAY

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:25.830
ALL DESPERATE FOR A
PIECE OF THE ACTION.

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:29.300
THE HIGHER THE SHARE
PRICE WENT, THE MORE
THEY WANTED TO BUY.

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:36.030
IT WAS A CLASSIC STOCK
MARKET FEEDBACK LOOP.

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:42.230
IT WAS IN THESE HEADY TIMES
THAT THE WORD MILLIONAIRE
WAS FIRST COINED.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:46.360
YES, MILLIONAIRES,
LIKE ENTREPRENEURS,

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.800
WERE INVENTED IN FRANCE.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:55.230
AND BY JANUARY 1720, JOHN LAW
WAS THE RICHEST OF THEM ALL.

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:59.800
LOUIS XIV HAD SAID,
L'ETAT C'EST MOI.

00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.060
I AM THE STATE.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:06.200
NOW THE RENEGADE SCOTSMAN
JOHN LAW WAS ABLE TO SAY,

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.730
L'ECONOMIE C'EST MOI.

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:15.330
I AM THE ECONOMY.

00:53:15.330 --> 00:53:19.230
ONLY WHEN THE MISSISSIPPI BUBBLE
BURST WOULD THE FRENCH REALIZE

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:23.130
THE DANGERS OF LAW'S
ECONOMIC EXPERIMENT.

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:25.060
NEXT TIME ON THE
ASCENT OF MONEY,

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:28.400
WE'LL SEE HOW WHAT BEGAN AS
A REVOLUTION IN FINANCE--

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.830
THE FIRST STOCK MARKET BUBBLE--

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:35.000
ENDED AS A FULL-BLOWN
POLITICAL REVOLUTION

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:42.260
IN WHICH ROYAL HEADS WOULD ROLL.

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:44.430
NEXT TIME ON THE
ASCENT OF MONEY,

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:47.800
BEFORE CHARLES PONZI
AND BERNIE MADOFF,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.300
THE STORY OF JOHN LAW.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.330
LIKE ALL PONZI SCHEMES,
THE EFFECT OF LAW'S SYSTEM

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:55.000
WAS TO GENERATE AN
UNSUSTAINABLE BUBBLE.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.030
HIS BUBBLE WAS ABOUT TO GO POP.

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.430
AND THE BRITISH
ARISTOCRACY LEARNS

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:01.730
THAT WHAT GOES UP
MUST COME DOWN.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.000
THIS HOUSE BELONGED TO
THE PRINCIPAL VICTIM

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.200
OF THE FIRST MODERN
PROPERTY CRASH.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.060
