that folks are trying to avoid

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.360
getting health care, the problem
is they can't afford it.
>> We are approaching a perfect
storm of problems that, if not

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.900
addressed by the next president,
will cause our health care
system to implode.
>> I am not running for

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.660
president to put band-aids on
our problems.
I want to get to universal
health care for every single

American.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:03:04.600
the World.
>> REID: That's the capitol of
the richest, most powerful
nation in history.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:14.560
But when it comes to providing
health care for people, that
great country, our country, is a
fourth-rate power.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.700
The World Health Organization
says the US health care system
rates 37th in the world in terms
of quality and fairness.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.130
All the other rich countries do
better than we do, and yet they
spend a heck of a lot less.
How do they do it?

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.400
That's what this film is about.
We're going to go around the
world to see what lessons we can
learn to fix America's sick,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:42.760
sick health care system.
I've covered the world as a
foreign correspondent, and right
now I'm writing a book about

00:03:42.760 --> 00:04:03.000
health care systems overseas.
First stop on my tour is Great
Britain, where our family lived
for five years.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.700
Even though the UK is our
closest European ally, its
health care solution that is,
the government-run National

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.230
Health Service-- may seem too
close to socialism for most
Americans.
Still, we can learn something

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.260
here.
For about half of what we pay
per person, the NHS covers
everybody and has somewhat

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:33.030
better health statistics, longer
life expectancy, lower infant
mortality.
Britain's National Health

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.160
Service is dedicated to the
proposition that you should
never have to pay a medical
bill.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.930
In the NHS, there's no insurance
premium, no co-pay, no fee at
all.
The system covers everybody.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.500
And, you know, when we lived
here, my family got really good
care from the NHS, although we
often had to wait to see a

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.400
doctor.
And yet the newspapers here are
full of NHS horror stories--
rationing, waiting lists,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.500
terrible mistakes.
So I've come to London to see
this NHS.
Is it an answer for the U.S., or

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:13.130
just some horrible socialist
nanny state?
The Brits pay for health care
out of tax revenue, so the

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:20.660
government owns the hospitals,
like this one, the Whittington
Hospital in North London.
The doctors who work here are

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.500
salaried government employees.
Does that sound like socialized
medicine?
Well, according to the hospital

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.960
CEO, David Sloman, the Brits
like it that way.
>> I think people are proud of
it.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.630
90% of people who use the NHS
think it's good or excellent.
So people think very, very
highly of it.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.860
People who don't use it, don't
think so well of it, actually.
>> REID: Would you say most
British people go their whole

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.860
lives and never get a medical
bill?
>> Every single person who's
born in the UK will use the NHS

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.060
at one point in their lives.
The majority of people will use
it as the only provider of their
medical care.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.660
And none of them will be
presented a bill at any point
during that time.
>> REID: No medical bills.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:13.360
Sounds sweet to me.
And here's something else that's
different: there's no medical
bankruptcy.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.560
This is Jeremy Cadle.
His son, Tom, is being treated
for leukemia at the Whittington.
At least he doesn't have to

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.600
worry about going broke.
>> He's had eight weeks in
hospital.
Apart from the times when he

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.500
needs chemotherapy, we've got
community health care that comes
in on a weekly basis to take his
blood.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.500
Hasn't cost us a penny.
You know, it's astonishing the
care you can get.
>> On your picture?

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.730
>> REID: Of course, it's not
free.
The Brits pay much higher taxes
than we do to cover health care.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:55.500
But even so, does it sound a bit
too good to be true?
To find out, I sought out a
long-time NHS watcher, Nigel

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.230
Hawkes of the "Times," for a
more critical perspective.
Look, this all sounds really
sweet.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:07.860
>> (<i> laughs</i> )
>> Does it work?
>> It works in some respects.
I think primary care, the family

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:16.130
doctor service, is pretty good,
and emergency care works quite
well.
Where I think it can fall down

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:24.630
is on elective care-- hip
replacements, heart operations,
this kind of thing.
It used to be of the order of 18

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:32.600
months to get a new hip.
That's been greatly reduced by
the current government over the
last ten years.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:38.860
It's down to certainly less than
six months, and for most people
about two or three.
>> There are 400,000 fewer

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:45.430
people on waiting lists than in
1997.
Waiting times...
>> REID: In the last decade in

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:51.830
Britain, Tony Blair and other
politicians have reduced the
waiting lists.
They did it by spending more

00:07:51.830 --> 00:08:00.730
money and by bringing some
market mechanisms into a
government-run system.
Today government-owned hospitals

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.800
like the Whittington compete
against each other for
government money.
In today's NHS, patients can

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:14.660
choose which hospital to go to.
>> Oh, of course we compete.
You know, we do on our web site.
We'll make sure you can book

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.430
into our place at least as quick
as all the other places around
here.
But we're all competing around

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:25.130
what I think are now respectable
margins, whereas, previously,
you know, it was six months or
seven months.

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:31.930
Now, in some specialties, I
could proceed tomorrow.
>> REID: It's easy to see why
choice might suit patients, but

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:38.200
what do government-run hospitals
get out of it?
We don't understand why people
would compete when you can't

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.830
make more money.
In America, people compete to
make profit.
>> Yes.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:51.760
That's a very fair point.
I mean, here you would compete
in order to survive.
Because if you start losing

00:08:51.760 --> 00:09:03.630
patients to another hospital,
your services are going to be
under threat.
>> What we've seen over the past

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:13.060
ten years is a move away from
Bevin's ideal of an NHS for all.
We've seen the creeping
privatization of services.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:19.830
>> REID: When I was in London, I
stumbled on this rally in
Trafalgar Square, and I
discovered that many NHS

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:27.500
staffers are angry about these
new trends that could close some
of the less-popular hospitals.
They were also protesting

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:33.600
government plans to privatize
some NHS services.
You're probably 50, or even more
than that.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.260
Have you ever paid a medical
bill?
>> Isn't he very kind?
>> REID: Have you ever paid a

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.530
medical bill?
>> No, never.
>> REID: Will you ever pay a
medical bill in your life?

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:48.360
>> Not likely.
>> I hope not.
This is why we're doing this.
We don't want to.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:56.060
And even in ten years time, if
we're not around, we don't want
our kids to do it, either.
>> REID: While the hospitals

00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:05.860
struggle with reforms, the GPs
have embraced them.
I went to visit one who
practices in the West London

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.030
neighborhood of Shepherds Bush.
>> Patricia Wilton?
>> Yes.
>> REID: In Britain, health care

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.130
starts here.
>> Hi, have a seat.
>> REID: Nobody can to go
directly to a specialist.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:20.200
First you have to go to a
gatekeeper, like Dr. Ahmed
Badat.
>> (<i> coughing</i> )

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:27.800
>> Huh, a nasty cough.
>> REID: He's a family doctor, a
general practitioner.
GPs hold down costs for the

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:35.430
system and give people what the
Brits call a "medical home."
My family had one just down the
street, and we liked it.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:42.560
>> You're going to have an X-ray
done here.
Open your mouth.
>> REID: GPs are paid a fixed

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:50.360
amount based on the number of
patients they have.
The average list is 1,800
people.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.730
And get this: they make a bonus
for keeping their patients
healthy.
So when Dr. Badat does a good

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:02.160
job of caring for patients with
diabetes and heart disease, he
gets paid more.
How much more?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.960
>> It works out about £90,000.
>> REID: So that's increasing
your salary by $180,000 a year.
That's not bad.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.000
>> Yes, yes.
>> REID: I'm reading the
newspaper.
It says docs are doing well

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.200
here.
>> I can't complain.
>> REID: Dr. Badat has had
personal experience with U.S.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:28.560
medicine.
He had a heart attack while on
vacation in Las Vegas, and was
rushed to the county hospital.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:39.960
>> The treatment was absolutely
fantastic.
But I was there eight days.
The total bill came to $67,000.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:50.800
I mean, that is preposterous.
>> REID: Critics say Britain has
the opposite problem: care costs
the patients too little here.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.200
Do you have patients who come
twice a week or something?
>> Yes.
There's always like that.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:02.600
>> REID: Are they sick, or...
>> No.
I think they're just lonely
people, they are... so just want

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:13.200
somebody to chat to.
But then there are people I
never see at all.
And they come and register, I

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.530
don't see them for three years,
five years.
>> REID: With access this easy,
the doctor and the system have a

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.900
strong incentive to keep people
healthy.
The result: Britain has become a
world leader in preventive

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:29.730
medicine.
Just look at all these services
GPs here aggressively promote
and talk to their patients

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:39.530
about.
To sum up, then, there's a lot
to like in Britain: no bills;
NHS waiting lists are getting

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:46.600
shorter; there's excellent
preventive medicine.
But there's probably still too
much government here for

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:57.030
American tastes, even if the NHS
is trying to be more market
savvy.
The next country on my tour

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:08.360
couldn't be more different.
Our family lived there twice.
I was the Tokyo correspondent
for the "Washington Post."

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:15.200
Japan has 130 million people.
And whenever I come to this
station in Tokyo, I feel like
every one of them is right here.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:22.200
It's a ferociously capitalist
economy.
They have no natural resources,
but they've built the second-

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.230
richest country in the world.
And, you know, it's 130 million
healthy people.
They have better national health

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:33.660
than we do.
They cover everybody and-- get
this-- they spend half as much
as the United States on health

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:42.660
care per capita.
How do they do that?
One thing is for certain:
Japanese health care is a

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:50.430
bargain.
For just 8% of GDP-- that's less
than even the British spend--
the Japanese have built a system

00:13:50.430 --> 00:14:00.630
with fabulous health statistics.
They have the longest healthy
life expectancy in the world and
the lowest infant mortality

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:07.060
rate.
Now, part of that's due to diet
and lifestyle, but the health
system must be doing something

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:14.100
right.
Everybody's covered, but unlike
the Brits, the Japanese don't
pay for all of it through taxes.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.600
Instead, everybody has to sign
up for a health insurance
policy.
You get it at work or through a

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:29.200
community-based insurer.
The government picks up the tab
for those who are too poor.
This system is known as social

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:35.760
insurance, and it's a model
that's used in many wealthy
countries.
As for the health care itself,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:43.200
that's certainly not socialist.
80% of the hospitals are
private, more than in the U.S.,
and almost every doctor's office

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:51.330
is a private business.
Dr. Kono Hitoshi is a typical
doctor.
He runs a private 19-bed

00:14:51.330 --> 00:15:10.260
hospital in the Tokyo
neighborhood of Soshigoya.
The Japanese are prodigious
consumers of health care.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:17.200
They go to the doctor three
times as often as Americans do,
and since there are no
gatekeepers, they can go see any

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:29.760
specialist they want.
Do you have to make an
appointment to come?
>> REID: Never?

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:38.760
>> Never.
>> REID: How long do you see the
doctor?
>> Three minutes.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:16:03.660
>> REID: It seems like such a
short visit.
>> REID: Surveys show the
Japanese are highly satisfied

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:25.700
with their health system.
>> (<i> speaking Japanese</i> )
>> REID: Excuse me.
She says, "This annual physical

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.600
is really a great idea.
I think that's why I've stayed
so healthy, because they really
look out for me and check out

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:38.260
all my problems."
>> (<i> speaking Japanese</i> )
>> REID: (<i> translating</i> ): Well,
it's not bad, as a matter of

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.960
fact.
You can't call it bad, because
everybody has the insurance and
the insurance pretty much takes

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:51.960
care of the bills."
>> (<i> speaking Japanese</i> )
>> REID: "So I think the
Japanese health care system is

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.330
really good.
I know nothing about other
countries.
What do people in your country

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:02.600
think about your health care
system?" she says.
Here's something else that's
different: Japanese patients

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:09.330
have much longer hospital stays
than Americans, and they love
technology, like scans.
They have nearly twice as many

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:17.700
MRIs per capita as Americans;
eight times as many as the
Brits.
So how do they keep costs under

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:23.230
control?
Well, it turns out the Japanese
Health Ministry tightly controls
the price of health care right

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:31.200
down to the smallest detail.
Every two years, the physicians
and the health ministry
negotiate a fixed price for

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:41.200
every single procedure and drug.
Like the items in this sushi
bar, everything from open heart
surgery to a routine check-up

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:47.430
has a standard price, and this
price is the same everywhere in
Japan.
If a doctor tries to boost his

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:53.230
income by increasing the number
of procedures, well, then, guess
what?
At the next negotiation, the

00:17:53.230 --> 00:18:02.200
government lowers the price.
That's what happened with MRIs,
which are incredibly cheap in
Japan.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:09.830
I asked the country's top health
economist, Professor Naoki
Ikegami, to tell us how that
happened.

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:17.530
In Denver, where I live, if you
get an MRI of your neck region,
it's $1,200.
And the doctor we visited in

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:25.800
Japan says he gets $98 for an
MRI.
So how do you do that?
>> Well, in 2002, the government

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:33.000
says that the MRIs, we are
paying too much.
So in order to be within the
total budget, we will cut them

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:42.300
by 35%.
>> REID: So, if I'm a doctor,
why don't I say, "Well, I'm not
going to do them then, it's not

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:50.560
enough money"?
>> You forgot that we have only
one payment system.
So if you want to do your MRIs,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:58.330
unless you can get private
paying patients, which is almost
impossible in Japan, you go out
of business.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:04.400
>> REID: So that shafts the
medical device makers and must
limit innovation, right?
Well, no.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.660
Japanese manufacturers of
scanning equipment, like
Toshiba, found ways to make
inexpensive machines they could

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:18.800
sell to doctors.
And guess what?
Now they're exporting these
machines all over the world.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:24.430
But price regulation also hits
the doctors hard.
Dr. Kono can't charge what he
wants.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:46.560
He can only charge what the
official price book dictates.
>> REID: If somebody comes in
with a cut that's less than six

00:19:46.560 --> 00:20:01.830
square inches-- so, fairly small
cut-- he gets 450 YEN, $4.30, to
sew that up.
That's incredibly cheap.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:09.530
>> REID: He then told me what it
costs to stay in his hospital.
Okay, you're going to love this.
So you know how much it costs to

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:15.000
spend the night in a hospital
here, according to this price
book?
If you stay in a room with four

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.400
people, ten dollars a night.
If you have a private room, $90
to spend the night in a hospital
in a private room here.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:41.460
That's because the government
set the price.
>> REID: Is that fair?
>> It's fair.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:53.000
>> REID: Oh, it is.
>> REID: The doctors have to
live with the price book, but
Japanese patients have to play

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.830
their part in financing the
system by paying into a social
insurance fund.
If you lose your job in Japan,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:07.200
you don't lose your health
insurance.
Unlike the U.S., you switch to a
community insurer, and these

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:14.700
insurance companies have very
little in common with their
American counterparts.
Can they turn her down if she

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.430
has heart disease or something?
>> That is forbidden.
>> REID: These health care plans
covering basic health care for a

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:26.860
worker and his family, do they
make a profit?
>> No, because they... they are
not allowed to make a profit,

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:34.400
and anything left over is
carried over to the next year.
And if there's a lot carried
over, then the premium rate

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:45.560
would go down.
>> REID: Insurance companies
barred from making a profit,
national price regulation--

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.800
that's all good news for
patients.
The average premium for a
Japanese family is just $280 a

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:56.700
month, with the employer paying
at least half, a lot less than
most Americans pay.
It's good news for Japanese

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:05.630
employers as well.
J.R. Tokai, the company that
runs this bullet train to Osaka,
told me that its health costs

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:14.730
are about half of 1% of
operating expenses.
General Motors pays eight times
as much as that.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:21.030
So here's a country with the
longest life expectancy,
excellent health results, no
waiting lists and rock bottom

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:28.430
costs.
What's not to like?
But the president of the Nagoya
Central Hospital, Professor

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:38.060
Saito Hidero, showed me the
downside.
>> I think our system is pretty
good, pretty good.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:47.300
But no system is perfect.
>> REID: Yes.
>> But now 50% of hospitals are
in financial deficit now.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:54.600
>> REID: No, I didn't know that.
In Japan?
>> 50% in Japan.
So I'm afraid hospitals may be

00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:04.030
one of the endangered species in
Japan now.
>> Ah...
>> REID: 50% in financial

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:10.130
deficit?
That sounds unsustainable.
So here's the weakness.
While we spend too much on

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:17.030
medicine, the Japanese seem to
spend too little.
In a country with ten dollar per
night hospital stays, the prices

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:25.330
are just not high enough to
balance the books.
But the Japanese system is so
popular that they're not going

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:32.300
to rip it apart.
The experts say they'll have to
increase prices a little to save
the hospitals from going broke.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:41.630
Back home, our problem is
patients going broke.
And in Japan, how many people go
bankrupt from medical costs?

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:55.930
>> I don't know.
(<i> speaking Japanese</i> )
We never heard of it.
Yeah, almost never hear of,

00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:10.230
yeah.
>> REID: Before leaving Tokyo, I
went to the Meiji Jingu Shrine,
a deeply spiritual place.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:18.530
I left a prayer asking for
something I think almost all of
us can agree on: a health system
where, as in Japan, everyone

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:36.100
gets care and nobody goes broke
paying doctor bills.
Next, to a country a bit more
like the U.S., the nation that

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:46.430
gave us aspirin and X-rays, the
third-richest economy in the
world.
It's Germany.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:25:03.130
In many ways they're just like
us, except, that is, for their
health care.
That imposing figure behind me

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:09.360
is Otto von Bismarck, the
Prussian Chancellor in the
1880s.
And he's the guy who invented

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:14.800
the concept of health care
systems, the notion that a
government has to provide
mechanisms so all its people can

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:23.600
get medical care when they need
it.
And today, the Bismark model is
used all over the world.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:29.460
Thanks to the Bismarck model,
everybody in Germany is offered
health care.
While the rich are allowed to

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:38.430
opt out and pay privately, about
90% of Germans choose to stay in
the national system.
And that system is famous not

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:44.930
only for covering all the
basics-- plus mental health,
dental and optical-- they'll
also pay for alternative

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:55.300
therapies like homeopathy.
They'll pay you to go to a spa.
The system's even been known to
cover belly dancing lessons.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:05.200
As in Japan, the delivery of
health care is largely a market
affair carried out by private
doctors and private hospitals.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:13.660
I visited Dr. Christina von
Koekritz, a family doctor
practicing in the small town of
Kladow, south of Berlin.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:20.260
If I call your office and say,
"Oh, my shoulder kind of hurts,
I'm not sure what's wrong," how
long would it take me to see

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:26.660
you?
>> One or two weeks.
If it's serious, same day.
>> REID: Serious, same day.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:31.860
If I come in here and you look
at my shoulder and say, "Well, I
think maybe an orthopedic
specialist should look at it,"

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:39.000
then how long would I have wait
to see the...
>> It's different.
Perhaps another week or two.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.460
>> REID: Yeah.
>> Yes.
>> REID: What if the orthopedic
specialist said, "Well, we have

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.330
to operate on your shoulder"?
Do you know how long I would
have to wait for that?
>> Not too long.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:53.960
Three weeks?
>> REID: Three weeks before I
could get in?
>> I guess.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:27:02.130
>> REID: That's about the same
waiting time as the U.S.
It's faster than Britain, but
not as quick as Japan would be.

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:13.800
To finance health care, Germans
pay premiums based on income to
one of 240 private insurers.
They call them "sickness funds."

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:23.360
A worker earning $60,000 would
split a $750 monthly family
premium with her employer.
It's more expensive than Japan

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:29.860
and the UK, but still a bargain
by U.S. standards, about two-
thirds of ours.
>> It is a system where the rich

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:39.230
pay for the poor, and where the
ill are covered by the healthy.
>> REID: This is Professor Karl
Lauterbach, a member of the

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:45.860
German parliament and one of
Germany's foremost experts on
health policy.
>> So it is a nice social

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:55.600
support system which is highly
accepted by the population.
>> REID: Katie Haaser is one of
those patients.

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:04.060
She's having her third baby.
>> I'm very satisfied with the
system, especially during my
pregnancy.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:13.760
I think it's maybe not perfect,
but it's the best I can imagine.
>> REID: What does she pay?
>> Actually, nothing.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:23.160
I don't have to pay anything.
>> REID: While pregnant women
pay nothing, there is a
co-payment for most patients.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:33.430
But you'll love this: it costs
ten Euros-- that's about 15
bucks-- and you only have to pay
that once every three months.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:38.600
If you lose your job, what
happens to your health
insurance?
>> Health insurance continues

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:46.460
with no change if you lose a
job.
We do know very well that people
who become unemployed are at an

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:54.230
increased risk of becoming ill,
and therefore becoming
unemployed is about the worst
time to lose health insurance.

00:28:54.230 --> 00:29:04.860
So therefore everyone who loses
a job remains in exactly the
health insurance system he is
in.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.430
>> REID: German insurance plans
actively compete among
themselves for customers even
though they are not allowed to

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:17.900
make a profit.
So what's in it for them?
>> Sickness funds do not want to
perish.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:24.960
They want to survive and grow.
And the management is better
paid if the sickness fund is
growing.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:31.460
So I think the German healthcare
system is a nice third way
between a for-profit system on
the one hand and, let's say,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:38.860
single payer system on the other
hand.
>> REID: It all sounds good to
me, but how does the German

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:46.960
system compare with ours?
To get a U.S. view, I went to
McGury's Café in the former East
Berlin to meet Mike McGury, an

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:55.700
American whose been living in
Germany for six years.
Good to see you.
Haven't seen you since Kladow.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:02.960
>> It's been a while.
Wow, I love the new bar.
It looks great.
(<i> speaking German</i> )

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:11.300
That's all the German I know.
"I want a big beer."
>> That's all you need.
(<i> laughter</i> )

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.760
>> REID: You ever have to go to
the doctor?
I mean, you've used the health
care system?

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.000
>> Oh, absolutely.
>> REID: Yeah.
And what do you think?
How would you rate it?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.030
>> Top notch.
>> REID: Oh, really?
How come?
What's good?

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:31.660
>> You have many different
choices, and the cost is a
fraction of what is covered in
the States.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.930
Most of your prescriptions are
covered with very, very small
co-pays.
>> REID: And how's the quality?

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:38.860
I mean, do you think you're
getting good health care here?
>> Excellent.
Actually, I see no difference,

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:46.500
as far as quality goes, between
here and when I was in the
States.
>> REID: Really?

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:53.860
Surveys show Germans are
satisfied with their health
care.
The system is also efficient.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:31:00.630
Medical providers and sickness
funds negotiate standard prices,
and this cuts administrative
costs.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:05.500
They're only around 6%.
That's a quarter of what they
are in the U.S.
And drugs are a bargain here,

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:11.430
too.
>> The same drugs are way
cheaper in Germany than in
America.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:20.830
Because, obviously, if all
sickness funds negotiate with
the drug companies for a single
price, then the market power of

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:29.730
the sickness funds is fully
used.
>> REID: Every year the sickness
funds also negotiate standard

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:38.100
prices with medical providers.
And just as in Japan, some of
these doctors feel undervalued
and underpaid.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:46.230
Professor Detlev Ganten is
chairman of Berlin's giant
Charité Hospital.
So do you think your hospital is

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:52.560
paid enough for the services it
provides people?
>> No.
As I mentioned, it's not being

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:58.960
paid enough because we are
providing very expensive care to
university hospital, so we have
to economize enormously within

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:06.060
the university system also.
>> REID: An American hospital
that felt it wasn't getting
enough money for its services

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:11.260
would raise its prices.
Could you do that?
>> No, we cannot do that.
These prices are negotiated

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:21.130
every year, and this is done by
states.
So, within Berlin, all the
hospitals get the same kind of

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:29.130
DRG re-compensation.
We cannot raise our prices.
>> REID: By U.S. standards,
doctors who work in hospitals

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:36.600
here are not paid very well.
A 35-year-old might earn about
$80,000 a year, about half what
he'd earn in the U.S.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:43.760
>> It's not a high salary.
And people correctly complain
because they work not eight
hours; they work 12 hours, 14

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:53.130
hours, 16 hours, and sometimes
seven days a week.
And I think they deserve more.
>> REID: Dr. Christina von

00:32:53.130 --> 00:33:02.760
Koekritz also feels shortchanged
by the system.
A family doctor makes around
$120,000 a year, about two-

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:07.060
thirds of what she'd earn in the
U.S.
But then she has a lot lower
overhead.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:13.530
Her malpractice premium is just
$1,400 a year, about a tenth of
what she would pay in the U.S.
And medical school didn't cost

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:20.900
her a penny.
In America, we have an image of
a doctor as a pretty rich
person.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:27.000
>> Yes.
>> REID: Drives a Lexus to the
country club and takes vacations
in Majorca, and stuff like that.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.530
>> It's been like this in
Germany until, I think, '80s,
the '80s, the last century,
perhaps '90s.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:38.430
But it's changed in the mid of
90 years, yes.
>> REID: Okay.
>> So you... a doctor normally

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:45.560
has a small car today.
But he still goes to Majorca.
>> REID: Still goes to Majorca,
yeah.

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:56.660
Skis in St Moritz?
>> No.
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> REID: But a lot of doctors

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:02.800
aren't laughing.
In March of 2006, they felt
sufficiently angry to stop work
and take to the streets in the

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:11.560
heart of Berlin.
Dr. Christina was one of them.
She marched three times that
Spring.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:22.600
>> I think about 18,000 or
20,000 doctors, and doctors
don't usually demonstrate.
But nothing changed.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:28.460
>> REID: For Americans there's
nothing particularly foreign
about German health care.
You get health insurance through

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:34.400
your employer and the company
makes you pay for it.
And the coverage is great.
They got mental, they got

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:40.160
surgical, they got dental.
If your doctor says you're
tired, the health insurance pays
to send you to a spa.

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.930
And the Germans have made this
work.
They provide universal coverage
for a lot less money than we do.

00:34:45.930 --> 00:34:51.560
They did it by taking the profit
out of health insurance, and
they also pay doctors a lot less
than we do.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:59.760
I think there's a lot here that
we could learn from.
In just three countries, I've
picked up lots of ideas.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:08.530
The Brits pay no doctor bills
and have great preventive care.
In Japan, there's no waiting
time and doctors still make

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:18.930
house calls.
In Germany, insurance companies
compete for business even though
they can't make a profit.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:24.660
What if you could pick and
choose the best ideas from
around the world?
Well, that's exactly what one

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:43.060
small Asian nation did.
Great
>> Thank you.
>> REID: Taiwan's an island

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:50.530
nation of about 23 million that
became rapidly industrialized
and went from poor to rich in
about 20 years.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:56.360
And when Taiwan got rich, the
government said, "Wait a minute,
we need a rich country's health
care system."

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:01.830
So you know what they did?
They set up a committee and they
looked all over the world at
different health care systems

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:09.160
looking for good ideas, and then
designed their own.
In the late 1980s, Taiwanese
health care was even worse than

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:17.600
America's is today.
About half the population had no
coverage at all.
Hongjen Chang was one of the

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.660
officials charged with designing
a new health care system from
scratch.
>> Taiwan is a small island.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:32.360
We always look abroad
internationally for ideas.
Chinese saying: we say, "The
track of the previous cart is

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:38.160
the teacher of the following
cart."
>> REID: So if the other guy's
oxcart has found a good route to

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:45.360
universal health coverage,
follow those tracks.
>> Follow those tracks.
If they were trapped in trouble,

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:52.460
avoid that track.
Find a new track.
>> NARRATOR: So they consulted
experts from around the world

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:59.400
and asked William Hsiao, a
Chinese-born Harvard health
economist, to head a blue ribbon
panel.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:07.530
>> Why do you want to repeat the
mistakes other people make?
You want to pick up what people
have done well and then move

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:12.800
beyond that.
>> REID: Another expert they
consulted was Taiwanese American
health economist Tsung-mei

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.030
Cheng.
How many different countries did
they look at, do you know?
>> Over ten.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:25.300
Maybe ten, 13, 15 countries they
looked at.
And so, in the end, the program
that they finally set up in 1995

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:39.130
really is like a car that was
made of different parts,
imported from overseas but
manufactured domestically.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:47.300
>> We examine quite extensive
the major systems of quite a
dozen-- Europe, British or
France, Germany and the Nordic

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:51.730
countries, Swiss or the Dutch
or America.
>> REID: Did you look at the
richest country in the world,

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:56.330
the United States?
>> Yes, yes, yes.
It was the best system in the
world, we<i> thought.</i>

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:01.800
>> REID: Yeah, you thought.
And when you studied it, what
did you find?
>> Well, American is not really

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:09.430
a system that you can copy.
It's a market.
So if you let things happen it
will be like the United States.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:18.160
There are many supporters.
But in the end we said, "No,
this is not the way we want to
go."

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:24.630
>> REID: They wanted a system
that gave everybody equal access
to health care, free choice of
doctors with no waiting time,

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:33.160
and a system that encouraged
lots of competition among
medical providers.
To finance the scheme, they

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:40.160
chose a national insurance
system that forced everybody to
join in and pay.
But Professor Hsiao thought

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:46.930
Taiwan could improve on other
countries like Japan and Germany
>> We try to correct their
mistakes.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:54.030
Japan has many funds.
>> REID: Yes.
>> And we unified it.
Germany let the rich people opt

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:59.700
out.
We do not let the rich people
opt out.
So we're building on what they

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:09.500
have done correctly, but trying
to overcome their deficiencies.
>> REID: The solution: to have
one government insurer

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:16.600
collecting the money and no
chance to opt out.
The result: a system that works
a bit like the U.S. Medicare

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:26.200
system for the elderly, and, in
fact, a lot like Canada's.
>> It has drug benefits, vision
care, traditional Chinese

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:32.330
medicine, kidney dialysis,
inpatient care, outpatient care;
just about everything under the
sun.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:42.030
>> REID: And to satisfy the
patients in Taiwan, there's no
gatekeeper and no waiting times.
Clinics are open on weekends.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:49.300
This street clinic was bustling
at 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon.
If I woke up in Taiwan some
morning and my shoulder is

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:53.930
really hurting, how long would
it take me to see an orthopedic
specialist?
>> We go now.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:59.100
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> REID: This morning I could
see one?
>> Yeah.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:04.000
>> REID: I don't have to go to a
GP and get a recommendation?
>> No, our people don't like the
idea of gatekeepers.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.230
They want to keep themselves...
they want to decide by
themselves.
>> REID: High-tech Taiwan

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:17.430
designed its new health system
using state of the art
information technology.
Everybody here has to have a

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:23.160
smart card like this to go to
the doctor.
The doc puts it in a reader and
the patient's history,

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:32.230
medications, et cetera, all show
up on the screen.
And then the bill goes directly
to the government insurance

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:37.160
office and is paid
automatically.
So Taiwan has the lowest
administrative costs in world,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:45.130
less than 2%.
Compare that to the endless
paperwork and all the denied
claims we get with for-profit

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:55.800
U.S. health insurance.
The smart card can also be used
in other ways.
>> If a patient goes to see a

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:06.500
doctor or hospital over 20 times
a month, or 50 times in a three-
month period, then the IT picks
that person out and the person

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:12.030
then gets a visit from the
government, the Bureau of
National Health Insurance, and
they have a little "chat."

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:23.000
And this works very well.
>> REID: That may be too much
like Big Brother to get by in
the U.S., but surveys show the

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.430
Taiwanese are highly satisfied
with their health care.
>> REID: How many people in
Taiwan every year go bankrupt

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:34.960
because of medical bills?
>> None.
>> REID: So the patients are
safe from bankruptcy.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:42.630
But just like Japan, the system
itself is under strain.
>> REID: How much of the
Taiwan's GDP are you spending on

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:50.160
health care?
>> We spend some 6.23%.
>> REID: And do you know the
number in America?

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:57.660
>> Yes, it's about 15%.
>> REID: 16%, yes, that's right.
So we spend too much on health
care and don't even cover

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:05.530
everybody.
But the Taiwanese spend too
little, less even than Japan.
They just don't bring in enough

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:12.560
money to pay for all the
services they offer.
>> So actually, as we speak, the
government is borrowing from

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:20.700
banks to pay what there isn't
enough to pay the providers.
>> REID: Taiwan's politicians
are reluctant to increase

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:27.500
premiums.
They think voters will punish
them.
So that's their problem.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:34.830
They know that the solution is
fairly straightforward: increase
the spending a little to maybe
8% of GDP.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:43.600
Now, there's a problem the U.S.
would love to have.
Like the other countries we've
seen, Taiwan is struggling to

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:53.060
balance the hopes of patients
and the expectations of doctors
against the price people are
willing to pay for health care.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:43:00.560
Before leaving Taiwan I tried
some acupuncture for my bum
shoulder.
I hurt it years ago in the navy.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:10.200
Of course, Chinese medicine is
covered by Taiwan's plan, too.
Taiwan's achievement got me
thinking about what it takes to

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:16.530
carry out health care reform.
But to create a universal health
system in an emerging Asian
nation is one thing.

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:24.300
To get there in a mature free
market economy is something
else.
So my final stop was in a

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:36.960
country more like us that did
take on health care reform.
Some people say it's politically
impossible to fix a health care

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:45.630
system.
And, in fact, the last time we
tried it in 1994, the result was
disastrous failure.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:51.500
But that same year here in
Switzerland, a country famous
for huge insurance companies and
drug companies, they did take on

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:58.130
health care reform and changed
the system.
Today they have universal
coverage with high quality.

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:06.630
We've come to Switzerland to see
why they made the change and how
it's working.
Like Americans, the Swiss tend

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:15.130
to think they're exceptional.
They don't follow the crowd.
It's a nation of eight million
people right at the center of

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:24.960
Europe, but it won't join the
European Union.
It denied women the vote until--
are you ready?-- 1971, and it

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:32.000
has higher gun ownership than
the U.S.A.
In 1994, Switzerland's health
care system resembled America's.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Medical insurance was voluntary,
generally linked to employment.
If you lost your job, you could
lose your coverage, and many

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:53.960
did.
Ruth Dreifuss back then was
health minister of the left-
leaning Social Democratic party,

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:59.200
and later the first female
president of the Swiss
Federation.
She spearheaded a new law called

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:04.460
LAMal, or the sickness.
It mandated that everybody buy
insurance with the state paying
for the poor.

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:09.460
In return, it guaranteed a
comprehensive package of medical
care for all.
Amid opposition from drug

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:19.330
companies and insurers the Swiss
voted in a referendum.
>> The difference between "yes"
and the "no" was a very tiny

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:28.960
one, a very slight one.
And the result was quite 50/50,
just with a little bit more on
the "yes" side so that the law

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:37.930
was passed.
>> REID: After that, insurance
companies could not cherry pick
the young and healthy to avoid

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:43.260
the old and the sick.
And they were not allowed to
make a profit on basic care,
although they could profit from

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:52.630
supplemental policies.
People who refused to get
coverage were automatically
assigned to an insurance

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:57.500
company and had to pay the
monthly bills.
More than ten years later, LAMal
is well accepted.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:10.260
Pascal Couchepin, from the
center-right Free Democratic
party, is the current president
of Switzerland.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.830
Originally unenthusiastic about
LAMal, today he's a supporter.
>> Everybody has a right to
health care.

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:18.830
>> REID: Yeah, now see, that's
striking for an American.
Because we would certainly say
everyone's entitled to an

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:22.760
education.
>> Yes.
>> Everyone is entitled to
legal protection if you get in

00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:28.930
trouble with the law.
But we don't say that everyone's
entitled to health care.
>> Why?

00:46:28.930 --> 00:46:37.030
Because it is a profound need
for people to be sure that if
they are struck by destiny, by a
stroke of destiny, they can have

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:47.130
a good health system?
>> REID: Dreifuss, from the
opposite political camp, agrees.
>> I think it's a basic human

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:53.630
right.
This is really the aim.
And this is really the reason
why I think that everybody now,

00:46:53.630 --> 00:47:01.930
a large, large majority, would
renew the confidence in this
system because they see what it
means to have a universal

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:11.730
coverage.
>> REID: But I wondered about
LAMal's impact on drug and
insurance companies.

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:21.360
Pierre Marcel Revaz is CEO of
Groupe Mutuel, one of
Switzerland's biggest insurance
companies.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:29.030
What's different here is that
many Swiss insurers were already
non-profit, so the
transformation was easier than

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:33.500
it might be for us.
Ten years on the insurers are
doing fine.
As in Germany, a lack of profit

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:59.760
has not meant a lack of
competition.
>> REID: The benefit package
here is fixed-- it's the same

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:04.230
for everybody-- so companies
compete in other ways.
Is this one of the ways you
compete with other companies?

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:22.000
You say, "We'll pay faster"?
Groupe Mutuel has a strong
incentive to keep administrative
costs low.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.860
>> REID: Do you know what that
figure is in American health
insurance companies?
The average administrative cost

00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:36.030
is about 22%, and you're running
at 5%.
But where the Swiss insurance
companies can make a profit is

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:43.700
on supplemental coverage for,
say, better hospital rooms.
This is also how they attract
more customers.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:50.930
But what about the drug
companies?
In America, the drug companies
say, "Well, if you cut the price

00:48:50.930 --> 00:49:01.160
we get for the drugs then we
won't have as much money for
research and innovation."
Is that a legitimate argument?

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.300
>> It was the same argument here
in Switzerland.
>> REID: I'm sure.
>> But I can say also that the

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:12.230
Swiss pharmaceutical industry
ten years after this struggle is
not bad.
In the international competition

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:23.500
I think the Swiss are still
belonging to the top ten.
And when you hear them, they are
not crying about the bad shape

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:37.030
of their industry.
>> REID: That may be because
Swiss drug companies still make
more than a third of their

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:43.260
profits from the less-regulated
U.S. market.
One of the problems we have in
America is that many people,

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:49.700
it's a huge number of people, go
bankrupt because of medical
bills.
Some studies say 700,000 people

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:55.800
a year.
How many people in Switzerland
go bankrupt because of medical
bills?

00:49:55.800 --> 00:50:02.700
>> Nobody.
Doesn't happen.
It would be a huge scandal if it
happens.

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:07.800
>> REID: But here's
Switzerland's challenge.
Having achieved universal health
care, it has to decide how much

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:16.630
citizens are willing to pay.
Today an average monthly premium
for a Swiss family is about
$750.

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:23.600
But there's pressure to raise
the premiums.
And it's already the second most
expensive health care system in

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.930
the world, although still much
cheaper than ours.
What's interesting about
Switzerland is that after

00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:37.460
LAMAal's success, people in this
proud capitalist country see
limits now to the free market.
Could a 100% free market system

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:46.200
work in health care?
>> No, I don't think so.
If you do that, you will lose
solidarity and equal access for

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:53.230
everybody.
>> REID: Which is what you were
finding in the late '80s.
>> Yes.

00:50:53.230 --> 00:51:11.000
We think that is a basic value
of living in our society.
>> My plan combines employers
and individual responsibility

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.260
while maintaining Medicare and
Medicaid.
I think this whole idea...
>> REID: Back in the U.S., in an

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:23.030
election year, everybody's
talking about health care.
>> My belief is that if we make
it affordable, if we provide

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:29.430
subsidies to those who can't
afford it, they will buy it.
>> REID: Although, if you listen
carefully, none of the

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:35.730
candidates talks about the
lessons we could learn from
other rich democracies, like the
ones I visited.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:43.060
>> The solution, my friends,
isn't a one size fits all, big
government takeover of health
care.

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:49.360
>> REID: What I've found is that
it's not all socialized medicine
out there.
Many countries provide universal

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:56.930
coverage with private insurance,
private doctors, private
hospitals, using market ideas
that might work for us.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:03.900
But here's the thing.
These capitalist countries don't
trust health care entirely to
the free market.

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:17.160
They all impose limits.
There are three big ones.
First, insurance companies must
accept everyone and can't make a

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:25.630
profit on basic care.
Second, everybody's mandated to
buy insurance and the government
pays the premium for the poor.

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:35.030
Third, doctors and hospitals
have to accept one standard set
of fixed prices.
Can Americans accept ideas like

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:44.330
that?
>> Just came in to get your
temperature and your blood
pressure.

00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:48.900
>> REID: Well, the fact is these
foreign health care ideas aren't
really so foreign to us.
For American veterans, health

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:59.100
care is just like Britain's NHS.
For seniors on Medicare, we're
Taiwan.
For working Americans with

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:09.030
insurance, we're Germany.
And for the tens of million
without health insurance, we're
just another poor country.

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:20.430
(<i> sirens blaring</i> )
But almost all of us can agree
that this fragmented health care
mess cannot be ignored.

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:50.560
The longer we leave it, the
sicker it becomes and the more
expensive the cure.
