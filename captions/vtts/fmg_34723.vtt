00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
*

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
ALL ROCKS HAVE
STORIES TO TELL.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
MINERALS MAKE UP ROCKS.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
THERE'S A LOT OF MINERALS
THAT ARE USED IN ECONOMY

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
OR INDUSTRY.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
GOLD, SILVER, LEAD, ZINC...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
THERE ARE ALSO SOME
VERY BEAUTIFUL ROCKS.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I LOVE BEAUTIFUL MINERALS.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
ROCKS TELL AN
INCREDIBLE STORY.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
THEY TELL THE STORY OF
THE HISTORY OF THE PLANET

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL
BILLION YEARS.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
THE EARTH IS MADE OF ROCK,
FROM THE TALLEST MOUNTAINS

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
TO THE FLOOR OF
THE DEEPEST OCEAN.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
GEOLOGISTS STUDY THE ROCKS
TO LEARN ABOUT OUR PLANET

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
AND THE VARIOUS
PROCESSES AND EVENTS

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
THAT HAVE TAKEN PLACE.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
SCIENTISTS READ ROCKS
BECAUSE ROCKS TELL US

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
THE HISTORY
OF THE EARTH.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
THEY KIND OF RECORD THE
EVENTS OF THE EARTH,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER
GEOLOGICAL TIME.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
THAT'S THE GREAT THING
ABOUT GEOLOGY IS THAT

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
THESE MOMENTS ARE
RECORDED IN ROCK.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
YOU CAN SEE DROPLETS
OF RAIN AND YOU CAN SEE

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
DINOSAUR FOOTPRINTS
IN THE ROCK

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
WHICH IS JUST
FASCINATING.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
IT'S MORE THAN JUST
RECORDING FOSSILS,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
IT RECORDS
MOMENTS IN TIME.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
BUT BEFORE WE CAN UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING ABOUT ROCKS

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT MINERALS ARE.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
ROCKS AND MINERALS

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
IS THAT MINERALS
MAKE UP ROCKS.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY THE
BUILDING BLOCKS OF ROCKS.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
SO THE SAME WAY THAT,
SAY, THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
BETWEEN A POTATO
AND A STEW, RIGHT?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
BECAUSE A STEW IS MADE UP OF
ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
- VEGETABLES AND
BROTH AND POTATOES -

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
IN THE SAME WAY THAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
MINERALS AND ROCKS.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
ROCKS ARE MADE UP OF
DIFFERENT KINDS OF MINERALS.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
MANY PEOPLE ARE USED TO
HEARING THE WORD "MINERAL"

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR
JAR OF DAILY VITAMINS.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
THOSE ARE NOT MINERALS,
THOSE ARE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
WHILE ROCKS ARE MADE OF
MINERALS, MINERALS ARE

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
MADE OF CHEMICAL ELEMENTS
- ESSENTIALLY ATOMS

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
SUCH AS CARBON,
IRON, OR CALCIUM.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
CURRENTLY WE KNOW OF
AT LEAST 113 ELEMENTS

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
AND AT LEAST 92 OF THESE ARE
NATURALLY OCCURRING ON EARTH.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
MANY ARE VALUABLE
RESOURCES.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
IT'S VERY INTERESTING WHEN
YOU LOOK AT ALL OF THE

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
RESOURCES THAT WE USE
IN EVERYDAY LIFE,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
THEY'RE MOSTLY MADE UP OF
THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
VERY MINOR ABUNDANCES,
LIKE THE GOLD IN MY RING

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
OR ANY OF THE
METALS THAT WE USE.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU
HAVE A RACING BIKE

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
IT'S MADE OUT OF
A TITANIUM ALLOY.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
THESE ARE ALL ELEMENTS
THAT ARE PRESENT IN VERY

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
TINY ABUNDANCES AND THERE
ARE VARIOUS DIFFERENT

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
PROCESSES ON EARTH THAT
HAVE CONCENTRATED THOSE

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
ELEMENTS LOCALLY, BUT IF YOU
LOOK AT THE ENTIRE PLANET

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
IT'S REALLY JUST A FEW
ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
MOST OF OUR GLOBE.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
AS THE EARTH FORMED, MANY
OF THE HEAVIER ELEMENTS

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
SUCH AS IRON AND NICKEL
WERE DRAWN TO THE CENTER

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
WHILE LIGHTER ELEMENTS
FLOATED TO THE TOP

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
TO FORM THE CRUST.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THE CRUST IS MADE UP OF
MAINLY EIGHT ELEMENTS:

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
IF WE LOOK AT THE
ELEMENTS THAT MAKE UP

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
THE EARTH'S CRUST THERE'S
REALLY ONLY EIGHT ELEMENTS

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
OF THE 92 NATURALLY
OCCURRING ELEMENTS

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
THAT MAKE UP
THE EARTH'S CRUST.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
THE TWO MOST ABUNDANT THAT
MAKE UP ROUGHLY ABOUT 75%

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
ARE OXYGEN BEING THE MOST
ABUNDANT AT ABOUT 46%

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
AND SILICA.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
BECAUSE THOSE TWO
ELEMENTS ARE THE

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
DOMINANT COMPONENTS
OF THE EARTH'S CRUST,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
LOGICALLY THEY MAKE UP
THE BUILDING BLOCKS

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
FOR ABOUT 95% OF THE
MINERALS WE FIND

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
IN THE EARTH'S CRUST - IN
THE ROCK-FORMING MINERALS.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
ROCK-FORMING MINERALS THAT
CONTAIN OXYGEN AND SILICA

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
ARE CALLED "SILICATES".

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
MOST MINERALS ARE
USUALLY A COMBINATION OF

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
TWO OR MORE ELEMENTS
AND ARE REPRESENTED BY

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
THE CHEMICAL SYMBOL OF
THE COMBINED ELEMENTS.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS A
CRYSTAL OF THE MINERAL QUARTZ.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
IT'S ONE SINGLE
GRAIN OF QUARTZ.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
QUARTZ IS A MINERAL, IT HAS
A FIXED CHEMICAL FORMULA

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
- SIO2 -
SILICON DIOXIDE.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
EACH OF THE SILICATE
MINERALS CONTAINS

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
OXYGEN AND SILICON
AND PERHAPS

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
ONE OR MORE
ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
AND THEY MAKE UP
THREE-FOURTHS

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
OF THE EARTH'S
CONTINENTAL CRUST.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
HOWEVER, THERE ARE ALSO
NON-SILICATE GROUPS

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
AND WHILE THEY MAKE UP
ONLY ONE-FOURTH OF THE

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
CONTINENTAL CRUST, THESE
MINERALS ARE USED IN MANY

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
IMPORTANT WAYS FROM BUILDING
MATERIALS LIKE CEMENT

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
AND DRYWALL TO ELECTRICAL
CONDUCTORS AND STEEL.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
SOME OF THE NON-SILICATE
MINERAL GROUPS INCLUDE:

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
CARBONATES INCLUDE
MINERALS LIKE CALCITE,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
ALSO KNOWN AS CALCIUM
CARBONATE WHICH IS A MAJOR

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
COMPONENT IN ROCKS LIKE
MARBLE AND LIMESTONE.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
IT IS ALSO THE PRIMARY
MINERAL IN CAVE FORMATIONS.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
THERE ARE SOME
MINERAL-TYPE DEPOSITS

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
THAT ARE MORE
COMMON IN CAVES -

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
YOUR STALACTITES
AND STALAGMITES.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
THAT'S BASICALLY
CALCIUM CARBONATE

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
BUT THAT'S WHAT REEF
ROCK IS MADE OUT OF.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
ALL YOUR LIMESTONE,
THAT'S CALCIUM CARBONATE.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
WHEN YOU GO TO PLACES LIKE
YELLOWSTONE AND YOU SEE

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
ALL THE TRAVERTINE
DEPOSITS COMING OUT OF THE

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
HOT SPRINGS, MOST OF THAT
IS ALSO CALCIUM CARBONATE.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
SO THEY TAKE DIFFERENT
FORMS BUT YOU'RE STILL

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
RESTRICTED BY THE
SAME SET OF MINERALS.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
SULFATES INCLUDING GYPSUM
CAN ALSO BE SEEN BEST

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
UNDERGROUND WHERE
THEY CAN TAKE ON

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
RARE AND UNUSUAL
FORMATIONS.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
YOU DO SEE SOME MORE
ODDBALL THINGS LIKE

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
THE GIANT GYPSUM
CHANDELIERS.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE
BIG CELANITE NEEDLES

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
AND THERE'S VERY FEW
PLACES, PARTICULARLY ON

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH,
THAT YOU SEE THAT BECAUSE

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
CELANITE, WHICH IS MADE UP
OF THE SAME STUFF AS GYPSUM,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
THE CALCIUM SULFATE,
IS EXTREMELY SOLUBLE.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
THIS IS THE SAME STUFF THAT
THEY MAKE DRYWALL OUT OF.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
IT'S VERY, VERY SOLUBLE
IN WATER SO ON THE SURFACE

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
WHERE YOU'VE GOT RAIN
YOU JUST DON'T SEE IT.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
BUT UNDERGROUND WHERE
YOU'RE ACTUALLY PROTECTED

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
BY ALL THOSE LAYERS OF
ROCK YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
LARGE DISPLAYS OF VERY BIG
CRYSTALS AND THERE'S VERY

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
FEW PLACES IN THE WORLD
THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
SEE THOSE PRESERVED,
WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
WALK BY AND
TAKE A LOOK.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
OTHER NON-SILICATE
MINERALS INCLUDE

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
HALIDES SUCH AS SALT,
OXIDES LIKE ICE AND IRON,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
AND SULFIDES SUCH
AS ORE OF COPPER.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
AS WELL AS NATIVE
ELEMENTS WHICH ARE

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
CALLED "PURE" ELEMENTS
BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
FROM ONLY ONE ELEMENT
SUCH AS GOLD AND DIAMONDS.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
A MINERAL BY DEFINITION
MUST SATISFY FIVE CONDITIONS:

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
SO IF WE TAKE THAT SORT
OF TEXTBOOK DEFINITION AND

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE
BIT, A MINERAL HAS TO BE

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
NATURALLY OCCURRING, SO IT
CAN'T BE A MAN-MADE THING

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
LIKE CUBIC ZIRCONIUM OR
AN INDUSTRIAL DIAMOND

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
OR INDUSTRIAL RUBY.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
IT HAS TO BE
SOMETHING THAT'S

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
ACTUALLY MADE
BY THE EARTH.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
TO BE INORGANIC MEANS
THAT IT WAS NEVER ALIVE

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
AND CANNOT BE MADE FROM
PLANT OR ANIMAL MATERIAL.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
SO, IF YOU FOUND A SHELL
- A SHELL IS NOT A ROCK

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
BECAUSE IT'S
MADE ORGANICALLY,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
BUT THE CONSTITUENTS OF THAT
SHELL - CALCIUM CARBONATE,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
THE CALCIUM CARBONATE
MINERAL, CALCITE -

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
THAT IS A MINERAL
BUT THE SHELL ITSELF

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
ISN'T A MINERAL.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
THEY MUST BE A SOLID
ELEMENT OR COMPOUND

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
SO LIQUIDS
ARE NOT MINERALS.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
THEY MUST HAVE A
DEFINITE COMPOSITION,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
MEANING THE CHEMICAL
ANALYSIS OF A GIVEN MINERAL

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
WILL ALWAYS PRODUCE THE
SAME RATIO OF ELEMENTS.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
FOR EXAMPLE, QUARTZ
WILL ALWAYS HAVE

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
ONE SILICON ATOM FOR
EVERY TWO OXYGEN ATOMS.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
IT HAS TO HAVE A DEFINITE
SET OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
AND CHEMICAL PROPERTIES.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
IT CAN'T VARY IN ITS
CHEMISTRY TOO MUCH.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
MINERALS ARE IN ESSENCE
JUST CHEMICALS

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
BUT THEY'RE
CRYSTALLINE CHEMICALS.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
THEY MUST HAVE A REGULAR
INTERNAL CRYSTAL STRUCTURE

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
WHICH MEANS THE ATOMS
ARE ARRANGED IN A

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE
IN A REPEATING PATTERN.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
MINERALS ALSO HAVE
CERTAIN PROPERTIES

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
THAT HELP US
CLARIFY THEM.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
WE CLASSIFY THEM IN
TERMS OF THINGS LIKE

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
THEIR HARDNESS, HOW THEY
BREAK WHICH IS CALLED

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
THEIR CLEAVAGE, WHETHER
THEY LEAVE A STREAK

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
OF A DIFFERENT COLOR IF
YOU TRY TO WRITE WITH THEM

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
ON A PIECE OF
WHITE CERAMIC.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
AND ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT
PROPERTIES THAT WE USE

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
TO CLASSIFY THEM ARE
REALLY TELLING US ABOUT

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
THE CRYSTALLINE ARRANGEMENT
OF ALL OF THOSE ATOMS.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
CRYSTAL FORM REFERS TO THE
INTERNAL ORDERLY ARRANGEMENTS

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
OF ATOMS, BUT ALSO GENERALLY
RESULTS IN A CRYSTAL

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
WITH WELL-FORMED FACES,
LIKE IN THIS QUARTZ GRAIN.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
THESE GREW NATURALLY.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY
CUT WITH A SAW, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
AND THE CRYSTAL FACES
TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE
SILICON AND OXYGEN ATOMS

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
IN THE CRYSTAL LATTICE
FOR THE MINERAL QUARTZ.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
THE STANDARD SCALE FOR
HARDNESS WAS DEVELOPED

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
BY FRIEDRICH MOHS IN 1812
AND REALLY REFLECTS

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
THE STRENGTH OF WHAT ARE
CALLED COVALENT BONDS -

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
THE CHEMICAL LINK BETWEEN
ATOMS AND THE MINERAL.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
THE STANDARD MINERALS
MAKING UP THE MOHS SCALE

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
OF HARDNESS ARE FROM THE
SOFTEST, TALC, TO THE

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
HARDEST, DIAMOND, WHICH IS
THE HARDEST MINERAL ON EARTH

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
BECAUSE OF THE BONDS
BETWEEN THE CARBON ATOMS.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
EVERY CARBON ATOM IS VERY
TIGHTLY BONDED TO EVERY

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
OTHER CARBON ATOM BY WHAT
ARE CALLED COVALENT BONDS.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
AND IT TAKES AN ENORMOUS
AMOUNT OF ENERGY

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
TO BREAK THOSE
COVALENT BONDS.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
AND BECAUSE EVERY CARBON
IS CONNECTED TO EVERY

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
OTHER ONE BY COVALENT
BONDS IT GIVES THE MINERAL

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
ITS INCREDIBLE
HARDNESS AND STRENGTH

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
THAT YOU JUST CANNOT BREAK
THOSE BONDS VERY READILY.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
BECAUSE BONDING IS NOT
ALWAYS OF EQUAL STRENGTH

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
IN MOST CRYSTALS, SOME
WILL TEND TO BREAK.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
WHERE YOU HAVE A PLANE
OF WEAK BONDS YOU CAN

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
BREAK THAT MINERAL
VERY EASILY

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
AND HENCE IT HAS A
VERY GOOD CLEAVAGE.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
FOR EXAMPLE, THE MICAS
- BIOTITE OR MUSCOVITE -

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
MOST KIDS HAVE PROBABLY
PICKED UP A BOOK OF MICA

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
AND FOUND THEY CAN
PEEL THE SHEETS AWAY.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
THE SHEETS THEMSELVES,
AGAIN THE BONDS ARE

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
VERY STRONG WITHIN A
SHEET, BUT EACH SHEET IS

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
HELD TO THE NEXT ONE BY
VERY, VERY WEAK BONDS

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
AND YOU CAN BREAK THEM
WITH YOUR FINGERS.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
COLOR ALSO CAN BE HIGHLY
VARIABLE IN MINERALS

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
DEPENDING ON VARIOUS
IMPURITIES THAT MIGHT

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
GET INTO THE
CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
QUARTZ, FOR EXAMPLE,
CAN BE CLEAR AS GLASS

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
BUT IT CAN ALSO BE
PURPLE SUCH AS AMETHYST

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
WHICH YOU MIGHT
FIND IN A GEODE.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
IT CAN BE BLACK,
IT CAN BE BROWN,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
IT CAN BE ANY
VARIETY OF COLORS.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
PINK IN ROSE QUARTZ, FOR
EXAMPLE, OR IT CAN BE

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
A DULL GRAY AS
IN SMOKY QUARTZ.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
SO, MINERALS, DEPENDING
ON A DASH OF THIS AND A

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
SPRINKLING OF THAT, CAN
HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
STREAK, LUSTER, AS WELL AS
TASTE OR EVEN ELASTICITY

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
AND MAGNETISM, ARE ALL
HELPFUL PROPERTIES WHEN

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
IDENTIFYING THE DIFFERENT
AND OFTEN QUITE BEAUTIFUL

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
MINERALS AND
VALUABLE GEM STONES.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
GEMS ARE SIMPLY MINERALS
THAT HAVE SOME SPECIAL

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
COMMERCIAL VALUE BECAUSE
OF THEIR GREAT BEAUTY AND

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH
THEM AND CUT FACETS IN THEM

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
WHICH IS ENHANCED
BY THE ORIENTATION

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
OF THE CHEMICAL BONDING
IN THOSE MINERALS.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
CERTAINLY SOME OF
THEM HAVE SOME VALUE

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
OTHER THAN JUST AS
THINGS OF BEAUTY.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE
COMPUTER CHIP INDUSTRY

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
AND SO ON AND FOR
MAKING SEMICONDUCTORS

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
BUT AS GEM STONES REALLY
THEIR VALUE IS PURELY

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
HOW HUMANS PLACE VALUE
JUDGMENTS ON THEM.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
A ROCK IS BASICALLY A
COMBINATION OF ONE OR MORE

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
MINERALS, BUT IT IS
MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
ROCKS CONTAIN INFORMATION
ABOUT THE EARTH,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
ABOUT THE PROCESSES
THAT PRODUCE THEM

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
AND THE HISTORY
OF THE ENVIRONMENTS

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
THAT CHANGE THEM.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY
DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROCKS.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
WHAT WE DO TO CLASSIFY
A ROCK IS LOOK AT ITS

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
MINERAL CONTENT, LOOK
AT WHAT TYPE OF MINERAL

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
IS IN IT AND HOW
MUCH OF IT IS IN IT

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
IN ORDER TO DETERMINE
WHAT KIND OF ROCK IT IS.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
AND THE CHEMISTRY OF
THE MINERALS THEMSELVES

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
WILL DEPEND ON HOW
AND WHAT ENVIRONMENT

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
THEY WERE FORMED.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
WHETHER IT WAS VOLCANIC,
WHETHER IT WAS SOMEWHERE

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
IN THE DEEP SEA WHERE THERE
WAS A LOT OF WATER INPUT

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
- THESE ARE ALL THINGS
THAT WILL DETERMINE

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
HOW THOSE ELEMENTS
WILL COME TOGETHER.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
THERE ARE THREE
TYPES OF ROCKS.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
ALL ROCKS CAN BE
CLASSIFIED IN THIS WAY.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
WE HAVE IGNEOUS ROCKS,
SEDIMENTARY, AND METAMORPHIC.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
IGNEOUS ARE LIKE
THE BIRTH OF A ROCK.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
THEY'RE FORMED FROM MAGMA
WHICH IS LIQUID ROCK

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
THAT COOLS AND SOLIDIFIES
AND FORMS AN IGNEOUS ROCK.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
AND THAT CAN HAPPEN
UNDERGROUND OR IT CAN HAPPEN

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
WHEN THEY ERUPT OUT OF
A VOLCANO AND FORM LAVA.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IGNEOUS
ROCKS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
A GROUP OR FAMILY OF ROCKS
THAT CONTAIN MANY, MANY,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
MANY DIFFERENT VARIETIES
OF IGNEOUS ROCK.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
BUT THERE'S
TWO MAIN GROUPS

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
WE CAN LUMP
IGNEOUS ROCKS INTO.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED
EXTRUSIVE OR VOLCANIC

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
IGNEOUS ROCKS, AND THESE
ARE IGNEOUS ROCKS THAT FORM

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
AS A RESULT OF LAVA
BEING EXTRUDED ON THE

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
EARTH'S SURFACE AND
COOLING AND CRYSTALLIZING

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
VERY RAPIDLY ON THE
EARTH'S SURFACE.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
AND SO WHAT HAPPENS
IS THAT THESE MELTS

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
WHEN THEY ERUPT
FROM A VOLCANIC VENT

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
THEY'RE SO STICKY THEY
CAN'T REALLY FLOW ANYWHERE

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
AND THEY'RE SO VISCOUS
THAT ALL OF THE

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
CHEMICAL ATOMS IN THEM
FORM INTO MOLECULES

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
AND GET TANGLED UP
WITH EACH OTHER

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
AND THEY CAN'T MAKE NICE
CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURES.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
AND SO IT JUST QUENCHES
AS IS, AS A GLASS.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
IGNEOUS ROCKS THAT COOL
AND CRYSTALLIZE VERY SLOWLY

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
WITHIN THE CRUST OF THE
EARTH ARE CALLED INTRUSIVE

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
OR PLUTONIC IGNEOUS
ROCKS AND AN EXAMPLE

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
OF AN INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS
ROCK WOULD BE GRANITE.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
GRANITE IS THE MOST
COMMON FORM OF

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
INTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCK.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
THE YOSEMITE AREA OF THE
SIERRA NEVADA IS MOSTLY

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
ALL GRANITE, FORMED DEEP
WITHIN THE EARTH AND THEN

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
EXPOSED LATER BY SURFACE
PROCESSES LIKE EROSION.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
SEDIMENTARY ROCKS OFTEN
START AS FRAGMENTS OF

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
EXISTING ROCKS ON THE
SURFACE OF THE EARTH.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
WHAT HAPPENS ON THE
SURFACE IS IT'S EXPOSED

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
TO THE ELEMENTS -
EXPOSED TO WATER

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
AND ALL THE STUFF
THAT'S IN WATER,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
IT'S EXPOSED TO ALL
THESE CHEMICALS AND AIR

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
AND EVENTUALLY IT
ERODES, IT WEATHERS.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
SO THE ROCK BREAKS DOWN,
ITS MINERALS BREAK DOWN,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
AND EVENTUALLY IT GETS
TRANSPORTED BY WATER

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
TO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
SO ALL THAT STUFF
YOU SEE IN STREAMS

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
AND OCEANS AND LAKES
- THE SAND, THE CLAY -

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
THOSE ARE BITS OF
BROKEN DOWN ROCK.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
THESE ROCK FRAGMENTS CALLED
"SEDIMENT" ARE EVENTUALLY

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
DEPOSITED IN LAKES,
VALLEYS, SEAS, AND OCEANS.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
WHEN BURIED, THE SEDIMENTS
LOSE WATER AND ARE

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
ESSENTIALLY GLUED
BACK TOGETHER.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT A
SEDIMENTARY ROCK WITHOUT

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
TALKING ABOUT THE
ENVIRONMENT IT FORMED IT.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
WAS IT AN OCEAN?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
WAS IT A LAKE?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
WAS IT A RIVER?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
WAS IT A DESERT?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
WAS IT, YOU KNOW, YOU
CAN'T DISCUSS IT WITHOUT

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
REALLY HAVING A GOOD
IDEA OF ALL THE ELEMENTS

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
THAT CAME INTO PLAY
IN ITS FORMATION.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
THEY'RE ALL FORMED IN A
PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENT -

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
A LAKE, A SHALLOW MARINE
SETTING NEAR A BEACH,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
OR IN A STREAM.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
AND ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PARTS ABOUT

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
STUDYING SEDIMENTARY ROCKS
OF ANCIENT EARTH IS THAT

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
THEY CAN TELL US A GREAT
DEAL ABOUT WHAT THE EARTH

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
LOOKED LIKE AT THAT
PARTICULAR TIME

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
BY UNDERSTANDING WHAT
THE ENVIRONMENT WAS.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
WAS IT A SWAMP?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
WAS IT A LAKE?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000
WAS IT A STREAM?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
IN THE SEDIMENTARY
ROCK FAMILY

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000
THERE ARE TWO
MAIN SUBGROUPS.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
THERE ARE DETRITAL
SEDIMENTARY ROCKS

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
AND CHEMICAL
SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
DETRITAL SEDIMENTARY
ROCKS ARE FORMED FROM THE

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
LEFTOVER FRAGMENTS,
DETRITUS, OF OTHER ROCKS.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
THERE'S MUDSTONE,
THERE'S SANDSTONE.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
THOSE NAMES COME FROM
THE SIZE OF THE CLASS

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
OF A ROCK.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE
DETRITAL SEDIMENTARY

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
ROCK CONGLOMERATE
ARE MADE OF FRAGMENTS

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
THAT ARE TWO MILLIMETERS
OR GREATER IN SIZE.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
SAND ARE FRAGMENTS THAT
RANGE IN SIZE BETWEEN

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
ONE-SIXTEENTH AND ABOUT
TWO MILLIMETERS IN SIZE.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
SILT RANGES IN SIZE
FROM ABOUT 1/16TH TO

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
1/256THS OF A MILLIMETER,
AND CLAYS ARE REALLY TINY.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
THAT'S ANYTHING LESS
THAN ABOUT 1/256THS

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
OF A MILLIMETER.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
SO DETRITAL SEDIMENTARY
ROCKS ARE BASED

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
AND CLASSIFIED
BY GRAIN SIZE.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER
ABOUT SEDIMENTARY ROCKS

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
IS THAT THERE'S A
PART OF THEM WHICH IS

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
NOT FORMED BY
THE DETRITUS,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
THE ERODED MATERIAL
OF OTHER ROCKS, BUT

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
ARE FORMED BY BIOCHEMICAL
AND CHEMICAL MEANS.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
AND THESE ARE VERY
IMPORTANT SETS OF ROCKS,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
ESPECIALLY OUR CARBONATES,
OUR LIMESTONES,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
AND MOST OF
THOSE ARE FORMED

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
INDIRECTLY OR
DIRECTLY FROM LIFE,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
FROM THE HARD PARTS OF
VARIOUS FORMS OF LIFE.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
FROM SHELLS ON THE BEACH
TO VARIOUS KINDS OF PLANTS

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
THAT HAVE ESSENTIALLY SPINES
OF HARD SKELETAL PARTS,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
TO BONES FROM VERTEBRATES
AND ANY OF THOSE THINGS

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
THAT ACCUMULATE IN LAYERS
OR ARE MIXED WITH DETRITUS

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
GIVE US A KIND OF
SEDIMENTARY ROCK THAT

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
IS FORMED FUNDAMENTALLY
BY BIOLOGICAL REMAINS.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
AND USUALLY IT'S THE
MINERAL COMPOSITION

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
WHICH WILL IDENTIFY IT.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
FOR EXAMPLE,
CALCIUM CARBONATE.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
ROCKS MADE OF THIS
PARTICULAR MINERAL

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
ARE USUALLY
CALLED LIMESTONE.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
ROCKS MADE OF THE
MINERAL HALIDE,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
WHICH IS
COMMON TABLE SALT,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
ARE WHAT ARE
CALLED "EVAPORATES"

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE MADE
CHEMICALLY THEY FALL UNDER

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
THE SUBGROUP OF CHEMICAL
SEDIMENTARY ROCKS.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
METAMORPHIC ROCKS
ARE ALSO FORMED BY

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
THE MODIFICATION OF
A PRE-EXISTING ROCK,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
BUT THIS TIME BY HEAT
AND PRESSURE ON THE ROCK.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
IF WE TAKE THAT ROCK NOW
AND WE BURY IT VERY DEEPLY,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
MAYBE WE TAKE IT
DOWN A SUBDUCTION ZONE

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
OR WE SLAM TWO CONTINENTS
INTO EACH OTHER

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
AND WE BURY THE ROCKS
AND HEAT THEM UP -

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT
FORMS METAMORPHIC ROCKS.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
THOSE PRESSURES AND
TEMPERATURES EVENTUALLY,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
IF THEY'RE DEEP ENOUGH IN
THE EARTH, CAUSE THE ROCK

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
TO CHANGE AGAIN - CAUSES
THE CHEMISTRY TO WANT TO

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000
REARRANGE ITSELF
TO ACCOMMODATE

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
THOSE TEMPERATURES
AND PRESSURES.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN THE MINERALS

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
ARE PUSHED UPON, BASICALLY.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
LITERALLY JUST PRESSURE
PUSHES UPON THEM UNTIL

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
THEY ROTATE IN A
PREFERRED DIRECTION.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
THIS PROCESS CAUSES MANY
CHANGES IN THE ROCK,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
INCLUDING A
CHANGE IN DENSITY;

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
GROWTH OF
LARGER CRYSTALS;

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF
LOW TEMPERATURE MINERALS

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
INTO HIGH
TEMPERATURE MINERALS.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
THESE METAMORPHIC
ROCKS ARE THEN DIVIDED

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
INTO TWO GROUPS:
FOLIATED AND NON-FOLIATED.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
SO METAMORPHIC ROCKS ACTUALLY
GO THROUGH GRADATIONS

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
DEPENDING ON THE TYPE
OF METAMORPHIC ROCK.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
FOLIATED METAMORPHIC ROCKS
WHICH USUALLY START OUT AS

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
A CLAY-RICH SHALE WILL GO
FROM LOW GRADE TO HIGH GRADE.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
AN EXAMPLE OF A LOW-GRADE
METAMORPHIC ROCK

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
WOULD BE SLATE.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
JUST LIKE YOU'D GO
DOWN AND BUY SLATE TILE

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
AT THE HARDWARE STORE AND
TILE YOUR FLOOR WITH IT.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000
NON-FOLIATED METAMORPHIC
ROCKS INCLUDE THINGS

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
LIKE MARBLE.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000
IF YOU TAKE THE CHEMICAL
SEDIMENTARY ROCK LIMESTONE

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
AND SUBJECT THAT TO
HEAT AND PRESSURE,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
YOU'LL FORM MARBLE WHICH
MOST PEOPLE KNOW IS A ROCK

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
USED IN ARCHITECTURAL
OR ARTISTIC ENTERPRISES.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
ROCKS ON THE EARTH'S
SURFACE VARY IN AGE FROM

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
LESS THAN ONE MILLION YEARS
OLD TO OVER THREE BILLION.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
BUT ALL ARE MUCH
YOUNGER THAN THE

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
4.6 BILLION
YEAR OLD EARTH.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
THE REASON ROCKS ARE
YOUNGER THAN THE EARTH

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000
IS BECAUSE THEY
ARE RECYCLED.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
FROM IGNEOUS TO
SEDIMENTARY TO METAMORPHIC

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
AND BACK AGAIN, THE
EARTH'S ROCKS AND MINERALS

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
CHANGE OVER AND OVER IN
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
IN WHAT WE CALL
"THE ROCK CYCLE".

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
THE ROCK CYCLE IS A
REPRESENTATION OF

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
HOW DYNAMIC THE
EARTH IS, REALLY.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
ROCKS ARE IN A CONSTANT
STATE OF CHANGE,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
A CONSTANT
STATE OF FLUX.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
SO THIS IGNEOUS ROCK
WAS ON THE SURFACE,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
IT GETS BROKEN
DOWN INTO SEDIMENT,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
SEDIMENT GETS WASHED
INTO AN OCEAN OR LAKE

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
AND THERE IT FORMS
SEDIMENTARY ROCK

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
AND THEN IT GETS
METAMORPHOSED AND THEN

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
IF IT'S BURIED DEEP ENOUGH
IT GETS TURNED BACK

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
INTO MAGMA AND THEN
IT COMES BACK AGAIN.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
SO THAT'S WHAT WE REFER
TO AS THE "ROCK CYCLE".

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
SO THESE SAME ELEMENTS,
THESE SAME OXYGENS

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
AND SILICAS AND CARBONS
GET PUT INTO THIS CYCLE

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
AND GET REFORMED AND PUT
BACK IN AND REFORMED.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
TO US AS HUMANS WE THINK
ROCKS ARE IMMUTABLE.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
THEY'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
THEY'RE HERE FOREVER.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
BUT INDEED ROCKS
ARE ALWAYS CHANGING.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
ROCKS ARE ERODING TO
BECOME SEDIMENTARY ROCKS,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
OR ROCKS ARE BEING HEATED
AND CHANGED TO BECOME

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
METAMORPHIC ROCKS, OR
ROCKS ARE BEING MELTED

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
AND RECRYSTALLIZED TO
BECOME IGNEOUS ROCKS.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
THE ROCK CYCLE IS A
REPRESENTATION OF THIS

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
DYNAMIC NATURE, OF
EARTH'S DYNAMIC NATURE.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
THE EARTH'S CRUST IS
VERY THIN COMPARED TO

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
THE REST OF THE EARTH
BUT IT CONTAINS THE ROCKS

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
AND MINERALS PROVIDING
US INVALUABLE RESOURCES

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
FOR ECONOMY, RECREATION,
AND INFORMATION

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:38.000
ABOUT THE INTRICATE HISTORY
OF OUR PLANET EARTH.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:51.000
*

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.000
*

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000
*
