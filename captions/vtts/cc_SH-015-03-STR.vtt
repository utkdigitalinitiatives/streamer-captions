00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530


2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.600


3
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.700
Use me well in it.

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.270
Sister, prove such a wife as mythoughts make thee

5
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.100
and as my uarthest band shallpass on thy approof.

6
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.970
Most noble Antony, let not thepiece of virtue,

7
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.030
which is set betwixt us as thecement of our love,

8
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.670
to keep it builded, be the ramto batter the fortress of it.

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.570
For better might we have lovedwithout this mean

10
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.530
if on both parts this be notcherished.

11
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.670
Make me not offended in yourdistrust.

12
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.170
I have said.

13
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.970
You shall not find, though yoube therein curious,

14
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.530
the least cause for what youseem to fear.

15
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.600
So the gods keep you

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.330
and make the hearts of Romansserve your ends.

17
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.030
We will here part.

18
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.770
Farewell, my dearest sister.

19
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.630
Fare thee well.

20
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.370
The elements be kind to thee

21
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.470
and make thy spirits all ofcomfort.

22
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.030
Fare thee well.

23
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.800
My noble brother.

24
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.230
The April's in her eyes.

25
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.400
It is love's spring, and thesethe showers to bring it on.

26
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.770
Be cheerful.

27
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.070
Sir, look well to my husband'shouse and

28
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.230
What, Octavia?

29
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.530
I'll tell you in your ear.

30
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.730
Her tongue will not obey herheart,

31
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.600
nor can her heart inform hertongue.

32
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.370
The swan's down-feather thatstands upon the swell

33
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.930
at full of tide and neither wayinclines.

34
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.670
Will Caesar weep?

35
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.170
Why, Enobarbus,

36
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.530
when Antony found Julius Caesardead,

37
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.430
he cried almost to roaring,

38
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.030
and he wept when at Philippi hefound Brutus slain.

39
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.170
That year, indeed, he wastroubled with a rheum.

40
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.070
Oh, sweet Octavia, you shallhear from me still.

41
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.530
The time shall not outgo mythinking on you.

42
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.870
Come, sir, come.

43
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.930
I'll wrestle with you in mystrength of love.

44
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.370
Look, here I have you.

45
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.800
Thus, I let you go and give youto the gods.

46
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.200
Adieu; be happy.

47
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.870
Let all the number of the starsgive light to thy fair way.

48
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.100
Farewell. Farewell.

49
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.270
Farewell.

50
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.530
Where is the fellow?

51
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.800
Half afeard to come.

52
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.100
Go to, go to.

53
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.630
Come hither, sir.

54
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.930
Come thou near.

55
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.100
Most gracious majestyó

56
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.930
Didst thou behold Octavia?

57
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.300
Ay, dread queen.

58
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.300
Where?

59
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.300
Madam, in Rome.

60
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.570
I looked her in the face

61
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.100
and saw her led between herbrother and Mark Antony.

62
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.400
Is she as tall as me?

63
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.670
She is not, madam.

64
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.600
Didst hear her speak?

65
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.300
Is she shrill-tongued or low?

66
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.300
Madam, I heard her speak; she islow-voiced.

67
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.870
That's not so good.

68
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.570
He cannot like her long.

69
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.730
Like her! O Isis, 'tisimpossible.

70
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.570
I think so, Charmianó dull oftongue and dwarfish!

71
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.400
What majesty is in her gait?

72
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.700
Remember, if ever thou look'dston majesty.

73
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.530
She creeps.

74
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.930
Her motion and her station areas one.

75
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.970
She shows a body rather than alife,

76
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.570
a statue than a breather.

77
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.600
Is this certain?

78
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.170
Or I have no observance.

79
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.470
Three in Egypt cannot makebetter note.

80
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.830
He's very knowing, I do perceiveit.

81
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.870
There's nothing in her yet.

82
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.630
The fellow has good judgment.

83
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.630
Excellent.

84
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.500
Guess at her years, I prithee.

85
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.300
Madam, she was a widow.

86
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.230
Widow! Charmian, hark.

87
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.570
And I do think she's thirty.

88
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.830
Bear'st thou her face in mind?

89
00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.470
Is it long or round?

90
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.500
Round, even to faultiness.

91
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.970
For the most part, too, they arefoolish that are so.

92
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.070
Her hair, what color?

93
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.170
Brown, madam,

94
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.530
and her forehead as low as shewould wish it.

95
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.530
There's gold for thee.

96
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.870
Thou must not take my formersharpness ill.

97
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.130
I will employ thee back again.

98
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.200
I find thee most fit forbusiness.

99
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.100
Go, make thee ready.

100
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.900
Our letters are prepared.

101
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.570
A proper man.

102
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.970
Indeed, he is so.

103
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.000
I repent me much that so Iharried him.

104
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.230
Why, methinks, by him, thiscreature's no such thing.

105
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.530
Nothing, madam.

106
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.700
The man hath seen some majestyand should know.

107
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.570
Hath he seen majesty?

108
00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.830
Isis else defend and serving youso long.

109
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.900
I have one thing more to ask himyet, good Charmian.

110
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.600
But 'tis no matter.

111
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.000
Thou shalt bring him to me whereI will write.

112
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.470
All may be well enough.

113
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.530
Nay, nay, Octavia, not onlythat.

114
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.270
That were excusable,

115
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.200
that and thousands more offsemblable import.

116
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.530
But he hath waged new warsagainst Pompeyó

117
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.400
made his will and read it topublic ear,

118
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.800
spoke scantly of me

119
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.030
when perforce he could not butpay me terms of honor.

120
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.530
My good lord, believe not all,

121
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.500
or if you must believe, stomachnot all.

122
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.430
A more unhappy lady, if thisdivision chance,

123
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.000
never stood between praying forboth parts.

124
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.070
The good gods will mock mepresently

125
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.830
when I shall pray, "O, bless mylord and husband!"

126
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.500
Undo that prayerby crying out asloud,

127
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.970
"O, bless my brother!"

128
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.930
Husband, win; win, brother.

129
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.100
Prays, and destroys the prayer.

130
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.600
No midway twixt these extremesat all.

131
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.070
Gentle Octavia.

132
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.270
Let your best love draw to thatpoint

133
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.200
which seeks best to preserve it.

134
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.370
If I lose mine honor, I losemyself.

135
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.000
Better I were not yours thanyours so branchless.

136
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.230
But, as you requested, yourselfshall go between us.

137
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.500
The meantime, lady,

138
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.230
I'll raise the preparation of awar shall stain your brother.

139
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.800
Make your soonest haste so yourdesires are yours.

140
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.370
Thanks to my lord.

141
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.930
The Jove of power make me mostweak, most weak.

142
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.900
Your reconciler.

143
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.270
Wars twixt you twain would be asif the world should cleave

144
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.200
and that slain men should solderup the rift.

145
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.570
When it appears to you wherethis begins,

146
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.370
turn your displeasure that way,

147
00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.830
for our faults can never be soequal

148
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.670
that your love can equally movewith them.

149
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.030
Provide your going, choose yourown company,

150
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.800
and command what cost your hearthas mind to.

151
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.970
How now, friend Eros.

152
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.730
There's strange news come, sir.

153
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.130
What, man?

154
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.330
Caesar and Lepidus have madewars upon Pompey.

155
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.470
This is old; what is thesuccess?

156
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.330
Caesar, having made use of himin the wars against Pompey,

157
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.500
presently denied him rivality,

158
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.870
would not let him partake in theglory of the action,

159
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.300
and, not resting here,

160
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.470
accuses him of letters he hadformerly wrote to Pompey.

161
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.100
Upon his own appeal, seizes him.

162
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:47.500
So the poor third is up tilldeath enlarge his confine.

163
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:56.170
Then, world, thou hast a pair ofchaps, no more.

164
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.470
Contemning Rome,

165
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.770
he has done all this and more inAlexandria.

166
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.930
Here's the manner of it.

167
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.030
In the marketplace, on atribunal silvered,

168
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.500
Cleopatra and himself in chairsof gold

169
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.270
were publicly enthroned.

170
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.970
At the feet sat Caesarion, whomthey call my father's son

171
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.200
and all the unlawful issue

172
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.770
that their lust since then hathmade between them.

173
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.470
Unto her he gave thestablishment of Egypt,

174
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.200
made her of lower Syria, Cyprus,Lydia, absolute queen.

175
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.570
This in the public eye?

176
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:29.130
In the common showplace wherethey exercise.

177
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.970
His sons he there proclaimed thekings of kings.

178
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.170
Great Media, Parthia, andArmenia, he gave to Alexander.

179
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:40.230
To Ptolemy, he assigned Syria,Cilicia, Phoenicia.

180
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.200
She in the habiliments of thegoddess Isis that day appeared

181
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.370
and oft before gave audience as'tis reported so.

182
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.930
Let Rome be thus informed.

183
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.970
Who, queasy with his insolencealready, will their goodthoughts call from him.

184
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.230
The people knows it.

185
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.930
They have now received hisaccusations.

186
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:55.070
Who does he accuse?

187
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.400
Caesaróand that having in SicilySextus Pompeius spoiled,

188
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.800
we had not rated him his part ofthe isle.

189
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.070
Then does he say he lent me someshipping unrestored.

190
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.130
Lastly, he frets that Lepidus

191
00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.770
of the triumvirate should bedeposed

192
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.370
and being that we detain all hisrevenue.

193
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.570
Sir, this should be answered.

194
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.870
'Tis done already, and themessenger gone.

195
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.400
I have told him, Lepidus wasgrown too cruel,

196
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.330
that he his high authorityabused,

197
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.870
and did deserve his change,

198
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.030
for what I have conquered, Igrant him part.

199
00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.700
But then in his Armenia andother of his conquered kingdoms,

200
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:28.970
I demand the like.

201
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.430
He'll never yield to that.

202
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.300
Nor must not then be yielded toin this.

203
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.100
Hail, Caesar, and my lords!

204
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.130
Hail, most dear Caesar!

205
00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.170
That ever I should call theecastaway.

206
00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.300
You have not called me so, norhave you cause.

207
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.500
Why have you stolen upon usthus?

208
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.800
You come not like Caesar'ssister.

209
00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.900
The wife of Antony should havean army for an usher,

210
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.700
and the neighs of horse to tellof her approach

211
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.670
long ere she did appear.

212
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.800
The trees by the way should haveborne men

213
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.830
and expectation fainted, longingfor what it had not.

214
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.170
Nay, the dust should haveascended to the roof of heaven,

215
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.500
raised by your populous troops,

216
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.800
but you are come a market maidto Rome

217
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.970
and have prevented theostentation of our love,

218
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.670
which left unshown is often leftunloved.

219
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.830
We should have met you by seaand land,

220
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.000
supplying every stage with anaugmented greeting.

221
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.500
Good my lord, to come thus was Inot constrained

222
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.270
but did it on my free will.

223
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.830
My lord, Mark Antony,

224
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.600
hearing that you prepared forwar,

225
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.500
acquainted my grieved earwithal,

226
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.830
whereon, I begged his pardon forreturn.

227
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.170
Which soon he granted,

228
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.830
being an obstruct 'tween hislust and him.

229
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.900
Do not say so, my lord.

230
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.930
I have eyes upon him,

231
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.600
and his affairs come to me onthe wind.

232
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.670
Where is he now?

233
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.200
My lord, in Athens.

234
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.070
No, my most wronged sister.

235
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.470
Cleopatra hath nodded him toher.

236
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:58.030
He hath given his empire up to awhore,

237
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.970
who now are levying the kings ofthe earth for war.

238
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.100
Ay me, most wretched,

239
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:07.000
that have my heart partedbetwixt two friends

240
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.970
that does afflict each other.

241
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.230
Cheer your heart.

242
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.570
Be you not troubled with thetime

243
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.630
which drives over your contentthese strong necessities.

244
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:25.100
But let determined things todestiny hold unbewailed theirway.

245
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.930
Welcome to Rome.

246
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.730
Nothing more dear to me.

247
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.000
You are abused beyond the markof thought

248
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.130
and the high gods to do youjustice,

249
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.600
make them ministers of us andthose that love you.

250
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.830
Best of comfort and ever welcometo us.

251
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.200
Welcome, lady.

252
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.370
Welcome, dear madam.

253
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.030
Each heart in Rome does love andpity you.

254
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:51.800
Only the adulterous Antony, mostlarge in his abominations,

255
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.300
turns you off and gives hispotent regiment to a trull

256
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.870
that noises it against us.

257
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.700
Is it so, sir?

258
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.630
Most certain.

259
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.600
Sister, welcome.

260
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.830
Pray you be ever known topatience.

261
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.030
My dearest sister.

262
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.330
I will be even with thee, doubtit not.

263
00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.270
But why, why, why?

264
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.970
Thou hast forspoke my being inthese wars

265
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.300
and say'st it is not fit.

266
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.730
Well, is it? Is it?

267
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.500
If not denounced against us,

268
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.130
why should not we be there inperson?

269
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.430
Well, I could reply,

270
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.830
if we should serve with horseand mares together,

271
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.100
the horse were merely lost.

272
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.230
What is't you say?

273
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.970
Your presence needs must puzzleAntonyó

274
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.870
take from his heart, take fromhis brain,

275
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.300
from's time that should not thenbe spared.

276
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.870
He is already traduced forlevity.

277
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.030
And 'tis said in Rome thatPhotinus, an eunuch,

278
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.870
and your maids manage this war.

279
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.400
Sink Rome, and their tongues rotthat speak against us.

280
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.470
A charge we bear in the war

281
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.030
and, as the president of mykingdom, will appear there for aman.

282
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.800
Speak not against it; I will notstay behind.

283
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.530
Is it not strange, Canidius,

284
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.170
that from Tarentum andBrundusium

285
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:11.170
he could so quickly cut theIonian Sea

286
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.770
and take in Toryne?

287
00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.230
You've heard on it, sweet?

288
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.800
Celerity is never more admiredthan by the negligent.

289
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.400
A good rebuke,

290
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.400
which might have well becomedthe best of men

291
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.870
to taunt at slackness.

292
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.200
Canidius, we will fight with himby sea.

293
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.000
By sea! What else?

294
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.400
Why will my lord do so?

295
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.130
For that he dares us to it.

296
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.900
Your ships are not well manned.

297
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.300
Your mariners are muleters,reapers,

298
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.900
people engrossed by swiftimpress.

299
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.630
In Caesar's fleet are those thatoften have against Pompeyfought.

300
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.530
Their ships are yare; yours,heavy.

301
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.470
No disgrace will fall you forrefusing him at sea,

302
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.770
being prepared for land.

303
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.170
By sea, by sea.

304
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.900
Most worthy sir, you thereinthrow away

305
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.000
the absolute soldiership youhave by land.

306
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.670
I'll fight at sea!

307
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:57.230
I have sixty sails; Caesar, nonebetter.

308
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.930
Our overplus of shipping will weburn

309
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.400
and with the rest full-mannedfrom the head of Actium

310
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.130
beat the approaching Caesar.

311
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:08.170
But if we fail, we then can doit at land.

312
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.170
How now, soldier?

313
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.370
O noble emperor, do not fight bysea.

314
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.770
Trust not to rotten planks.

315
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.400
Do you misdoubt this sword,these my wounds?

316
00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.270
Let the Egyptians andPhoenicians go a-ducking.

317
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.470
We are used to conquer,

318
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:22.670
standing on the earth, fightingfoot-to-foot.

319
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.970
Well, well, away!

320
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.070
Set we our squadrons on yondside of the hill

321
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.370
in eye of Caesar's battle

322
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.800
from which place we may thenumber of the ships behold

323
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.900
and so proceed accordingly.

324
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:39.170
Strike not by land; keep whole.

325
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.330
Provoke not battle till we havedone at sea.

326
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:44.930
Do not exceed the prescript ofthis scroll.

327
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.300
Our fortune lies upon this jump.

328
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.570
Hark! The land bids me tread nomore upon it.

329
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.170
It is ashamed to bear me!

330
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.770
Friends, come hither.

331
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.300
I am so lated in the world thatI have lost my way forever.

332
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.030
I have a ship laden with gold.

333
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.330
Take that, divide it;

334
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:55.800
fly, and make your peace withCaesar.

335
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.830
Fly? Not we.

336
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.470
I have fled myself

337
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.600
and have instructed cowards torun and show their shoulders.

338
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.600
Friends, begone.

339
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.030
I have myself resolved upon acourse

340
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:07.300
which has no need of you.

341
00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.400
Begone.

342
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.830
My treasure's in the harbor.Take it.

343
00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:19.130
O, I followed that I blush tolook upon.

344
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.730
Leave me, I pray, a little.

345
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:25.830
Pray you, now.

346
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.930
Nay, do so, for indeed I havelost command.

347
00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:33.170
Therefore, I pray you, I'll seeyou by and by.

348
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.370
Nay, gentle madam, to him,comfort him.

349
00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:41.770
Do, most dear queen.

350
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.530
Do! Why, what else?

351
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.600
No, no, no, no, no.

352
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.330
The queen, my lord, the queen.

353
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:51.470
Go to him, madam. Speak withhim.

354
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.800
He is unqualitied with veryshame.

355
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.400
Well then, sustain me, O!

356
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.930
Most noble sir, arise; the queenapproaches.

357
00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.300
Her head's declined and deathwill seize her,

358
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.030
but your comfort makes therescue.

359
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:08.970
I have offended reputation, amost unnoble swerving.

360
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.900
Sir, the queen.

361
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:21.430
O whither hast thou led me,Egypt?

362
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.170
See how I convey my shame out ofthine eyes

363
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.330
by looking back what I have leftbehind,

364
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:28.100
destroyed in dishonor.

365
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.870
O my lord, my lord,

366
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.800
forgive my fearful sails!

367
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.030
I little thought you would havefollowed.

368
00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.130
Egypt, thou knew'st too well

369
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.870
my heart was to thy rudder tiedby the strings

370
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.630
and thou shouldst tow me after.

371
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.500
O'er my spirit thy fullsupremacy thou knew'st

372
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.000
and that thy beck might

373
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.830
from the bidding of the godscommand me.

374
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.870
O, my pardon.

375
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.700
Now I must to the young man sendhumble treaties,

376
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.870
dodge and palter in the shiftsof lowness,

377
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.900
who with half the bulk of theworld

378
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:09.470
played as I pleased, making andmarring fortunes.

379
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.430
You did know how much you weremy conqueror

380
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.070
and that my sword, made weak bymy affection,

381
00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.800
would obey it on all cause.

382
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.330
Pardon, pardon.

383
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:32.270
Fall not a tear, I say;

384
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.670
one of them rates all that iswon and lost.

385
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.400
Give me a kiss.

386
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:49.830
Even this repays me.

387
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:59.200
We sent our schoolmaster; is hecome back?

388
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.030
Love, I am full of lead.

389
00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.470
Some wine within there and ourviands!

390
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:17.870
Fortune knows we scorn her mostwhen most she offers blows.

391
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.570
Let him appear that's come fromAntony.

392
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.700
Know you him?

393
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.800
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmasteró

394
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.670
an argument that he is plucked

395
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.330
when hither he sends so poor apinion of his wing

396
00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.470
which had superfluous kings formessengers

397
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.570
not many moons gone by.

398
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:34.870
Approach and speak.

399
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.770
Such as I am, I come fromAntony.

400
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:41.700
I was of late as petty to hisends as is the morn-dew

401
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.670
on the myrtle leaf to his grandsea.

402
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:46.630
Be it so; declare thine office.

403
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.330
Lord of his fortunes, he salutesthee

404
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.170
and requires to live in Egypt,

405
00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:54.630
which not granted, he lessenshis requests;

406
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.600
and to thee sues to let himbreathe

407
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.430
between the heavens and earth, aprivate man in Athensó

408
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.800
this for him.

409
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.500
Next, Cleopatra does confess thygreatness,

410
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.930
submits her to thy might,

411
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:10.130
and of thee, craves the circleof the Ptolemies for her heirs,

412
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:12.470
now hazarded to thy grace.

413
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.030
For Antony,

414
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:22.030
I have no ears to his request.

415
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.130
The queen of audience nor desireshall fail,

416
00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.830
so she from Egypt drive herall-disgraced friend,

417
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.370
or take his life there.

418
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:36.430
This if she perform, she shallnot sue unheard.

419
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.800
So to them both.

420
00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.600
Fortune pursue thee!

421
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.830
Bring him through the bands.

422
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.070
To try thy eloquence now 'tistime; dispatch.

423
00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.030
From Antony win Cleopatra;promise.

424
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.670
And in our name, what sherequires.

425
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:09.000
Add more from thine invention,offers.

426
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.530
Women are not in their bestfortunes strong,

427
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.730
but want will perjure thenever-touched vestal.

428
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:19.300
Try thy cunning, Thyreus.

429
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.530
Make thine own edict for thypains,

430
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:23.000
which we will answer as a law.

431
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.530
Caesar, I go.

432
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.470
Observe how Antony becomes hisflaw,

433
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:32.630
and what thou think'st his veryaction speaks

434
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.230
in every power that moves.

435
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.000
Caesar, I shall.

436
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:45.330
What shall we do, Enobarbus?

437
00:21:45.330 --> 00:21:48.470
Think and die.

438
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:50.600
Is Antony or we in fault inthis?

439
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.570
Antony only, that would make hiswill lord of his reason.

440
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.170
What though you fled from thatgreat face of war,

441
00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.100
whose several ranges frightedeach other,

442
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.430
why should he follow?

443
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.070
The itch of his affection

444
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.170
should not then have nicked hiscaptainship

445
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.470
at such a point when half tohalf the world opposed,

446
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.770
he being the meered question.

447
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.530
'Twas a shame no less than washis loss,

448
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.930
to course your flying flags andleave his navy gazing.

449
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.030
Prithee, peace.

450
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.270
Is that his answer?

451
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.430
Aye, my lord.

452
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.670
The queen shall then havecourtesy,

453
00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.270
so she shall yield us up.

454
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:25.570
He says so.

455
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:26.670
Well, let her know it.

456
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:30.830
To the boy, Caesar send thisgrizzled head,

457
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.030
and he will fill thy wishes tothe brim with principalities.

458
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.500
That head, my lord?

459
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:38.800
To him again;

460
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.900
tell him he wears the rose ofyouth upon him

461
00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.800
from which the world should notesomething particular.

462
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.170
His coin, ships, legions may bea coward's,

463
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:52.300
whose ministers would prevailunder the service of a child

464
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.370
as soon as in the command ofCaesar.

465
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:58.630
I dare him, therefore, to layhis gay comparisons apart

466
00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:03.100
and answer me declined, swordagainst swordó

467
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.570
ourselves alone.

468
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.970
I'll write it; follow me.

469
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.600
Yes, like enough,

470
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.470
high-battled Caesar will unstatehis happiness

471
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.270
and be staged to the showagainst a sworder.

472
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.300
I see men's judgments are aparcel of their fortunes.

473
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.670
And things outward do draw theinward quality after them

474
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.570
to suffer all alike that heshould dream,

475
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.200
knowing all measures

476
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.500
the full Caesar will answer hisemptiness.

477
00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:38.600
Caesar, thou hast subdued his isjudgment too.

478
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.070
A messenger from Caesar.

479
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.600
What, no more ceremony?

480
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.530
See, my women.

481
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.900
Against the blown rose may theystop their nose

482
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.300
that kneeled unto the buds.

483
00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:54.830
Admit him, sir.

484
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.470
Mine honesty and I begin tosquare.

485
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.700
The loyalty well held to foolsdoes make our faith mere folly.

486
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.100
Yet he that can endure to followwith allegiance a fallen lord

487
00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.400
does conquer him that did hismaster conquer

488
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:15.230
and earns a place in the story.

489
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.830
Caesar's will?

490
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:20.430
Hear it apart.

491
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.600
None but friends; say boldly.

492
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.230
So haply are they friends toAntony.

493
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.900
He needs as many, sir, as Caesarhas or needs not us.

494
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.670
If Caesar please, our masterwill leap to be his friend,

495
00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.400
for us, you know, whose he is weare,

496
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.930
and that is Caesar's.

497
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.170
So.

498
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.200
Thus then, thou most renowned,

499
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:44.170
Caesar entreats not to considerin what case thou stand'st

500
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.670
further than he is Caesar.

501
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.130
Go on, right royal.

502
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:53.070
He knows that you embrace notAntony as you did love

503
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:56.200
but as you feared him.

504
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.500
O!

505
00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.430
The scars upon your honor,therefore, he does pity

506
00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:04.530
as constrained blemishes, not asdeserved.

507
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.570
He is a god and knows what ismost right.

508
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.200
Mine honor was not yielded butconquered merely.

509
00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.200
To be sure of that, I will askAntony.

510
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:21.900
Sir, sir, thou art so leaky thatwe must leave thee to thysinking,

511
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.900
for thy dearest quit thee.

512
00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.500
Shall I say to Caesar what yourequire of him?

513
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.300
For he partly begs to be desiredto give.

514
00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.630
It much would please him that ofhis fortunes

515
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.630
you should make a staff to leanupon.

516
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:38.330
But it would warm his spirits

517
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.430
to hear from me that you hadleft Antony

518
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.600
and put yourself under hisshroud,

519
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.270
the universal landlord.

520
00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.270
What's your name?

521
00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.530
My name is Thyreus.

522
00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.800
Most kind messenger, say togreat Caesar this:

523
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.400
in deputation, I kiss hisconquering hand.

524
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.300
Tell him, I am prompt to lay mycrown at his feet

525
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.670
and there to kneel.

526
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.800
Tell him from his all-obeyingbreath, I hear the doom ofEgypt.

527
00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.170
'Tis your noblest course.

528
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.330
Wisdom and fortune combatingtogether.

529
00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.470
If that the former dare but whatit can,

530
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.100
no chance may shake it.

531
00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.330
Give me grace to lay my duty onyour hand.

532
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:10.070
Your Caesar's father oft,

533
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.930
when he hath mused of takingkingdoms in,

534
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:17.130
bestowed his lips on thatunworthy place as it rainedkisses.

535
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:20.470
Favors, by Jove that thunders!

536
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.970
What art thou, fellow?

537
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.600
One that but performs thebidding of the fullest man

538
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.700
and worthiest to have commandobeyed.

539
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.200
You will be whipped.

540
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.830
Approach there.

541
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.400
Ah, you kite!

542
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.170
Now gods and devils!

543
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:41.500
Authority melts from me.

544
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.370
Of late when I cried "ho" likeboys unto a muss,

545
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.870
kings would start forth and cry,"Your will?"

546
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:51.030
Have you no ears? I am Antonyyet!

547
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.770
Take hence this Jack and whiphim.

548
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.130
'Tis better playing with alion's whelp

549
00:26:57.130 --> 00:26:59.330
than with an old one dying.

550
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.800
Moon and stars! Whip him.

551
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.870
Were it twenty of the greatesttributaries that do acknowledgeCaesar,

552
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:08.130
should I find them so saucy withthe hand of she here.

553
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.200
What's her name? Since she wasCleopatra?

554
00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.700
Whip him, fellows, till like aboy

555
00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.470
you see him cringe his face andwhine aloud for mercy.

556
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:16.500
Take him hence.

557
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.630
Mark Antony!

558
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:19.430
Tug him awayóbeing whipped,bring him again.

559
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.400
This Jack of Caesar's shall bearus an errand to him.

560
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:26.830
You were half blasted ere I knewyou.

561
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.300
Ha! Have I my pillow leftunpressed in Rome

562
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.530
forborne the getting of a lawfulrace

563
00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.000
and by a gem of women

564
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.200
to be abused by one that lookson feeders?

565
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.700
Good my lordó

566
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.730
You have been a boggler ever.

567
00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.870
But when we in our viciousnessgrow hardó

568
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.370
O misery on it then the wisegods seel our eyes,

569
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.070
in our own filth, drop our clearjudgments,

570
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:50.470
make us adore our errors,

571
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.970
laugh at us while we strut toour confusion.

572
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.670
O, is it come to this?

573
00:27:55.670 --> 00:28:01.370
I found you as a morsel coldupon dead Caesar's trencher.

574
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.770
Nay, you were a fragment ofCneius Pompey's.

575
00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:08.170
Besides what hotter hours,unregistered in vulgar fame,

576
00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:09.830
you have luxuriously picked out.

577
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.130
For I am sure, though,

578
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.730
you can guess what temperanceshould be,

579
00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:14.000
you know not what it is.

580
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.200
Wherefore is this?

581
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.370
To let a fellow that will takerewards

582
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:19.430
and say "God quit you!"

583
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:22.770
be familiar with my playfellow,your handó

584
00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:27.070
this kingly seal and plighter ofhigh hearts!

585
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.500
O, that I were upon the hill ofBasan,

586
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.070
to outroar the horned herd,

587
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:35.830
for I have savage cause.

588
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.200
And to proclaim it civilly werelike a haltered neck

589
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.170
which does the hangman thank forbeing yare about him.

590
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.230
Is he whipped?

591
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.700
Soundly, my lord.

592
00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.830
Cried he and begged a pardon?

593
00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.000
He did ask a favor.

594
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.700
If that thy father live,

595
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:01.470
let him repent thou wast notmade his daughter,

596
00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:04.500
and be thou sorry to followCaesar in his triumph

597
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:06.630
since thou hast been whipped forfollowing him.

598
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:12.100
Henceforth, the white hand of alady fever thee,

599
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.470
shake thou to look on it.

600
00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.300
Get thee back to Caesar; tellhim thy entertainment.

601
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.770
Look, thou say he makes me angrywith him

602
00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.130
for he seems proud anddisdainful,

603
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:25.670
harping on what I am, not whathe knew I was.

604
00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:27.870
He makes me angry!

605
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:31.030
And at this time most easy 'tisto do it

606
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.900
when my good stars that were myformer guides

607
00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.430
have empty left their orbs

608
00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:38.900
and shot their fires into theabysm of hell.

609
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.670
If he mislike my speech and whatis done,

610
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.770
tell him he has Hipparchus, myenfranched bondman,

611
00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.370
whom he may at pleasure whip, orhang, or torture

612
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.830
as he shall like to quit me.

613
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.370
Urge it thou. Hence, with thystripes, begone.

614
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:04.630
Have you done yet?

615
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.930
Alack, our terrene moon is noweclipsed.

616
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:12.800
And it portends alone the fallof Antony.

617
00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.270
I must stay his time.

618
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:21.370
To flatter Caesar would youmingle eyes

619
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.370
with one that ties his points?

620
00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.900
Not know me yet?

621
00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:36.270
Coldhearted toward me?

622
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:41.800
Ah, dear, if I be so,

623
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.430
from my cold heart let heavenengender hail,

624
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.830
and poison it in the source,

625
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.200
and the first stone drop in myneck

626
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.030
as it determines so dissolve mylife.

627
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:56.230
The next Caesarion smite,

628
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.800
till by degrees the memory of mywomb,

629
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.730
together with my brave Egyptiansall,

630
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.330
by the discandying of thispelleted storm,

631
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:04.830
lie graveless

632
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:09.270
till the flies and gnats of Nilehave buried them for prey.

633
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:14.100
I am satisfied.

634
00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.970
Caesar sits down in Alexandria,where I will oppose his fate.

635
00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.030
Our force by land hath noblyheld.

636
00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:30.170
Our navy, too, have knit again,

637
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:34.230
and fleet threatening mostsea-like.

638
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.930
Where hast thou been, my heart?

639
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.430
Dost thou hear, lady?

640
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:47.030
If from the field I shall returnonce more to kiss these lips,

641
00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.830
I will appear in blood.

642
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.130
I and my sword will earn ourchronicle.

643
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:54.800
There's hope in it yet.

644
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.270
That's my brave lord.

645
00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.700
I will be treble-sinewed,hearted, breathed,

646
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.300
and fight maliciously.

647
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.400
For when mine hours were niceand lucky,

648
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.130
men did ransom lives of me forjests.

649
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:08.800
But now I'll set my teeth

650
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.670
and send to darkness all thatstop me.

651
00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:16.330
Come, let's have one other gaudynight.

652
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.500
Call to me all my sad captains.

653
00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.000
Fill our bowls once more.

654
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.800
Let's mock the midnight bell

655
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.270
It is my birthday.

656
00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:26.870
I had thought to have held itpoor,

657
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.700
but since my lord is Antonyagain,

658
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.200
I will be Cleopatra.

659
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.370
We will yet do well.

660
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.700
Call all his noble captains tomy lord.

661
00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.800
Do so; we'll speak to them.

662
00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.230
And tonight I'll force the winepeep through their scars.

663
00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.430
Come, my queen, there's sap init yet.

664
00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.530
The next time I do fight I'llmake death love me,

665
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:54.530
for I will contend even with hispestilent scythe.

666
00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.770
Now he'll outstare thelightning.

667
00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:08.170
To be furious is to be frightedout of fear.

668
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.100
And in that mood, the dove willpeck the estridge.

669
00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.370
And I see still a diminution

670
00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:17.630
in our captain's brain restoreshis heart.

671
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.970
When valor preys on reason,

672
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.030
it eats the sword it fightswith.

673
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:32.500
I will seek some way to leavehim.

674
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:45.300
