        MAJOR FUNDING 
        FOR THIS PROGRAM PROVIDED BY
      

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.800

        THE FORD FOUNDATION,
        
      

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300

        A RESOURCE
        FORINNOVATIVE PEOPLE
      

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.410

        AND INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE,


00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.410

        AND THE CORPORATION
        FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING.
      

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:20.010

        ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED
        BY THESE FUNDERS --
      

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.680

        "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL."


00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.220

        "ALL MEN
        ARE CREATED EQUAL."
      

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.860

        IT'S THE LOFTY
        AND REVOLUTIONARY IDEAL
      

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.930

        AT AMERICA'S CORE.


00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.860

        YET IT WAS WRITTEN AT A TIME
        WHEN SOME INHABITANTS
      

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.070

        WERE HELD IN BONDAGE


00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.570

        AND OTHERS WERE BEING
        DISPOSSESSED OF THEIR LANDS.
      

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.710

        HOW DID AMERICAN SOCIETY
        JUSTIFY UNEQUAL TREATMENT
      

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.750

        BASED ON SKIN COLOR
        AND NATIONAL ORIGINS?
      

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.420

        HOW DID IT
        RECONCILE THAT CONTRADICTION?
      

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.920

        AMERICA CREATED A STORY,


00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.630

        A STORY OF RACE.


00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.860

        Man: RACE WAS NEVER JUST
        A MATTER OF HOW YOU LOOK.
      

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:43.600

        IT'S ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ASSIGN
        MEANING TO HOW YOU LOOK.
      

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.370

        Woman: WE HAVE THE IDEA THAT
        IT'S SOMEWHERE WRITTEN IN STONE
      

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.780

        THAT THERE ARE THESE
        FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES
      

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.880

        BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS.


00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.910

        WE DON'T REALIZE THAT RACE
        IS AN IDEA
      

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.520

        THAT EVOLVES OVER TIME,
        THAT IT HAS A HISTORY,
      

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.220

        THAT IT IS CONSTRUCTED
        BY A SOCIETY
      

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.960

        TO FURTHER CERTAIN POLITICAL
        AND ECONOMIC GOALS.
      

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.500

        Narrator:
        CREATED OVER FOUR CENTURIES,
      

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.770

        RACE HAS BECOME A POWERFUL
        AND ENDURING NARRATIVE.
      

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.800

        MOMENTS IN AMERICA'S PAST


00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.270

        REVEAL HOW THIS IDEA TOOK HOLD


00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:32.420

        AND BECAME THE LENS THROUGH
        WHICH WE VIEW OUR WORLD.
      

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560

        THOMAS JEFFERSON,
        A VIRGINIA SLAVEHOLDER,
      

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.760

        PENNED THE REVOLUTIONARY WORDS
        PROCLAIMING HUMAN EQUALITY
      

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.800

        IN THE DECLARATION
        OF INDEPENDENCE.
      

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.430

        HE ALSO WROTE A LESSER KNOWN,
        INFLUENTIAL DOCUMENT
      

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.470

        "NOTES ON THE STATE
        OF VIRGINIA."
      

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.640

        WRITTEN IN RESPONSE
        TO QUESTIONS FROM FRANCE
      

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.840

        ABOUT THE AMERICAN COLONIES,


00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.050

        THE BOOK READS AS A KIND OF
        SALES PITCH FOR AMERICA.
      

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.220

        "NOTES ON THE STATE OF VIRGINIA"
        WAS NOT ABOUT RACE.
      

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.450

        BUT AMONG JEFFERSON'S
        DESCRIPTIONS
      

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.060

        OF RIVERS AND SEAPORTS,
        MOUNTAINS AND CLIMATE,
      

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.160

        HE EXPRESSED HIS VIEWS ON
        THE INHABITANTS OF THE NEW LAND,
      

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.030

        PEOPLE FROM AMERICA,
        EUROPE, AND AFRICA.
      

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.440

        I ADVANCE IT AS A SUSPICION
        ONLY THAT THE BLACKS,
      

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740

        WHETHER ORIGINALLY
        A DISTINCT RACE
      

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.040

        OR MADE DISTINCT BY TIME
        AND CIRCUMSTANCES
      

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.050

        ARE INFERIOR TO THE WHITES


00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.580

        IN THE ENDOWMENTS
        BOTH OF BODY AND MIND.
      

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.320

        Man: IT IS POSSIBLE
        TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT
      

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.090

        THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON


00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.660

        IS THE FIRST PERSON


00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.830

        TO TRULY ARTICULATE A THEORY
        OF RACE IN THE UNITED STATES.
      

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.900

        AND IN EFFECT HE HAS TO DO SO.


00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.500

        HE HAS SAID IN
        THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
      

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.570

        THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL.


00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.800

        WELL, IF IN FACT
        WE'RE ALL CREATED EQUAL
      

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.840

        AND IF IN FACT WE'RE
        ENTITLED TO OUR LIBERTY,
      

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.040

        THEN HOW CAN HE
        POSSIBLY OWN 175 SLAVES
      

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:12.080

        AND GOING UP TO ABOUT 225 SLAVES
        AT THE PEAK OF HIS SLAVEHOLDING?
      

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.920

        Narrator: IN "NOTES,"


00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.360

        JEFFERSON'S WORDS APPEARED
        TO JUSTIFY SLAVERY
      

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.360

        AT A TIME WHEN MANY WERE
        ADMONISHING THE FOUNDING FATHERS
      

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.490

        FOR ESPOUSING FREEDOM


00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:27.330

        WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT
        A SYSTEM OF HUMAN BONDAGE.
      

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.340

        Man: THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAD
        TO FIGURE OUT IS,
      

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.870

        HOW CAN WE PROMOTE LIBERTY,


00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.010

        FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY
        ON THE ONE HAND,
      

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.710

        AND A SYSTEM OF SLAVERY
        AND EXPLOITATION
      

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.240

        OF PEOPLES WHO ARE NON-WHITE
        ON THE OTHER?
      

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.280

        AND THE WAY YOU DO THAT
        IS TO SAY,
      

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.910

        YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,


00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.720

        THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
        ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.
      

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.720

        THIS WHOLE BUSINESS
        OF INALIENABLE RIGHTS,
      

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:54.890

        THAT'S FINE, BUT IT ONLY APPLIES
        TO CERTAIN PEOPLE.
      

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.660

        Man: THE MOMENT WHEN WE
        BECOME A NATION IS CRITICAL
      

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.870

        FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF BOTH
        AMERICAN NATIONALITY AND RACE.
      

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.140

        WE ACCEPT THE NOTION THAT ALL
        MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,
      

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.910

        BUT THEN PERHAPS
        SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE
      

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.410

        WHO ARE ENSLAVED
        ARE NOT QUITE MEN.
      

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.920

        THAT IS, WE'LL KEEP OUR IDEAS
        OF AMERICAN NATIONALITY
      

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:37.440

        BUT WE'LL WRITE CERTAIN PEOPLE
        OUT OF THE HUMAN FAMILY.
      

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.210

        Narrator: THE SUSPICIONS OF
        BLACK RACIAL INFERIORITY
      

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.540

        RAISED BY JEFFERSON
        HAD EVOLVED OVER TIME,
      

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.880

        SHAPED IN PART BY
        AN INTENSE NEED FOR LABOR
      

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.150

        IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES.


00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.590

        IN 1619, WHEN THE FIRST AFRICANS
        ARRIVED IN VIRGINIA,
      

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.460

        RELIGION AND WEALTH,
        NOT PHYSICAL APPEARANCE,
      

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.760

        DEFINED STATUS.


00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.290

        BLACKNESS AND WHITENESS


00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.630

        WERE NOT YET
        CLEAR CATEGORIES OF IDENTITY.
      

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.030

        THEY WERE MORE LIKELY


00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.830

        TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN
        CHRISTIANS AND HEATHENS
      

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.840

        THAN THEY WERE BETWEEN PEOPLE OF
        COLOR AND PEOPLE WHO WERE WHITE.
      

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.140

        THEY REGARDED A PERSON'S
        STATUS IN LIFE
      

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.750

        AS SOMEHOW MORE FUNDAMENTAL
        THAN WHAT COLOR THEY WERE
      

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.020

        OR WHAT THEIR PARTICULAR
        BACKGROUND WAS.
      

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.420

        Man: THE DIFFERENT WAYS
        IN WHICH THOSE HIERARCHIES
      

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.430

        OF SOCIAL CLASS AND SOCIAL POWER


00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.530

        BECAME FILLED IN
        WITH THE CONTENT
      

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.730

        OF RACE SO THAT THE LOWEST CLASS
        WOULD BE A BLACK CLASS
      

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.000

        AND THE HIGHEST CLASS


00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.940

        WOULD BE SOME PARTICULARLY PALE
        WHITE CLASS,
      

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.610

        THAT WAS A VERY GRADUAL PROCESS.


00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.180

        Narrator: FOR THE FIRST 50 YEARS
        IN THE AMERICAN COLONIES,
      

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.180

        MOST OF THE LABORERS WERE
        EUROPEAN INDENTURED SERVANTS,
      

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.280

        MANY TOILING
        ON TOBACCO PLANTATIONS
      

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.890

        IN WRETCHED CONDITIONS.


00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.290

        WITH FEWER EUROPEANS


00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:07.090

        BRAVING THE TREACHEROUS JOURNEY
        ACROSS THE ATLANTIC,
      

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.330

        PLANTERS FACING
        A POTENTIAL LABOR SHORTAGE
      

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.270

        TURNED TO THE TRANS-ATLANTIC
        SLAVE TRADE
      

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.570

        AND GRADUALLY REPLACED
        INDENTURED SERVANTS
      

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.540

        WITH AFRICAN SLAVES.

        Horton:
        THEY FOUND WHAT THEY CONSIDERED
      

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.510

        AN ENDLESS LABOR SUPPLY,


00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.710

        PEOPLE WHO COULD
        BE READILY IDENTIFIED,
      

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.450

        AND SO WHEN THEY RAN AWAY,
        THEY COULDN'T JUST
      

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.280

        MELD INTO THE POPULATION
        LIKE NATIVE AMERICANS COULD.
      

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.250

        PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW
        TO GROW TOBACCO,
      

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:36.520

        PEOPLE WHO KNEW HOW
        TO GROW RICE --

        FROM THEIR STANDPOINT
        THE IDEAL LABOR SOURCE.
      

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.560

        Narrator: COLONY BY COLONY,
        NEW LAWS MADE SLAVERY PERMANENT
      

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.030

        AND INHERITABLE
        FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
      

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.400

        AND FOR THE FIRST TIME,
        THE WORD "WHITE,"
      

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.170

        RATHER THAN "CHRISTIAN"
        OR "ENGLISHMAN,"
      

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:56.310

        BEGAN APPEARING
        IN COLONIAL STATUTES.
      

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.210

        TO AN EXTENT YOU COULD SAY
        THIS WAS ACTUALLY
      

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.550

        CONSCIENCE STRATEGY,
        OR WHAT EXTENT IT WAS THE RESULT
      

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.510

        OF A NUMBER OF UNTHINKING
        DECISIONS THAT RESULTED IN THIS,
      

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.720

        BUT IT DID BUTTRESS
        A KIND OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE.
      

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.120

        Narrator:
        AS AFRICAN SLAVERY INCREASED,
      

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.590

        LOWER CLASS EUROPEANS WON
        NEW RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES.
      

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.830

        SOME EVEN BECAME OVERSEERS
        AND BOUNTY HUNTERS,
      

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:23.700

        RESPONSIBLE FOR POLICING
        THE GROWING SLAVE POPULATION.
      

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.200

        Fredrickson: THE ORDINARY WHITE
        PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO BE
      

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.080

        COMPLICIT IN THE SYSTEM UNLESS
        THEY GET SOMETHING OUT OF IT.
      

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.610

        MY BELIEF IS THAT PAYOFF


00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:34.780

        WAS IN A CERTAIN STATUS,
        PRESTIGE, RECOGNITION,
      

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.550

        EGO ENHANCEMENT,


00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.220

        THAT ORDINARY WHITE PEOPLE
        COULD DERIVE FROM RACISM.
      

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:44.220

        AND SO THERE WAS
        A KIND OF BARGAIN STRUCK.
      

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:47.560

        Kelley: MANY OF THE
        EUROPEAN-DESCENDED POOR WHITES
      

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.430

        BEGAN TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES,


00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.360

        IF NOT DIRECTLY
        WITH THE RICH WHITES,
      

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.200

        CERTAINLY WITH BEING WHITE.


00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.970

        AND HERE YOU GET THE EMERGENCE
        OF THIS IDEA OF A WHITE RACE
      

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.140

        AS A WAY TO
        DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES
      

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.810

        FROM THOSE DARK-SKINNED PEOPLE


00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.680

        WHO THEY ASSOCIATE
        WITH PERPETUAL SLAVERY.
      

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.950

        SLAVERY BECAME IDENTIFIED
        WITH AFRICANS.
      

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:14.620

        BLACKNESS AND SLAVERY
        WENT TOGETHER.
      

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.620

        THAT GAVE THE WHITE AMERICAN


00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.290

        THE IDEA THAT AFRICANS WERE
        A DIFFERENT KIND OF PEOPLE.
      

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.960

        Woman:
        THERE'S A RACIAL DIVIDE EMERGING
      

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.000

        THAT PEOPLE BEGIN TO,
        UM, SEE AS NATURAL.
      

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.240

        AND THAT'S PART OF WHERE
        THE IDEA OF RACE COMES FROM.
      

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.370

        IT'S JUST IN THE TENDENCY
        FOR PEOPLE TO SEE
      

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.640

        EXISTING POWER RELATIONSHIPS


00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:49.990

        AS HAVING SOME SORT OF
        NATURAL QUALITY TO THEM.
      

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:52.860

        Narrator: BY THE TIME JEFFERSON
        SAT DOWN TO WRITE
      

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.530

        "NOTES ON THE STATE OF VIRGINIA"
        IN 1781,
      

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.760

        A PLANTATION ECONOMY
        DEPENDENT ON SLAVERY
      

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.500

        WAS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED.


00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.500

        SLAVERY HAD BECOME SO WIDESPREAD
        THAT TO MANY WHITES
      

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.510

        IT SEEMED THE NATURAL STATE
        FOR BLACK PEOPLE.
      

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.080

        BUT WHEN JEFFERSON TURNED HIS
        ATTENTION TO INDIANS IN "NOTES,"
      

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.380

        WHAT APPEARED NATURAL ABOUT THEM


00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.880

        WAS THEIR STATUS
        AS A FREE PEOPLE,
      

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.320

        BRAVE WARRIORS
        PROTECTING THEIR LANDS.
      

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.220

        THIS LED JEFFERSON TO SUSPECT


00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:27.730

        THAT INDIANS WERE NOT
        MUCH DIFFERENT FROM EUROPEANS.
      

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.760

        THEIR VIVACITY
        AND ACTIVITY OF MIND
      

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.670

        IS EQUAL TO OURS
        IN THE SAME SITUATION.
      

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.200

        WE SHALL PROBABLY FIND
        THAT THEY'RE FORMED IN MIND,
      

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.840

        AS WELL AS IN BODY,


00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:45.580

        ON THE SAME MODULE WITH
        THE HOMO SAPIENS EUROPAEUS.
      

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.210

        Fredrickson: THE ORIGINAL VIEW
        OF THE INDIANS
      

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.250

        WAS THAT THEY WERE NATURALLY
        WHITE PEOPLE
      

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.280

        AND THEY LOOKED SLIGHTLY BROWN
        BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE TO THE SUN
      

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.520

        AND BECAUSE OF THE WAY
        THEY TREATED THEIR SKIN.
      

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.860

        JEFFERSON FELT, AMONG MANY
        PEOPLE AT THAT TIME,
      

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.230

        FELT THAT THE INDIANS
        WERE GOOD HUMAN MATERIAL.
      

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.030

        AND THE PROBLEM WITH THEM WAS
        NOT RACE BUT CULTURE,
      

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:11.100

        THAT THE INDIANS WERE SAVAGES,
        BUT THEY COULD BE CIVILIZED.
      

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.110

        Narrator: JEFFERSON
        AND HIS CONTEMPORARIES
      

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.180

        WERE ALSO INFLUENCED BY EUROPEAN
        ENLIGHTENMENT THINKERS,
      

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.640

        WHO BELIEVED THAT
        EDUCATION AND ENVIRONMENT
      

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.650

        COULD IMPROVE PEOPLE.


00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.420

        BUT WHEN JEFFERSON
        WROTE ABOUT THE INDIANS,
      

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.520

        HE HAD LITTLE DIRECT CONTACT
        WITH THEM.
      

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.090

        MOST VIRGINIA TRIBES
        HAD BEEN PUSHED WEST
      

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:35.030

        OR KILLED OFF BY WAR
        AND EUROPEAN DISEASES.
      

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.000

        Man: THOSE IN DIRECT CONFLICT
        WITH THE INDIANS,
      

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.070

        THOSE WHO WERE CROSSING
        THE MOUNTAINS
      

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.230

        TO KENTUCKY OR TENNESSEE,


00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:46.900

        DIDN'T THINK OF THE INDIANS
        IN AN ENLIGHTENMENT VIEW.
      

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.740

        THEY THOUGHT OF INDIANS
        AS SAVAGES
      

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.310

        WHO WERE TRYING TO DESTROY
        PEACEFUL SETTLERS COMING IN,
      

00:11:53.310 --> 00:12:06.830

        AND THOUGHT THEY SHOULD BE
        DRIVEN OUT OR EXTERMINATED.
      

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.330

        Man: THERE WAS
        AN EVER-ENCROACHING
      

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.130

        WHITE POPULATION
        WHO WANTED OUR LAND.
      

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.470

        AS A PEOPLE, WE WERE HUNTERS.


00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:18.370

        AS ANTHROPOLOGISTS
        WOULD DESCRIBE US
      

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:20.410

        AS HUNTERS AND GATHERERS.


00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.710

        WE SAW OURSELVES
        AS EQUAL PEOPLE.
      

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:29.680

        WE WERE FREE PEOPLE,
        WE HAD ALWAYS BEEN FREE PEOPLE.
      

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.090

        Narrator: MANY INDIANS FOUGHT TO
        MAINTAIN THEIR FREEDOM AND LAND.
      

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.520

        WITHIN A DECADE OF INDEPENDENCE,

        MIAMI, KICKAPOO, AND OTHERS


00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.930

        THREATENED THE STABILITY
        OF THE YOUNG NATION.
      

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.300

        Perdue:
        THE UNITED STATES DECIDED
      

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:56.340

        THAT THE CHEAPEST, EASIEST WAY
        TO AVOID AN INDIAN WAR
      

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.010

        ALONG ITS ENTIRE FRONTIER
        AND ALSO TO ACQUIRE INDIAN LAND
      

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.480

        WAS TO "CIVILIZE" THE INDIANS.


00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.350

        CIVILIZATION INCLUDED
        CHRISTIAN RELIGION.
      

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:12.720

        IT INCLUDED AN ENGLISH EDUCATION
        AND COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE.
      

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:18.660

        IF YOU CAN CONVERT INDIANS
        FROM HUNTERS INTO FARMERS,
      

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.130

        IF YOU COULD CONFINE THEM
        TO A SMALL ACREAGE,
      

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:26.410

        THEN YOU WOULD HAVE
        ALL THIS SURPLUS LAND
      

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.840

        WHICH COULD OPEN
        TO WHITE SETTLEMENT.

        Allen: THE CIVILIZATION POLICY


00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:40.290

        WAS ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO
        ASSIMILATE US INTO AMERICA.
      

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.990

        IT WAS ULTIMATELY
        TO MAKE US FARMERS,
      

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:46.290

        TO LIVE LIKE
        THE COLONISTS LIVED.
      

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:55.370

        THE CIVILIZATION POLICY WAS
        TO MAKE US BROWN WHITE MEN.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.940

        COULD BE ASSIMILATED
        INTO AMERICAN SOCIETY.
      

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.910

        TO HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT
      

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.460

        FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE

        IT WAS THROUGH THOSE EYES
      

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.310

        THAT THE MAN WHO WROTE
        THE NATION'S CREDO,
      

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:46.820

        "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL,"
        PUT FORTH AS A SUSPICION ONLY
      

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.760

        THAT THE BLACKS
        "ARE INFERIOR TO THE WHITES
      

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.560

        IN THE ENDOWMENTS
        BOTH OF BODY AND MIND."
      

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.490

        Berlin: THIS DIFFERENCE
        IS NOT SIMPLY
      

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.560

        A PRODUCT OF CIRCUMSTANCE,


00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.200

        IT'S NOT SIMPLY A PRODUCT
        OF THE ENVIRONMENT,
      

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.900

        BUT JEFFERSON BROACHES THIS
        POSSIBILITY THAT IT IS SOMETHING
      

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.540

        MUCH DEEPER, SOMETHING INNATE.


00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.570

        WE WOULD SAY IN
        OUR OWN LANGUAGE --
      

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.610

        JEFFERSON DIDN'T HAVE
        THIS LANGUAGE --
      

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.210

        WE WOULD SAY GENETIC.


00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.180

        BUT HE SAYS WE WILL NOT
        BE ABLE TO KNOW THIS
      

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.520

        UNTIL SCIENCE GIVES US
        THE ANSWERS.
      

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.590

        AND SO HE CALLS ON SCIENCE.


00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.620

        Finkelman: HE SETS AMERICAN
        SCIENCE ON THE PATH
      

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.290

        OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT


00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:30.290

        WHAT IT IS SCIENTIFICALLY


00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.730

        THAT MAKES BLACKS
        INFERIOR TO WHITES.
      

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.200

        AND OF COURSE, IF THAT'S
        THE QUESTION THE SCIENTIST ASKS,
      

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.070

        THEN THAT'S THE QUESTION
        THE SCIENTIST WILL ANSWER.
      

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.480

        Horton: AND SO
        FROM THAT MOMENT ON,
      

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.150

        YOU START TO BUILD A CASE
        THAT IS SPECIFICALLY GEARED
      

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:52.350

        TO TELL THE WORLD THAT
        THESE PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT.
      

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:58.920

        THEORIES OF RACE
        ARE USED TO DO THAT.
      

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.330

        Narrator: IN THE NEXT CENTURY,
        AS THE NATION EXPANDED,
      

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.260

        SO WOULD IDEAS
        ABOUT HUMAN DIFFERENCE.
      

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.600

        SCIENCE AND SLAVERY WOULD HELP
        FOCUS THE NATION'S ATTENTION
      

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:14.010

        ON THE NATURE OF BLACK PEOPLE.


00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.740

        BUT LAND WOULD PROPEL
        NATIVE AMERICANS
      

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:30.190

        INTO THE RACIAL SPOTLIGHT.


00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:34.860

        A RISING NATION SPREAD
        OVER WIDE AND FRUITFUL LAND
      

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.990

        TRAVERSING ALL THE SEAS


00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.760

        WITH THE RICH PRODUCTIONS
        OF THEIR INDUSTRY,
      

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:48.810

        ADVANCING RAPIDLY TO DESTINIES
        BEYOND THE REACH OF MORTAL EYE.
      

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.680

        Narrator:
        THE HOPES EXPRESSED BY JEFFERSON
      

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.140

        IN HIS FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS


00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:56.950

        WERE PARTIALLY REALIZED
        TWO YEARS LATER, IN 1803,
      

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:00.280

        WHEN THE UNITED STATES PURCHASED
        THE LOUISIANA TERRITORY
      

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.860

        FROM FRANCE, DOUBLING
        THE SIZE OF THE COUNTRY.
      

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.560

        Woman: JEFFERSON BELIEVED THAT


00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.030

        THE UNITED STATES
        HAD A GREAT FUTURE
      

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.630

        BECAUSE IT COULD
        EXPAND THROUGH SPACE,
      

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:15.930

        THAT THE AGRARIAN IDEAL
        OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE
      

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:21.970

        COULD BE MAINTAINED BY EXPANDING
        THE COUNTRY WESTWARD.
      

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.840

        Horsman: OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE
        VERY BIG PROBLEMS WITH THIS.
      

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.010

        THE LAND WAS NOT EMPTY.


00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:34.320

        ONE DID OVERRUN INDIANS.


00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.720

        Narrator: AT THE TIME
        OF THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE,
      

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.390

        DOZENS OF INDIAN TRIBES


00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.230

        POPULATED THE VAST NEW TERRITORY
        WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.
      

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.200

        AND SOME INDIAN NATIONS
        LIKE THE CHEROKEE
      

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.870

        STILL OWNED MASSIVE TRACTS
        OF LAND IN THE SOUTHEAST.
      

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.940

        Perdue: INDIANS IN THE SOUTH
        LIVED IN THE REGION
      

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.480

        IN WHICH WEALTH WAS VERY FIRMLY
        GROUNDED IN LAND.
      

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.450

        PLANTERS NEEDED LAND
        ON WHICH TO GROW TOBACCO
      

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.550

        TO GROW COTTON,
        TO GROW OTHER STAPLE CROPS.
      

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.650

        INDIANS OCCUPIED THAT LAND.


00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:09.190

        INDIANS OWNED THAT LAND.


00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.660

        AND CONSEQUENTLY,


00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:14.060

        INDIANS WERE UNDER CONSTANT
        PRESSURE FOR THAT LAND.
      

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.030

        Narrator: IN RESPONSE
        TO THIS PRESSURE
      

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.660

        AND DEFEATS ON THE BATTLEFIELD,


00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:21.870

        SOME TRIBES LIKE THE CHEROKEE


00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.040

        EMBRACED THE GOVERNMENT
        CIVILIZATION POLICY
      

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.700

        FIRST BEGUN IN THE 1790s.


00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.040

        THEY WOULD PUT TO THE TEST
        JEFFERSON'S WORDS.
      

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.780

        "WE SHALL ALL BE AMERICANS.


00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.780

        "YOUR BLOOD
        WILL RUN IN OUR VEINS
      

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.150

        AND WILL SPREAD WITH US
        OVER THIS GREAT CONTINENT."
      

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:41.620

        Perdue: MOST PEOPLE
        CONSIDER THE CHEROKEES
      

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.790

        TO BE THE GREAT SUCCESS STORY
        OF THE CIVILIZATION POLICY.
      

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.590

        THE CHEROKEES WERE ABLE
        VERY QUICKLY
      

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.260

        TO TRANSFORM,
        AT LEAST ON A SUPERFICIAL LEVEL,
      

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:53.870

        THEIR CULTURE.


00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.730

        THE CHEROKEES MADE
        MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
      

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.970

        THAT LED THEIR SUPPORTERS


00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:03.880

        TO PROCLAIM THEM TO BE
        CIVILIZED INDIANS.
      

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:08.650

        Narrator: ONE OF THE LARGEST
        TRIBES IN AMERICA,
      

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.380

        THE CHEROKEES HAD LIVED IN SMALL
        VILLAGES IN PARTS OF WHAT IS NOW
      

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.590

        AND GEORGIA.
      

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.230

        BY 1819,
        THEY HAD SIGNED TREATIES
      

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:26.030

        CEDING OVER 90% OF THEIR LAND
        TO THE UNITED STATES.
      

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.770

        WITH THE CIVILIZATION POLICY,


00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.540

        MANY CHEROKEES HAD SWITCHED
        FROM BEING HUNTERS TO FARMERS.
      

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.140

        SOME EVEN RAN PLANTATIONS
        AND OWNED SLAVES.
      

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.640

        THEIR CHILDREN LEARNED

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.580

        A CHEROKEE ALPHABET WAS CREATED,


00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.350

        AND IN THE 1820s,
        THE CHEROKEE NATION
      

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:51.820

        BEGAN PUBLISHING
        A BILINGUAL NEWSPAPER.
      

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.660

        THEY ESTABLISHED A GOVERNMENT
        AND CONSTITUTION
      

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.330

        THAT WAS PATTERNED
        AFTER THE UNITED STATES.

        Allen: THE CIVILIZATION POLICY


00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.230

        WAS LOOKED ON
        AS A TOOL FOR SURVIVAL.
      

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.610

        WE BEGAN TO SEE THAT
        THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY WAY
      

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.340

        FOR THE CHEROKEE PEOPLE
        TO LIVE IN PEACE
      

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.380

        WITH THE UNITED STATES,


00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:18.020

        NOT SO MUCH THAT WE WANTED
        TO BECOME WHITE PEOPLE.
      

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.450

        Malcomson: AS THE CHEROKEES
        BECAME MORE AND MORE PROSPEROUS
      

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.560

        ALONG MORE OR LESS CLASSIC
        WHITE, SOUTHERN LINES,
      

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.760

        THE NATURE OF WHITE GOVERNMENT
        IN AMERICA WAS CHANGING.
      

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.760

        THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
        HAD TO APPEAL TO
      

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.170

        A MUCH WIDER BASE OF
        WHITE AMERICAN MEN
      

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.840

        THAN IT HAD PREVIOUSLY
        IN THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD.
      

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.940

        ONE OF THE MAIN INTERESTS
        OF THIS DEMOGRAPHIC
      

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.070

        OF LESS WELL-OFF
        WHITE AMERICAN MEN
      

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.240

        WAS TO GET LAND
        SO THAT THEY COULD BECOME
      

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.150

        BETTER-OFF WHITE AMERICAN MEN.


00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.150

        THE MAIN RESULT OF THIS,


00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:51.710

        WHICH WAS FROM
        THE WHITE POINT OF VIEW
      

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.320

        AN EXPANSION OF DEMOCRACY


00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.450

        AND OF DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATION
        OF INCLUSION
      

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.260

        OF MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
        IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY,
      

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.330

        FROM THE INDIAN POINT OF VIEW
        WAS THE GRADUAL EMPOWERMENT
      

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:03.860

        OF EXACTLY THE POPULATION


00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:09.600

        WHICH WOULD LIKE
        TO TAKE WHAT THEY HAD.
      

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.800

        Narrator: EVERY YEAR MORE WHITE
        SETTLERS ARRIVED IN GEORGIA,
      

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.710

        SEEKING TO SETTLE
        ON WHAT WAS STILL INDIAN LAND.
      

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:19.440

        THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
        HAD PROMISED TO REMOVE

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.450

        BUT 25 YEARS LATER,


00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.650

        WITH THE CHEROKEES APPEARING
        EVEN MORE ENTRENCHED,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.970

        THE STATE HELD A LOTTERY


00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.870

        GIVING WHITES TITLE
        TO CHEROKEE PROPERTY.
      

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.440

        Perdue:

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.480

        THEY KILLED PEOPLE,
        THEY STOLE THEIR PROPERTY.
      

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.680

        THEY FORCED THEM
        OUT OF THEIR HOUSES.
      

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.890

        CHEROKEES WERE REALLY BEING
        PRESSED FROM ALL SIDES,
      

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:08.230

        INCREASED IN 1828
      

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.000

        WHEN ANDREW JACKSON
        WAS ELECTED PRESIDENT
      

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.440

        ON A PLATFORM CHAMPIONING
        OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMON MAN.
      

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.210

        REMOVING ALL INDIANS
        EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI
      

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.950

        WAS CENTRAL TO HIS AGENDA.

        OUT IN A KIND OF A POPULIST WAY,
      

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.920

        SPEAKING FOR THE LITTLE GUY,
        SPEAKING OUT AGAINST PRIVILEGE,
      

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.460

        HIS LITTLE GUY, HIS CITIZEN,


00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.730

        IS INCREASINGLY
        A WHITE MALE CITIZEN.
      

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.330

        AS AMERICA IS BECOMING MORE
        DEMOCRATIC FOR WHITE MALES,
      

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:53.670

        IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY
        MORE RACE-BASED.
      

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:58.580

        IT'S BELIEVED THAT ONLY WHITE
        PEOPLE CAN MAINTAIN THE LAND,

        PRESERVE IT, PROTECT
        THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE,
      

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:03.650

        FOR SELF-GOVERNMENT
      

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:11.220

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.870

        THEY THOUGHT THE SAME WAY,

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.380

        THEY SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE,
        THEY LOOKED THE SAME.
      

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.610

        AND THIS IS VERY CONTRADICTORY
        TO THE ENLIGHTENMENT NOTIONS

        LEWIS CASS
      

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.190

        PROVIDED A JUSTIFICATION,

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.470

        RESISTED REMOVAL,


00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:58.530

        PRESIDENT JACKSON'S RESPONSE

        IN RACIAL THINKING
        ABOUT THE INDIANS.

        THEY SHOULD NOT
        BECOME LIKE WHITE PEOPLE,
      

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.730

        THEY SHOULD PRESERVE THEMSELVES
        AS INDIANS.
      

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:13.500

        AND NOT ONLY THAT, THEY SHOULD
        PRESERVE THEMSELVES AS INDIANS
      

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:22.750

        THE UNITED STATES ARMY
      

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.560

        FORCED THEM TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES

        SOUTHEASTERN INDIANS
      

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.420

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.560

        WAS ALSO ABOUT WHO COULD BE
        CIVILIZED AND WHO COULDN'T,
      

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.590

        WHO COULD BE WHITE,

        OF THIS COUNTRY
      

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.760

        AND WHO COULD RESIDE
        WITHIN ITS BORDERS.
      

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.630

        AND AS THE COUNTRY MOVES WEST,


00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.870

        THAT QUESTION GETS ANSWERED
        IN THE SAME FASHION
      

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:23.140

        OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:32.920

        AMERICA WENT TO WAR WITH MEXICO
        TO ACQUIRE MORE LAND.
      

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.690

        SUPPORTERS OF THE WAR
        ARGUED THAT MEXICANS
      

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.820

        WERE AN INFERIOR MONGREL RACE.


00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.730

        A POPULAR GUIDE FOR HOMESTEADERS
        DESCRIBED THEM AS
      

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:46.660

        "MERE INDIANS,
        BARBAROUS SAVAGES WHO INTEND
      

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:51.140

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:04.750

        THE UNITED STATES ANNEXED
        ONE-THIRD OF MEXICO'S LAND.

        THE WEST WAS FOR THEM
      

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.220

        AND FOR THEM ALONE.


00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.830

        BUT THIS WAS PART OF THE WHOLE
        PHILOSOPHY OF MANIFEST DESTINY,
      

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.890

        OF WHAT IMPELLED
        WESTERN EXPANSION
      

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.930

        THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE PART
        OF THE 19th CENTURY.
      

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.230

        THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT


00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:28.700

        THE WEST BELONGED
        TO WHITE AMERICANS.

        Narrator: AS THEY CONTINUED
        THEIR EXPANSION WESTWARD,
      

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:36.410

        SOME WHITE AMERICANS WOULD USE
        SCIENCE TO JUSTIFY THEIR ACTIONS
      

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:54.900

        AND SUPPORT THEIR BELIEF
        IN RACIAL SUPERIORITY.
      

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.530

        Bay: DURING THE 19th CENTURY


00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:01.040

        THERE WERE LOTS OF PUBLIC
        LECTURES ON THE RACES OF MAN.
      

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.710

        SCIENCE WAS, BECAUSE IT WAS NEW,


00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.540

        WAS SOMETHING PEOPLE
        WERE AVIDLY INTERESTED IN.
      

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.580

        SCIENCE IN THE 19th CENTURY
        WAS EXPECTED
      

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:12.980

        TO REVEAL ALL THE MYSTERIES
        OF THE UNIVERSE.
      

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.250

        Horsman: YOU EVEN SEE SPECIFIC
        REFERENCES BY THIS PERIOD
      

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:22.060

        WHERE THEY'RE SAYING "RACE IS
        THE GREAT ISSUE OF THE AGE."
      

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.160

        Narrator:
        THE NATION'S INTEREST IN RACE
      

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.900

        WAS MORE THAN IDLE FASCINATION.


00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.200

        IN THE 1840s,
        THE QUESTION OF WHETHER SLAVERY
      

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.270

        WOULD EXPAND TO NEWLY ACQUIRED
        WESTERN LANDS
      

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:36.810

        WAS BITTERLY DIVIDING THE NATION


00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:43.210

        AND FUELING ATTACKS ON SLAVERY.


00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.350

        Malcomson:
        THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT MOMENTUM
      

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:49.950

        TOWARDS THE ABOLITION
        OF RACIAL SLAVERY.
      

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.120

        BUT THERE WERE ALSO VERY STRONG
        COUNTERVAILING TRENDS.
      

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.990

        AND IN THE END,


00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:58.260

        THIS CREATED AN ENORMOUS TENSION
        WITHIN WHITE SOCIETY
      

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.430

        BECAUSE IT WAS CAUGHT
        IN THIS CONTRADICTION
      

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:06.670

        THAT WAS INESCAPABLE.


00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.970

        Bay: AS PEOPLE BEGIN
        TO OPPOSE SLAVERY,
      

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:11.210

        THE WHOLE QUESTION


00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.180

        OF WHAT THE DIFFERENCE
        BETWEEN THE RACES IS
      

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.410

        AND WHAT THE STATUS OF
        BLACK PEOPLE SHOULD BE
      

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.550

        BECOMES MORE DEBATED.


00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.620

        IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS DEBATE


00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.950

        OVER SLAVERY VERSUS
        ANTI-SLAVERY,
      

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:27.960

        IDEAS ABOUT RACE
        REALLY FLESH OUT.
      

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:32.560

        Narrator: IN 1846, 5,000 PEOPLE
        GATHERED IN BOSTON TO HEAR
      

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.700

        "THE PLAN OF CREATION
        AND THE ANIMAL KINGDOM,"
      

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.530

        THE FIRST AMERICAN LECTURE


00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:43.710

        BY RENOWNED SWISS NATURALIST
        LOUIS AGASSIZ.
      

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.850

        HIS METHODS VALUED OBSERVATION
        OVER SPECULATION.
      

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:50.110

        AGASSIZ WAS QUICKLY
        PULLED INTO
      

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.150

        THE SCIENTIFIC QUESTION
        OF THE DAY --
      

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.750

        ARE ALL PEOPLE,


00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.320

        NO MATTER
        THEIR PHYSICAL FEATURES,
      

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.720

        MEMBERS OF THE SAME
        OR DIFFERENT SPECIES?
      

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.890

        Finkelman: IT'S A DEBATE
        BETWEEN PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT
      

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.060

        THE BOOK OF GENESIS AND SEE WHAT
        THEY CALL A SINGLE CREATION,
      

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.730

        GOD CREATED ADAM AND EVE,


00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.500

        AND SCIENTISTS WHO SAY,
        WELL, ACTUALLY THESE RACES
      

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:13.770

        COULDN'T POSSIBLY
        HAVE COME FROM THE SAME PLACE.
      

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:21.310

        THERE MUST BE DIFFERENT
        AND SEPARATE CREATIONS.
      

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.280

        Narrator:
        AGASSIZ ARRIVED IN AMERICA,
      

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.620

        SUPPORTING THE THEORY
        THAT ALL HUMANS WERE UNITED
      

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.320

        IN A SINGLE CREATION.


00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.790

        BUT HE SOON BEGAN
        TO RETHINK HIS POSITION
      

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.030

        AFTER MEETING ONE OF AMERICA'S
        MOST DISTINGUISHED SCIENTISTS,
      

00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:38.530

        SAMUEL MORTON.


00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:40.360

        A PHILADELPHIA PHYSICIAN,


00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.300

        MORTON OWNED THE WORLD'S LARGEST
        COLLECTION OF HUMAN SKULLS,
      

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.640

        AND HAD WRITTEN
        TWO INFLUENTIAL BOOKS
      

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.770

        DOCUMENTING WHAT HE CLAIMED
        WERE INNATE DIFFERENCES
      

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.440

        AMONG HUMANS.


00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.510

        ONE FOCUSED ON AMERICAN INDIANS.


00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:58.980

        Horsman: THE FOUNDATION WORK
        WAS A WORK CALLED
      

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.020

        "CRANIA AMERICANA,"


00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:07.420

        IN WHICH HE ARGUED THAT HE WAS
        USING PURELY SCIENTIFIC METHODS
      

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.930

        TO INVESTIGATE THE QUESTION
        OF SKULL SIZE,
      

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.300

        SKULL CAPACITY,
        WHICH HAD IMPLICATIONS
      

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:17.330

        FOR BRAIN SIZE,
        WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS VITAL
      

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:23.440

        IN HOW RACES PROGRESSED.


00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.540

        Finkelman: LO AND BEHOLD,
        HE DISCOVERS
      

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:26.910

        THAT WHITE AMERICAN MALES


00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:28.650

        ARE THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
        ON EARTH,
      

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.050

        FOLLOWED IN GRADATION
        BY THE ENGLISH, THE FRENCH,
      

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:33.250

        AND THEN OTHER EUROPEANS,
        AND THEN
      

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.450

        OTHER RACES, WITH BLACKS
        ALWAYS ON THE BOTTOM.
      

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.060

        CURIOUSLY SOME ENGLISH SCHOLARS
        DO THE SAME THING,
      

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.820

        THEY DISCOVER ENGLISHMEN ARE
        ACTUALLY SMARTER THAN AMERICANS,
      

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.660

        FOLLOWED BY FRENCH
        AND OTHER EUROPEANS.
      

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.260

        AND GUESS WHAT
        THE FRENCH DISCOVER?
      

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.130

        THAT THE FRENCH ARE
        REALLY SMARTER THAN BOTH.
      

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:51.500

        SOMEHOW HE MANAGED TO MAKE
        SORT OF SYSTEMATIC ERRORS
      

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.470

        IN FAVOR OF WHAT WAS
        THE, YOU KNOW, THE SORT OF
      

00:32:55.470 --> 00:33:00.480

        UNDERSTOOD HIERARCHY
        OF THE RACES OF THE DAY.
      

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.710

        Man: SAMUEL MORTON DREW
        WILD CONCLUSIONS
      

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.120

        BASED ON VERY CAREFUL STUDYING
        AND RANKING
      

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.220

        OF THESE SKULLS.


00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.860

        I DON'T CARE HOW MANY TIMES
        YOU MEASURE A SKULL
      

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:16.190

        OR EVEN ANYTHING PHYSICAL
        ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL
      

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.660

        OR A GROUP OF PEOPLE --


00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:19.800

        YOU CANNOT PREDICT
        THEIR MORALITY,
      

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.700

        THEIR BEHAVIOR,
        THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS,
      

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.100

        POTENTIAL FOR ACHIEVEMENT.


00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.270

        BUT THAT WAS WHAT WAS IMPORTANT


00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:35.080

        ABOUT THIS IDEA OF RACE
        AT THE TIME.
      

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.380

        Horsman: SOUTHERNERS WERE
        ACTUALLY DELIGHTED
      

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.450

        AT WHAT
        THE SCIENTISTS WERE DOING.
      

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.780

        THEY WERE HEARING


00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.120

        FROM, IF YOU LIKE,
        NON-SPECIAL INTERESTS
      

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.690

        THAT THERE WERE HUGE DIFFERENCES
        BETWEEN THE RACES.
      

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.460

        NOW THIS MEANT THAT THE SOUTH
        BEGAN TO ARGUE
      

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.200

        QUITE VIGOROUSLY


00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.200

        THAT THE BEST
        SCIENTIFIC OPINION IS SAYING
      

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.270

        THAT SLAVES CANNOT EXIST
        WITHIN A FREE WHITE SOCIETY
      

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:06.310

        AND THAT THEY ARE INFERIOR.


00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:11.320

        Finkelman: THE ULTIMATE DEFENSE
        OF SLAVERY IS A RACIAL DEFENSE,
      

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.120

        THAT BLACKS ARE INFERIOR


00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.920

        AND THEREFORE THEY ARE
        READY-MADE SLAVES.
      

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.720

        GOD CREATED THEM AS SLAVES.


00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.260

        Narrator: "WHY ALL THIS RANT
        ABOUT NEGRO EQUALITY,"
      

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.930

        ASKED JOHN CAMPBELL
        IN HIS BOOK NEGRO-MANIA,
      

00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:29.200

        "SEEING THAT NEITHER NATURE
        OR NATURE'S GOD
      

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.000

        EVER ESTABLISHED
        ANY SUCH EQUALITY?"
      

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.510

        JOSIAH NOTT,
        A SOUTHERN DOCTOR
      

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.240

        AND DISCIPLE OF MORTON,
        FIRMLY BELIEVED
      

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.950

        THAT BLACK PEOPLE
        WERE A SEPARATE SPECIES
      

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:49.050

        AND USED SCIENCE TO WAGE
        A VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF SLAVERY.
      

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.820

        Horsman: THOUGH HE WAS
        A GOOD DOCTOR --
      

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.260

        I MEAN, FOR THE PERIOD --


00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:55.460

        AND WELL-REGARDED AS AN EXPERT
        ON YELLOW FEVER,
      

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:59.560

        HE IMMEDIATELY STARTS TO SHOW
        FROM THESE VERY FIRST WRITINGS
      

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.460

        THAT WHEN HE WRITES
        ABOUT RACE,
      

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.870

        HE THROWS OFF REALLY
        ANY SCIENTIFIC REALISM AT ALL
      

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.800

        AND WRITES FROM HIS PREJUDICES.


00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.340

        IT SEEMS SO EXAGGERATED,


00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.380

        IT LOOKS LIKE
        THE PUBLICATION YOU'D GET
      

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.750

        ON A SORT OF
        A DIRTY LITTLE LEAFLET
      

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:19.420

        THAT SOME FRINGE ORGANIZATION
        HAS PUBLISHED,
      

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:24.690

        AND YET IT'S ACCEPTED
        SCIENTIFIC FACT FOR A TIME.
      

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.460

        Narrator: AS THESE IDEAS
        TOOK HOLD,
      

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.330

        PRO-SLAVERY ADVOCATES ARGUED


00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:31.930

        THAT THE ENSLAVEMENT
        OF BLACK PEOPLE
      

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.000

        DID NOT VIOLATE THE DEMOCRATIC
        SPIRIT OF AMERICA,
      

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.930

        BECAUSE JEFFERSON'S TERM
        "ALL MEN"
      

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:47.340

        DID NOT SCIENTIFICALLY
        INCLUDE BLACK PEOPLE.
      

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:50.150

        IN 1850, LOUIS AGASSIZ,


00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:52.920

        BY THEN, HARVARD'S
        MOST PROMINENT PROFESSOR,
      

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.650

        TOLD HIS FELLOW MEMBERS


00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.950

        OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
        FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE
      

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:03.190

        THAT, "VIEWED ZOOLOGICALLY,
        THE SEVERAL RACES OF MEN
      

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:07.030

        WERE WELL MARKED AND DISTINCT."


00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:10.730

        JOSIAH NOTT WROTE
        TO SAMUEL MORTON,
      

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:16.810

        "WITH AGASSIZ IN THE WAR,
        THE BATTLE IS OURS."
      

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:20.310

        Baker:
        HERE WAS THE MOST OBJECTIVE,
      

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.880

        THE PINNACLE
        OF THE SCIENTIFIC MAN,
      

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.080

        INFLUENCED BY AMERICAN RACISM,


00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.890

        AND WHO TRANSFORMED
        HIS DEEPLY HELD BELIEF
      

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.120

        IN THE UNITY OF MANKIND.


00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:37.730

        I THINK THAT SAYS,
        MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE,
      

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:40.160

        THAT THE POWER OF
        THE IDEOLOGY OF RACE
      

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.240

        CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S MINDS.


00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.710

        Narrator: THREE YEARS LATER,
        AGASSIZ CONTRIBUTED A CHAPTER
      

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:54.540

        TO A FORTHCOMING BOOK
        COAUTHORED BY NOTT.
      

00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:01.050

        THE 738-PAGE "TYPES OF MANKIND"
        WAS GREATLY ANTICIPATED.
      

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:06.060

        IT PRESOLD
        ITS ENTIRE FIRST EDITION.
      

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:10.290

        Baker: "TYPES OF MANKIND"
        WAS TREMENDOUSLY INFLUENTIAL.
      

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:14.900

        IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
        THAT SCIENTISTS PULLED TOGETHER
      

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.930

        ALL OF THE RESEARCH
        THAT JUSTIFIED THE ARGUMENT
      

00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:20.900

        THAT AFRICAN-AMERICANS,
        NATIVE AMERICANS,
      

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:27.010

        ASIANS, ET CETERA,
        WERE DIFFERENT SPECIES.
      

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.710

        NATIONS AND RACES,
        LIKE INDIVIDUALS,
      

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:32.720

        HAVE EACH
        AN ESPECIAL DESTINY.
      

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.850

        SOME ARE BORN TO RULE,
        AND OTHERS TO BE RULED,
      

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:40.290

        AND SUCH HAS EVER BEEN
        THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.
      

00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:44.460

        NO TWO DISTINCTLY MARKED RACES
        CAN DWELL TOGETHER
      

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:50.200

        ON EQUAL TERMS.

        Narrator: "TYPES OF MANKIND"


00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.770

        WAS ONE OF THE BEST SELLING
        SCIENCE BOOKS OF ITS DAY.
      

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:00.040

        AMONG THE FIRST TO BUY IT


00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.140

        WERE THE UNITED STATES
        DEPARTMENTS OF STATE,
      

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:08.550

        NAVY, AND TREASURY.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.320

        AND POPULAR OPINION


00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.390

        WELD TOGETHER IN A WAY


00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.760

        THAT IS EXTREMELY USEFUL
        FOR BOTH.
      

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.500

        THE POLITICIANS
        AND THE GENERAL POPULATION
      

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.700

        ARE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE
        SCIENTIFIC VIEWS TO LEAN ON
      

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:29.670

        WHICH SAY THAT THE FACT THAT
        THIS SUCCESSFUL REPUBLIC
      

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.780

        IS NOT DESTROYING INDIANS
        JUST FOR THE LOVE OF IT,
      

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.550

        THEY'RE NOT ENSLAVING BLACKS
        BECAUSE THEY'RE SELFISH,
      

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.380

        THEY'RE NOT OVERRUNNING
        MEXICAN LANDS
      

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.850

        BECAUSE THEY'RE AVARICIOUS
        FOR LAND,
      

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:48.120

        THAT THIS IS PART OF
        SOME GREAT
      

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.760

        INEVITABILITY OF SCIENCE,


00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.600

        OF REALLY THE WAY
        RACES ARE CONSTITUTED,
      

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.530

        THAT IS THE CAUCASIAN RACE,


00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.600

        AND EVEN CERTAIN BRANCHES
        WITHIN THE CAUCASIAN RACE,
      

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:04.410

        ARE SUPERIOR.


00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:09.610

        Hammonds: IT'S A WAY OF SORT OF
        NATURALIZING A SOCIAL STRUCTURE,
      

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:13.450

        WHICH EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD
        AND CLEARLY SAW,
      

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.590

        THAT THE "NEGRO,"


00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.720

        OR IN OTHER REGIONS
        OF THE COUNTRY
      

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.260

        THE NATIVE AMERICAN
        OR THE CHINESE,
      

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.620

        WERE AT THE BOTTOM


00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.990

        OF THE SOCIAL
        AND POLITICAL HIERARCHY.
      

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.900

        AND IF YOU CAN SAY THAT
        THEY ARE
      

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.000

        FUNDAMENTALLY
        BIOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT,
      

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.300

        THEN THEY SHOULD BE.


00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.840

        Narrator: IN THE 1857
        DRED SCOTT CASE,
      

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.910

        THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED THAT
        PEOPLE OF AFRICAN ANCESTRY,
      

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:42.080

        ENSLAVED OR FREE,


00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.480

        COULD NEVER BECOME CITIZENS
        OF THE UNITED STATES.
      

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:49.190

        THE OPINION STATED
        THAT BLACK PEOPLE HAD NO RIGHTS
      

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:52.520

        WHICH THE WHITE MAN
        WAS BOUND TO RESPECT.
      

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.190

        Horsman: THERE'S BEEN
        A REMARKABLE TRANSFORMATION,
      

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:56.960

        BECAUSE IF YOU'RE THINKING,


00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.560

        SAY, 50 OR 60 YEARS BEFORE
        IN AMERICAN HISTORY,
      

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:04.530

        YOU'VE GOT JEFFERSON
        AMBIGUOUSLY TALKING ABOUT,
      

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.800

        WELL, HE THINKS POSSIBLY
        BLACKS ARE NOT QUITE
      

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.570

        OF THE SAME CAPACITY AS WHITES
        BUT HE ISN'T SURE.
      

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:15.010

        BUT THEY GET TO THE 1850s,
        PEOPLE ARE WRITING,
      

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:28.760

        THERE ARE DEEP, IRREVOCABLE
        GULFS BETWEEN THE RACES.
      

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:37.570

        Narrator: THE CONFLICT OVER
        SLAVERY LED THE NATION TO WAR.
      

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:41.300

        AFTER PRESIDENT LINCOLN SIGNED
        THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION,
      

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.540

        HIS ADMINISTRATION CONSULTED
        LOUIS AGASSIZ
      

00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.180

        ON HOW TO DEAL WITH THE NEWLY
        FREED BLACK POPULATION.
      

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.850

        AGASSIZ ADVISED,


00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.420

        "BEWARE OF HOW WE GIVE
        TO THE BLACKS RIGHTS
      

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.720

        "BY VIRTUE OF WHICH


00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.220

        "THEY MAY ENDANGER
        THE PROGRESS OF WHITES.
      

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:07.430

        THEY ARE INCAPABLE OF LIVING ON
        A FOOTING OF SOCIAL EQUALITY."

        Horton: IF AMERICA HAD JUST
        LOOKED THE WORLD IN THE EYE
      

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.900

        AND SAID, "WE HOLD THESE PEOPLE
        IN SLAVERY
      

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.940

        "BECAUSE WE NEED THEIR LABOR


00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.310

        AND WE'VE GOT THE POWER
        TO DO IT,"
      

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:18.070

        NOW, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
        MUCH BETTER
      

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.640

        BECAUSE THEN WHEN
        THE POWER WAS GONE,
      

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.840

        WHEN SLAVERY IS OVER, IT'S OVER.


00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.220

        BUT WHAT WE SAID WAS, THERE'S
        SOMETHING ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.
      

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.650

        BY DOING THAT, IT MEANS THAT
        WHEN SLAVERY IS OVER,
      

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:40.300

        THAT RATIONALIZATION

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:50.910

        IDEAS OF RACIAL DIFFERENCE WOULD
        BECOME WIDELY ACCEPTED AT HOME

        OF NATIONAL IDENTITY.
      

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:59.540

        RACE WAS A COMMON TOPIC

        MIDDLE CLASS READERSHIP
      

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.150

        WAS INTERESTED

        THE INDIAN QUESTION,


00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.660

        THE NEGRO QUESTION.


00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.430

        PEOPLE CONSUMED IT WITHOUT EVEN

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:27.940

        THAT WENT BEHIND IT,

        IT'S A PRINCIPLE OF

        RIGHT NOW,
      

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.710
