00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:05.542
CHARLES DARWIN ONCE TOOK 
A RIDE ON ONE OF THESE

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:07.250
AND IT WAS SOMETHING 
ABOUT THEIR SHELLS

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.999
THAT GAVE HIM THE FIRST HINT

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.999
THAT LIVING CREATURES 
CHANGE OVER TIME.

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:13.667
( crunching )

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:15.999
THE GIANT TORTOISES 
OF THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:17.999
ARE AMONG THE MANY 
UNIQUE ANIMALS HERE...

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:18.999
OKAY, I'M SORRY, 
I'M SORRY.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:20.999
Alda: 
THAT GOT DARWIN TO THINKING

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.667
ABOUT HOW NEW SPECIES COME 
INTO BEING.

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:29.999
TODAY THE ISLANDS' CREATURES 
STILL AMAZE THEIR VISITORS

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:32.999
AND PROVIDE INSIGHTS 
INTO HOW EVOLUTION WORKS.

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.999
I HAVE GOOD 
BEGINNER'S LUCK.

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:35.999
I'M ALAN ALDA.

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:38.999
JOIN ME AND THE CREATURES 
THAT INSPIRED DARWIN

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:40.999
AS WE VOYAGE TO THE GALAPAGOS.

IN 1831, AT THE AGE OF 22

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:26.999
CHARLES DARWIN SET OFF 
ON A VOYAGE

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.999
THAT WOULD CHANGE NOT ONLY 
HIS LIFE BUT OURS AS WELL.

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.959
THE NATURALIST ON A 
BRITISH NAVAL SHIP, THE BEAGLE

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:36.999
DARWIN TRAVELED AROUND 
SOUTH AMERICA AND BEYOND.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:38.999
WHAT HE SAW ON AN 
ISOLATED GROUP OF ISLANDS

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.999
OUT HERE IN THE PACIFIC

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.542
BEGAN AN INTELLECTUAL VOYAGE 
THAT WOULD LAST SOME 20 YEARS

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.999
AND WOULD CULMINATE IN THE THEN 
SHOCKING IDEA THAT LIVING THINGS

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.999
ARE NOT DESIGNED ACCORDING 
TO AN UNCHANGEABLE PLAN

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.667
BUT INSTEAD ARE SHAPED 
BY THE WORLD AROUND THEM.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:00.999
WHEN THE BEAGLE FINALLY 
ANCHORED HERE IN THE GALAPAGOS

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.999
IN SEPTEMBER OF 1835

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:05.417
DARWIN WAS VERY EXCITED 
ABOUT COMING HERE.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.999
HE WAS REALLY FASCINATED 
WITH THE GEOLOGY OF THE PLACE

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.542
PARTICULARLY THE VOLCANIC 
ORIGINS OF THESE ISLANDS.

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:13.834
BUT WHEN HE ACTUALLY SET FOOT 
ON THE SHORE

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.999
HE WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED 
IN THIS PLACE.

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:17.125
IN FACT, THIS IS WHAT HE WROTE:

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:20.999
"NOTHING COULD BE LESS INVITING 
THAN THE FIRST APPEARANCE.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.999
"A BROKEN FIELD 
OF BLACK, BASALTIC LAVA

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
"IS EVERYWHERE COVERED 
BY A STUNTED BRUSHWOOD

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.000
"WHICH SHOWS LITTLE 
SIGNS OF LIFE.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.999
"THE DRY AND PARCHED SURFACE

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.667
"HAVING BEEN HEATED 
BY THE NOONDAY SUN

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:36.999
"GAVE THE AIR A CLOSE 
AND SULTRY FEELING

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.834
LIKE THAT FROM A STOVE."

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.999
600 MILES OFF 
THE SOUTH AMERICAN COAST

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:46.999
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS ARE 
ACTUALLY THE TIPS OF VOLCANOES

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.999
THAT HAVE PUSHED THEIR WAY 
ABOVE THE OCEAN SURFACE.

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.999
THE OLDEST ISLANDS WERE FORMED

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.999
SOME TWO TO 
THREE MILLION YEARS AGO.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.999
THE YOUNGEST, 
INCLUDING THE BIGGEST, ISABELA

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.999
ARE A FEW HUNDRED 
THOUSAND YEARS OLD

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.999
WITH VOLCANOES THAT STILL ERUPT.

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.542
MY VISIT TO THE GALAPAGOS 
IS TO TAKE ME

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:10.999
TO OVER HALF THE DOZEN 
OR SO MAJOR ISLANDS

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:15.250
INCLUDING ONE WHOSE VOLCANIC 
ORIGINS ARE ONLY TOO APPARENT.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.834
Alda: 
THESE ROCKS LOOK

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:18.000
LIKE THEY'RE LAID OUT 
IN A CIRCLE.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.959
Woman: 
YEAH, THIS IS 
DEVIL'S CROWN.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:21.999
IT'S AN OLD 
ERODED CRATER

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:23.999
THAT'S VERY SHALLOW HERE 
IN THE MIDDLE.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:25.999
WE'RE IN THE 
MIDDLE OF A CRATER--

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.999
A VOLCANIC CRATER?

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.417
YEAH, IT'S NOT GOING 
TO ERUPT, THOUGH

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:29.834
DON'T WORRY.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:30.999
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:31.999
IT'S OLD-- 
IT'S ALL ERODED.

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:33.999
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF 
OLD THINGS ERUPT--

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:35.000
ME!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.999
I'M REALLY 
SURPRISED AT HOW 
LUSH EVERYTHING IS.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:39.250
THAT'S THE EL NIÑO?

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.999
Alda: 
MY GUIDE ON THE TRIP 
IS LYNN FOWLER

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:45.834
A BIOLOGIST WHO HAS SPENT 
MUCH OF HER LIFE IN THE ISLANDS.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:46.999
WHAT IS THIS 
TRAIL HERE?

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.000
THAT'S A 
LAND IGUANA TRAIL.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
SO AT THE END OF 
THIS TRAIL WE MIGHT 
FIND AN IGUANA?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.999
WE MIGHT FIND ONE-- 
LET'S SEE.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.959
Alda: 
AND HERE, AS IF WAITING 
PATIENTLY FOR OUR ARRIVAL

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.999
IS A CREATURE THAT DARWIN WAS 
NOT IMMEDIATELY IMPRESSED BY.

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.417
WHEN DARWIN FIRST SAW 
THESE LAND IGUANAS

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:04.999
HE THOUGHT THEY LOOKED 
SLOW AND STUPID.

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.999
IN FACT, THERE'S A FUNNY STORY 
HE TELLS ABOUT THAT.

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.999
DARWIN WAS WATCHING 
A LAND IGUANA BURROW

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:16.999
MAKING A HOLE 
SOMEWHAT LIKE THIS ONE

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:18.542
WITH JUST HIS TAIL STICKING OUT.

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:20.999
AND DARWIN GAVE 
THE TAIL A LITTLE YANK

00:04:20.999 --> 00:04:23.999
AND THE IGUANA BACKED OUT 
OF THE HOLE AND TURNED AROUND

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.999
AND LOOKED AT HIM, AS IF TO SAY, 
"WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?"

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.999
WHAT DARWIN INTERPRETED 
AS STUPIDITY

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:33.000
IN THE ISLANDS' LAND IGUANAS

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.417
IS IN FACT AN EXTRAORDINARY 
INDIFFERENCE TO HUMANS

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:39.125
THAT'S SHARED BY ALL 
THE GALAPAGOS ANIMAL LIFE

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.999
AND THAT DARWIN REPEATEDLY NOTED 
IN HIS ACCOUNT OF HIS VOYAGE.

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.999
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT 
IN HIS SEVERAL ENCOUNTERS

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:52.999
WITH THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS' 
MOST FAMOUS RESIDENTS

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.250
THE GIANT TORTOISES:

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.999
"AS I WAS WALKING ALONG, 
I MET TWO LARGE TORTOISES

00:04:57.999 --> 00:05:01.667
"EACH OF WHICH MUST HAVE WEIGHED 
AT LEAST 200 POUNDS.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:03.999
"THESE HUGE REPTILES 
SEEMED TO MY FANCY

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.999
"LIKE SOME ANTEDILUVIAN ANIMALS.

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.999
"I WAS ALWAYS AMUSED 
WHEN OVERTAKING

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:11.417
"ONE OF THESE GREAT MONSTERS 
AS IT WAS QUIETLY PACING ALONG

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.999
"TO SEE HOW SUDDENLY, 
THE INSTANT I PASSED

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:17.667
"IT WOULD DRAW IN ITS HEAD AND 
LEGS, AND UTTERING A DEEP HISS

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:21.125
FALL TO THE GROUND WITH A 
HEAVY SOUND, AS IF STRUCK DEAD."

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:23.417
( tortoise hisses loudly )

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.667
"I FREQUENTLY GOT 
ON THEIR BACKS

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:31.999
"AND THEN GIVING A FEW RAPS ON 
THE HINDER PART OF THEIR SHELLS

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:34.667
"THEY WOULD RISE UP 
AND WALK AWAY

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.999
BUT I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT 
TO KEEP MY BALANCE."

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:41.000
( crunching )

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.999
( giggling )

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.999
TODAY VISITORS TO THE GALAPAGOS 
USUALLY PAY THEIR RESPECTS

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.999
TO THE HANDFUL OF GIANT 
TORTOISES THAT ARE HOUSED

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.999
AT THE RESEARCH STATION HERE 
NAMED FOR CHARLES DARWIN

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:52.999
ALTHOUGH GETTING TO FEED THEM

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:55.000
IS A PRIVILEGE RESERVED 
FOR THE FOOLHARDY.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.834
HELLO.

00:05:57.834 --> 00:05:58.999
( chomp )

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:00.999
WHAT A LOOK 
IN HIS EYE.

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:03.999
( in amazement ): 
OY-OY-OY!

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.999
MY PROBLEM IS 
I NOT ONLY SAW E.T.

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:10.667
I ALSO SAW JURASSIC PARK.

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:13.250
Alda: 
IN DARWIN'S DAY, 
THE GIANT TORTOISES

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.542
WERE STILL BEING HAULED AWAY 
BY THE THOUSANDS

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.417
TO PROVIDE FRESH MEAT 
FOR WHALING SHIPS.

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:19.125
THAT'S A LITTLE 
TOO CLOSE TO 
MY FINGERS--

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.999
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.417
Alda: 
THE GOVERNOR 
OF THE GALAPAGOS TOLD DARWIN

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:25.999
THAT HE COULD TELL 
BY THE SHAPE OF ITS SHELL

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:27.999
WHICH ISLAND 
A TORTOISE CAME FROM.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.999
THIS SADDLE-BACKED TORTOISE, 
FOR INSTANCE

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:33.999
COMES FROM 
THE ISLAND OF ESPAÑOLA.

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:35.999
AT THE TIME, 
DARWIN PAID LITTLE ATTENTION

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:37.999
TO THE GOVERNOR'S CLAIM

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.667
BUT IT WAS TO BE THE FOUNDATION 
FOR EVERYTHING THAT FOLLOWED.

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:49.999
SOON HE SAW FOR HIMSELF 
HOW CREATURES

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.999
COULD BE RECOGNIZABLY DIFFERENT 
FROM ONE ISLAND TO THE NEXT.

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.959
THESE MOCKINGBIRDS, 
LIKE THE SADDLE-BACKED TORTOISE

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.250
ARE FROM THE ISLAND OF ESPAÑOLA.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.999
( chirping loudly )

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.999
Man: 
THESE MOCKINGBIRDS 
ARE HAVING A FLICK FIGHT.

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.125
THEY FLICK THEIR WINGS 
AND THEIR TAIL BACK AND FORTH

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:13.999
AS A TERRITORIAL DISPLAY

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:16.999
BETWEEN TWO BIG GROUPS OF 
MOCKINGBIRDS THAT ARE FAMILIES

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.999
AND THEY'RE DISPUTING 
WHAT'S GOING ON

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:20.667
AT THE TERRITORIAL BOUNDARY.

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:23.999
SO THEY DO THIS 
BIG DISPLAY SAYING, YOU KNOW

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:24.999
"IF YOU CROSS THIS BOUNDARY

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:27.000
"THIS IS WHAT'S GOING 
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.125
IT'S GOING TO BE BAD."

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:32.999
Alda: 
DAVE ANDERSON IS ONE  
OF THE FEW BIOLOGISTS

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:35.999
WITH PERMISSION TO COME 
TO THE GALAPAGOS YEAR AFTER YEAR

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:37.999
TO PURSUE HIS RESEARCH.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.999
THE RULES GOVERNING HIS VISITS 
ARE STRICT

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:42.999
AND EVERYTHING HE BRINGS IN 
MUST GO OUT.

00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:47.999
MOCKINGBIRDS ARE 
A CONSTANT PRESENCE

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:49.999
IN HIS CAMP ON ESPAÑOLA

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:52.999
AND THEY SEEM EAGER TO VOLUNTEER 
FOR A SHOW-AND-TELL.

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:55.999
Anderson: 
ON THIS ISLAND

00:07:55.999 --> 00:07:59.999
THE MOCKINGBIRD SPECIES IS 
LARGER THAN ON OTHER ISLANDS

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:01.999
AND ON THIS ISLAND 
THE BEAK IS LONG AND CURVED.

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:04.999
THEY USE THAT 
TO MOVE DIRT AROUND.

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:06.999
THEY DIG MORE ON THIS ISLAND 
THAN ON OTHER ISLANDS.

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:11.000
ALSO THE BREAST FEATHERS 
ARE WHITISH AND SPECKLED

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.999
AND SOME OF THE OTHER SPECIES 
ARE MUCH CLEANER IN THE BREAST.

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:17.959
THE POINT IS THAT 
NEARBY ISLANDS HAVE

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:18.999
VERY DIFFERENT-LOOKING BIRDS.

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.999
IT'S NO PROBLEM 
FOR EVEN AN AMATEUR BIRDER

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:24.999
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN SPECIES OF MOCKINGBIRDS.

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:27.999
Alda: 
IN ADDITION TO 
THE ESPAÑOLA MOCKINGBIRDS

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:30.125
TWO OTHER ISLANDS HAVE 
THEIR OWN DISTINCT SPECIES.

00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.999
THEN THERE'S A FOURTH SPECIES

00:08:33.999 --> 00:08:37.999
COMMON ACROSS MOST OF 
THE ISLANDS, INCLUDING HERE

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:40.999
ON THE NORTHEASTERNMOST 
ISLAND, GENOVESA.

00:08:40.999 --> 00:08:42.667
THEY ALL LOOK 
A LITTLE DIFFERENT

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:44.959
DEPENDING ON THE ISLAND 
THEY COME FROM?

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.417
YEAH, SO FOR EXAMPLE, 
THOSE ESPAÑOLA BIRDS

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:48.999
HAD A LOT OF SPECKLING 
ON THEIR BREASTS

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:49.999
AND THIS ONE REALLY DOESN'T.

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:51.999
THIS ONE'S GOT 
A CLEAN, WHITE BREAST.

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:53.999
LOOKS CLEANER 
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:57.999
THOSE ESPAÑOLA BIRDS LOOK 
SORT OF RATTY AND DIRTY.

00:08:57.999 --> 00:08:58.999
ARE YOU GOING 
TO LET HIM GO?

00:08:58.999 --> 00:09:00.999
YEAH... WE CAN TRY 
HYPNOTIZING HIM.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.999
OH-- CAN HE FLY 
IF HE'S HYPNOTIZED?

00:09:03.999 --> 00:09:05.999
HE'LL GO TO SLEEP.

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:07.999
Alda: 
MOCKINGBIRDS JOINED 
THE GIANT TORTOISES

00:09:07.999 --> 00:09:10.999
ON DARWIN'S LIST OF CREATURES 
THAT FOR SOME MYSTERIOUS REASON

00:09:10.999 --> 00:09:12.999
WERE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT 
ON DIFFERENT ISLANDS.

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:15.999
I WILL NOW MAKE 
THIS MOCKINGBIRD 
WAKE UP.

00:09:15.999 --> 00:09:17.999
( snaps fingers )

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:19.667
( laughs )

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:23.834
YOU DIDN'T EVEN GIVE HIM 
A POST-HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION.

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:24.834
THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:25.999
DALE, DALE!

00:09:25.999 --> 00:09:27.999
Alda: 
DURING HIS FIVE WEEKS 
IN THE GALAPAGOS

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:30.250
DARWIN VISITED ONLY FOUR 
OF THE ISLANDS...

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.999
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:35.999
Alda: 
YET HE MANAGED TO COLLECT 
HUNDREDS OF SPECIMENS

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:37.999
OF BIRDS, ANIMALS AND PLANTS.

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:43.999
THIS WAS ONE 
OF THE ISLANDS 
DARWIN LANDED AT?

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:45.959
YEAH, THIS IS FLOREANA.

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.999
THIS WAS HIS SECOND STOP, 
ACTUALLY, IN THE GALAPAGOS.

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:51.999
Alda: 
BY NOW, DARWIN WAS BECOMING 
INCREASINGLY EXCITED

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:54.999
BY THE NATURAL HISTORY 
OF THE ISLANDS.

00:09:54.999 --> 00:09:56.250
EVERYWHERE, HE WAS SEEING

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.999
WHAT HE CALLED 
"ABORIGINAL CREATIONS"--

00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:01.999
ANIMALS AND PLANTS 
FOUND NOWHERE ELSE--

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:05.999
WHAT BIOLOGISTS NOW CALL 
"ENDEMIC SPECIES."

00:10:05.999 --> 00:10:09.999
ON FLOREANA ALONE, 
HE IDENTIFIED 21 ENDEMIC PLANTS.

00:10:09.999 --> 00:10:12.999
SO, WHAT PLANTS 
HERE ARE ENDEMIC 
TO THIS ISLAND?

00:10:12.999 --> 00:10:14.959
WELL, HERE WE'VE 
GOT LECOCARPUS--

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:15.999
THIS LITTLE YELLOW DAISY--

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:20.834
AND THIS ONE HERE WITH THE HAIRY 
LEAVES, THIS IS SCALESIA VELOSA.

00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:22.959
Alda: 
AND ONCE AGAIN, DARWIN NOTICED

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:25.834
THAT DIFFERENT ISLANDS HAD 
THEIR OWN UNIQUE VERSIONS

00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:28.999
INCLUDING A SPECIES OF SCALESIA 
THAT GROWS INTO A 30-FOOT TREE.

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:33.999
BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE

00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:36.999
BESIDES THE UNIQUENESS 
OF THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS HERE.

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:41.999
THEY SEEMED TO DARWIN 
TO BEAR A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE

00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:43.999
TO THOSE HE'D JUST SEEN 
IN SOUTH AMERICA.

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:47.417
AND A TREMENDOUS IDEA 
BEGAN TO GERMINATE:

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:48.999
PERHAPS HERE IN THE GALAPAGOS

00:10:48.999 --> 00:10:52.999
HE WAS CLOSE TO NOTHING LESS 
THAN THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES.

00:10:53.999 --> 00:10:56.250
"THE NATURAL HISTORY 
OF THESE ISLANDS

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.999
"IS EMINENTLY CURIOUS 
AND WELL DESERVES ATTENTION.

00:10:59.999 --> 00:11:01.667
"MOST OF THE ORGANIC PRODUCTIONS

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:04.999
"ARE ABORIGINAL CREATIONS 
FOUND NOWHERE ELSE.

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:06.959
"THERE IS EVEN A DIFFERENCE

00:11:06.959 --> 00:11:08.999
"BETWEEN THE INHABITANTS 
OF THE DIFFERENT ISLANDS.

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:11.999
"THE ARCHIPELAGO IS 
A LITTLE WORLD WITHIN ITSELF

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:14.125
"OR RATHER A SATELLITE 
ATTACHED TO AMERICA

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:17.999
"WHENCE IT HAS DERIVED 
A FEW STRAY COLONISTS.

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:20.667
"HENCE, BOTH IN SPACE AND TIME

00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:23.999
"WE SEEM TO BE BROUGHT SOMEWHAT 
NEAR TO THAT GREAT FACT

00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:26.250
"THAT MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES--

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.999
THE FIRST APPEARANCE 
OF NEW BEINGS ON THIS EARTH."

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.999
IT WOULD BE TWO MORE YEARS-- 
 THE BEAGLE'S VOYAGE

00:11:33.999 --> 00:11:36.999
FINALLY OVER-- BEFORE 
THE "MYSTERY OF MYSTERIES"

00:11:36.999 --> 00:11:38.999
BEGAN TO RESOLVE ITSELF 
IN HIS MIND.

00:11:41.125 --> 00:11:43.999
IT HAPPENED AS HE WAS PUZZLING 
OVER ANOTHER GROUP OF CREATURES

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:47.999
THAT WHILE HE WAS HERE, HE 
HADN'T PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO--

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.999
THE LITTLE BIRDS 
NOW CALLED "DARWIN'S FINCHES."

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:03.999
AND THIS GOES DOWN, RIGHT?

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:05.417
Anderson: 
YEP.

00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:06.999
Alda: 
WE'RE SETTING UP A MIST NET

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:08.999
TO CATCH ONE 
OF THE GROUP OF BIRDS

00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.999
THAT HAS BECOME LITERALLY 
SYNONYMOUS WITH DARWIN

00:12:10.999 --> 00:12:12.000
AND HIS THEORY OF EVOLUTION.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.999
THIS NEEDS TO BE 
LOOSE LIKE THIS?

00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:15.999
YEAH, WHAT 
HAPPENS IS

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:19.125
THE BIRD FLIES IN 
AND DOESN'T SEE IT

00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:21.999
AND SO IT CARRIES THE NET 
OUT WITH IT WITH ITS MOMENTUM

00:12:21.999 --> 00:12:25.125
AND THEN SAGS DOWN, HANGING 
LIKE THIS IN A LITTLE BAG.

00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:28.999
Both: 
PSSH, PSSH, PSSH.

00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:29.999
CAN THEY HEAR THAT?

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:31.999
YOU CAN ALSO 
GO LIKE THIS--

00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:35.999
( making squeaking noise )

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:38.999
DO YOU DO THAT WHEN 
YOU'VE BEEN HERE TOO LONG?

00:12:38.999 --> 00:12:40.999
BIRDERS ACT LIKE 
THEY KNOW WHAT 
THEY'RE DOING

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:42.999
AND THEY MAKE THESE 
LITTLE SQUEAKY SOUNDS

00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:44.999
AND THEY ALL PRETEND LIKE 
IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:46.999
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER 
IT DOES OR NOT.

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.250
Both: 
PSSH, PSSH, PSSH.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.999
YOU GOT ONE, 
YOU GOT ONE!

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:55.667
IT'S A SHARP-BEAKED 
GROUND FINCH.

00:12:55.667 --> 00:12:57.999
Alda: 
OUR BIZARRE CALLS 
HAVE NETTED US A BIRD

00:12:57.999 --> 00:13:00.999
FROM ONE OF THE 13 DIFFERENT 
SPECIES OF FINCHES

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:04.999
IN THE GALAPAGOS-- BIRDS THAT 
ARE TODAY KNOWN COLLECTIVELY

00:13:04.999 --> 00:13:06.999
AS "DARWIN'S FINCHES."

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:07.999
NOW, WHAT IS 
THIS AGAIN?

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:09.999
THIS IS THE 
SHARP-BEAKED 
GROUND FINCH.

00:13:09.999 --> 00:13:12.999
THIS IS THE SMALLEST 
GROUND FINCH ON 
THIS ISLAND.

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:16.250
IT'S GOT A POINTY 
LITTLE BEAK THAT'S 
GREAT FOR GRASS SEEDS.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:21.999
Alda 
TODAY DARWIN'S FINCHES 
ARE IN ALL THE TEXTBOOKS

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:23.125
AS THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:25.999
OF HOW LIVING THINGS 
ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

00:13:27.999 --> 00:13:30.999
EACH OF THE 13 SPECIES IN THE 
GALAPAGOS HAS A DIFFERENT BEAK

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:35.999
THAT SUITS ITS LIFESTYLE-- 
FROM FEEDING OFF CACTUS FLOWERS

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:38.999
TO USING TWIGS TO DIG OUT 
INSECTS FROM THE BARK OF TREES.

00:13:41.999 --> 00:13:44.834
A GROUP OF SPECIES 
KNOWN AS GROUND FINCHES

00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:46.250
ARE THE MOST COMMON.

00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:51.999
THIS IS THE LARGE GROUND FINCH, 
WITH A THICK, HEAVY BEAK

00:13:51.999 --> 00:13:53.999
PERFECT FOR CRACKING OPEN 
LARGE TOUGH SEEDS.

00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:58.999
THE SHARP-BEAKED 
GROUND FINCH BY CONTRAST

00:13:58.999 --> 00:14:01.999
EATS MAINLY SMALL SEEDS.

00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:04.999
Anderson: 
IF YOU GAVE THIS GUY 
A GRAM OF SMALL SEEDS TO EAT

00:14:04.999 --> 00:14:07.999
IT WOULD GET DONE A LOT FASTER 
THAN WITH THIS GUY.

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:09.999
Alda: 
BECAUSE HE'S GOT TOO 
MUCH BEAK IN THE WAY?

00:14:09.999 --> 00:14:11.667
HE'S GOT TOO MUCH 
EQUIPMENT THERE, YEAH.

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:12.999
IT'S TOO BIG, IT'S TOO BULKY.

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:15.999
HE CAN HANDLE IT 
BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH.

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:18.000
YEAH, SO HE'D HAVE 
TO SPEND MORE ENERGY

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.834
ON FEEDING HIMSELF

00:14:19.834 --> 00:14:21.999
THAN HE NEEDS 
THE ENERGY TO DO IT.

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:22.999
YEAH, HIS NET INTAKE

00:14:22.999 --> 00:14:24.999
WOULD PROBABLY 
BE NEGATIVE.

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:25.999
WOW, SO HE COULD...

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.250
ALTHOUGH HE'S PROBABLY 
EATING ALL DAY LONG

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.250
HE COULD EVENTUALLY 
STARVE TO DEATH.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:31.999
YEAH, HE'S GOT EXPENSES.

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:32.999
HE'S GOT OVERHEAD 
HE'S GOT TO PAY.

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:34.999
YEAH, RIGHT, 
TOO MUCH OVERHEAD.

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.999
AND YOU LOOK 
AT THE BODY SIZES

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:39.125
AND HE'S GOT A LOT MORE 
OVERHEAD THAN THIS ONE.

00:14:41.999 --> 00:14:42.999
Alda: 
CONTRARY TO LEGEND

00:14:42.999 --> 00:14:44.999
DARWIN HIMSELF DIDN'T 
PAY MUCH ATTENTION

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:47.999
TO THE DULL LITTLE BIRDS THAT 
OFTEN HOPPED AROUND HIS FEET.

00:14:47.999 --> 00:14:50.999
HE COLLECTED SEVERAL DOZEN 
WHILE HE WAS HERE

00:14:50.999 --> 00:14:53.250
BUT HE DIDN'T EVEN 
BOTHER TO LABEL THEM

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.999
OR NOTE WHICH ISLAND 
THEY CAME FROM.

00:14:56.999 --> 00:14:59.999
BUT BY A DELICIOUS TWIST OF FATE

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:01.999
IT'S THE FINCHES ON ONE 
OF THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS--

00:15:01.999 --> 00:15:03.999
AN ISLAND DARWIN 
DIDN'T EVEN VISIT--

00:15:03.999 --> 00:15:05.999
THAT HAVE BECOME 
THE SINGLE BEST PROOF

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:08.999
THAT HIS THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS 
NO LONGER ONLY A THEORY

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:10.999
BUT AN OBSERVABLE FACT.

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:12.250
YEP, YEP.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.999
Alda: 
AS WE APPROACH THE ISLAND

00:15:14.999 --> 00:15:17.250
I CAN SEE 
WHY DARWIN NEVER LANDED HERE.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.999
YOU MEAN, ON THE FACE 
OF THAT CLIFF.

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:20.999
RIGHT THERE, YEP.

00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:23.999
IT LOOKS A LITTLE 
WORSE FROM HERE   
THAN IT REALLY IS.

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:24.999
MAYBE NOT.

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:26.999
IT'S NOT ONLY 
A CLIFF.

00:15:26.999 --> 00:15:28.999
THE CLIFF STICKS 
OUT AT THE TOP.

00:15:28.999 --> 00:15:32.999
Alda: 
THE ISLAND, CALLED DAPHNE MAJOR, 
IS ONLY A MILE OR SO ACROSS.

00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:34.999
FOR SOME QUARTER CENTURY NOW

00:15:34.999 --> 00:15:38.667
A TEAM OF BIOLOGISTS AND 
A STRING OF GRADUATE STUDENTS

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:40.959
INCLUDING BRIEFLY DAVE ANDERSON

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.999
HAVE BEEN COMING HERE 
EVERY YEAR.

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:46.999
ALL RIGHT!

00:15:46.999 --> 00:15:48.999
THIS GUY'S 
LIKE A SPIDER.

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:52.125
Alda: 
THE RESEARCHERS' SINGLE PURPOSE 
HAS BEEN TO WEIGH AND MEASURE

00:15:52.125 --> 00:15:54.999
EVERY ONE OF THE FEW HUNDRED 
GROUND FINCHES

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:56.999
THAT SHARE THIS LUMP 
OF VOLCANIC ROCK

00:15:56.999 --> 00:15:59.999
WITH LOW, RATHER SCRUBBY 
VEGETATION, SOME SEABIRDS

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:03.417
AND NOT MUCH ELSE APART FROM 
THE OCCASIONAL GRUMPY SEA LION.

00:16:03.417 --> 00:16:04.999
( barking )

00:16:04.999 --> 00:16:06.834
OKAY, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:07.999
JUST PASSING THROUGH.

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:09.999
WHY DO PEOPLE GO 
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:11.250
OF GETTING 
ON THIS THING?

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.999
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE 
TO SCIENCE OF DAPHNE MAJOR?

00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:15.999
WELL, THERE ARE 
SOME FOLKS

00:16:15.999 --> 00:16:18.999
WHO CALL DAPHNE MAJOR 
THE LABORATORY OF EVOLUTION.

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:22.125
IT'S A REALLY GREAT PLACE TO SEE 
EVOLUTION ACTUALLY HAPPENING

00:16:22.125 --> 00:16:24.999
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM, 
THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM, IS

00:16:24.999 --> 00:16:27.999
RELATIVELY SIMPLE: 
NOT TOO MANY COMPONENTS

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:28.999
AND FOR THE FINCHES

00:16:28.999 --> 00:16:31.999
IT KIND OF BOILS DOWN 
TO WHAT SEEDS ARE HERE

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:34.250
AND "WHAT TOOL DO I HAVE 
TO CRACK THOSE SEEDS?"

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.999
Alda: 
THE MAIN GROUND FINCH HERE 
IS ABOUT HALFWAY IN SIZE

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:42.834
BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIES 
DAVE AND I LOOKED AT EARLIER.

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.999
WHAT THE RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND

00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:49.250
IS THAT WHEN SMALL SEEDS 
ARE PLENTIFUL

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.999
USUALLY IN RAINY YEARS

00:16:50.999 --> 00:16:53.999
THE BEAKS OF THE BIRDS 
BORN THE FOLLOWING YEAR

00:16:53.999 --> 00:16:55.999
ARE ALSO, ON AVERAGE, SMALLER.

00:16:55.999 --> 00:16:59.999
WHEN THERE ARE PLENTY 
OF LARGE SEEDS, IN DRIER YEARS

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:03.999
THE NEXT GENERATION HAS 
BEAKS THAT ARE LARGER.

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:07.542
THIS IS EVOLUTION, 
AND ITS DRIVING FORCE

00:17:07.542 --> 00:17:11.834
DARWIN'S GREAT INSIGHT, 
IS NATURAL SELECTION.

00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:12.999
HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

00:17:12.999 --> 00:17:16.999
IN EVERY GENERATION OF FINCHES 
THERE'S A RANGE OF BEAK SIZES

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:20.999
SOME A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THE 
AVERAGE, SOME A LITTLE LARGER.

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:24.999
WHEN SMALL SEEDS ARE PLENTIFUL, 
WHEN THERE'S BEEN PLENTY OF RAIN

00:17:24.999 --> 00:17:28.999
THE SMALLER-BEAKED BIRDS ARE 
THE MORE-EFFICIENT EATERS

00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:30.999
SO THEY THRIVE 
AND PRODUCE MORE OFFSPRING

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:32.999
THAN THE LARGER-BEAKED BIRDS.

00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:35.834
THE RESULT IS 
THAT IN THE NEXT GENERATION

00:17:35.834 --> 00:17:38.000
THERE ARE MORE SMALL- 
THAN LARGE-BEAKED BIRDS.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.999
THE AVERAGE BEAK SIZE IS SMALLER 
THAN THE LAST GENERATION.

00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:44.999
THE POPULATION HAS EVOLVED.

00:17:44.999 --> 00:17:46.000
WHEN CONDITIONS CHANGE

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.125
AND A DRY YEAR BRINGS 
MORE LARGE SEEDS THAN SMALL

00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:51.542
THEN LARGE-BEAKED BIRDS 
DO BETTER.

00:17:51.542 --> 00:17:52.999
THEY LEAVE MORE OFFSPRING

00:17:52.999 --> 00:17:56.999
AND THE POPULATION SHIFTS TOWARD 
A LARGER AVERAGE BEAK SIZE.

00:17:56.999 --> 00:17:58.999
SMALLER TO LARGER, 
LARGER TO SMALLER--

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:01.959
IT'S THESE SUBTLE SHIFTS 
IN BEAK SIZE

00:18:01.959 --> 00:18:04.999
THAT THE RESEARCHERS HAVE 
SO METICULOUSLY DOCUMENTED.

00:18:04.999 --> 00:18:06.999
Anderson: 
THE REALLY SIGNIFICANT THING 
THEY FOUND IS

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:08.999
THAT OSCILLATING BACK AND FORTH

00:18:08.999 --> 00:18:11.999
THAT THE SIZE OF THE BEAK 
REALLY DOES CHANGE

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:14.999
OVER SHORT PERIODS OF TIME, 
AND THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHY.

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:18.959
IT'S BECAUSE THEIR 
FOOD SUPPLY CHANGES.

00:18:18.959 --> 00:18:21.999
AND THAT'S A CASE OF ACTUALLY 
SEEING EVOLUTION IN PROGRESS

00:18:21.999 --> 00:18:23.999
TO SEE IT AS IT HAPPENS?

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:25.999
YEAH, YEAH, THE REALLY 
COOL THING ABOUT THIS

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:27.999
FOR EVERYBODY, 
SCIENTISTS AND EVERYBODY ELSE

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:29.417
IS THAT THERE'S NO QUESTION

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:31.999
THAT IT IS EVOLUTION HAPPENING 
IN FRONT OF OUR EYES.

00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:33.999
WE DON'T HAVE TO THINK 
OF EVOLUTION

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:36.999
AS BEING SOMETHING THAT YOU 
ONLY GET FROM THE FOSSIL RECORD

00:18:36.999 --> 00:18:38.999
OR THEORIZING ABOUT IT.

00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:41.999
YOU CAN GO TO A PLACE LIKE 
DAPHNE MAJOR, WHERE IT'S SIMPLE

00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:44.999
AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE 
EVOLUTION HAPPENING

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:47.999
ALMOST ON A MONTHLY BASIS, 
BUT CERTAINLY AN ANNUAL BASIS.

00:18:47.999 --> 00:18:49.999
I'VE OFTEN HEARD PEOPLE SAY--

00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:51.999
PEOPLE SYMPATHETIC 
TO THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION--

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.999
THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE 
A LITTLE BIT OF IT ON FAITH.

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:57.999
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE 
ANY OF IT ON FAITH?

00:18:57.999 --> 00:18:58.999
NOT ANYMORE.

00:18:58.999 --> 00:19:00.999
NOT ANYMORE, 
NOT AFTER THIS STUDY.

00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:02.999
PEOPLE VISIT HERE, 
NOT JUST SCIENTISTS.

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:05.250
THEY NEED A TRAIL 
THAT'S ESTABLISHED.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.250
Alda: 
IT'S WONDERFULLY APPROPRIATE

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.999
THAT EVOLUTION SHOULD MOVE 
FROM THEORY TO FACT

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:11.999
IN A STUDY OF DARWIN'S FINCHES

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:13.999
BECAUSE IT WAS 
WHILE DARWIN HIMSELF

00:19:13.999 --> 00:19:16.999
WAS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF 
HIS HAPHAZARD FINCH COLLECTION

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:18.999
THAT THE IDEA OF EVOLUTION 
FIRST OCCURRED TO HIM.

00:19:18.999 --> 00:19:20.999
WITH IT, HE COULD EXPLAIN

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:23.999
NOT ONLY WHY DIFFERENT ISLANDS 
HAVE DIFFERENT FINCHES

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:26.999
BUT ALSO DIFFERENT 
MOCKINGBIRDS...

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:28.999
DIFFERENT PLANTS...

00:19:28.999 --> 00:19:31.999
DIFFERENT TORTOISES.

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:34.999
FROM THE TIME THEIR ANCESTORS 
ARRIVED IN THE ARCHIPELAGO

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:36.999
THE ANIMALS ON DIFFERENT ISLANDS

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:38.999
HAVE GONE 
THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT WAYS

00:19:38.999 --> 00:19:41.999
SHAPED BY THE CONDITIONS 
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN

00:19:41.999 --> 00:19:45.000
UNTIL EVENTUALLY 
THEY BECAME DIFFERENT SPECIES.

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:50.999
AS FOR HOW 
THEIR ANCESTORS GOT HERE

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:52.999
WELL, WE'RE COMING TO THAT.

00:20:07.834 --> 00:20:09.999
GETTING HERE WAS NO PROBLEM

00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:12.999
FOR THE ANCESTORS 
OF THE GALAPAGOS SEA LION.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.999
LYNN FOWLER HAS PROMISED ME

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:19.834
AN UNDERWATER RENDEZVOUS 
WITH A SEA LION PUP

00:20:19.834 --> 00:20:22.999
AND THIS BEING THE GALAPAGOS, 
THERE'S AN EAGER VOLUNTEER.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.999
THE GALAPAGOS SEA LION, 
LIKE MOST OF THE CREATURES HERE

00:20:29.999 --> 00:20:31.999
HAS CHANGED SINCE IT ARRIVED

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:35.999
EVOLVING INTO A SMALLER VERSION 
OF ITS CALIFORNIA COUSIN.

00:20:41.999 --> 00:20:42.999
Alda: 
I SAW HIS FACE

00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:45.999
AND IT WAS LIKE "SO WHAT 
ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:47.542
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?"

00:20:47.542 --> 00:20:48.999
Alda: 
SEA LIONS CAN SWIM.

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:52.999
BUT HOW DID LAND ANIMALS GET WAY 
OUT HERE IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN?

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:54.999
THE EXPLANATION I'VE HEARD WAS

00:20:54.999 --> 00:20:57.999
THAT THEY CAME ON FLOATING RAFTS 
OF VEGETATION.

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:00.999
BUT IGUANAS AND TORTOISES 
ARE HEFTY CREATURES.

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:02.250
SO THEY HAD 
TO HAVE HAD

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.999
A PRETTY HEFTY RAFT 
TO GET OVER HERE.

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:06.999
YEAH, WELL, THERE ARE 
BIG CHUNKS OF LAND

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.999
THAT COME DOWN SOME 
OF THOSE RIVERS

00:21:08.999 --> 00:21:10.999
ON THE SOUTH 
AMERICAN CONTINENT.

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:12.999
AND THEY FLOAT WAY 
OUT HERE, 600 MILES.

00:21:12.999 --> 00:21:14.999
AN ACTUAL CHUNK 
OF LAND?

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:15.999
I THOUGHT 
IT WAS JUST

00:21:15.999 --> 00:21:17.999
LIKE, YOU KNOW, 
TWIGS OR BRANCHES.

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:21.999
THERE ARE CHUNKS OF LAND 
THAT EVEN HAVE STANDING TREES

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:24.999
THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN FLOATING 
WAY OUT TO SEA IN THE OCEAN.

00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:27.999
AND THOSE COULD EASILY BRING 
SEVERAL SPECIES AT ONCE

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:29.999
TO A SYSTEM LIKE THIS.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:33.250
Alda: 
OF ALL THE IMMIGRANTS HERE

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.999
FEW HAVE ADAPTED 
SO SUCCESSFULLY TO ISLAND LIFE

00:21:35.999 --> 00:21:37.999
AS THE MARINE IGUANAS.

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:39.999
WHEREVER YOU GO 
ALONG THE SHORELINE

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:43.999
IGUANAS WILL BE ON DISPLAY, 
SOMETIMES LITERALLY.

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:45.999
HE'S GREEN ON 
THE TOP AND RED 
ALONG HIS BODY.

00:21:45.999 --> 00:21:46.999
WHAT DOES THAT...

00:21:46.999 --> 00:21:48.999
YEAH, THAT'S 
A BREEDING MALE.

00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:50.417
IT'S THE COLORATION 
THEY GET...

00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:52.417
THAT'S A SIGNAL 
HE'S READY TO BREED?

00:21:52.417 --> 00:21:53.999
THAT HE'S READY.

00:21:53.999 --> 00:21:55.125
THEN HE'LL SET UP 
A TERRITORY

00:21:55.125 --> 00:21:57.999
AND TRY TO ATTRACT 
SOME FEMALES TO IT.

00:21:57.999 --> 00:21:58.999
BUT THAT'S A BIG 
BREEDING MALE.

00:21:58.999 --> 00:21:59.999
BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT?

00:21:59.999 --> 00:22:01.999
WHAT DOES HE DO 
TO ATTRACT FEMALES?

00:22:01.999 --> 00:22:02.999
JUST DISPLAY HIS...

00:22:02.999 --> 00:22:04.667
YOU SEE THAT 
HEAD BOBBING.

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:05.999
THAT'S KIND OF COOL.

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:06.999
YEAH, RIGHT:

00:22:06.999 --> 00:22:08.999
"LOOK, BABE, I CAN 
DO 20 PUSH-UPS."

00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:09.999
( laughs ): 
YEAH, RIGHT.

00:22:09.999 --> 00:22:10.999
"I'M THE MAN FOR YOU."

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:12.999
HE'S A BEAUTY, 
THOUGH, ISN'T HE?

00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:13.999
YEAH, HE IS.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.959
DOESN'T THAT LOOK 
LIKE GODZILLA?

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:16.999
YEAH.

00:22:16.999 --> 00:22:19.999
Alda: 
CHARLES DARWIN, 
HAD HE EVER HEARD OF GODZILLA

00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:20.999
MIGHT HAVE AGREED:

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:23.999
"IT IS A HIDEOUS-LOOKING 
CREATURE, STUPID

00:22:23.999 --> 00:22:25.999
"AND SLUGGISH 
IN ITS MOVEMENTS.

00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:27.667
"WHEN IN THE WATER, 
THIS LIZARD SWIMS

00:22:27.667 --> 00:22:28.999
"WITH PERFECT EASE AND QUICKNESS

00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:31.999
"BY A SERPENTINE MOVEMENT 
OF ITS BODY AND FLATTENED TAIL

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:34.999
"THE LEGS BEING MOTIONLESS 
AND COLLAPSED AT ITS SIDES.

00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:36.999
"I OPENED THE STOMACHS 
OF SEVERAL

00:22:36.999 --> 00:22:40.667
AND FOUND THEM LARGELY DISTENDED 
WITH MINCED SEAWEED."

00:22:41.999 --> 00:22:44.542
DARWIN PUT HIS FINGER 
ON JUST THOSE ADAPTATIONS

00:22:44.542 --> 00:22:46.999
THAT HAVE MADE THE MARINE IGUANA 
FIT SO PERFECTLY

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:47.999
INTO ITS ISLAND HOME.

00:22:47.999 --> 00:22:49.999
ALL HE WANTS 
IS GREENS, HUH?

00:22:49.999 --> 00:22:50.999
YEAH, UH-HUH.

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:51.999
I MEAN, VEGETABLES.

00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:54.000
ALL THAT SEA 
LETTUCE, OVA

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.999
IS THEIR 
FAVORITE FOOD.

00:22:55.999 --> 00:22:57.999
Alda: 
THE ANCESTORS OF THESE CREATURES

00:22:57.999 --> 00:23:00.417
WERE LIKE ALL THE OTHER LIZARDS 
IN THE WORLD

00:23:00.417 --> 00:23:01.999
SWIMMING ONLY WHEN THEY HAD TO.

00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:04.999
HE MADE IT 
UP THE CLIFF.

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:08.417
Alda: 
BUT THE GALAPAGOS MARINE 
IGUANAS, AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES

00:23:08.417 --> 00:23:10.999
HAVE TURNED TO THE SEA 
TO SUSTAIN THEM

00:23:10.999 --> 00:23:12.999
EATING AS VIRTUALLY 
THEIR ONLY FOOD

00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:13.999
THE BRIGHT GREEN ALGAE

00:23:13.999 --> 00:23:17.542
THAT GROWS ALL ALONG 
AND BENEATH THE SHORELINE.

00:23:17.542 --> 00:23:19.834
NOT ONLY HAVE THEY BECOME 
EXPERT SWIMMERS

00:23:19.834 --> 00:23:22.999
THEY'VE ALSO DEVELOPED 
THE ABILITY TO DIGEST THE ALGAE

00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:26.417
WITH THE HELP OF A BACTERIUM 
THAT LIVES IN THEIR HIND GUT.

00:23:29.959 --> 00:23:32.959
THIS SPECIALIZATION HAS MADE 
THE MARINE IGUANAS

00:23:32.959 --> 00:23:33.999
THE LORDS OF THE SEASHORE

00:23:33.999 --> 00:23:38.417
BUT IT HAS ALSO LEFT THEM 
EXTREMELY VULNERABLE.

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:42.999
MARTIN WIKELSKI HAS WITNESSED 
THEIR VULNERABILITY FIRSTHAND.

00:23:42.999 --> 00:23:45.417
WHAT WAS THIS LIKE 
DURING THAT LAST 
GREAT EL NIÑO?

00:23:45.417 --> 00:23:48.999
WELL, IT WAS HORRIBLE.

00:23:48.999 --> 00:23:50.999
THOSE GUYS ARE 
ABOUT TEN PERCENT

00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:52.959
OF ALL THE ANIMALS 
THAT WERE HERE.

00:23:52.959 --> 00:23:53.999
THERE WERE 
TEN TIMES AS MANY?

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:54.999
TEN TIMES AS MANY.

00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:57.542
AND THEY WERE 
GOING TO FORAGE.

00:23:57.542 --> 00:24:00.999
THEY WERE TRYING TO GET 
THE LAST BITS OF ALGAE

00:24:00.999 --> 00:24:02.999
AND THEN SLOWLY 
WALKING UP THE BEACH.

00:24:02.999 --> 00:24:04.999
AND SOMETIMES THEY DIDN'T 
MAKE IT UP THE BEACH

00:24:04.999 --> 00:24:06.999
SO THEY WOULD JUST SORT 
OF PUT ONE FOOT FORWARD

00:24:06.999 --> 00:24:08.667
AND STILL TRY TO GO UP

00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:11.999
BUT THEN REALLY BAKE 
IN THE SAND, LITERALLY.

00:24:11.999 --> 00:24:13.999
AND THEY JUST ALL DIED 
IN FRONT OF OUR EYES.

00:24:13.999 --> 00:24:17.999
SO WE HAD, I THINK, LIKE 400 
DEAD ANIMALS DURING A FEW WEEKS.

00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:19.250
THAT'S PRETTY AMAZING.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.999
NOW, WAS THAT BECAUSE ALL THIS 
GREEN WE SEE HERE WAS NOT HERE?

00:24:22.999 --> 00:24:24.999
YEAH, ALL THIS GREEN YOU 
SEE WAS TOTALLY BLACK.

00:24:24.999 --> 00:24:27.999
THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING 
GROWING ON THESE ROCKS.

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:32.417
Alda: 
THE CAUSE OF THE DEVASTATION 
WAS THE 1997-'98 EL NIÑO

00:24:32.417 --> 00:24:34.999
A PLUME OF UNUSUALLY WARM WATER

00:24:34.999 --> 00:24:37.999
THAT WREAKED HAVOC WITH WEATHER 
PATTERNS ALL OVER THE GLOBE.

00:24:37.999 --> 00:24:40.999
ITS IMPACT ON THE GALAPAGOS 
WAS MORE DIRECT

00:24:40.999 --> 00:24:42.999
BATHING THE ISLANDS 
IN WARM WATER

00:24:42.999 --> 00:24:45.999
AND DRIVING OUT THE COLD 
NUTRIENT-RICH CURRENTS

00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:48.999
THAT NORMALLY SUSTAIN 
THE MARINE LIFE HERE.

00:24:48.999 --> 00:24:53.999
EVERYTHING ON AND 
AROUND THE ISLANDS THAT 
LIVES OFF THE SEA SUFFERED

00:24:53.999 --> 00:24:55.999
BUT THE MARINE IGUANAS

00:24:55.999 --> 00:24:58.667
WHOSE SOLE SOURCE OF FOOD 
WITHERED AWAY

00:24:58.667 --> 00:24:59.999
SUFFERED THE MOST.

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:02.999
BUT IT TURNS OUT 
THAT EVEN DURING GOOD YEARS

00:25:02.999 --> 00:25:06.000
THE MARINE IGUANAS HERE 
ON THE ISLAND OF GENOVESA

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.542
HAVE TO STRUGGLE 
TO MAKE A LIVING.

00:25:08.542 --> 00:25:09.999
Alda: 
WHY DO WE SEE

00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:10.999
SO MANY SMALLISH 
IGUANAS HERE?

00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:11.999
RIGHT.

00:25:11.999 --> 00:25:14.000
THIS ISLAND GETS 
LEAST OF THE NUTRIENTS.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.999
AND THAT MEANS 
THAT THIS ALGAE...

00:25:15.999 --> 00:25:18.542
YOU PROBABLY SAW IGUANAS 
FORAGING ALREADY.

00:25:18.542 --> 00:25:19.999
YES.

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:22.000
THEY SOMETIMES HAVE 
THESE HUGE ALGAE PASTURES

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.999
AND THEY JUST GET 
A MOUTHFUL OF ALGAE EVERY BITE.

00:25:24.999 --> 00:25:27.999
BUT HERE THEY ONLY HAVE 
A TINY LITTLE CARPET OF ALGAE

00:25:27.999 --> 00:25:29.999
AND THEY CONSTANTLY 
HAVE TO SCRAPE IT OFF.

00:25:29.999 --> 00:25:31.667
SO THAT HAS SELECTED 
OUT THE BIG ONES.

00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:32.959
RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.

00:25:32.959 --> 00:25:34.417
THE BIG ONES 
THAT MIGHT BE BORN HERE

00:25:34.417 --> 00:25:36.999
JUST AREN'T GOING TO GET 
ENOUGH NUTRIENTS.

00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:37.999
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:38.999
THAT'S INTERESTING.

00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:39.999
SO THERE THEY ARE.

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:40.999
THAT'S THE PRODUCT

00:25:40.999 --> 00:25:42.834
OF NATURAL SELECTION 
RIGHT THERE.

00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:44.999
Alda: 
BUT EVEN AMONG THESE 
SMALLER-THAN-AVERAGE ANIMALS

00:25:44.999 --> 00:25:46.999
SOME OF THE MALES ARE 
CLEARLY LARGER.

00:25:46.999 --> 00:25:50.999
THIS BIG GUY 
HAS WALKED THROUGH 
THE ENTIRE COLLECTION

00:25:50.999 --> 00:25:52.999
DOING THAT 
NODDING THING

00:25:52.999 --> 00:25:55.999
WHICH IS TO ANNOUNCE 
HIS TERRITORY, RIGHT?

00:25:55.999 --> 00:25:56.999
RIGHT.

00:25:56.999 --> 00:25:59.667
BUT IS HE THE ONLY ONE 
IN THIS WHOLE BATCH

00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:00.999
THAT'S DOMINANT 
LIKE THAT?

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:01.999
HE'S THE HOT SHOT.

00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:03.834
HE'S DEFINITELY 
THE PRIZE MALE

00:26:03.834 --> 00:26:05.999
BECAUSE YOU SEE 
ALL THESE FEMALES 
AROUND HERE?

00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:07.999
THEY ALL LIKE 
TO HANG OUT WITH HIM.

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:10.667
SO THE FEMALES ARE 
THE ONES THAT CHOOSE 
IN THIS SYSTEM

00:26:10.667 --> 00:26:12.834
AND THE MALES JUST 
TRY TO DO THEIR BEST.

00:26:12.834 --> 00:26:15.999
THE FEMALES ARE ATTRACTED 
TO THIS BIG HANDSOME GUY--

00:26:15.999 --> 00:26:17.999
THIS UGLY THING HERE.

00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:18.999
WAIT, HE'S NOT UGLY.

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:20.999
I KNOW YOU COME 
HERE EVERY DAY

00:26:20.999 --> 00:26:23.999
AND YOU KIND OF LIKE 
THE WAY THEY LOOK NOW

00:26:23.999 --> 00:26:26.959
BUT I'M TELLING YOU, 
I JUST GOT HERE...

00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:27.999
YOU SHOULD BE 
HERE 30 DAYS

00:26:27.999 --> 00:26:28.999
AND YOU'LL LIKE THEM.

00:26:28.999 --> 00:26:29.999
YEAH, RIGHT, 
OKAY, OKAY.

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:32.834
Alda: 
YES, MARTIN ACTUALLY DOES SPEND

00:26:32.834 --> 00:26:36.542
THE ENTIRE 30 DAYS THE IGUANAS 
HERE ARE DECIDING ON MATES

00:26:36.542 --> 00:26:39.959
WATCHING TO SEE 
WHICH MALES THE FEMALES PICK.

00:26:39.959 --> 00:26:42.999
IT'S AN IMPORTANT DECISION.

00:26:42.999 --> 00:26:44.999
EACH OF THOSE FEMALES 
ONLY HAS ONE EGG.

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:45.999
OH, REALLY?

00:26:45.999 --> 00:26:47.417
IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:49.999
THEY HAVE ABOUT 25% 
OF THEIR BODY MASS 
IN ONE EGG.

00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:51.667
SO IT REALLY COUNTS 
WHO THEY CHOOSE.

00:26:51.667 --> 00:26:52.999
ABSOLUTELY.

00:26:52.999 --> 00:26:55.250
Alda: 
MARTIN IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.999
WHY-- IF THE BIG GUYS 
ARE SO POPULAR--

00:26:57.999 --> 00:27:01.999
THE GROUP HERE ALSO CONTAINS 
A NUMBER OF MUCH SMALLER MALES

00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:05.999
WHO, INSTEAD OF SHOWING OFF, 
KEEP A DELIBERATELY LOW PROFILE.

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:06.999
SEE THAT GUY?

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:09.125
HE WAS SORT OF SNEAKING 
UP ON THE FEMALE

00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:10.999
TRYING TO GET HER.

00:27:10.999 --> 00:27:12.999
THAT'S ONE OF THE SMALL 
SNEAKER MALES

00:27:12.999 --> 00:27:14.999
THAT HANG OUT 
IN THE TERRITORIES

00:27:14.999 --> 00:27:17.999
AND THEY TRY TO SORT OF 
SNEAK UP ON THE FEMALES.

00:27:17.999 --> 00:27:19.667
THEY'RE ABOUT 
THE FEMALES' SIZE

00:27:19.667 --> 00:27:21.999
SO THE MALE CAN'T TELL 
THEM FROM FEMALES.

00:27:21.999 --> 00:27:24.250
SO THEY JUST TRY 
TO SNEAK UP ON FEMALES

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.999
AND TRY TO MATE WITH 
THEM, IF THEY CAN.

00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:28.999
SO IN A WAY 
HE GETS AN ADVANTAGE.

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:31.417
HE HAS A CHANCE 
TO SNEAK UP

00:27:31.417 --> 00:27:33.999
BECAUSE HE'S 
A FEMALE IMPERSONATOR

00:27:33.999 --> 00:27:35.999
RIGHT UP UNTIL 
THE LAST MOMENT.

00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:37.999
YEP, YEP.

00:27:37.999 --> 00:27:41.999
Alda: 
THERE MUST BE SOME REASON 
THE FEMALES ACCEPT THE SNEAKERS

00:27:41.999 --> 00:27:45.417
OR NATURAL SELECTION WOULD HAVE 
LONG SINCE HAVE ELIMINATED THEM.

00:27:45.417 --> 00:27:48.999
MARTIN'S HYPOTHESIS IS THAT 
KEEPING SMALLNESS GENES AROUND

00:27:48.999 --> 00:27:52.999
PROVIDES THE FEMALES 
WITH A SORT OF INSURANCE POLICY

00:27:52.999 --> 00:27:54.999
AGAINST THOSE 
BRUTAL EL NIÑO YEARS

00:27:54.999 --> 00:27:56.999
WHEN BEING BIG CAN BE FATAL.

00:27:56.999 --> 00:27:57.999
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE

00:27:57.999 --> 00:27:59.999
SORT OF A LONG-TERM STRATEGY

00:27:59.999 --> 00:28:02.999
THAT THEY CAN'T REALLY KNOW 
WHEN THE NEXT EL NIÑO HITS

00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:05.999
SO SOMETIMES THEY MIGHT 
JUST CHOOSE A SMALL GUY

00:28:05.999 --> 00:28:08.999
AS A MATING PARTNER 
TO HAVE SOME SMALLER OFFSPRING

00:28:08.999 --> 00:28:11.999
AND AT SOME OTHER TIMES 
THEY MIGHT CHOOSE A BIGGER ONE.

00:28:11.999 --> 00:28:12.999
ONE YEAR 
YOU TRY IT BIG

00:28:12.999 --> 00:28:14.417
NEXT YEAR 
YOU TRY IT SMALL

00:28:14.417 --> 00:28:16.999
AND YOU PROTECT YOURSELF 
ALL THE WAY AROUND.

00:28:16.999 --> 00:28:17.999
HE'S NOT GOING 
TO MIND THIS

00:28:17.999 --> 00:28:18.999
COMING IN HIS FACE?

00:28:18.999 --> 00:28:20.000
WELL...

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.999
DO IT SLOWLY AND...

00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:24.999
Alda: 
IN THE COURSE OF TESTING 
HIS INSURANCE IDEA

00:28:24.999 --> 00:28:28.999
MARTIN HAS CAUGHT THOUSANDS OF 
MARINE IGUANAS HERE ON GENOVESA.

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:30.999
THE LEAST I CAN DO 
IS LEND A HAND WITH ONE.

00:28:32.999 --> 00:28:34.999
( Wikelski chuckles )

00:28:34.999 --> 00:28:36.999
NOW HE PROBABLY 
IS ON TO THIS.

00:28:36.999 --> 00:28:38.999
HE'S NOT GOING 
TO LIKE THIS AT ALL.

00:28:40.999 --> 00:28:41.999
WOW, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:46.999
EXCELLENT.

00:28:47.999 --> 00:28:49.999
I HAVE GOOD BEGINNER'S LUCK.

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:51.000
( chuckling )

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.999
Alda: 
THIS IGUANA WAS FIRST 
CAUGHT AND MARKED BY MARTIN

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:55.999
WHEN IT WAS A HATCHLING.

00:28:55.999 --> 00:28:59.999
12 YEARS LATER, IT'S ONE 
OF THE KINGS AROUND HERE.

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:02.667
BUT IF ANOTHER EL NIÑO COMES 
AND THIS GUY'S TOO BIG

00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:05.999
THEN WE BASICALLY FIND 
HIS BODY ON THE BEACH SOMEDAY.

00:29:05.999 --> 00:29:06.999
THAT'S THE FIRST ONE 
FOR THE SEASON.

00:29:06.999 --> 00:29:08.999
JUST GIVE HIM AN "A."

00:29:08.999 --> 00:29:11.999
Alda: 
THE PAINT WILL MAKE IT EASIER 
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

00:29:11.999 --> 00:29:14.999
IS IT POSSIBLE 
THAT THIS WILL 
TURN OUT TO BE

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:15.999
SOME CUE TO THE FEMALES

00:29:15.999 --> 00:29:17.999
THAT THIS GUY SHOULD 
BE AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS?

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:18.999
THAT'S 
A GOOD POINT.

00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:20.000
DO THEY TAKE 
ANY VISUAL CUES?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.667
MANY PEOPLE AT 
CONFERENCES ASK ME.

00:29:22.667 --> 00:29:23.999
OH, YEAH?

00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:26.834
WE DID TEST IT 
BECAUSE IN ANOLES, 
IN OTHER LIZARDS

00:29:26.834 --> 00:29:27.999
IT WOULD MAKE 
A BIG DIFFERENCE

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:29.999
BUT IN THOSE GUYS 
IT DOESN'T.

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:31.999
SO THE FEMALES DON'T 
GO FOR COLORATION.

00:29:31.999 --> 00:29:34.999
THEY DON'T CARE 
ABOUT THE MARKINGS 
WE PUT ON THEM

00:29:34.999 --> 00:29:37.250
AND THEY PROBABLY 
ONLY GO FOR THE SIZE

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.999
AND FOR THE BEHAVIOR.

00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:39.999
YEAH, BUT THIS GUY

00:29:39.999 --> 00:29:41.999
IS NOW CLEARLY 
A MOVIE STAR.

00:29:41.999 --> 00:29:43.999
I MEAN, 
THEY'RE GOING TO...

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:45.999
AREN'T THEY GOING 
TO NOTICE THAT?

00:29:45.999 --> 00:29:47.667
THAT IS TRUE.

00:29:47.667 --> 00:29:49.667
SO THAT'S IT 
FOR THIS GUY.

00:29:49.667 --> 00:29:50.999
WE CAN LET HIM GO.

00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:52.999
OKAY.

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:55.999
Alda: 
MARTIN WIKELSKI ISN'T 
THE FIRST SCIENTIST

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:59.000
TO CATCH AND RELEASE MARINE 
IGUANAS HERE IN THE GALAPAGOS:

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.667
"I THREW ONE SEVERAL TIMES 
AS FAR AS I COULD

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:05.999
"INTO A DEEP POOL LEFT 
BY THE RETIRING TIDE;

00:30:05.999 --> 00:30:07.999
"BUT IT INVARIABLY RETURNED 
IN A DIRECT LINE

00:30:07.999 --> 00:30:09.999
"TO THE SPOT WHERE I STOOD.

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:12.125
"PERHAPS THIS SINGULAR PIECE 
OF APPARENT STUPIDITY

00:30:12.125 --> 00:30:14.667
"MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR 
BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:16.999
"THAT THIS REPTILE HAS 
NO ENEMY WHATEVER ON THE SHORE

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:20.250
"WHEREAS AT SEA 
IT MUST OFTEN FALL A PREY

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.999
"TO THE NUMEROUS SHARKS.

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:25.999
"HENCE, PROBABLY, URGED BY 
A FIXED AND HEREDITARY INSTINCT

00:30:25.999 --> 00:30:28.125
"THAT THE SHORE IS 
ITS PLACE OF SAFETY

00:30:28.125 --> 00:30:31.999
WHATEVER THE EMERGENCY MAY BE, 
IT THERE TAKES REFUGE."

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:35.999
Alda: 
LATE ONE AFTERNOON

00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:37.999
LYNN AND I FOUND OURSELVES 
STEPPING CAREFULLY

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:40.417
TO AVOID MARINE IGUANAS 
LOUNGING BEFORE BEDTIME

00:30:40.417 --> 00:30:43.999
ALL OVER THE WATERFRONT 
OF THE ISLAND OF FERNANDINA.

00:30:43.999 --> 00:30:45.999
OOPS, ALMOST STEPPED 
ON ITS TAIL.

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:48.999
Alda: 
I REMEMBER MY SURPRISED 
AND DELIGHTED REACTION

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:52.417
TO THE FIRST MARINE IGUANA 
I SAW ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO.

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:55.999
BUT ALREADY THEY'VE BECOME 
SIMPLY PART OF THE PLACE.

00:30:57.999 --> 00:31:00.999
BUT JUST WATCH THEM FOR A WHILE.

00:31:01.999 --> 00:31:03.999
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY 
THEY TELL.

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:08.542
FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, 
PERHAPS MILLIONS OF YEARS

00:31:08.542 --> 00:31:10.999
THEY'VE LIVED AND DIED HERE

00:31:10.999 --> 00:31:13.000
SLOWLY SCULPTED 
BY THAT LIVING AND DYING

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.999
FROM THE LAND CREATURES 
THEY ONCE WERE

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:18.999
INTO THE IMPERIOUS MASTERS 
OF THEIR NEW MARINE ENVIRONMENT.

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:25.999
IT'S A STORY THAT, 
FOR ONE GIDDY MOMENT

00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:28.999
IT SEEMS TO ME 
THEY DESERVE TO HEAR.

00:31:28.999 --> 00:31:29.999
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

00:31:29.999 --> 00:31:32.667
THERE'S THIS GUY CHARLES DARWIN 
WHO SAYS IT'S SO.

00:31:32.667 --> 00:31:33.999
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:37.542
YOU ALL DESCENDED FROM 
SOME LIZARD A LONG TIME AGO.

00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:39.999
WHO... COULD I SEE 
A SHOW OF CLAWS?

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:40.999
WHO BELIEVES THAT?

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.959
Alda: 
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN 
FROM MY FIRST ENCOUNTER

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:01.999
WITH A BIRD CALLED 
THE MASKED BOOBY

00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:03.999
THAT THIS IS A CREATURE 
WITH A STRANGE SENSE

00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:04.999
OF RIGHT AND WRONG.

00:32:04.999 --> 00:32:06.417
WHOOP.

00:32:07.999 --> 00:32:08.999
HOLD TIGHT... 
OKAY, OKAY!

00:32:08.999 --> 00:32:09.999
( chuckling )

00:32:09.999 --> 00:32:10.999
WE GOT 
A LITTLE CLOSE

00:32:10.999 --> 00:32:12.999
TO THE GUANO 
RING THERE.

00:32:12.999 --> 00:32:14.999
Alda: 
MY SECOND ENCOUNTER CAME

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:16.999
IN THE COMPANY 
OF DAVE ANDERSON.

00:32:16.999 --> 00:32:17.999
( squawks )

00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:19.542
ALL RIGHT, ALAN.

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:21.999
HERE WE'VE GOT 
A NESTLING MASKED BOOBY

00:32:21.999 --> 00:32:23.959
WITH ITS PARENT

00:32:23.959 --> 00:32:24.999
WHO HAS CONVENIENTLY 
STEPPED ASIDE

00:32:24.999 --> 00:32:27.999
SO THAT WE CAN PUT 
A BAND ON ITS CHICK.

00:32:27.999 --> 00:32:30.999
Alda: 
DAVE HAS BEEN STUDYING MASKED 
BOOBIES FOR HALF HIS LIFE

00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:33.999
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 
A SINGULARLY GRUESOME FACT...

00:32:33.999 --> 00:32:35.999
GENTLY GRAB 
THE BIRD.

00:32:35.999 --> 00:32:39.250
Alda: 
THAT THIS YOUNG BOOBY, ALL 
FLUFFY AND APPARENTLY INNOCENT

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.999
MAY WELL HAVE 
COMMITTED MURDER.

00:32:40.999 --> 00:32:46.999
THIS IS MAYBE 
A 35-, 40-DAY-OLD 
MASKED BOOBY CHICK

00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:48.999
AND IT CAN GIVE 
YOU A GOOD NIP.

00:32:48.999 --> 00:32:50.999
SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE 
TO HOLD THIS BIRD...

00:32:50.999 --> 00:32:51.999
IT COULD GIVE YOU 
A GOOD NIP

00:32:51.999 --> 00:32:53.250
SO IF I WOULD 
LIKE TO HOLD IT?

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.999
IS THAT, LIKE, 
AN ACTUAL SENTENCE?

00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:55.999
YEAH, NOW, 
DON'T SQUEEZE IT.

00:32:55.999 --> 00:32:58.999
JUST GET UP 
AROUND THE HEAD SO...

00:32:58.999 --> 00:33:01.999
Alda: 
NOT ONLY IS THIS BABY BOOBY 
A NATURAL-BORN KILLER;

00:33:01.999 --> 00:33:04.999
THE CREATURE IT MAY HAVE KILLED 
WAS ITS OWN SIBLING.

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:06.999
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE 
THIS BIRD A NAME.

00:33:06.999 --> 00:33:08.999
PROBABLY ALREADY 
HAS A NAME

00:33:08.999 --> 00:33:12.250
BUT THIS IS WHAT I'M 
GOING TO CALL IT: 95289.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.542
Alda: 
DAVE ANDERSON WANTS TO KNOW 
WHY THE MURDER OCCURRED.

00:33:15.542 --> 00:33:16.999
EVEN MORE, HE WANTS TO KNOW

00:33:16.999 --> 00:33:19.125
WHY THE PARENTS DID 
NOTHING TO STOP IT.

00:33:19.125 --> 00:33:22.999
AND WE'LL PUT THIS 
LITTLE CHICK BACK IN HIS HOME.

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:23.999
LITTLE CHICK NEEDS TO CALM DOWN.

00:33:23.999 --> 00:33:25.999
THERE.

00:33:27.999 --> 00:33:29.999
Alda: 
TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

00:33:29.999 --> 00:33:31.999
ANDERSON HAS BEEN COMING HERE 
TO THE ISLAND OF ESPAÑOLA

00:33:31.999 --> 00:33:34.999
FOR 20 YEARS.

00:33:34.999 --> 00:33:37.125
MASKED BOOBIES BREED IN COLONIES

00:33:37.125 --> 00:33:39.999
AND THINGS START OFF 
ROMANTICALLY ENOUGH.

00:33:39.999 --> 00:33:41.999
SOME OF THESE BIRDS 
DON'T HAVE A MATE.

00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:43.999
AND SO WHEN THEY'RE 
TRYING TO FIND ONE

00:33:43.999 --> 00:33:45.999
THEY CHECK OUT 
DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES

00:33:45.999 --> 00:33:46.999
AND THEY GET TOGETHER

00:33:46.999 --> 00:33:48.999
AND THEY MAYBE HAVE 
A DATE FOR AN AFTERNOON

00:33:48.999 --> 00:33:50.999
WHERE THEY GIVE EACH 
OTHER LITTLE GIFTS--

00:33:50.999 --> 00:33:53.959
TWIGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT-- 
AND IF THEY'RE NOT COMPATIBLE

00:33:53.959 --> 00:33:54.999
THEY'LL KNOW PRETTY QUICKLY

00:33:54.999 --> 00:33:57.542
AND IF THEY ARE COMPATIBLE, 
MAYBE THEY'LL CONTINUE.

00:33:57.542 --> 00:34:00.999
IT'S A LOT LIKE A SPECIES 
WE KNOW PRETTY WELL.

00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:04.999
MOST BIRDS IN OTHER SPECIES MAKE 
A NEST AND MASKED BOOBIES DON'T.

00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:08.999
BUT THE BUILDING OF A NEST 
AND ACCUMULATION OF MATERIAL

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:10.999
AND SHOWING WHAT 
A GREAT TWIG YOU'VE GOT

00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:11.999
IS STILL PART OF THE RITUAL.

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:13.999
SO IT'S ANOTHER WAY 
OF SAYING, YOU KNOW

00:34:13.999 --> 00:34:15.250
"I'M IN A FAMILY WAY.

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:16.999
"ARE YOU?

00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:17.999
"DO YOU LIKE THIS TWIG?

00:34:17.999 --> 00:34:19.999
"MAYBE IF WE LIKE 
THE SAME KIND OF TWIG

00:34:19.999 --> 00:34:21.250
WE MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO GET TOGETHER."

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:22.999
( booby whistles )

00:34:24.999 --> 00:34:27.959
Alda: 
BUT ONCE THE WEDDING BELLS 
HAVE RUNG

00:34:27.959 --> 00:34:31.667
THE HARSH REALITY 
OF MASKED BOOBY LIFE BEGINS.

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:35.250
Anderson: 
THIS PARENT HAS 
TWO CHICKS UNDER IT.

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:37.999
ONE OF THEM HATCHED 
ABOUT SEVEN DAYS AGO

00:34:37.999 --> 00:34:40.959
AND THE OTHER ONE HATCHED 
OUT OF THIS EGGSHELL

00:34:40.959 --> 00:34:41.999
ABOUT TWO DAYS AGO.

00:34:41.999 --> 00:34:43.999
WHEN THE SECOND CHICK HATCHED

00:34:43.999 --> 00:34:45.999
IT WAS A SMALLER SIZE 
AND LESS CAPABLE

00:34:45.999 --> 00:34:47.000
AND THE FIRST CHICK

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.999
IS GOING TO PUSH THIS HELPLESS 
SECOND CHICK OUT OF THE NEST

00:34:50.999 --> 00:34:52.999
IF IT BEHAVES LIKE 
NORMAL MASKED BOOBY CHICKS.

00:34:52.999 --> 00:34:54.999
Alda: 
FOR THE FIRST FEW DAYS

00:34:54.999 --> 00:34:57.999
THE CHICKS AMICABLY 
SHARE THEIR NEST.

00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:00.999
BUT ON DAY FIVE, 
THINGS TURN NASTY.

00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:04.999
( chick squeals )

00:35:14.999 --> 00:35:16.999
( younger chick squeaks feebly )

00:35:16.999 --> 00:35:18.999
( parent bird squawks )

00:35:32.999 --> 00:35:36.999
Alda: 
THE MAIN THING THE PARENT 
IS PROVIDING FOR THE CHICKS

00:35:36.999 --> 00:35:39.125
IS SHELTER FROM THE GLARING SUN.

00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:41.999
THE OLDER CHICK IS TRYING 
TO PUSH THE YOUNGER

00:35:41.999 --> 00:35:45.999
OUT FROM THE SHADE, 
TO A SLOW BUT CERTAIN DEATH.

00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:46.999
THROUGHOUT THE STRUGGLE

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:50.417
THE PARENT REMAINS ALOOF 
AND APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT.

00:35:50.417 --> 00:35:54.999
Anderson: 
THE PARENT IS NOT GOING TO DO 
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SIBLICIDE--

00:35:54.999 --> 00:35:57.999
WE CALL IT SIBLICIDE, 
THE KILLING OF A SIBLING.

00:35:57.999 --> 00:35:59.999
IF IT'S LIKE MOST 
MASKED BOOBY PARENTS

00:35:59.999 --> 00:36:02.999
IT WILL SIMPLY WATCH OR LOOK 
AROUND OR DO SOMETHING ELSE

00:36:02.999 --> 00:36:05.834
BUT IT WILL NOT HELP 
THIS POOR OFFSPRING

00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:07.999
THAT'S BEING KILLED 
BY ITS OWN SIBLING.

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:12.999
THE FIRST TIME I SAW THIS HAPPEN

00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:16.999
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT 
BAD LUCK THE "B" CHICK HAD.

00:36:16.999 --> 00:36:18.250
ITS CLOSEST RELATIVE 
IN THE WORLD

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.959
IS THROWING IT OUT OF THE NEST

00:36:20.959 --> 00:36:23.834
TO DIE ON THE HOT GROUND 
OF SUNSTROKE.

00:36:23.834 --> 00:36:25.999
UM... IT'S SORT OF 
A MISERABLE THING TO SEE.

00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:26.999
I'VE SEEN IT ENOUGH TIMES NOW

00:36:26.999 --> 00:36:29.999
THAT I ACCEPT THAT THAT'S 
THE NORMAL WAY OF BOOBY LIFE

00:36:29.999 --> 00:36:32.000
BUT IT IS KIND OF SHOCKING 
THE FIRST TIME YOU SEE IT.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.999
Alda: 
SHOCKING, AND IN 
DARWINIAN TERMS BAFFLING

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:37.999
AT LEAST AT FIRST SIGHT.

00:36:37.999 --> 00:36:42.999
AFTER ALL, THAT'S THE PARENT'S 
OWN GENES LYING THERE DYING.

00:36:42.999 --> 00:36:45.999
Alda: 
I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
THE ECONOMICS OF THIS.

00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:47.999
IF SHE'S GOING TO LAY TWO EGGS

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:49.000
AND EVERYBODY KNOWS

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.999
THAT THE FIRST ONE IS GOING 
TO KILL THE SECOND ONE

00:36:51.999 --> 00:36:54.999
WHY EXPEND ALL THAT ENERGY 
TO LAY A SECOND EGG?

00:36:54.999 --> 00:36:56.667
IT SEEMS 
LIKE A WASTE.

00:36:56.667 --> 00:36:57.999
YEAH.

00:36:57.999 --> 00:36:59.125
IN TERMS OF NATURAL SELECTION

00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:02.999
SELECTION IS GOING 
TO MAXIMIZE THE EXCESS BENEFITS

00:37:02.999 --> 00:37:05.417
OVER THE COST.

00:37:05.417 --> 00:37:07.999
SO CERTAINLY THE BENEFIT 
HAS TO EXCEED THE COST.

00:37:07.999 --> 00:37:10.999
IN THIS CASE, THERE'S A BENEFIT 
TO LAYING THE SECOND EGG

00:37:10.999 --> 00:37:12.125
EVEN IF YOU ONLY WANT ONE CHICK

00:37:12.125 --> 00:37:14.542
BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
LOUSY HATCHING SUCCESS.

00:37:14.542 --> 00:37:16.417
THEY ONLY HATCH 
ABOUT 60% OF THEIR EGGS

00:37:16.417 --> 00:37:18.999
EVEN IF YOU ELIMINATE 
ACCIDENTS AND STUFF.

00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:21.999
SOMETHING ABOUT FERTILITY 
OR EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT

00:37:21.999 --> 00:37:23.999
CAUSES 40% OF THEM TO DIE.

00:37:23.999 --> 00:37:25.125
SO IF YOU'RE GOING 
TO GET ONE CHICK--

00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:26.999
YOU GOT TO HAVE ONE CHICK--

00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:28.999
YOU'RE PREPARED TO PAY 
THE PRICE OF A SECOND EGG

00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:32.250
EVEN THOUGH IT'S EXPENSIVE, 
BECAUSE IF THE FIRST ONE FAILS

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:33.999
THE SECOND ONE 
CAN TAKE ITS PLACE.

00:37:33.999 --> 00:37:35.999
IT SEEMS TO ME

00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:38.999
THAT ONCE YOU'VE GONE TO 
THE TROUBLE OF LAYING TWO EGGS

00:37:38.999 --> 00:37:39.999
AND YOU HAVE A GOOD SHOT

00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:42.959
AT HAVING TWO HEALTHY ADULTS 
COME OUT OF THAT

00:37:42.959 --> 00:37:46.999
ISN'T YOUR PURPOSE BETTER SERVED 
TO... TO LET BOTH OF THEM LIVE?

00:37:46.999 --> 00:37:48.999
YEAH, GOOD QUESTION.

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:51.999
IF YOU EXPERIMENTALLY STOP 
THE SIBLICIDE FROM HAPPENING

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:55.250
AND MAKE THEM PLAY NICE, 
AND THEN CHALLENGE THE PARENTS

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:56.999
TO BRING BACK 
ENOUGH FOOD FOR TWO

00:37:56.999 --> 00:37:58.999
ABOUT 30% OF THE TIME, 
THEY CAN DO IT.

00:37:58.999 --> 00:37:59.999
SHE DOESN'T STOP FEEDING.

00:37:59.999 --> 00:38:01.999
IF THERE ARE TWO CHICKS 
IN FRONT OF HER

00:38:01.999 --> 00:38:04.999
SHE'LL FEED THEM-- YOU KNOW, 
OPEN MOUTH, PUT IN FOOD--

00:38:04.999 --> 00:38:05.999
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

00:38:05.999 --> 00:38:07.542
AND IF THERE ARE 
TWO OF THEM THERE

00:38:07.542 --> 00:38:08.999
SHE PUTS IT IN 
AT TWICE THE RATE.

00:38:08.999 --> 00:38:11.542
SO YOU SAY, "WELL, THEY 
DEFINITELY SHOULD BE STOPPING

00:38:11.542 --> 00:38:12.999
THE SIBLICIDE FROM HAPPENING."

00:38:12.999 --> 00:38:15.999
HOWEVER, IF YOU FOLLOW 
THOSE PARENTS ANOTHER YEAR

00:38:15.999 --> 00:38:19.000
YOU FIND OUT IN THE YEAR 
AFTER THEY RAISED TWO CHICKS

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.999
THEY TAKE IT ON THE CHIN 
IN TERMS OF SURVIVAL

00:38:20.999 --> 00:38:22.999
PARTICULARLY THE MOMS.

00:38:22.999 --> 00:38:26.834
REGULAR MOMS SURVIVE AT ABOUT 
92% OVER... FROM YEAR TO YEAR

00:38:26.834 --> 00:38:30.959
AND THE EXPERIMENTALS THAT 
HAVE HAD TO RAISE TWO CHICKS

00:38:30.959 --> 00:38:34.125
SURVIVE AT ABOUT 75%, 
AND THAT'S A HUGE COST.

00:38:34.125 --> 00:38:37.999
Alda: 
A COST THAT IN TERMS 
OF NATURAL SELECTION

00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:39.999
SIMPLY CANNOT BE SUSTAINED.

00:38:41.999 --> 00:38:44.999
Alda: 
THIS IS REALLY FASCINATING.

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:46.834
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND

00:38:46.834 --> 00:38:49.999
I'M SPENDING JUST A FEW HOURS 
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THIS

00:38:49.999 --> 00:38:52.834
AND YOU'RE SPENDING 
YOUR LIFE ON IT.

00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:54.667
HOW DID YOU GET LED TO THAT?

00:38:54.667 --> 00:38:55.999
IT'S A PROBLEM

00:38:55.999 --> 00:38:59.542
THAT ON THE SURFACE SEEMS 
FAIRLY EASY TO ADDRESS--

00:38:59.542 --> 00:39:02.125
THE PROBLEM BEING, 
WHY LAY THAT SECOND EGG?

00:39:02.125 --> 00:39:05.999
GIVEN THAT YOU LAY A SECOND EGG, 
WHY NOT TRY TO RAISE TWO CHICKS?

00:39:05.999 --> 00:39:09.834
BUT TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW 
SELECTION ACTS ON INDIVIDUALS

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:12.999
YOU REALLY OUGHT TO HAVE 
A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE

00:39:12.999 --> 00:39:14.999
AND FOLLOWING 
THE LIFETIME CONSEQUENCES

00:39:14.999 --> 00:39:17.999
OF A LONG-LIVED ANIMAL MAY 
TAKE UP MOST OF YOUR CAREER.

00:39:17.999 --> 00:39:22.999
SOME OF THE BIRDS THAT I HAVE 
INITIATED STUDY OF AS BABIES

00:39:22.999 --> 00:39:24.125
ARE GOING TO OUTLIVE MY CAREER.

00:39:25.999 --> 00:39:26.999
Alda: 
BUT MANY WON'T.

00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:29.999
EVEN CHICKS THAT HAVE WON 
THE BATTLE OF THE NEST

00:39:29.999 --> 00:39:32.999
FALL PREY TO MOCKINGBIRDS 
PECKING THEM FOR THEIR BLOOD.

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:37.999
AND THEN THERE ARE

00:39:37.999 --> 00:39:40.999
THE CONSTANTLY MARAUDING 
FRIGATE BIRDS

00:39:40.999 --> 00:39:43.999
ALWAYS LOOKING TO SNATCH 
A CHICK FROM ITS NEST.

00:39:43.999 --> 00:39:46.999
Anderson: 
I MEAN, YOU EITHER GET 
KILLED BY YOUR SIBLING

00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:49.999
AND YOUR PARENTS DON'T CARE

00:39:49.999 --> 00:39:51.999
OR IF YOU MANAGE TO SURVIVE 
THAT PROCESS

00:39:51.999 --> 00:39:53.834
THEN WHEN YOUR PARENTS 
LEAVE YOU ALONE

00:39:53.834 --> 00:39:56.000
A FRIGATE BIRD MIGHT 
COME DOWN AND TAKE YOU

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.417
AND DROP YOU FROM 
A HUNDRED FEET IN THE AIR.

00:39:58.417 --> 00:40:01.999

DAVE ANDERSON'S LIFE AMONG 
THE MASKED BOOBIES OF ESPAÑOLA

00:40:01.999 --> 00:40:03.999
HAS GIVEN HIM UNUSUAL ACCESS

00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:05.999
TO THE DAILY STRUGGLE 
THAT DRIVES EVOLUTION.

00:40:05.999 --> 00:40:08.999
AND IT ISN'T A PRETTY SIGHT.

00:40:08.999 --> 00:40:12.999
LIFE STINKS FOR MOST ORGANISMS 
MOST OF THE TIME

00:40:12.999 --> 00:40:14.999
AND WE MAYBE DON'T 
REALIZE IT SO MUCH

00:40:14.999 --> 00:40:17.999
LOOKING AT CONTINENTAL SYSTEMS 
AS OPPOSED TO HERE

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:20.999
BECAUSE HERE THE ANIMALS DO 
THEIR SUFFERING OUT IN THE OPEN

00:40:20.999 --> 00:40:23.999
AND PARTICULARLY 
THESE BOOBIES.

00:40:23.999 --> 00:40:25.250
THEY JUST HAVE A MISERABLE LIFE

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.250
YOU WOULDN'T WISH 
ON YOUR WORST ENEMY--

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.999
ALL THESE TERRIBLE THINGS 
THAT CAN HAPPEN TO YOU.

00:40:29.999 --> 00:40:33.417
AND IT'S REALLY APPARENT TO US, 
BECAUSE IT'S...

00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:34.999
THEY'RE NOT HIDING IT.

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:35.999
THEY DON'T HAVE A HISTORY

00:40:35.999 --> 00:40:37.999
OF TRYING TO HIDE 
FROM CREATURES LIKE US

00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:39.999
AND SO THEY JUST DO IT 
IN FRONT OF US.

00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:43.999
WE CAN SORT OF PARTICIPATE 
IN THE COMMUNITY

00:40:43.999 --> 00:40:46.250
AS A KIND OF IGNORED OBSERVER

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.999
WALKING DOWN THE BACK ALLEYS 
OF THEIR LIVES

00:40:49.999 --> 00:40:52.125
AND THEY SORT OF LET US DO IT.

AMONG THE MORE RECENT IMMIGRANTS 
TO THE GALAPAGOS ARE HUMANS.

00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:14.999
WHEN DARWIN CAME IN 1835

00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:18.999
PEOPLE LIVED SCATTERED IN SMALL 
FISHING AND FARMING COMMUNITIES

00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:20.667
THROUGHOUT THE ARCHIPELAGO.

00:41:20.667 --> 00:41:22.250
WITH PEOPLE CAME ANIMALS

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.999
THAT WOULD NEVER HAVE 
MADE IT HERE ON THEIR OWN:

00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:26.999
CHICKENS, DOGS, CATS..

00:41:26.999 --> 00:41:29.999
GOATS, PIGS, CATTLE.

00:41:30.999 --> 00:41:32.999
TODAY THERE ARE STRICT RULES

00:41:32.999 --> 00:41:36.999
GOVERNING WHERE PEOPLE 
AND THEIR ANIMALS CAN LIVE.

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:39.999
96% OF THE LAND IS NATIONAL PARK

00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:42.999
OFF-LIMITS TO ANYONE 
NOT ACCOMPANIED BY A GUIDE

00:41:42.999 --> 00:41:43.999
LIKE LYNN FOWLER.

00:41:43.999 --> 00:41:45.999
BUT WHILE PEOPLE 
CAN BE CONTROLLED

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:49.959
THE ANIMALS THEY'VE 
BROUGHT WITH THEM CAN'T.

00:41:49.959 --> 00:41:52.000
WE'RE CLIMBING A PEAK 
OVERLOOKING SANTIAGO

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.999
ONE OF THE FOUR ISLANDS 
ON DARWIN'S ITINERARY.

00:41:55.999 --> 00:41:57.999

WHEN DARWIN 
CAMPED THERE...

00:41:57.999 --> 00:41:59.999
THAT'S ALL SANTIAGO 
OVER THERE?

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:01.999
YEAH-- THERE 
WERE SO MANY 
LAND IGUANAS ON IT

00:42:01.999 --> 00:42:03.999

HARDLY FIND A PLACE

00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:04.999
TO PITCH HIS TENT

00:42:04.999 --> 00:42:06.000
BECAUSE OF THE 
LAND IGUANA BURROWS.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
( chuckles )

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.999
BUT THEY'RE 
EXTINCT NOW.

00:42:09.999 --> 00:42:11.999
THEY'RE EXTINCT 
FROM SANTIAGO.

00:42:11.999 --> 00:42:12.999
THOSE... REALLY?

00:42:12.999 --> 00:42:14.999
WELL, HOW DID 
THAT HAPPEN?

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:16.999
DOGS AND PIGS... 
AND RATS.

00:42:16.999 --> 00:42:17.999
THEY GO 
RIGHT INTO THE...

00:42:17.999 --> 00:42:19.999
THE RATS ATTACK 
THE IGUANAS?

00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:21.250
THEY GO IN THE 
LAND IGUANA BURROWS

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:23.999
AND EAT THE 
EGGS AND KILL THE 
LITTLE HATCHLINGS.

ONE OF THE GALAPAGOS NATIVES 
WORST HIT BY HUMANS

THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:33.999

ORIGINALLY DECIMATED BY WHALERS 
HAULING THEM OFF FOR FOOD

00:42:37.834 --> 00:42:39.999
THEY HAVE SINCE HAD TO COMPETE 
WITH PIGS AND GOATS

00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:41.542
THAT HAVE GONE WILD 
AND RUN RAMPANT

00:42:41.542 --> 00:42:43.999

THE CAPTIVE-BREEDING PROCESS 
AS THEY WENT ALONG.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.999
A CRITICAL REALIZATION WAS 
THAT THE SEX OF THE HATCHLINGS

00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:09.999
DEPENDS UPON THE TEMPERATURE AT 
WHICH THE EGGS ARE INCUBATED...

28 DEGREES CELSIUS, 
AND YOU GET MALES.

A PRETTY SOPHISTICATED 
SYSTEM HERE

DESPITE THE SHOESTRING BUDGET

00:44:36.999 --> 00:44:39.999
THE CAPTIVE-BREEDING PROGRAM

00:44:39.999 --> 00:44:42.999
IN SOME 800 ESPAÑOLA TORTOISES 
BEING RETURNED

TO THEIR NATIVE ISLAND.

00:44:44.999 --> 00:44:49.999
MAKING THIS POSSIBLE WAS AN 
AMBITIOUS AND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM

00:44:49.999 --> 00:44:51.999
AIMED AT RIDDING 
THE ISLAND OF GOATS

00:44:51.999 --> 00:44:55.834
THE TORTOISES' MAIN 
COMPETITOR FOR RESOURCES.

00:44:56.999 --> 00:45:00.667

INCLUDING THE BIGGEST, ISABELA

00:45:00.667 --> 00:45:02.999
REMAIN OVERRUN WITH GOATS 
AS WELL AS PIGS.

MARIELAS ISLANDS ONLY RECENTLY

00:45:37.834 --> 00:45:39.999

MOST UNEXPECTED INHABITANTS.

PENGUINS IN 
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS

THE PENGUINS IN GALAPAGOS

00:45:47.999 --> 00:45:49.999
AREN'T DOING PARTICULARLY WELL.

00:45:49.999 --> 00:45:52.542
WHEN EL NIÑO EVENTS COME 
INTO THE ARCHIPELAGO

00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:55.999
WHICH HAPPENS EVERY SO OFTEN, 
THE WATERS GET VERY, VERY WARM

00:45:55.999 --> 00:45:58.999
AND THE NORMAL FISH LIFE 
AROUND HERE BEGINS TO DIE OFF.

00:45:58.999 --> 00:46:01.542
WHEN THAT HAPPENS, 
PENGUIN POPULATIONS CRASH.

00:46:01.542 --> 00:46:03.999
IN 1982-'83, THEY 
CRASHED BY OVER 50%.

00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:06.959
THIS LAST YEAR, '97-'98, 
THEY CRASHED AGAIN.

00:46:06.959 --> 00:46:08.542
AND THE THING THAT CONFUSES US

00:46:08.542 --> 00:46:10.999
IS THEY DON'T RECUPERATE 
AFTER THOSE CRASHES.

00:46:10.999 --> 00:46:13.667
NOW, THAT WORRIES US, 
BECAUSE, OF COURSE

00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:16.999
IF THE POPULATIONS CRASH EVERY 
SO OFTEN AND NEVER RECUPERATE

00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:18.999
THEY CAN GO EXTINCT.

00:46:18.999 --> 00:46:20.999
Alda: 
HOWARD SUSPECTS RATS 
ARE THE CULPRITS

00:46:20.999 --> 00:46:22.999
INVADING THE ROCK CREVICES

00:46:22.999 --> 00:46:25.999
WHERE PENGUINS LAY THEIR EGGS 
AND RAISE THEIR CHICKS.

00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:27.999
SO HE'S CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT

00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:30.999
TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE 
TO SAVE THE PENGUINS--

00:46:30.999 --> 00:46:32.542
SHORT OF THE IMPOSSIBLE TASK

00:46:32.542 --> 00:46:35.250
OF RIDDING THE GALAPAGOS 
OF RATS ENTIRELY.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:38.000
Snell: 
NOW, WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO 
IS USE THESE ISLANDS--

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.999
THESE SMALL ISLANDS-- AS MODELS 
FOR THE REST OF THE GALAPAGOS.

00:46:41.999 --> 00:46:44.667
AND WE'RE REMOVING THE RATS, 
BY POISONING THEM

00:46:44.667 --> 00:46:47.834
FROM SOME OF THE ISLANDS 
AND LEAVING THEM ON OTHERS.

00:46:48.999 --> 00:46:52.999
THE IDEA IS TO TRY AND MEASURE 
HOW FEW RATS WE CAN REMOVE

00:46:52.999 --> 00:46:54.999
TO INCREASE 
PENGUIN REPRODUCTION.

00:46:54.999 --> 00:46:56.999
THAT WAY WE CAN 
INVEST ENOUGH MONEY

00:46:56.999 --> 00:46:58.999
TO INCREASE PENGUIN REPRODUCTION

00:46:58.999 --> 00:47:02.125
BUT NOT SO MUCH MONEY THAT 
WE CAN'T DO OTHER THINGS ALSO.

00:47:02.125 --> 00:47:04.999
IT'S REALLY ABOUT TRYING 
TO DIVVY UP LIMITED RESOURCES

00:47:04.999 --> 00:47:05.999
FOR THE CONSERVATION

00:47:05.999 --> 00:47:07.999
OF THE BIOLOGY 
OF THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS.

00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:11.999
Alda: 
THOSE RESOURCES MAY BECOME 
A LITTLE LESS LIMITED

00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:15.000
IN THE FUTURE, THANKS 
TO THE LATEST ALIEN SPECIES

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.667
TO INVADE THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS:

00:47:17.667 --> 00:47:20.999
ECO-TOURISTS, WHO COME 
BY THE THOUSANDS EACH YEAR.

00:47:20.999 --> 00:47:23.999
THESE TOURISTS BRING IN 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:47:23.999 --> 00:47:25.999
FOR THE TOUR OPERATORS

00:47:25.999 --> 00:47:29.999
BUT UNTIL RECENTLY, LITTLE 
OR NOTHING FOR THE WILDLIFE.

00:47:29.999 --> 00:47:31.834
NOW THAT'S CHANGING.

00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:34.999
Man: 
THERE ARE ABOUT 60,000 PEOPLE 
A YEAR WHO VISIT THE GALAPAGOS

00:47:34.999 --> 00:47:37.999
AND I'M OF THE BELIEF 
THAT THOSE 60,000 PEOPLE

00:47:37.999 --> 00:47:40.999
CAN BE A MAJOR PART 
OF THE FUTURE IN THESE ISLANDS

00:47:40.999 --> 00:47:42.999
AND THAT COMPANIES 
LIKE OURSELVES

00:47:42.999 --> 00:47:44.667
WHO BENEFIT AND INDEED PROFIT

00:47:44.667 --> 00:47:46.999
FROM BEING ABLE TO BRING 
THESE VISITORS HERE

00:47:46.999 --> 00:47:49.417
ARE IN THE POSITION 
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

00:47:49.417 --> 00:47:52.959
AND IN THE LAST YEAR, 
IN THE YEAR SINCE 
WE'VE BEEN HERE

00:47:52.959 --> 00:47:54.999
WE'VE RAISED ABOUT 
$200,000 FROM OUR GUESTS

00:47:54.999 --> 00:47:56.999
AND WHEN YOU THINK 
THAT WE REPRESENT

00:47:56.999 --> 00:47:59.999
FIVE PERCENT OF TOURISM 
TO THESE ISLANDS

00:47:59.999 --> 00:48:02.999
AND IF YOU MULTIPLY THIS KIND 
OF AN ACTIVITY TIMES 20

00:48:02.999 --> 00:48:06.667
ALL OF A SUDDEN, TOURISM COULD, 
IN FACT, SUSTAIN PLACES

00:48:06.667 --> 00:48:10.999
LIKE THE CHARLES DARWIN RESEARCH 
STATION AND THE NATIONAL PARKS

00:48:10.999 --> 00:48:13.999
AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE 
TO STRUGGLE SO MUCH FOR FUNDING.

00:48:15.999 --> 00:48:17.999
Alda: 
BUT THERE'S AN IRONY HERE.

00:48:17.999 --> 00:48:19.999
TOURISTS BRING IN 
NOT ONLY DOLLARS;

00:48:19.999 --> 00:48:22.999
THEY'VE ALSO ATTRACTED THOUSANDS 
OF ECUADORIANS TO THE ISLANDS

00:48:22.999 --> 00:48:24.999
TO WORK IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY.

00:48:27.999 --> 00:48:30.999
TOGETHER, TOURISTS AND 
RESIDENTS POSE A NEW THREAT

00:48:30.999 --> 00:48:31.999
TO THE ISLANDS' ECOSYSTEM.

00:48:31.999 --> 00:48:34.999
Snell: 
BECAUSE THERE ARE 16,000 
TO 20,000 PEOPLE

00:48:34.999 --> 00:48:36.999
THAT LIVE IN 
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS

00:48:36.999 --> 00:48:39.999
FIVE SUPPLY SHIPS RUN OUT HERE 
TWO OR THREE TIMES A MONTH EACH

00:48:39.999 --> 00:48:41.999
AND THERE ARE THREE 727s A DAY

00:48:41.999 --> 00:48:43.999
THAT FLY INTO 
THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS.

00:48:43.999 --> 00:48:47.999
ALL OF THAT ACTIVITY BRINGS IN 
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MATERIAL.

00:48:47.999 --> 00:48:50.999
TONS AND TONS AND TONS OF FOOD 
AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL

00:48:50.999 --> 00:48:52.999
COME TO THE GALAPAGOS 
EVERY YEAR.

00:48:52.999 --> 00:48:53.999
SOMEWHERE IN THOSE PACKAGES

00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:55.999
ARE THE INTRODUCED SPECIES 
OF TOMORROW.

00:48:55.999 --> 00:48:57.999
IT'S NOT PURPOSEFUL NOWADAYS

00:48:57.999 --> 00:49:00.999
BUT IT'S EVERY BIT 
AS DAMAGING AS IF IT WAS.

00:49:00.999 --> 00:49:02.999
Alda: 
I'VE COME TO SEE FOR MYSELF

00:49:02.999 --> 00:49:05.999
ONE OF THE WORST 
OF THESE ALIEN INVADERS.

00:49:05.999 --> 00:49:08.999
CHARLOTTE CAUSTON 
OF THE DARWIN RESEARCH STATION

00:49:08.999 --> 00:49:09.999
IS SHOWING THE WAY.

00:49:09.999 --> 00:49:12.999
WHAT ARE ALL THESE 
LITTLE WHITE THINGS?

00:49:12.999 --> 00:49:15.999
OKAY, THESE 
ARE THE COTTONY 
CUSHION SCALE.

00:49:15.999 --> 00:49:18.667
IT'S AN INTRODUCED 
SCALE INSECT

00:49:18.667 --> 00:49:20.542
THAT WAS INTRODUCED 
IN 1982

00:49:20.542 --> 00:49:22.999
INTO THE ISLAND 
OF SAN CRISTOBAL

00:49:22.999 --> 00:49:24.999
AND HAS SINCE 
THEN SPREAD

00:49:24.999 --> 00:49:27.999
TO NINE OTHER ISLANDS 
IN THE ARCHIPELAGO

00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:29.999
AND ATTACKS OVER 
40 PLANT SPECIES.

00:49:29.999 --> 00:49:31.250
HMM...

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:33.999
IN THE ABSENCE OF 
ITS NATURAL ENEMIES

00:49:33.999 --> 00:49:34.999
IT'S JUST GONE HAYWIRE.

00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:36.999
HOW WAS IT INTRODUCED?

00:49:36.999 --> 00:49:38.999
WE'RE NOT SURE.

00:49:38.999 --> 00:49:40.000
WE THINK IT WAS INTRODUCED

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.542
IN SOME ACACIA TREES THAT 
WERE IMPORTED TO THE ISLANDS

00:49:43.542 --> 00:49:45.959
BUT THEN AGAIN, IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN SOME CITRUS.

00:49:45.959 --> 00:49:48.250
AND IT WAS DEFINITELY ON A PLANT 
AND ACCIDENTALLY INTRODUCED.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:49.999
NO ONE BROUGHT IT IN ON PURPOSE.

00:49:49.999 --> 00:49:54.999
Alda: 
THE COTTONY CUSHION SCALE IS ONE 
OF HUNDREDS OF NONNATIVE INSECTS

00:49:54.999 --> 00:49:57.125
THAT HAVE RECENTLY SNEAKED 
INTO THE ISLANDS

00:49:57.125 --> 00:50:00.417
AND CHARLOTTE IS ONE 
OF ONLY TWO ENTOMOLOGISTS.

00:50:00.417 --> 00:50:02.999
IF YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER THEM 
SPECIES BY SPECIES

00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.999
FIND OUT WHAT THEY DO, 
WHAT HARM THEY CAUSE

00:50:04.999 --> 00:50:07.542
AND THEN HOW YOU CAN 
PROTECT AGAINST THEM--

00:50:07.542 --> 00:50:09.999
AND BY THE TIME YOU FIND 
THAT OUT ABOUT ONE SPECIES

00:50:09.999 --> 00:50:12.999
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT 
ANOTHER 300 ON YOUR LIST.

00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:13.999
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:50:13.999 --> 00:50:15.000
HOW DOES THAT 
MAKE YOU FEEL?

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.125
IT'S DAUNTING, THE PROSPECT.

00:50:17.125 --> 00:50:20.999
THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEMS 
THAT FACE THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS

00:50:20.999 --> 00:50:23.999
CAN APPEAR OVERWHELMING, AND 
IN FACT, THEY ARE OVERWHELMING

00:50:23.999 --> 00:50:26.999
BUT THE ONE THING THAT 
PEOPLE THAT ARE MOTIVATED

00:50:26.999 --> 00:50:29.999
TO CONSERVE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY 
IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS

00:50:29.999 --> 00:50:33.125
KEEP AT THE FOREFRONT ALL OF 
THE TIME IS THAT THIS IS REALLY

00:50:33.125 --> 00:50:35.999
ONE OF THE LAST OCEANIC 
ARCHIPELAGOS IN THE WORLD

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:39.999
WHERE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
MAINTAIN A PRISTINE ENVIRONMENT.

00:50:39.999 --> 00:50:42.999
THERE ARE... 95% TO 96% OF 
THE SPECIES THAT EVER OCCURRED

00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:45.000
IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS 
ARE ALIVE TODAY.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.999
SOME OF THEM ARE IN A BAD STATE.

00:50:46.999 --> 00:50:48.999
SOME OF THEM MAY GO EXTINCT 
BEFORE TOO LONG

00:50:48.999 --> 00:50:51.000
IF WE'RE NOT SUCCESSFUL 
AT RESTORATION EFFORTS FOR THEM.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.417
BUT THE POINT IS, WE HAVE 
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE.

00:50:53.417 --> 00:50:55.417
THE WORLD, ACTUALLY-- 
IT'S NOT JUST ECUADOR;

00:50:55.417 --> 00:50:56.999
IT'S NOT JUST 
THE RESEARCH STATION;

00:50:56.999 --> 00:50:58.999
IT'S NOT JUST 
THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE

00:50:58.999 --> 00:51:01.999
BUT THE WORLD HAS AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO PRESERVE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY

00:51:01.999 --> 00:51:03.542
IN A PRISTINE STATE.

00:51:03.542 --> 00:51:05.542
NOW, NOW, WHAT 
ABOUT THIS?

00:51:05.542 --> 00:51:09.542
WHY SHOULD ANYBODY ELSE, 
WHO'S NOT A SCIENTIST, CARE

00:51:09.542 --> 00:51:11.999
ABOUT PRESERVING THE GALAPAGOS?

00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:15.999
IF THE GALAPAGOS 
DISAPPEARS AS 
A UNIQUE PLACE--

00:51:15.999 --> 00:51:19.999
IT'S RUN OVER BY 
INTRODUCED SPECIES-- 
SO WHAT?

00:51:19.999 --> 00:51:23.999
THERE'S A GENETIC... A BANK 
OF GENETIC INFORMATION

00:51:23.999 --> 00:51:25.999
AND IT CAN BE SQUANDERED

00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:28.999
OR IT CAN BE PRESERVED 
IN ITS CURRENT STATE.

00:51:28.999 --> 00:51:31.999
THE ANALOGY IS OFTEN 
MADE WITH A LIBRARY--

00:51:31.999 --> 00:51:34.999
THAT YOU WOULDN'T 
GO INTO A LIBRARY

00:51:34.999 --> 00:51:37.999
AND WANTONLY DESTROY 
A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF

00:51:37.999 --> 00:51:41.999
TO MAKE SHELF ROOM, YOU KNOW, 
TO PUT KNICKKNACKS ON.

00:51:41.999 --> 00:51:43.999
WELL, HERE, 
WE'VE GOT CREATURES

00:51:43.999 --> 00:51:45.999
THAT HAVE BEEN COMING UP 
WITH SOLUTIONS

00:51:45.999 --> 00:51:48.999
TO PARTICULAR PROBLEMS 
FOR A LONG, LONG TIME

00:51:48.999 --> 00:51:50.999
AND THERE'LL BE 
PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE

00:51:50.999 --> 00:51:53.000
THAT WILL NEED SOME 
OF THOSE SOLUTIONS.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.999
THEY'RE HERE; 
WE SHOULD PRESERVE THEM.

00:51:55.999 --> 00:51:57.999
I THINK IT'S ALSO A PLACE OF JOY

00:51:57.999 --> 00:52:00.250
AND INSIGHT 
INTO NATURAL PROCESSES

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:01.999
AND YOU CAN'T REALLY PREDICT

00:52:01.999 --> 00:52:04.999
WHAT PEOPLE WILL FIND HERE 
IN THE FUTURE.

00:52:04.999 --> 00:52:08.667
BUT LIKE, DARWIN WAS INSPIRED 
BY THIS LABORATORY OF EVOLUTION

00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:10.999
AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE 
WILL IN THE FUTURE.

00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:13.417
AND YOU CAME BECAUSE 
YOU FIND IT INTERESTING.

00:52:13.417 --> 00:52:14.999
SO I THINK IT REALLY 
WILL CONTINUE

00:52:14.999 --> 00:52:16.667
TO BE A LAB OF EVOLUTION

00:52:16.667 --> 00:52:18.999
WHERE YOU CAN REALLY SEE 
THESE PROCESSES HAPPENING.

00:52:18.999 --> 00:52:21.667
THIS OTHER GUY 
WENT UNDER.

00:52:21.667 --> 00:52:22.999
THERE HE GOES!

00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:23.999
OH, THERE 
HE GOES.

00:52:23.999 --> 00:52:25.250
GREAT, BRAVO.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.999
Alda: 
IT WAS LATE ONE AFTERNOON

00:52:26.999 --> 00:52:29.834
AFTER LYNN AND I HAD 
BEEN OUT SNORKELING

00:52:29.834 --> 00:52:31.834
THAT THE MAGIC 
OF THE GALAPAGOS--

00:52:31.834 --> 00:52:32.999
ITS ABILITY, AS MARTIN SAID

00:52:32.999 --> 00:52:36.999
TO PROVIDE JOY AND INSIGHT-- 
CRYSTALLIZED FOR ME.

00:52:36.999 --> 00:52:39.999
HERE WE WERE ON THE EQUATOR, 
TALKING TO PENGUINS

00:52:39.999 --> 00:52:42.999
WHOSE ANCESTORS CAME 
FROM THE ANTARCTIC.

00:52:42.999 --> 00:52:45.999
IN SPITE OF THE WAVES 
AND THE RAZOR-SHARP ROCKS

00:52:45.999 --> 00:52:47.667
WE WERE MESMERIZED.

00:52:47.667 --> 00:52:48.999
Fowler: 
WALKER IN FRONT.

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:50.999
AREN'T THEY CUTE 
HOW THEY WALK?

00:52:50.999 --> 00:52:53.667
HE'S GOING TO GO BACK 
FOR SOME FISH.

00:52:53.667 --> 00:52:54.999
HE'S HUNGRY.

00:52:57.999 --> 00:53:00.999
YOU KNOW, TO GET 
THAT CLOSE TO 
PENGUINS, AND...

00:53:02.417 --> 00:53:04.000
IT'S AN EXPERIENCE 
I'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.999
AND IT'S REALLY 
A SENSATIONAL EXPERIENCE

00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:07.999
BUT YOU'RE OUT 
HERE ALL THE TIME.

00:53:07.999 --> 00:53:08.999
WHAT'S IT LIKE 
FOR YOU?

00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:10.125
THAT'S WHAT I SAID 
THE OTHER DAY

00:53:10.125 --> 00:53:12.999
WHEN YOU ASKED ME 
WHY I WAS STILL HERE 
AFTER 20 YEARS--

00:53:12.999 --> 00:53:13.999
IT'S INCREDIBLE, 
ISN'T IT?

00:53:13.999 --> 00:53:15.999
SOMETHING HAPPENS 
DIFFERENT EVERY SINGLE DAY.

00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:17.834
YOU NEVER GET TIRED 
OF THESE ISLANDS.

00:53:18.999 --> 00:53:22.999

CHARLES DARWIN SPENT JUST 
FIVE WEEKS IN THE GALAPAGOS

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:24.999
AMAZED, AS IS EVERY VISITOR

00:53:24.999 --> 00:53:28.959
BY THE TAMENESS OF THE ANIMALS 
AND BIRDS, AND BY A SENSE

00:53:28.959 --> 00:53:31.999
OF BEING IN A WORLD APART, 
IN TIME AND IN SPACE.

00:53:33.999 --> 00:53:37.667
BUT WHAT STAYED IN HIS MIND 
LIKE A SLOW-BURNING FUSE

00:53:37.667 --> 00:53:41.959
WAS THE SAME CREATURE OR PLANT 
TURNING UP IN DIFFERENT FORMS

00:53:41.959 --> 00:53:44.959
EVEN DIFFERENT SPECIES, 
ON DIFFERENT ISLANDS--

00:53:44.959 --> 00:53:48.834
A CIRCUMSTANCE, HE WROTE 
IN THE VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE

00:53:48.834 --> 00:53:50.999
"THAT STRIKES ME WITH WONDER":

00:53:50.999 --> 00:53:52.999
"IT IS THE FATE OF MOST VOYAGERS

00:53:52.999 --> 00:53:56.999
"NO SOONER TO DISCOVER WHAT IS 
MOST INTERESTING IN ANY LOCALITY

00:53:56.999 --> 00:53:58.999
"THAN THEY ARE HURRIED FROM IT;

00:53:58.999 --> 00:54:00.999
"BUT I OUGHT PERHAPS 
TO BE THANKFUL

00:54:00.999 --> 00:54:03.999
"THAT I OBTAINED SUFFICIENT 
MATERIALS TO ESTABLISH

00:54:03.999 --> 00:54:05.250
"THIS MOST REMARKABLE FACT

00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:07.999
"IN THE DISTRIBUTION 
OF ORGANIC BEINGS.

00:54:07.999 --> 00:54:11.999
"REVIEWING THE FACTS HERE GIVEN, 
ONE IS ASTONISHED AT THE AMOUNT

00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:15.999
"OF CREATIVE FORCE, IF SUCH 
AN EXPRESSION MAY BE USED

00:54:15.999 --> 00:54:19.417
DISPLAYED ON THESE SMALL, 
BARREN AND ROCKY ISLANDS."

SOME 20 YEARS LATER

00:54:24.999 --> 00:54:30.999
HE IDENTIFIED HIS "CREATIVE 
FORCE" AS NATURAL SELECTION

00:54:30.999 --> 00:54:34.999
AND THE WORLD CHANGED FOREVER.
