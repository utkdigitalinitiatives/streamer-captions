00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:44.000


2
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.700
I here do die.

3
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.630
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,

4
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.900
find we a time for frighted peace to pant

5
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.930
and breathe short-winded accents of new broils

6
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.670
to be commenced in strands afar remote.

7
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.800
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil

8
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.470
shall daub her lips with her own children's blood.

9
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.800
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,

10
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.430
nor bruise her flowerets

11
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.400
with the armed hoofs of hostile paces.

12
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.630
Those opposed eyes,

13
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.430
which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,

14
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.870
all of one nature, of one substance bred,

15
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.570
did lately meet in the intestine shock

16
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.870
and furious close of civil butchery shall now,

17
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.470
in mutual, well-beseeming ranks, march all one way

18
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.000
and be no more opposed

19
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.130
against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.

20
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.970
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,

21
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.970
no more shall cut his master.

22
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:47.400
Therefore, friends, as far as to the sepulchre of Christ,

23
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.170
whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross

24
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.030
we are impressed and engaged to fight,

25
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.430
forthwith a power of English shall we levy,

26
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.370
whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb

27
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.430
to chase these pagans in those holy fields

28
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.730
over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet

29
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.800
which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd for our advantage

30
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.370
on the bitter cross.

31
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.800
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,

32
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.230
and bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.

33
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.000
Therefore, we meet not now.

34
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.100
Then let me hear of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,

35
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.800
what yesternight our council did decree

36
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.070
in forwarding this dear expedience.

37
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.030
My liege, this haste was hot in question,

38
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.500
and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight

39
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.530
when all athwart there came a post from Wales

40
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.470
loaden with heavy news,

41
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.600
whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,

42
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600
leading the men of Herefordshire to fight

43
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.770
against the irregular and wild Glendower,

44
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.570
was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,

45
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.200
a thousand of his people butchered,

46
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.330
upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,

47
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.070
such shameless, beastly transformation

48
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.830
by those Welshwomen done

49
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.570
as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of.

50
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.370
It seems then that the tidings of this broil

51
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.970
brake off our business for the Holy Land.

52
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.000
This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,

53
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.730
for more uneven and unwelcome news came

54
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.770
from the north and thus it did import.

55
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.900
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,

56
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.800
Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,

57
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.970
that ever-valiant and approved Scot,

58
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.500
at Holmedon met,

59
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.230
where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,

60
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.770
as by discharge of their artillery

61
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.100
and shape of likelihood, the news was told.

62
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.170
For he that brought them, in the very heat

63
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.700
and pride of their contention did take horse,

64
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.400
uncertain of the issue any way.

65
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.970
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,

66
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.430
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.

67
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.430
Stain'd with the variation of each soil

68
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.630
betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours.

69
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.670
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.

70
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.600
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited.

71
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.170
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,

72
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.370
balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see

73
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.170
on Holmedon's plains.

74
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.400
Of prisoners, Hotspur took Mordake, Earl of Fife,

75
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.370
and eldest son to beaten Douglas,

76
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.930
and the Earl of Athol, of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.

77
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.000
And is not this an honorable spoil?

78
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.230
A gallant prize?

79
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.430
Ha, cousin, is it not?

80
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.770
Indeed, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

81
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.370
Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy

82
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.900
that my Lord Northumberland should be the father

83
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.230
to so blest a son,

84
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.470
a son who is the theme of honor's tongue.

85
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.500
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,

86
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.130
who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride,

87
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.830
whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,

88
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.900
see riot and dishonor stain the brow of my young Harry.

89
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.130
O that it could be proved that some night-tripping fairy

90
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.530
had in cradle-clothes exchanged our children where they lay

91
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.100
and call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!

92
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.330
Then would I have his Harry and he mine.

93
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.430
But let him from my thoughts.

94
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.470
What think you, coz, of this young Percy's pride?

95
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.970
The prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised

96
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.370
to his own use, he keeps and sends me word

97
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.000
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

98
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.200
This is his uncle's teaching.

99
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.030
This is Worcester, malevolent to you in all aspects,

100
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.030
which makes him prune himself, and bristle up

101
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.700
the crest of youth against your dignity.

102
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.430
But I have sent for him to answer this.

103
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.900
And for this cause awhile we must neglect

104
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.530
our holy purpose to Jerusalem.

105
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.270
Cousin, on Wednesday next,

106
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.130
our council we will hold at Windsor.

107
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.830
So inform the lords.

108
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.030
But come yourself with speed to us again,

109
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.430
for more is to be said and to be done

110
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.100
than out of anger can be uttered.

111
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.800
How now, Hal.

112
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.970
What time of day is it, lad?

113
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.370
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack

114
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.730
and unbuttoning thee after supper

115
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.600
and sleeping upon benches after noon,

116
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.630
that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly

117
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.830
which thou wouldst truly know.

118
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.070
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day?

119
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.100
Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons

120
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.470
and clocks the tongues of bawds

121
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.470
and dials the signs of leaping-houses

122
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.730
and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench

123
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.930
in flame-colored taffeta,

124
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.330
I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous

125
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.700
to demand the time of the day.

126
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.330
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal,

127
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.400
for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars

128
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.930
and not by Phoebus, he,

129
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.370
"that wandering knight so fair."

130
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.170
And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king,

131
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.970
as, God save Thy Grace-- or "Majesty," I should say,

132
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.430
for grace thou wilt have none--

133
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.670
What, none?

134
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.830
No, no, by my troth, not so much as will serve

135
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.730
to be prologue to an egg and butter.

136
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.870
Well, how then?

137
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.030
Come, roundly, roundly.

138
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.300
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king,

139
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.600
let not us that are squires of the night's body

140
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.500
be called thieves of the day's beauty.

141
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.700
Let us be called, oh, Diana's foresters,

142
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.830
gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon.

143
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.600
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too,

144
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.230
for the fortune of us that are the moon's men

145
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.330
doth ebb and flow like the sea,

146
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
being governed, as the sea is, by the moon.

147
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.900
As, for proof, now: a purse of gold

148
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.100
most resolutely snatched on Monday night

149
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.770
and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning,

150
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.400
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder

151
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.630
and by and by as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

152
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.570
By the Lord, thou sayest true, Hal.

153
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.730
But, I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows

154
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.930
standing in England when thou art king

155
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.670
and resolution thus fobbed as it is

156
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.370
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law?

157
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.670
Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

158
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.130
No, thou shalt.

159
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.270
Shall I?

160
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.570
O rare!

161
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.100
Oh, by the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.

162
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.500
Thou judgest false already.

163
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.870
I mean that thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves

164
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.800
and so become a rare hangman.

165
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.130
Oh, Hal.

166
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.530
Well...

167
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.300
and in some sort, it jumps with my humor

168
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.000
as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.

169
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.100
For obtaining of suits?

170
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.370
Yea, for obtaining of suits,

171
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.870
whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe.

172
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:16.400
Oh, 'sblood, I'm as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

173
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400
Or an old lion?

174
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.530
Or a lover's lute?

175
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.970
Or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

176
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.800
What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?

177
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.100
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes

178
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.930
and art indeed the most comparative,

179
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.230
rascalliest, sweet young prince.

180
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.770
Oh, I prithee, Hal, trouble me no more with vanity.

181
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.630
I would to God thou and I knew

182
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.030
where a commodity of good names were to be bought.

183
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.370
An old lord of the council rated me the other day

184
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.970
in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not;

185
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:54.500
And yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not.

186
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.200
And yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.

187
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.770
Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out

188
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.600
in the street, and no man regards it.

189
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.530
Ooh, ooh!

190
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.630
Thou hast damnable iteration

191
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.400
and art indeed able to corrupt a saint.

192
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.100
Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal.

193
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.170
God forgive thee for it.

194
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.870
Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing.

195
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.830
And now am I, if a man were to speak truly,

196
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.730
little better than one of the wicked.

197
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.600
I must give over this life, and I will give it over.

198
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.330
By the Lord, and I do not, I'm a villain.

199
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.970
I'll be damned for never a king's son in Christendom.

200
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.600
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?

201
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.970
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad.

202
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.130
I'll make one.

203
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.100
An I do not, call me villain and baffle me.

204
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.870
I see a good amendment of life in thee--

205
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.930
from praying to purse-taking.

206
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.870
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation.

207
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.730
'Tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation.

208
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.570
Poins.

209
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.600
Now shall we know if Peto have set a match.

210
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.870
O, if men were to be saved by merit,

211
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.630
what hole in hell were hot enough for him?

212
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.270
Good morrow, Ned.

213
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.770
Good morrow, sweet Hal.

214
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.570
What says Monsieur Remorse?

215
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.330
What says Sir John Sack and Sugar?

216
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.630
Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul,

217
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.500
that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last

218
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.930
for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?

219
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.130
Sir John stands to his word.

220
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.730
He will give the devil his due.

221
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.930
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.

222
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.670
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.

223
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.330
-My lads, my lads. -Yes.

224
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.170
Tomorrow morning, by four o'clock,

225
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.670
early at Gadshill.

226
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.930
There are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings

227
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.630
and traders riding to London with fat purses.

228
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.730
I have vizards for you all.

229
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.570
You have horses for yourselves.

230
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.430
Peto lies tonight in Rochester.

231
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.770
I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap.

232
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.070
We shall do it as secure as sleep.

233
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.230
If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns.

234
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.200
If you will not, tarry at home and be hanged.

235
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.570
Hear ye, Edward.

236
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.800
If I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you for going.

237
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.970
You will, chops?

238
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.200
Hal, wilt thou make one?

239
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.770
Who, I, rob?

240
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.000
I, a thief?

241
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.370
Not I, by my faith.

242
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.830
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship

243
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.870
in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood royal

244
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.070
if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

245
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.830
Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone.

246
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.600
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure

247
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.900
that he shall go.

248
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.430
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion

249
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.830
and him the ears of profiting,

250
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.700
that what thou speakest may move

251
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.730
and what he hears may be believed,

252
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.070
that the true prince may, for recreation sake,

253
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.030
prove a false thief,

254
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.670
for the poor abuses of the time want countenance.

255
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.670
Farewell!

256
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.000
You shall find me in Eastcheap.

257
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.500
Farewell, thou latter spring!

258
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.130
Farewell, all-hallown summer!

259
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.730
Now, my good, sweet honey lord,

260
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.800
ride with us tomorrow.

261
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.670
I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone.

262
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.830
Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto

263
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.170
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid.

264
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.970
Yourself and I shall not be there.

265
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.370
And when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them,

266
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.270
then cut this head off from my shoulders.

267
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.930
How shall we part with them in setting forth?

268
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.130
Why, we will set forth before or after them.

269
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.730
'Tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits,

270
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.770
by every other appointment, to be ourselves.

271
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.400
Tut; our horses, they shall not see.

272
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.970
I'll tie them in the wood.

273
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.330
Our vizards, we will change after we leave them.

274
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.600
And, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce

275
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.170
to immask our noted outward garments.

276
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.400
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.

277
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.200
Well, for two of them, I know them to be

278
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.270
as true-bred cowards as ever turned back.

279
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.270
And as for the third, if he fight longer

280
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.400
than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms.

281
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.970
The virtue of this jest shall be

282
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.000
the incomprehensible lies this same fat rogue

283
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
will tell,when we meet at supper:

284
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.800
how thirty, at least, he fought with;

285
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.000
what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured.

286
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.330
And in the reproof of this lives the jest.

287
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.430
Well, I will go with thee.

288
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.730
Provide us all things necessary.

289
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.470
Meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap.

290
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.700
There, I'll sup.

291
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700
Farewell.

292
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.700
Farewell, my lord.

293
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.330
I know you all

294
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.370
and will a while uphold the unyoked humor

295
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.030
of your idleness.

296
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.630
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,

297
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.330
who doth permit the base, contagious clouds

298
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.230
to smother up his beauty from the world

299
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.500
that, when he please again to be himself,

300
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.270
being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at

301
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.300
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapors

302
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.070
that did seem to strangle him.

303
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.870
If all the year were playing holidays,

304
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.530
to sport would be as tedious as to work.

305
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.600
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,

306
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.170
and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.

307
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:06.870
So when this loose behavior I throw off

308
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:10.070
and pay the debt I never promised,

309
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.830
by how much better than my word I am,

310
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.200
by so much shall I falsify men's hopes.

311
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.900
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,

312
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.300
my reformation, glittering o'er my fault,

313
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.770
shall show more goodly and attract more eyes

314
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.970
than that which hath no foil to set it off.

315
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.430
I'll so offend to make offense a skill,

316
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.830
redeeming time when men think least I will.

317
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.530
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,

318
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.500
unapt to stir at these indignities.

319
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.470
And you have found me,

320
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.600
for, accordingly, you tread upon my patience.

321
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.670
But be sure I will from henceforth

322
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.870
rather be myself, mighty and to be fear'd,

323
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.600
than my condition,

324
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.230
which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,

325
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.330
and therefore lost that title of respect

326
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.430
which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.

327
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.030
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves

328
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.230
the scourge of greatness to be used on it.

329
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.930
And that same greatness too which our own hands

330
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.200
have holp to make so portly.

331
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.200
My lord--

332
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.200
Worcester!

333
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.600
Get thee gone!

334
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.500
For I do see danger and disobedience in thine eye.

335
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.000
Oh, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,

336
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.930
and majesty might never yet endure

337
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.000
the moody frontier of a servant brow.

338
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.230
You have good leave to leave us.

339
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.170
When we need your use and counsel,

340
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.270
we shall send for you.

341
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.270
You were about to speak.

342
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.970
Yea, my lord.

343
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.200
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,

344
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.030
which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,

345
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.800
were, as he says, not with such strength denied

346
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.670
as is deliver'd to your majesty.

347
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.870
Either envy, therefore, or misprison

348
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.530
is guilty of this fault and not my son.

349
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.370
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

350
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.470
But I remember, when the fight was done,

351
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.070
when I was dry with rage and extreme toil,

352
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.630
breathless and faint,leaning upon my sword,

353
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.000
came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,

354
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.070
fresh as a bridegroom.

355
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.070
And his chin new reap'd show'd

356
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.830
like a stubble-land at harvest-home.

357
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.530
He was perfumed like a milliner, and 'twixt his finger

358
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.500
and his thumb, he held a pouncet-box,

359
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.070
which ever and anon he gave his nose

360
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.030
and took't away again; who therewith angry,

361
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.270
when it next came there,,took it in snuff.

362
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.900
And still he smiled and talk'd.

363
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.030
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,

364
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.900
he call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,

365
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.670
to bring a slovenly, unhandsome corse

366
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.570
betwixt the wind and his nobility.

367
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.970
With many holiday, and lady terms, he question'd me.

368
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.370
Amongst the rest,

369
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.570
demanded my prisoners in your majesty's behalf.

370
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.670
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,

371
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.170
to be so pester'd with a popinjay,

372
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.670
out of my grief and my impatience

373
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.900
answer'd neglectingly I know not what.

374
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.000
He should or he should not.

375
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.670
For he made me mad to see him shine so brisk

376
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.900
and smell so sweet

377
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.670
and talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

378
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.970
of guns and drums and wounds.

379
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.430
God save the mark!

380
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.530
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth

381
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.870
was parmaceti for an inward bruise.

382
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.500
And that it was great pity, so it was,

383
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.630
this villainous salt-petre should be digg'd out

384
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.330
of the bowels of the harmless earth,

385
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.800
which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd so cowardly.

386
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.030
And but for these vile guns,

387
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.830
he would himself have been a soldier.

388
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.800
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,

389
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.930
I answer'd indirectly, as I said.

390
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.870
And I beseech you, let not his report come current

391
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:10.000
for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty.

392
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.270
The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,

393
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.900
whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said

394
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.930
to such a person and in such a place,

395
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.170
at such a time, and all the rest retold,

396
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.130
may reasonably die and never rise

397
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.470
to do him wrong or any way impeach

398
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.130
what then he said, so he unsay it now.

399
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:36.030
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners.

400
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.430
But with proviso and exception,

401
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.800
that we at our own charge shall ransom straight

402
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.030
his brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,

403
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.230
who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd

404
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.170
the lives of those that he did lead to fight

405
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.770
against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,

406
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.270
whose daughter, as we hear,

407
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.670
that Mortimer hath lately married.

408
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.830
Shall our coffers, then, be emptied

409
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.530
to redeem a traitor home?

410
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.200
Shall we buy treason and indent with fears,

411
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.200
when they have lost and forfeited themselves?

412
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.470
No, on the barren mountains, let him starve,

413
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.270
for I shall never hold that man my friend

414
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.870
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost

415
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.530
to ransom home revolted Mortimer.

416
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.400
Revolted Mortimer?

417
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.800
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,

418
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.900
but by the chance of war

419
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.000
to prove that true needs but one tongue

420
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.970
for all those wounds, those mouthed wounds,

421
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.230
which valiantly he took

422
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.070
when on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,

423
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.700
in single opposition, hand to hand,

424
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.500
he did confound the best part of an hour

425
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.700
in changing hardiment with great Glendower.

426
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.730
Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,

427
00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.600
upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,

428
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.230
who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,

429
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.070
ran fearfully among the trembling reeds

430
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.900
and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,

431
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.070
bloodstained with those valiant combatants!

432
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.830
Never did base and rotten policy color her working

433
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.170
with such deadly wounds.

434
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.770
Nor never could the noble Mortimer receive so many,

435
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.000
and all willingly.

436
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.830
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt!

437
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.300
Thou dost belie him, Percy.

438
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.600
Thou dost belie him.

439
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.530
He never did encounter with Glendower.

440
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.070
I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone

441
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.130
as Owen Glendower for an enemy!

442
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.570
Art thou not ashamed?

443
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.530
But, sirrah, henceforth

444
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.330
let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.

445
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:48.300
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,

446
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.900
or you shall hear in such a kind from me

447
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.430
as will displease you.

448
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.530
My Lord Northumberland,

449
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.530
we license your departure with your son.

450
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:04.200
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.

451
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.870
An if the devil come and roar for them,

452
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.900
I will not send them.

453
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.170
I will after straight and tell him,

454
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.630
for I will ease my heart, albeit I make a hazard of my head.

455
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.300
What, drunk with choler?

456
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.600
Stay and pause awhile.

457
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.900
Here comes your uncle.

458
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.100
Speak of Mortimer!

459
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.430
'Zounds, I will speak of him

460
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.930
and let my soul want mercy if I do not join with him.

461
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.070
Yea, on his part, I'll empty all these veins

462
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.770
and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust.

463
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.270
But I will lift the noble Mortimer

464
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.470
as high in the air as this unthankful king,

465
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.830
as this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.

466
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.630
Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.

467
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.770
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

468
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.300
He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners.

469
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.830
When I urged the ransom once again of my wife's brother,

470
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.030
then his cheek look'd pale,

471
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.770
and on my face he turn'd an eye of death,

472
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.930
trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

473
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.200
I cannot blame him.

474
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.170
Was not he proclaim'd by Richard that dead is

475
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.330
the next of blood?

476
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.900
Peace, cousin. Say no more.

477
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.770
And now I will unclasp a secret book,

478
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.730
and to your quick-conceiving discontents,

479
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.900
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,

480
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.670
as full of peril and adventurous spirit

481
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.600
as to o'er-walk a current roaring loud

482
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.330
on the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

483
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.700
If he fall in, good night!

484
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.870
Or sink or swim.

485
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.300
Send danger from the east unto the west,

486
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.930
so honor cross it from the north to south,

487
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.770
and let them grapple.

488
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.570
O, the blood more stirs

489
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.700
to rouse a lion than to start a hare.

490
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.330
Imagination of some great exploit

491
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.800
drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

492
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.000
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap

493
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.500
to pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon

494
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.070
or dive into the bottom of the deep,

495
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.270
where fathom-line could never touch the ground,

496
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.570
and pluck up drowned honor by the locks

497
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.030
so he that doth redeem her thence

498
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.170
might wear without corrival all her dignities.

499
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.000
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

500
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.670
He apprehends a world of figures here

501
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.500
but not the form of what he should attend.

502
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.070
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

503
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.500
Oh, I cry you mercy.

504
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.700
Those same noble Scots That are your prisoners--

505
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.970
I'll keep them all.

506
00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.700
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them.

507
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.800
No, if a Scot should save his soul, he shall not.

508
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.100
I'll keep them, by this hand.

509
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.170
You start away and lend no ear unto my purposes.

510
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.900
Those prisoners, you shall keep.

511
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.130
Nay, I will. That's flat.

512
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.700
He said he would not ransom Mortimer,

513
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.870
forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer.

514
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.770
But I will find him when he lies asleep,

515
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.930
and in his ear, I'll holla, "Mortimer!"

516
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.200
Nay, I'll have a starling shall be taught

517
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.700
to speak nothing but "Mortimer"

518
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.830
and give it him to keep his anger still in motion.

519
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.000
Hear you, cousin; a word.

520
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.830
All studies here I solemnly defy,

521
00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.670
save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke

522
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.870
and that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales.

523
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.330
But that his father loves him not

524
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.300
and would be glad he met with some mischance,

525
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.030
I'd have him poison'd with a pot of ale.

526
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.600
Fare you well, kinsman.

527
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.000
I'll talk to you when you're better temper'd to attend.

528
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.230
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool art thou

529
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.930
to break into this woman's mood,

530
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.070
tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own.

531
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.330
Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,

532
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.430
nettled and stung with pismires

533
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.430
when I hear of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.

534
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.830
In Richard's time-- what do you call the place?

535
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.770
A plague upon it; it is in Gloucestershire.

536
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:35.270
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept, his uncle York,

537
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.700
where I first bow'd my knee unto this king of smiles,

538
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.500
this Bolingbroke.

539
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.570
'Sblood!

540
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.570
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.

541
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.600
At Berkley castle.

542
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.370
You say true.

543
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.870
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy

544
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.130
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me.

545
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.430
Look, "when his infant fortune came to age,"

546
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.630
And "gentle Harry Percy," and "kind cousin."

547
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.070
Oh, the devil take such cozeners!

548
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.870
God forgive me.

549
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.300
Good uncle, tell your tale.

550
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.800
I have done.

551
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.330
Nay, if you have not, to it again.

552
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.370
We will stay your leisure.

553
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.730
I have done, i' faith!

554
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.470
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.

555
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.170
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,

556
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.200
and make the Douglas' son your only mean

557
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.600
for powers in Scotland,

558
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.170
which, for divers reasons which I shall send you written,

559
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.030
be assured, shall easily be granted.

560
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.300
You, my lord,

561
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.170
your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,

562
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.800
shall secretly into the bosom creep

563
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.770
of that same noble prelate, the archbishop.

564
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.100
Of York, is it not?

565
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.430
True, who bears hard his brother's death at Bristol,

566
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.030
the Lord Scroop.

567
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.630
I speak not this in estimation, as what I think might be,

568
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.500
but what I know is ruminated, plotted, and set down

569
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.130
and only stays but to behold the face

570
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.900
of that occasion that shall bring it on.

571
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.970
I smell it.

572
00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.270
Upon my life, it will do well.

573
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.530
Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.

574
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.400
Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.

575
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.370
And then the power of Scotland and of York

576
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.870
to join with Mortimer, ha?

577
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.330
And so they shall.

578
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.770
Upon my life, it is exceedingly well aim'd.

579
00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.530
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,

580
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.200
to save our heads by raising of a head,

581
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.430
for, bear ourselves as even as we can,

582
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.200
the king will always think him in our debt

583
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.130
and think we think ourselves unsatisfied,

584
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.870
till he hath found a time to pay us home.

585
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.370
And see already how he doth begin

586
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.200
to make us strangers to his looks of love.

587
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.400
He does. He does.

588
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.300
We'll be revenged upon him.

589
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.300
Cousin, farewell.

590
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.600
No further go in this

591
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.430
than I by letters shall direct your course.

592
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.330
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,

593
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.270
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,

594
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.230
where you and Douglas and our powers at once,

595
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.000
as I will fashion it, shall happily meet

596
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.670
to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,

597
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.300
which now we hold at much uncertainty.

598
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.370
Farewell, good brother.

599
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.330
We shall thrive, I trust.

600
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.070
Uncle, adieu.

601
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.300
Oh, let the hours be short

602
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:04.630
till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport.

603
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.670
Heigh-ho!

604
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.030
An it be not four by the day, I'll be hanged.

605
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.070
Charles' wain is over the new chimney

606
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:23.030
and yet our horse not packed.

607
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:24.700
What, ostler!

608
00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.130
I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle.

609
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.730
Put a few flocks in the point.

610
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:33.730
The poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.

611
00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.830
Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog.

612
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:41.130
That's the next way to give poor jades the bots.

613
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:44.800
This house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.

614
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.470
Poor fellow, he's never joyed since the price of oats rose.

615
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.770
It was the death of him.

616
00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.800
I think this be the most villainous house

617
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.600
in all London road for fleas.

618
00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.800
I'm stung like a tench.

619
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:57.830
What, ostler!

620
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:58.870
Come away and be hanged!

621
00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:00.670
Come away!

622
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.630
I've a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,

623
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.070
to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.

624
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:08.370
God's body!

625
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.330
The turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.

626
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:13.100
Come, neighbour Mugs.

627
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.970
We'll call up the gentlemen.

628
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:18.000
They will along with company, for they have great charge.

629
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.970
What ho, chamberlain.

630
00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.270
At hand, quoth pick-purse.

631
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.600
Good morrow, Master Peto.

632
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.970
It holds current that I told you yesternight.

633
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.370
There's a franklin in the wild of Kent

634
00:31:50.370 --> 00:31:52.670
hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold.

635
00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.470
I heard him tell it to one of his party

636
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.670
last night at supper, a kind of auditor,

637
00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.000
one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.

638
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.500
Here.

639
00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.630
They're up already and call for eggs and butter.

640
00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:07.130
They will away presently.

641
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.530
Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas' clerks,

642
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.170
I'll give thee this neck.

643
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.630
Nay, I'll none of it.

644
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.370
I pray thee keep that for the hangman,

645
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.770
for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas

646
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:18.330
as truly as a man of falsehood may.

647
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.370
What talkest thou to me of the hangman?

648
00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.600
If I hang, I'll make a fat pair of gallows,

649
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.630
for if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me,

650
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.470
and thou knowest he's no starveling.

651
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.000
Tut!

652
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.500
There are other Trojans that thou dreamest not of,

653
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:33.930
the which for sport sake

654
00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.900
are content to do the profession some grace,

655
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.230
that would, if matters should be looked into,

656
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.030
for their own credit sake, make all whole.

657
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.430
I'm joined with no foot-land rakers,

658
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.470
no long-staff sixpenny strikers,

659
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.470
none of your mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms

660
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.370
but with nobility and tranquility,

661
00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:57.630
burgomasters and great oneyers.

662
00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.170
Give me your hand.

663
00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.000
Thou shalt have a share in our purchase,

664
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.430
as I am a true man.

665
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.430
Nay, rather let me have it, as thou art a false thief.

666
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:16.930
Come!

667
00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.270
Shelter, shelter.

668
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:21.700
I have removed Falstaff's horse,

669
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.770
and he frets like a gummed velvet.

670
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:26.400
Stand close.

671
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.030
Poins, and be hanged!

672
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:30.170
Poins!

673
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.800
Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal.

674
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.200
What a brawling dost thou keep.

675
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.200
Where's Poins, Hal?

676
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.830
He is walked up to the top of the hill.

677
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:37.130
I'll go seek him.

678
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.730
I'm accursed to rob.in that thief's company.

679
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.200
The rascal hath removed my horse and tied him I know not where.

680
00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.100
If I travel but four foot further afoot,

681
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.770
I shall break my wind.

682
00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:49.970
Poins, Hal!

683
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.370
A plague on you both!

684
00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.600
Bardolph, Peto!

685
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.270
I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further.

686
00:33:58.270 --> 00:33:59.570
Eight yards of uneven ground

687
00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.000
is threescore and ten miles afoot with me,

688
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.470
and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough.

689
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:07.430
A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another.

690
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.030
A plague on you all.

691
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.330
Give me my horse, you rogues.

692
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.330
Give me my horse, and be hanged!

693
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:19.770
Peace, ye fat-guts!

694
00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.670
Lie down.

695
00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.170
Lay thine ear close to the ground,

696
00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.470
and list if thou canst hear the tread of travelers.

697
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:28.130
Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?

698
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.670
'Sblood, I'll not bear my own flesh so far afoot again

699
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.600
for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.

700
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.700
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

701
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.830
Thou liest.

702
00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:37.600
Thou art not colted; thou art uncolted.

703
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.700
I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,

704
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.700
good king's son.

705
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.700
Out, ye rogue.

706
00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.000
Shall I be your ostler?

707
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.530
Hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters.

708
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.530
If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this.

709
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:50.300
An I have not ballads made on you all

710
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.530
and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison.

711
00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.530
Stand!

712
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.670
So I do, against my will.

713
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.830
O, 'tis our setter.

714
00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.230
I know his voice.

715
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.970
Bardolph, what news?

716
00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.370
Case ye. Case ye.

717
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:04.900
On with your vizards.

718
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.030
There's money of the king's coming down the hill.

719
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:08.670
'Tis going to the king's exchequer.

720
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.200
You lie, ye rogue.

721
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.170
'Tis going to the king's tavern.

722
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:14.100
There's enough to make us all.

723
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.400
To be hanged.

724
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.470
Sirs, you three shall front them in the narrow lane.

725
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.300
Ned Poins and I will walk lower.

726
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.970
If they 'scape from your encounter,

727
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.130
then they light on us.

728
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.300
How many be there of them?

729
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.430
Some eight or ten.

730
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:29.230
'Zounds, will they not rob us?

731
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.970
What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?

732
00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.100
Indeed, I'm not John of Gaunt, your grandfather,

733
00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.370
but yet no coward, Hal.

734
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.670
I'll leave that to the proof.

735
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.870
Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge.

736
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.070
When thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.

737
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:43.500
Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.

738
00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.470
Ned, where are our disguises?

739
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.300
Here, hard by.

740
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.300
Stand close.

741
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:59.270
Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I.

742
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:00.900
Every man to his business.

743
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:07.230
Strike!

744
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.230
Down with them!

745
00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.670
Cut the villains' throats!

746
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.670
Ay, whoreson caterpillars!

747
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.430
Bacon-fed knaves!

748
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:14.430
They hate us youth!

749
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:15.430
Down with them!

750
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:22.570
Now, my masters, let us to horse before day.

751
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.170
An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards,

752
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.470
there's no equity stirring.

753
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:28.800
There's no more valor in that Poins

754
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.330
than in a wild duck.

755
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.700
Got with much ease.

756
00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.470
Falstaff sweats to death.

757
00:36:51.470 --> 00:36:54.130
He lards the lean earth as he walks along.

758
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.000
Were 't not for laughing, I would pity him.

759
00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.430
Ooh, how the fat rogue roar'd.

760
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.500
"But for mine own part, my lord,

761
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.230
"I could be well contented to be there,

762
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.070
in respect of the love I bear your house."

763
00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:08.600
He could be contented?

764
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.930
Why is he not, then?

765
00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.130
In respect of the love he bears our house,

766
00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.270
he shows in this he loves his own barn better

767
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.330
than he loves our house.

768
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.430
Let me see some more.

769
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:19.530
"The purpose you undertake is dangerous."

770
00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.830
Why, that's certain.

771
00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.730
'Tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink.

772
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:29.930
But I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger,

773
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:32.930
we pluck this flower, safety.

774
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:34.970
"The purpose you undertake is dangerous,

775
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.870
"the friends you have named uncertain,

776
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:39.730
"the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light

777
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.470
for the counterpoise of so great an opposition."

778
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:46.130
Say you so? Say you so?

779
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.600
I say unto you again,

780
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.730
you're a shallow, cowardly hind, and you lie.

781
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.030
What a lack-brain is this!

782
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.130
By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid,

783
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.400
our friends true and constant.

784
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.870
A good plot, good friends, and full of expectation.

785
00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.900
An excellent plot, very good friends.

786
00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:08.970
What a frosty-spirited rogue is this.

787
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:10.630
Why, my lord of York commends the plot

788
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.500
and the general course of the action.

789
00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.330
'Zounds, an I were now by this rascal,

790
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:16.730
I could brain him with his lady's fan.

791
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.800
Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself?

792
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.600
Lord Edmund Mortimer, my lord of York,

793
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.600
and Owen Glendower?

794
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.100
Is there not besides the Douglas?

795
00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.070
Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms

796
00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.430
by the ninth of the next month?

797
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.570
And are they not some of them set forward already?

798
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.130
What a pagan rascal is this!

799
00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.930
An infidel!

800
00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.930
Ha!

801
00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:35.800
You shall see now,

802
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.230
out of very sincerity of fear and cold heart

803
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.270
will he to the king

804
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:43.630
and lay open all our proceedings.

805
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:46.500
Oh, I could divide myself and go to buffets

806
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.670
for moving such a dish of skim milk

807
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.070
with so honorable an action!

808
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:53.070
Hang him!

809
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.830
Let him tell the king.

810
00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:58.000
We are prepared.

811
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.570
I will set forward tonight.

812
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.730
How now, Kate.

813
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:07.330
I must leave you within these two hours.

814
00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:12.930
My good lord, why are you thus alone?

815
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.100
For what offense have I this fortnight been

816
00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.970
a banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?

817
00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.170
Tell me, sweet lord,

818
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:25.230
what is't that takes from thee thy stomach, pleasure,

819
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:27.330
and thy golden sleep?

820
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.970
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth

821
00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.300
and start so often when thou sit'st alone?

822
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:35.930
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks

823
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.970
and given my treasures and my rights of thee

824
00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:43.470
to thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?

825
00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:49.300
In thy faint slumbers, I by thee have watch'd

826
00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.830
and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars,

827
00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.430
speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed,

828
00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.630
cry "Courage!

829
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.170
To the field!"

830
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.270
And thou hast talk'd of sallies and retires,

831
00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.270
of trenches, tents,

832
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.370
of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,

833
00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:12.100
of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,

834
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.900
of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain

835
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.600
and all the currents of a heady fight.

836
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.700
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war

837
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.800
and thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep

838
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.800
that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow

839
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:32.330
like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream.

840
00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:37.630
And in thy face, strange motions have appear'd

841
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.330
such as we see when men restrain their breath

842
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.030
on some great sudden hest.

843
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.730
Oh, what portents are these?

844
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.870
Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,

845
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.930
and I must know it, else he loves me not.

846
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.770
What, ho!

847
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.000
Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

848
00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.670
He is, my lord, an hour ago.

849
00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.970
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?

850
00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:04.730
One horse, my lord, he brought even now.

851
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:05.800
What horse?

852
00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.530
A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?

853
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.830
It is, my lord.

854
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.730
That roan shall be my throne.

855
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:12.730
Well, I will back him straight.

856
00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:16.870
O esperance!

857
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.430
But hear you, my lord.

858
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:20.100
What say'st thou, my lady?

859
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.200
What is it carries you away?

860
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.500
Why, my horse, my love, my horse.

861
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.130
Out, you mad-headed ape!

862
00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.800
A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen

863
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.170
as you are toss'd with.

864
00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.900
In faith, I'll know thy business, Harry,

865
00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.270
that I will.

866
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:41.330
I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir about his title

867
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.730
and hath sent for you to line his enterprise.

868
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:45.970
But if you go--

869
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:48.930
So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.

870
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:50.670
Oh, come, come, you paraquito.

871
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:54.030
Answer me directly unto this question that I ask.

872
00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:57.800
In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,

873
00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:59.900
an if thou wilt not tell me all things true.

874
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.170
Ah!

875
00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.930
Away.

876
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:05.300
Away, you trifler!

877
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.770
Love!

878
00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.730
I love thee not.

879
00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.000
I care not for thee, Kate.

880
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.630
This is no world to play with mammets

881
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:13.930
and to tilt with lips.

882
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.900
We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns

883
00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.100
and pass them current too.

884
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.570
God's me, my horse!

885
00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.530
What say'st thou, Kate?

886
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.900
What would'st thou have of me?

887
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.230
Do you not love me?

888
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.970
Do you not, indeed?

889
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.430
Well, do not then, for since you love me not,

890
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.400
I will not love myself.

891
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.870
Do you not love me?

892
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:38.700
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.

893
00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.770
Come.

894
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:44.630
Will you see me ride?

895
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.000
And when I am on horseback,

896
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.330
I will swear I love thee infinitely.

897
00:42:51.330 --> 00:42:52.800
But hark you, Kate.

898
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.930
I must not have you henceforth question me

899
00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:56.600
whither I go, nor reason whereabout.

900
00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:59.130
Whither I must, I must, and, to conclude,

901
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.070
this evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.

902
00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.330
I know you're wise

903
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:06.230
but yet no farther wise than Harry Percy's wife.

904
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.470
Constant you are but yet a woman.

905
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.200
And for secrecy, no lady closer, for I well believe

906
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:16.430
thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know.

907
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:19.800
And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.

908
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.900
How, so far?

909
00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.370
Not an inch further.

910
00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.430
But hark you, Kate.

911
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.300
Whither I go, thither shall you go too.

912
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.000
Today will I set forth, tomorrow you.

913
00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:36.030
Will this content you, Kate?

914
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.400
It must, of force.

915
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.700
Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room,

916
00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.770
and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.

917
00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.900
Where hast been, Hal?

918
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:17.530
With three or four loggerheads

919
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.930
amongst three or four score hogsheads.

920
00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:22.630
I have sounded the very base-string of humility.

921
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.130
Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers

922
00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:27.170
and can call them all by their christen names,

923
00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.930
as Tom, Dick, and Francis.

924
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.600
They take it already upon their salvation

925
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.630
that though I be prince of Wales yet,

926
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.430
I am king of courtesy and tell me flatly

927
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:41.170
I'm no proud Jack, like Falstaff,

928
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:46.830
but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy,

929
00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.700
by the Lord, so they call me.

930
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.630
And when I'm king of England,

931
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.500
I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap.

932
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.230
Old Sir John and and a few dozen more

933
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.400
are at the door.

934
00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.970
Shall I let them in?

935
00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:03.230
Let them alone awhile.

936
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:04.600
I am now of all humors

937
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.230
that have showed themselves humors

938
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:08.070
since the old days of goodman Adam

939
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:12.430
to the pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.

940
00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:17.630
I am not yet of Percy's mind, the Hotspur of the north,

941
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:18.800
he that kills me

942
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.200
some six or seven dozen Scots at a breakfast,

943
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.930
washes his hands, and says to his wife.

944
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:25.530
"Fie upon this quiet life!

945
00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:27.730
I want work."

946
00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.200
"Oh, my sweet Harry," says she,

947
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.500
"how many hast thou killed today?"

948
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.170
"Give my roan horse a drench," says he

949
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.500
and answers "some fourteen" an hour after.

950
00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:41.430
"A trifle, a trifle."

951
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:42.930
I prithee, call in Falstaff.

952
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.300
I'll play Percy,

953
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.230
and that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife.

954
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:49.870
Falstaff!

955
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.570
"Rivo," says the drunkard!

956
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:55.800
Call in ribs! Call in tallow!

957
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:58.630
Welcome, Jack.

958
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.270
Where hast thou been?

959
00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.970
A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too.

960
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:07.170
Marry, and amen.

961
00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:08.970
Give me a cup of sack, boy.

962
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.830
Ere I lead this life long,

963
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:14.970
I'll sew nether stocks and mend them and foot them too.

964
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:16.630
A plague of all cowards.

965
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:17.900
Give me a cup of sack, rogue!

966
00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:19.600
Is there no virtue extant?

967
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.430
Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?

968
00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:25.130
Pitiful-hearted Titan,

969
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:27.670
that melted at the sweet tale of the sun's.

970
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.430
If thou didst, then behold that compound.

971
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:31.500
You rogue!

972
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.130
There's lime in this sack too.

973
00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.630
There's nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man.

974
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:41.100
But a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it.

975
00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.000
A villainous coward.

976
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.430
"Go thy ways, old Jack.

977
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:48.900
Die when thou wilt."

978
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:51.370
If manhood, good manhood,

979
00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.270
be not forgot upon the face of the earth,

980
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:55.070
then am I a shotten herring.

981
00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:58.030
There lives not three good men unhanged in England,

982
00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:00.870
and one of them is fat and grows old.

983
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:01.870
God help the while.

984
00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:03.830
A bad world, I say.

985
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:06.470
I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or anything.

986
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:08.430
A plague of all cowards, I say still.

987
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.770
How now, wool-sack.

988
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:10.770
What mutter you?

989
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.100
A king's son!

990
00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:14.400
Oh, if I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom

991
00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:17.300
with a dagger of lath and drive all thy subjects

992
00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.000
afore thee like a flock of wild geese,

993
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.630
I'll never wear hair on my face more.

994
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.000
You Prince of Wales!

995
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.500
Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?

996
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.670
Are not you a coward?

997
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.670
Answer me that.

998
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:28.170
And Poins there?

999
00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:29.930
'Zounds, ye fat paunch.

1000
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.400
Ye call me a coward.

1001
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.670
By the Lord, I'll stab thee.

1002
00:47:33.670 --> 00:47:36.400
I, call thee coward?

1003
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.330
I'll see thee damned ere I call thee coward.

1004
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.730
But I'd give a thousand pounds

1005
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:41.770
I could run as fast as thou canst.

1006
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:43.670
You're straight enough in the shoulders,

1007
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.530
you care not who sees your back.

1008
00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.530
Call you that backing of your friends?

1009
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:49.470
A plague upon such backing!

1010
00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:50.830
Give me them that will face me.

1011
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:52.600
Give me a cup of sack!

1012
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:53.900
I'm a rogue, if I drunk today.

1013
00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.370
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1014
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:56.700
Oh, villain.

1015
00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.000
Thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last.

1016
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.070
All's one for that.

1017
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:01.930
A plague of all cowards, I say still.

1018
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:04.370
What's the matter?

1019
00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:06.600
What's the matter?

1020
00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:08.770
There be three of us here

1021
00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:10.800
have ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.

1022
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.500
Where is it, Jack? Where is it?

1023
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.930
Where is it?

1024
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:19.630
Ta'en from us it is, a hundred upon poor three of us.

1025
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.730
What, a hundred?

1026
00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:21.770
I am a villain

1027
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:22.930
if I was not at half-sword

1028
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:25.230
with a dozen of them two hours together.

1029
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.030
I have 'scaped by miracle.

1030
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:29.000
I am eight times thrust through the doublet,

1031
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.070
four through the hose,

1032
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.970
my buckler cut through and through,

1033
00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.670
my sword hacked like a hand-saw.

1034
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.530
Ecce signum.

1035
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:37.730
I never dealt better since I was a man.

1036
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.530
All would not do.

1037
00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:40.630
A plague of all cowards.

1038
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:41.830
Let them speak.

1039
00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.500
If they speak more or less than truth,

1040
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.430
they are villains and the sons of darkness.

1041
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.300
Speak, sirs. How was it?

1042
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.200
We three set up some dozen--

1043
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.330
Sixteen at least, my lord, and bound them.

1044
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.600
No, no, they were not bound.

1045
00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.230
They were bound, every one of them,

1046
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.100
or I'm a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.

1047
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.270
As we were sharing,

1048
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.230
some six or seven fresh men set upon us--

1049
00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.530
And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.

1050
00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.570
What, fought you with them all?

1051
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:04.600
All?

1052
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.530
I know not what you call "all."

1053
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.300
But if I fought not with fifty of them,

1054
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:12.300
then am I a bunch of radish.

1055
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.900
If there were not two or three and fifty on poor old Jack,

1056
00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.400
then am I no two-legged creature.

1057
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.330
Pray God you have not murdered some of them.

1058
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.370
Oh, no, that's past praying for.

1059
00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:21.870
I have peppered two of them.

1060
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:25.300
Two, I am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits.

1061
00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:26.670
I tell thee what, Hal.

1062
00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.530
If I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.

1063
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.800
Thou knowest my old ward.

1064
00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.400
Here I lay.

1065
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.200
Thus I bore my point.

1066
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.430
Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--

1067
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:39.300
What, four? Thou saidst but two even now.

1068
00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.530
Four, Hal.

1069
00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:43.130
I told thee four.

1070
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:45.030
Ay, ay, he said four.

1071
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:48.370
These four came all a-front and mainly thrust at me.

1072
00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.630
I made me no more ado

1073
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.530
but took all their seven points in my target, thus.

1074
00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:55.230
Seven? Why, there were but four even now.

1075
00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:56.230
In buckram?

1076
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.400
Ay, four in buckram suits.

1077
00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:58.600
Seven, by these hilts,

1078
00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.870
or I'm a villain else.

1079
00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.400
Prithee, let him alone. We shall have more anon.

1080
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.430
Dost thou hear, Hal?

1081
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:04.930
Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.

1082
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.300
Do so, for it is worth the listening to.

1083
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:09.830
These nine in buckram that I told thee of--

1084
00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:10.870
So two more already.

1085
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:12.130
Their points being broken--

1086
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.200
Down fell their hose.

1087
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.400
Began to give me ground.

1088
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.800
But I followed me close, came in foot and hand.

1089
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.030
And with a thought, seven of the eleven I paid.

1090
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:20.070
O monstrous!

1091
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:21.870
Eleven buckram men grown out of two!

1092
00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:23.670
But, as ill luck would have it,

1093
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.830
three misbegotten knaves in Kendal green

1094
00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:28.030
came at my back and let drive at me,

1095
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:29.730
for it was so dark, Hal,

1096
00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.670
thou couldst not see thy hand.

1097
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:35.100
These lies are like their father that begets them:

1098
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:38.830
gross as a mountain, open, palpable.

1099
00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:42.170
Why, thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool,

1100
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:44.630
thou whoreson, obscene, greasy tallow-catch.

1101
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:47.030
What, art thou mad? Art thou mad?

1102
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.370
Is not the truth the truth?

1103
00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:50.670
Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green

1104
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:54.830
when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand?

1105
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:57.600
Come, tell us your reason.

1106
00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:59.130
What sayest thou to this?

1107
00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:01.070
Come, your reason, Jack.

1108
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.070
Your reason.

1109
00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:04.330
What, upon compulsion?

1110
00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:07.100
'Zounds, an I were at the strappado

1111
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.470
or all the racks in the world

1112
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:10.070
I would not tell you on compulsion.

1113
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.070
Give you a reason on compulsion?

1114
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.400
If reasons were as plentiful as blackberries,

1115
00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.970
I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.

1116
00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:20.930
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin.

1117
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:24.370
This sanguine coward, this bed-presser,

1118
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:28.270
this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh--

1119
00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.900
'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin,

1120
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.570
you dried neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle,

1121
00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:35.070
you stock-fish!

1122
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.670
O for breath to utter what is like thee!

1123
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.300
You tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase,

1124
00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:42.470
you vile standing-tuck--

1125
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:49.230
Breathe awhile, and then do it again.

1126
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:52.930
And when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,

1127
00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:55.200
hear me speak but this.

1128
00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.900
Mark, Jack.

1129
00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:01.400
We two saw you three set on four

1130
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.630
and were masters of their wealth.

1131
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:06.900
Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.

1132
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:10.830
Then did we two set on you three

1133
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:14.230
and, with a word, out-faced you from your prize

1134
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:15.600
and have it.

1135
00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.930
Yea, and can show it you here in the house.

1136
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:24.200
And, Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly

1137
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.630
with as quick dexterity,

1138
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.370
and roared for mercy and still run and roared

1139
00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:32.930
as ever I heard bull-calf.

1140
00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.570
What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword

1141
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:42.530
as thou hast done and then say it was in fight.

1142
00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:48.470
What trick, what device, what starting-hole

1143
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.570
canst thou now find out to hide thee

1144
00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:53.400
from this open and apparent shame?

1145
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.030
Come, Jack.

1146
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:57.730
What trick hast thou now?

1147
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:07.330
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.

1148
00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:11.830
Why, hear you, my masters.

1149
00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:15.670
Was it for me to kill the heir-apparent?

1150
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.630
Should I turn upon the true prince?

1151
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:22.070
Why, thou knowest I'm as valiant as Hercules.

1152
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:24.600
But beware instinct.

1153
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.600
The lion will not touch the true prince.

1154
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.300
Instinct is a great matter.

1155
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:34.200
I was now a coward upon instinct.

1156
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.100
I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life:

1157
00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:40.730
I for a valiant lion, thou for a true prince.

1158
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:44.670
But, by the Lord, lads, I'm glad you have the money.

1159
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:47.570
Hostess, clap to the doors!

1160
00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:50.200
Watch today. Pray to-morrow.

1161
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:51.930
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold,

1162
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:54.100
all the titles of good fellowship come to you.

1163
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.300
What, shall we be merry?

1164
00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.270
Shall we have a play extempore?

1165
00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:00.600
Content, and the argument shall be thy running away.

1166
00:54:02.330 --> 00:54:04.400
No more of that, an thou lovest me!

1167
00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.470
My lord the prince!

1168
00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:06.930
How now, my lady the hostess.

1169
00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:08.230
What sayest thou to me?

1170
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:10.430
Marry, my lord, a nobleman of the court is at door,

1171
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:11.470
would speak with you.

1172
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:12.970
He says he comes from your father.

1173
00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:14.900
Give him as much as will make him a royal man,

1174
00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.530
and send him back again to my mother.

1175
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:18.200
-What manner of man is he? -An old man.

1176
00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.170
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight?

1177
00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:21.430
Shall I give him,his answer?

1178
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:22.530
Prithee, do, Jack.

1179
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.100
'Faith, and I'll send him packing.

1180
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.930
Now, sirs, by our lady, you fought fair, Peto.

1181
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.700
So did you, Bardolph.

1182
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.130
You are lions too.

1183
00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:35.130
You ran away upon instinct, would not touch the true prince.

1184
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:36.200
No, fie!

1185
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.130
I ran when I saw others run.

1186
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:40.670
'Faith, tell me now in earnest,

1187
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.730
how came Falstaff's sword so hacked?

1188
00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:44.230
Why, he hacked it with his dagger

1189
00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:46.100
and said he would swear truth out of England

1190
00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.230
but he would make you believe it was done in fight

1191
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:49.800
and persuaded us to do the like.

1192
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.070
Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass

1193
00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:53.600
to make them bleed

1194
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.570
and then to beslubber our garments with it

1195
00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.030
and swear it was the blood of true men.

1196
00:54:58.030 --> 00:55:02.830
I did what I did not this seven year before.

1197
00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:07.570
I blushed to hear his monstrous devices.

1198
00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.230
Villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago

1199
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:11.600
and wert taken with the manner,

1200
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.630
and ever since, thou hast blushed extempore.

1201
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:17.400
Here comes lean Jack. Here comes bare-bone.

1202
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.670
How now, my sweet creature of bombast!

1203
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:22.330
How long is't ago, Jack,

1204
00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:25.670
since thou saw thine own knee?

1205
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:27.170
My own knee?

1206
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:29.170
When I was about thy years, Hal,

1207
00:55:29.170 --> 00:55:32.070
I was not an eagle's talon in the waist.

1208
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:36.200
I could have crept into any alderman's thumb-ring.

1209
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.600
A plague of sighing and grief;

1210
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.800
it blows a man up like a bladder.

1211
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.530
Now, shush, shush, shush.

1212
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:44.000
There's villainous news abroad.

1213
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.830
Here was Sir John Bracy from your father.

1214
00:55:45.830 --> 00:55:47.470
You must to the court in the morning.

1215
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.100
That same mad fellow of the north, Percy,

1216
00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:53.430
and he of Wales that gave Amamon the bastinado

1217
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:56.830
and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the devil

1218
00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:59.030
his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook--

1219
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:00.230
what a plague call you him?

1220
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:01.300
Oh, Glendower.

1221
00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.170
Owen, Owen, the same.

1222
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:05.500
And his son-in-law Mortimer and old Northumberland

1223
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.530
and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas,

1224
00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.400
he that runs o' horseback up a hill perpendicular--

1225
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.800
He that rides at high speed

1226
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.730
and with his pistol kills,a sparrow flying.

1227
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:15.730
You've hit it.

1228
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.270
So did he never the sparrow.

1229
00:56:17.270 --> 00:56:19.130
Well, there's good mettle in that fellow.

1230
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:20.470
He will not run.

1231
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:21.930
Why, what a rascal art thou then

1232
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:23.530
to praise him so for running.

1233
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.670
O' horseback, ye cuckoo.

1234
00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:26.530
But afoot, he will not budge a foot.

1235
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.300
Yes, Jack, upon instinct.

1236
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.430
Well, I grant ye, upon instinct.

1237
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:32.570
Well, he is there too and one Mordake

1238
00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:34.330
and a thousand blue-caps more.

1239
00:56:34.330 --> 00:56:36.400
Worcester is stolen away tonight.

1240
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.100
Your father's beard is turned white at the news.

1241
00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.700
You may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.

1242
00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:47.770
Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June,

1243
00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:50.100
we shall buy maidenheads as they buy hob-nails:

1244
00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.500
by the hundreds.

1245
00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.400
Oh, by the mass, thou sayest true, lad.

1246
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.430
It is like we shall have good trading that way.

1247
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:59.070
But tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard?

1248
00:56:59.070 --> 00:57:01.670
Thou being heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out

1249
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:03.930
three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas,

1250
00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:07.700
that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower?

1251
00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:10.300
Art thou not horribly afraid?

1252
00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:12.500
Doth not thy blood thrill at it?

1253
00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.900
Not a whit, i' faith.

1254
00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.000
I lack some of thy instinct.

1255
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow

1256
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.600
when thou comest to thy father.

1257
00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.200
An thou love me, practice an answer.

1258
00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.270
Do thou stand for my father

1259
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:31.230
and examine me upon the particulars of my life.

1260
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:33.630
Oh, uh, shall I?

1261
00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.400
Yes!

1262
00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.530
Content.

1263
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:38.130
Come on, come on, come on.

1264
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:42.370
This chair shall be my state, this dagger my scepter,

1265
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:45.630
and this cushion my crown.

1266
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:50.470
Give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red,

1267
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:51.970
that it may be thought I have wept.

1268
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:54.730
Stand aside, nobility.

1269
00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:58.330
O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!

1270
00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:02.530
Weep not, sweet queen...

1271
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.730
for trickling tears are vain.

1272
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.270
O, the father, see how he holds his countenance!

1273
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:13.630
For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen.

1274
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.870
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.

1275
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:18.830
O Jesu, he doth it as like one

1276
00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:21.530
of these harlotry players as ever I see.

1277
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:24.000
Peace, good pint-pot.

1278
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.330
Peace, good tickle-brain.

1279
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:29.070
Harry.

1280
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.330
Ah, yea.

1281
00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:34.200
I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time

1282
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.930
but also how thou art accompanied.

1283
00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:40.470
There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of,

1284
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:43.770
and it is known to many in this land by the name of pitch.

1285
00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:47.600
This pitch, as ancient writers do report,

1286
00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.470
doth defile.

1287
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:52.730
So doth the company thou keepest.

1288
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:56.700
Harry, I do not speak to thee in drink but in tears,

1289
00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.470
not in pleasure but in passion,

1290
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:04.330
not in words only but in woes also.

1291
00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:08.700
And yet there is a virtuous man

1292
00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.600
whom I have often noted in thy company,

1293
00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:14.130
but I know not his name.

1294
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:17.530
What manner of man, an it like your majesty?

1295
00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:21.100
A goodly, portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent,

1296
00:59:21.100 --> 00:59:23.030
of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye,

1297
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:25.770
and a most noble carriage.

1298
00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:31.800
And, as I think, his age some fifty,

1299
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:37.700
or, by'r lady, inclining to three score.

1300
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:43.500
And now I remember me; his name is...

1301
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.300
Falstaff.

1302
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:52.130
If that man should be lewdly given,

1303
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:53.330
he deceiveth me,

1304
00:59:53.330 --> 00:59:55.300
for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks.

1305
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.570
If then the tree shall be known by the fruit,

1306
00:59:57.570 --> 01:00:00.200
as the fruit by the tree, then, peremptorily I speak it,

1307
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.100
there is virtue in that Falstaff.

1308
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:07.070
Him, keep with. The rest, banish.

1309
01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:11.170
And now tell me, thou naughty varlet,

1310
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.430
tell me, where hast thou been this month?

1311
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.470
Dost thou speak like a king?

1312
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:18.100
Do thou stand for me, and I'll play my father.

1313
01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.130
What?

1314
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:20.770
Depose me?

1315
01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:22.300
Yea!

1316
01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:26.530
If thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically,

1317
01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:28.570
both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels

1318
01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.900
for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.

1319
01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.030
Here I am set.

1320
01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.300
And here I stand. Now judge, my masters.

1321
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.670
Now, Harry, whence come you?

1322
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.270
My noble lord, from Eastcheap.

1323
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:41.330
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.

1324
01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:44.730
'Sblood, my lord, they're false.

1325
01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:47.970
Nay, I'll tickle ye for a young prince, i' faith.

1326
01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:50.070
Swearest thou, ungracious boy?

1327
01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:51.670
Henceforth, ne'er look on me.

1328
01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:54.130
Thou art violently carried away from grace.

1329
01:00:54.130 --> 01:00:56.430
There is a devil haunts thee

1330
01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:01.870
in the likeness of an old, fat man.

1331
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:05.070
A tun of man is thy companion.

1332
01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:07.770
Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humors,

1333
01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:10.500
that bolting-hutch of beastliness,

1334
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:16.300
that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack,

1335
01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.300
that stuffed cloak-bag of guts,

1336
01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:22.730
that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly,

1337
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:25.930
that reverend vice, that gray iniquity,

1338
01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:29.470
that father ruffian, that vanity in years?

1339
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:32.970
Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it?

1340
01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:37.270
Wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it?

1341
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:40.370
Wherein cunning, but in craft?

1342
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:42.700
Wherein crafty, but in villainy?

1343
01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:46.430
Wherein villainous, but in all things?

1344
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:52.700
Wherein worthy, but in nothing?

1345
01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:59.170
I would your grace would take me with you.

1346
01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:00.670
Whom means your grace?

1347
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:04.330
That villainous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff,

1348
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.670
that old, white-bearded Satan.

1349
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:11.830
Well, my lord, the man, I know.

1350
01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.670
I know thou dost.

1351
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:17.330
But to say that I know more harm in him than in myself

1352
01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:19.570
were to say more than I know.

1353
01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:23.030
That he is old, the more the pity,

1354
01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.330
his white hairs do witness it.

1355
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:26.070
But that he is, saving your reverence,

1356
01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:29.170
a whoremaster, that, I utterly deny.

1357
01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:32.470
If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked.

1358
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.430
If to be old and merry be a sin,

1359
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:38.670
then many an old host that I know is damned.

1360
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:40.700
If to be fat be to be hated,

1361
01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.770
then Pharaoh's lean kine are to be loved.

1362
01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:46.530
No, my good lord.

1363
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.000
Banish Peto.

1364
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.030
Banish Bardolph.

1365
01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:50.300
Banish Poins.

1366
01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:55.870
But for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff,

1367
01:02:55.870 --> 01:02:59.900
true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff,

1368
01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:02.800
and therefore more valiant, being, as he is,

1369
01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:05.030
old Jack Falstaff,

1370
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:08.370
banish not him thy Harry's company.

1371
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:11.330
Banish not him thy Harry's company.

1372
01:03:11.330 --> 01:03:15.400
Banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

1373
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:22.300
I do.

1374
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:23.300
I will.

1375
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.230
My lord! My lord!

1376
01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:29.600
The sheriff, with a most monstrous watch,

1377
01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:30.600
is at the door.

1378
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.600
Out, ye rogue!

1379
01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.870
Play out the play.

1380
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:35.400
I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

1381
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.670
O Jesu, my lord, my lord.

1382
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:39.500
Heigh, the devil rides on a fiddlestick.

1383
01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:40.700
What's the matter?

1384
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.070
The sheriff and all the watch are at the door.

1385
01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:45.730
They are come to search the house.

1386
01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:48.630
Shall I let them in?

1387
01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:54.530
Dost thou hear, Hal?

1388
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:58.270
Never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit.

1389
01:03:58.270 --> 01:04:02.170
Thou art essentially mad, without seeming so.

1390
01:04:02.170 --> 01:04:05.830
And thou a natural coward without instinct.

1391
01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:07.800
I deny your major.

1392
01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.030
If you will deny the sheriff, so.

1393
01:04:10.030 --> 01:04:12.270
If not, let him enter.

1394
01:04:12.270 --> 01:04:15.230
If I become not a cart as well as another man,

1395
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:18.670
a plague upon my bringing up.

1396
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:22.400
I hope I shall be as soon strangled with a halter as another.

1397
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.600
Go hide thee behind the arras.

1398
01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.730
The rest walk up above.

1399
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:37.600
Now, my masters, for a good face and a true conscience.

1400
01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.430
Both which I have had, but their date is out,

1401
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:42.670
and therefore I'll hide me.

1402
01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:50.270
Call in the sheriff.

1403
01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:01.800
Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?

1404
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:03.300
First, pardon me, my lord.

1405
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.470
A hue and cry hath follow'd several men unto this house.

1406
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:07.700
What men?

1407
01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.630
One of them is well known, my gracious lord,

1408
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:11.430
a gross, fat man.

1409
01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:13.100
As fat as butter.

1410
01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.370
The man, I do assure you, is not here,

1411
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:17.370
for I myself at this time have employ'd him.

1412
01:05:17.370 --> 01:05:19.970
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee

1413
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:21.900
that I will, by dinnertime tomorrow,

1414
01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.530
send him to answer thee, or any man,

1415
01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:25.630
for any thing he shall be charged withal.

1416
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.270
And so let me entreat you leave the house.

1417
01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:29.930
I will, my lord.

1418
01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:32.470
There are two gentlemen

1419
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:34.670
have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.

1420
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.630
It may be so.

1421
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:39.170
If he have robb'd these men, he shall be answerable.

1422
01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:41.100
And so farewell.

1423
01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.670
Good night, my noble lord.

1424
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:45.800
I think it is good morrow, is it not?

1425
01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.770
Indeed, my lord, methinks it be two o'clock.

1426
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.670
This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's.

1427
01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:00.370
Go, call him forth.

1428
01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:06.670
Falstaff!

1429
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.430
Behind the arras, and snorting like a horse.

1430
01:06:16.700 --> 01:06:19.330
Hark, how hard he fetches breath.

1431
01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.270
Search his pockets.

1432
01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.030
What hast thou found?

1433
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:35.870
Nothing but papers, my lord.

1434
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:38.100
Let's see what they be. Read them.

1435
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:41.230
"Item, a capon, 2s2d.

1436
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.170
"Item, sauce, 4d.

1437
01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:46.930
"Item, sack, two gallons, 5s8d.

1438
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:52.030
"Item, anchovies and sack after supper, 2s6d.

1439
01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:54.800
Item, bread, ha'penny."

1440
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.370
Oh, monstrous.

1441
01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:58.070
But one ha'penny-worth of bread

1442
01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:01.770
to this intolerable deal of sack.

1443
01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:03.130
What there is else, keep close.

1444
01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:04.630
We'll read it at more advantage.

1445
01:07:04.630 --> 01:07:08.530
There let him sleep till day.

1446
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:11.530
I'll to the court in the morning.

1447
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:13.630
We must all to the wars,

1448
01:07:13.630 --> 01:07:18.000
and thy place shall be honorable.

1449
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.570
I'll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot.

1450
01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:23.770
And I know his death will be a march of twelve-score.

1451
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:28.400
The money shall be paid back again with advantage.

1452
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.070
Be with me betimes in the morning.

1453
01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:33.430
And so good morrow, Ned.

1454
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:36.130
Good morrow, good my lord.

1455
01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.670
These promises are fair, the parties sure,

1456
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.930
and our induction full of prosperous hope.

1457
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:58.800
Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower,

1458
01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.400
will you sit down?

1459
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.670
And uncle Worcester.

1460
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:04.200
A plague upon it.

1461
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.870
I have forgot the map.

1462
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:07.400
No, here it is.

1463
01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.270
Sit, cousin Percy.

1464
01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:12.500
Sit, good cousin Hotspur.

1465
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.830
For by that name as oft as Lancaster doth speak of you,

1466
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:16.100
his cheek looks pale,

1467
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.530
and with a rising sigh, he wisheth you in heaven.

1468
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:19.630
And you in hell

1469
01:08:19.630 --> 01:08:21.530
as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.

1470
01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:23.300
I cannot blame him.

1471
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.070
At my nativity, the front of heaven

1472
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:27.300
was full of fiery shapes, of burning cressets.

1473
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.570
And at my birth, the frame and huge foundation

1474
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:31.570
of the earth shaked like a coward.

1475
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.530
Why, so it would have done at the same season

1476
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:35.270
if your mother's cat had but kittened,

1477
01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:36.930
though yourself had never been born.

1478
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:39.400
I say the earth did shake when I was born.

1479
01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.370
And I say the earth was not of my mind,

1480
01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:44.430
if you suppose as fearing you it shook.

1481
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.670
The heavens were all on fire. The earth did tremble.

1482
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:49.270
Oh, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire

1483
01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:50.730
and not in fear of your nativity.

1484
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:55.170
Cousin, of many men I do not bear these crossings.

1485
01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:56.730
Give me leave to tell you once again

1486
01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:57.870
that at my birth,

1487
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:59.830
the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes.

1488
01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:01.400
The goats ran from the mountains,

1489
01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.170
and the herds were strangely clamorous

1490
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:04.570
to the frighted fields.

1491
01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:06.430
These signs have mark'd me extraordinary!

1492
01:09:06.430 --> 01:09:09.000
I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.

1493
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.630
I'll to dinner.

1494
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:12.230
Peace, cousin Percy.

1495
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.430
You will make him mad.

1496
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:16.030
I can call spirits from the vasty deep!

1497
01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:17.900
Why, so can I, or so can any man.

1498
01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.470
But will they come when you do call for them?

1499
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:22.700
Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the devil.

1500
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:24.630
And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil

1501
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:25.630
by telling truth.

1502
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:28.600
Tell truth and shame the devil.

1503
01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.000
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,

1504
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.530
and I'll be sworn I have the power to shame him hence.

1505
01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:37.400
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!

1506
01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.300
Come, come; no more of this unprofitable chat.

1507
01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.930
Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke

1508
01:09:41.930 --> 01:09:43.400
made head against my power.

1509
01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:46.030
Thrice from the banks of Wye and sandy-bottom'd Severn

1510
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:48.470
have I sent him bootless home and weather-beaten back.

1511
01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:52.430
Home without boots, and in foul weather too.

1512
01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:55.200
How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?

1513
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.500
Come! Here is the map.

1514
01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.670
Shall we divide our right

1515
01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:01.900
according to our threefold order ta'en?

1516
01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:06.870
The archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally:

1517
01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:10.400
England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,

1518
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.000
by south and east is to my part assign'd.

1519
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.870
All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore

1520
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:18.000
and all the fertile lands within that bound,

1521
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
to Owen Glendower.

1522
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.170
And, dear coz, to you

1523
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:24.570
the remnant northward, lying off from Trent.

1524
01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:27.170
And our indentures tripartite are drawn,

1525
01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:29.100
which being sealed interchangeably,

1526
01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.130
a business that this night may execute,

1527
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:33.970
tomorrow, cousin Percy, you and I

1528
01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.530
and my good Lord of Worcester will set forth

1529
01:10:36.530 --> 01:10:38.470
to meet your father and the Scottish power,

1530
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:40.670
as is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.

1531
01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:45.530
My father Glendower is not ready yet,

1532
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:48.470
nor shall we need his help these fourteen days.

1533
01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:50.570
Within that space, you may have drawn together

1534
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.870
your tenants, friends, and neighboring gentlemen.

1535
01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:59.300
Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,

1536
01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.430
in quantity equals not one of yours.

1537
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:04.770
See how this river comes me cranking in

1538
01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:06.430
and cuts me from the best of all my land

1539
01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:08.800
a huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.

1540
01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:11.570
I'll have the current in this place damm'd up.

1541
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:13.170
And here the smug and silver Trent

1542
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.200
shall run in a new channel, fair and evenly.

1543
01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.170
It shall not wind with such a deep indent

1544
01:11:17.170 --> 01:11:18.770
to rob me of so rich a bottom here.

1545
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:20.270
Not wind?

1546
01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:21.970
It shall. It must.

1547
01:11:21.970 --> 01:11:24.030
You see it doth.

1548
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.900
Yea, but mark how he bears his course

1549
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.400
and runs me up with like advantage

1550
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.900
on the other side,

1551
01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.500
gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other side,

1552
01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.630
it takes from you.

1553
01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:35.600
Yea, but a little charge will trench him here

1554
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.530
and on this north side win this cape of land.

1555
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:40.000
And then he runs straight and even.

1556
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.400
I'll have it so.

1557
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.730
A little charge will do it.

1558
01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:46.530
I'll not have it alter'd.

1559
01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:49.730
Will not you?

1560
01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:51.130
No, nor you shall not.

1561
01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:52.430
Who shall say me nay?

1562
01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:54.500
Why, that will I.

1563
01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.000
Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.

1564
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.870
I can speak English, lord, as well as you,

1565
01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:01.830
for I was train'd up in the English court,

1566
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:03.970
where, being but young, I framed to the harp

1567
01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:05.670
many an English ditty lovely well

1568
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.530
and gave the tongue a helpful ornament,

1569
01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:09.530
a virtue that was never seen in you.

1570
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:11.730
Marry, and I'm glad of it with all my heart.

1571
01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:13.530
I'd rather be a kitten and cry mew

1572
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:15.800
than one of these same meter ballad-mongers.

1573
01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:17.630
I'd rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd

1574
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:19.930
or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree.

1575
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:21.170
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,

1576
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.970
nothing so much as mincing poetry.

1577
01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:26.370
'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.

1578
01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:29.370
Come; you shall have Trent turn'd.

1579
01:12:33.130 --> 01:12:35.600
I do not care.

1580
01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.770
I'll give thrice so much land to any well-deserving friend.

1581
01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.830
But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,

1582
01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:44.800
I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.

1583
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:45.930
Are the indentures drawn?

1584
01:12:45.930 --> 01:12:46.930
Shall we be gone?

1585
01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:48.070
The moon shines fair.

1586
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:49.470
You may away by night.

1587
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:52.130
I'll haste the writer and withal break with your wives

1588
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:53.730
of your departure hence.

1589
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.100
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,

1590
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:59.500
so much she doteth on her Mortimer.

1591
01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:04.270
Fie, cousin Percy.

1592
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:06.400
How you cross my father.

1593
01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.700
I cannot choose.

1594
01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.270
Sometimes he angers me

1595
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:14.270
with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant

1596
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:16.700
and such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff

1597
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.070
as puts me from my faith.

1598
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:19.700
I tell you what; he held me last night

1599
01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.330
at least nine hours in reckoning up

1600
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.570
the several devils' names that were his lackeys.

1601
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:25.670
I cried "hum" and "well, go to"

1602
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:27.630
and mark'd him not a word.

1603
01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:29.970
Oh, he's as tedious as a tired horse,

1604
01:13:29.970 --> 01:13:33.130
a railing wife, worse than a smoky house.

1605
01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:35.930
I'd rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,

1606
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:37.700
than feed on cates and have him talk to me

1607
01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:39.370
in any summer-house in Christendom.

1608
01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:41.530
In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,

1609
01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:43.470
exceedingly well read

1610
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.630
and profited in strange concealments,

1611
01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:48.430
valiant as a lion, and wondrous affable

1612
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:51.730
and bountiful as mines of India.

1613
01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:54.100
Shall I tell you, cousin?

1614
01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.230
He holds your temper in a high respect

1615
01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:58.200
and curbs himself even of his natural scope

1616
01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.670
when you come 'cross his humor.

1617
01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:01.300
Faith, he does.

1618
01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:03.130
I warrant you, that man is not alive

1619
01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:04.970
might so have tempted him as you have done

1620
01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:07.730
without the taste of danger and reproof.

1621
01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:11.470
But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.

1622
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:14.230
In faith, my lord, you are too willful-blame

1623
01:14:14.230 --> 01:14:15.530
and, since your coming hither, have done enough

1624
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:17.200
to put him quite beside his patience.

1625
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.400
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault.

1626
01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.400
Well, I am school'd.

1627
01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:23.600
Good manners be your speed.

1628
01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.230
Here come our wives.

1629
01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:27.800
Let us take our leave.

1630
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.200
This is the deadly spite that angers me.

1631
01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:34.400
My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.

1632
01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.770
My daughter weeps.

1633
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.170
She'll not part with you.

1634
01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:38.270
She'll be a soldier too.

1635
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:39.530
She'll to the wars.

1636
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:44.200
Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy

1637
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.400
shall follow in your conduct speedily.

1638
01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:17.600
She is desperate here--

1639
01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.400
a peevish self-willed harlotry,

1640
01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.170
one that no persuasion can do good upon.

1641
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:33.430
I understand thy looks.

1642
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:35.670
That pretty Welsh which thou pour'st down

1643
01:15:35.670 --> 01:15:38.730
from these swelling heavens I am too perfect in.

1644
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:40.330
And, but for shame,

1645
01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:43.300
in such a parley should I answer thee.

1646
01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.430
I understand thy kisses and thou mine,

1647
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:08.070
and that's a feeling disputation.

1648
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:10.870
But I will never be a truant, love,

1649
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:13.470
till I have learned thy language,

1650
01:16:13.470 --> 01:16:16.400
for thy tongue makes Welsh as sweet

1651
01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.300
as ditties highly penn'd,

1652
01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:20.930
sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,

1653
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:23.670
with ravishing division, to her lute.

1654
01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:27.600
Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.

1655
01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:51.570
Oh, I am ignorance itself in this!

1656
01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:54.530
She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down

1657
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:56.430
and rest your gentle head upon her lap,

1658
01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:58.700
and she will sing the song that pleaseth you

1659
01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:01.400
and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,

1660
01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.570
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,

1661
01:17:03.570 --> 01:17:05.800
making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep

1662
01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.730
as is the difference betwixt day and night

1663
01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:09.770
the hour before the heavenly-harness'd team

1664
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:12.630
begins his golden progress in the east.

1665
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:15.470
With all my heart, I'll sit and hear her sing.

1666
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:19.630
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.

1667
01:17:19.630 --> 01:17:21.170
Do so.

1668
01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.400
And those musicians that shall play to you

1669
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.330
hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,

1670
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:29.000
and straight they shall be here.

1671
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.030
Sit, and attend.

1672
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:33.630
Come, Kate.

1673
01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:35.230
Thou art perfect in lying down.

1674
01:17:35.230 --> 01:17:38.200
Quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.

1675
01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:41.370
Oh, go, ye giddy goose.

1676
01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.500
Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh.

1677
01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.000
And 'tis no marvel he's so humorous.

1678
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000
By'r lady,,he is a good musician.

1679
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.200
Yes.

1680
01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.630
Then should you be nothing but musical,

1681
01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:01.300
for you are altogether governed by humors.

1682
01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.930
Lie still, ye thief,

1683
01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:06.270
and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

1684
01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:09.470
I had rather hear, lady, my brach, howl in Irish.

1685
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:12.300
Oh, wouldst thou have thy head broken?

1686
01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.000
-No. -Then be still.

1687
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Neither. 'Tis a woman's fault.

1688
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.270
Now God help thee.

1689
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:19.300
To the Welsh lady's bed.

1690
01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.730
What's that?

1691
01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:23.300
Peace, she sings.

1692
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:36.030
Come, Kate. I'll have your song too.

1693
01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:38.700
Not mine, in good sooth.

1694
01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:40.230
Not yours, in good sooth?

1695
01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:42.830
Heart, you swear like a comfit-maker's wife.

1696
01:19:42.830 --> 01:19:47.300
"Not you, in good sooth," and "as sure as I live"

1697
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:49.700
and "as God shall mend me," and "as sure as day"

1698
01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:53.770
and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths

1699
01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:56.070
as if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.

1700
01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.770
Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,

1701
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:04.670
a good mouth-filling oath, and leave "in sooth"

1702
01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:07.200
and such protest of pepper-gingerbread

1703
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.570
to velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.

1704
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:27.830
Come, sing.

1705
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:30.900
I will not sing.

1706
01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.300
'Tis the next way to turn tailor

1707
01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.270
or be red-breast teacher.

1708
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:36.570
An the indentures be drawn,

1709
01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:38.770
I'll away within these two hours.

1710
01:20:38.770 --> 01:20:41.100
And so come in when ye will.

1711
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:43.770
Come, come, Lord Mortimer.

1712
01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:46.500
You are as slow as hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.

1713
01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:47.800
By this our book is drawn.

1714
01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.300
We'll but seal, and then to horse immediately.

1715
01:20:50.300 --> 01:20:53.100
With all my heart.

1716
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:13.100
I know not whether God will have it so,

1717
01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:16.570
for some displeasing service I have done,

1718
01:21:16.570 --> 01:21:21.170
that, in his secret doom, out of my blood

1719
01:21:21.170 --> 01:21:25.370
he'll breed revengement and a scourge for me.

1720
01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:29.270
But thou dost in thy passages of life

1721
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:32.630
make me believe that thou art only mark'd

1722
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:35.030
for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven

1723
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:37.970
to punish my mistreadings.

1724
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:39.930
Tell me else,

1725
01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:44.300
could such inordinate and low desires,

1726
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:51.000
such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,

1727
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.530
such barren pleasures, rude society

1728
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:58.270
as thou art match'd withal and grafted to

1729
01:21:58.270 --> 01:22:00.870
accompany the greatness of thy blood

1730
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:03.900
and hold their level with thy princely heart?

1731
01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.770
So please your majesty, I would I could quit

1732
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:08.670
all offenses with as clear excuse

1733
01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:11.370
as well as I am doubtless I can purge myself

1734
01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:14.070
of many I am charged withal.

1735
01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:16.570
God pardon thee.

1736
01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:21.200
Yet let me wonder, Harry, at thy affections,

1737
01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.700
which do hold a wing quite from the flight

1738
01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:26.400
of all thy ancestors.

1739
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:31.500
Thy place in council, thou hast rudely lost

1740
01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.530
which by thy younger brother is supplied

1741
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:37.830
and art almost an alien to the hearts

1742
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:41.570
of all the court and princes of my blood.

1743
01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:45.630
The hope and expectation of thy time is ruin'd,

1744
01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:47.930
and the soul of every man

1745
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:50.570
prophetically do forethink thy fall.

1746
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:59.370
Had I so lavish of my presence been,

1747
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:02.900
so common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,

1748
01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:06.330
so stale and cheap to vulgar company,

1749
01:23:06.330 --> 01:23:10.270
opinion, that did help me to the crown,

1750
01:23:10.270 --> 01:23:12.630
had still kept loyal to possession

1751
01:23:12.630 --> 01:23:16.200
and left me in reputeless banishment,

1752
01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:20.670
a fellow of no mark nor likelihood.

1753
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:27.270
By being seldom seen, I could not stir

1754
01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:30.430
but like a comet I was wonder'd at,

1755
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:34.770
that men would tell their children, "This is he."

1756
01:23:34.770 --> 01:23:39.970
Others would say, "Where? Which is Bolingbroke?"

1757
01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:44.370
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven

1758
01:23:44.370 --> 01:23:48.270
and dress'd myself in such humility

1759
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:51.730
that I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,

1760
01:23:51.730 --> 01:23:55.400
loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,

1761
01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:58.930
even in the presence of the crowned king.

1762
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.630
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new.

1763
01:24:05.630 --> 01:24:09.830
My presence, like a robe pontifical,

1764
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:12.500
ne'er seen but wonder'd at.

1765
01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:18.330
And so my state, seldom but sumptuous,

1766
01:24:18.330 --> 01:24:23.800
showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity.

1767
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.330
The skipping king, he ambled up and down

1768
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:36.270
with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,

1769
01:24:36.270 --> 01:24:39.130
soon kindled and soon burnt.

1770
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:41.800
Carded his state,

1771
01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.030
mingled his royalty with capering fools,

1772
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:50.030
had his great name profaned with their scorns,

1773
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:53.430
and gave his countenance, against his name,

1774
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:56.900
to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push

1775
01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:00.700
of every beardless vain comparative,

1776
01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:05.800
grew a companion to the common streets,

1777
01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:08.830
enfeoff'd himself to popularity

1778
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:12.930
that, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,

1779
01:25:12.930 --> 01:25:16.670
they surfeited with honey and began to loathe

1780
01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:20.170
the taste of sweetness,

1781
01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:22.630
whereof a little more than a little

1782
01:25:22.630 --> 01:25:25.530
is by much too much.

1783
01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:30.000
So when he had occasion to be seen,

1784
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.570
he was but as the cuckoo is in June:

1785
01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:38.630
heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes

1786
01:25:38.630 --> 01:25:42.400
as, sick and blunted with community,

1787
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.770
afford no extraordinary gaze,

1788
01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:47.330
such as is bent on sun-like majesty

1789
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:50.970
when it shines seldom in admiring eyes,

1790
01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:56.500
but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,

1791
01:25:56.500 --> 01:26:01.770
slept in his face, and render'd such aspect

1792
01:26:01.770 --> 01:26:04.400
as cloudy men use to their adversaries,

1793
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:09.230
being with his presence glutted, gorged, and full.

1794
01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:16.000
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou,

1795
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.970
for thou has lost thy princely privilege

1796
01:26:18.970 --> 01:26:21.900
with vile participation.

1797
01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:28.630
Not an eye But is a-weary of thy common sight, save mine,

1798
01:26:28.630 --> 01:26:32.400
which hath desired to see thee more,

1799
01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.070
which now doth that I would not have it do:

1800
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:39.830
make blind itself with foolish tenderness.

1801
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:43.730
I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,

1802
01:26:43.730 --> 01:26:46.100
be more myself.

1803
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.400
For all the world as thou art to this hour

1804
01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.770
was Richard then,

1805
01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:54.430
when I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh.

1806
01:26:54.430 --> 01:27:01.000
And even as I was then is Percy now.

1807
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.230
Now, by my scepter and my soul to boot,

1808
01:27:05.230 --> 01:27:08.500
he hath more worthy interest to the state

1809
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.000
than thou the shadow of succession,

1810
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:15.530
for of no right, nor color like to right,

1811
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:19.230
he doth fill fields with harness in the realm,

1812
01:27:19.230 --> 01:27:22.470
turns head against the lion's armed jaws,

1813
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:26.530
and, being no more in debt to years than thou,

1814
01:27:26.530 --> 01:27:29.830
leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on

1815
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:33.470
to bloody battles and to bruising arms.

1816
01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:38.330
What never-dying honor hath he got

1817
01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:41.830
against renowned Douglas, whose high deeds,

1818
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:45.870
whose hot incursions and great name in arms

1819
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:49.500
holds from all soldiers chief majority

1820
01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.570
and military title capital

1821
01:27:51.570 --> 01:27:55.300
through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ.

1822
01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:00.830
And what say you to this?

1823
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:07.730
Percy, Northumberland, the Archbishop's grace of York,

1824
01:28:07.730 --> 01:28:10.500
Douglas, Mortimer,

1825
01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.770
capitulate against us and are up.

1826
01:28:13.770 --> 01:28:18.430
But wherefore do I tell thee of those news?

1827
01:28:18.430 --> 01:28:22.800
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,

1828
01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:26.730
which art my near'st and dearest enemy?

1829
01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:31.030
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,

1830
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:34.230
base inclination, and the start of spleen

1831
01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:37.500
to fight against me under Percy's pay,

1832
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.130
to dog his heelsand curtsy at his frowns,

1833
01:28:41.130 --> 01:28:43.870
to show how much thou art degenerate!

1834
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:46.170
Do not think so.

1835
01:28:46.170 --> 01:28:48.930
You shall not find it so.

1836
01:28:48.930 --> 01:28:51.330
And God forgive them that so much have sway'd

1837
01:28:51.330 --> 01:28:54.000
your majesty's good thoughts away from me.

1838
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.900
I will redeem all this on Percy's head

1839
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:59.500
and, in the closing of some glorious day,

1840
01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.200
be bold to tell you that I am your son,

1841
01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.070
when I will wear a garment all of blood

1842
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:08.200
and stain my favors in a bloody mask,

1843
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.400
which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it.

1844
01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.870
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,

1845
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:18.100
that this same child of honor and renown,

1846
01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.930
this gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight

1847
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:26.330
and your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.

1848
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:28.100
For every honor sitting on his helm,

1849
01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:30.430
would they were multitudes

1850
01:29:30.430 --> 01:29:33.600
and on my head my shames redoubled.

1851
01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.730
For the time will come

1852
01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:36.570
that I shall make this northern youth

1853
01:29:36.570 --> 01:29:40.000
exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities.

1854
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:46.070
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,

1855
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:49.170
to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf.

1856
01:29:49.170 --> 01:29:52.200
And I will call him to so strict account

1857
01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.370
that he shall render every glory up--

1858
01:29:54.370 --> 01:29:57.030
yea, even the slightest worship of his time--

1859
01:29:57.030 --> 01:30:01.930
or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.

1860
01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:06.500
This, in the name of God, I promise here,

1861
01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:09.330
the which if he be pleased, I shall perform,

1862
01:30:09.330 --> 01:30:12.900
I do beseech your majesty may salve

1863
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:17.200
the long-grown wounds of my intemperture.

1864
01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.530
If not, the end of life cancels all bands,

1865
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:26.970
and I will die a hundred thousand deaths

1866
01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:30.030
ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.

1867
01:30:35.630 --> 01:30:40.670
A hundred thousand rebels die in this,

1868
01:30:40.670 --> 01:30:47.970
thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.

1869
01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:07.930
Oh, Bardolph.

1870
01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:10.330
Huh?

1871
01:31:10.330 --> 01:31:14.100
Am I not fallen away vilely since this last action?

1872
01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:15.930
Do I not bate?

1873
01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:17.370
Do I not dwindle?

1874
01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:20.770
My skin hangs about me

1875
01:31:20.770 --> 01:31:22.430
like an like an old lady's loose gown.

1876
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:26.970
I am withered like an old apple-john.

1877
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:30.730
Well, I'll repent, and that suddenly,

1878
01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:31.930
while I'm in some liking.

1879
01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:33.370
I shall be out of heart shortly,

1880
01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:36.230
and then I shall have no strength to repent.

1881
01:31:36.230 --> 01:31:41.930
An I've not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of.

1882
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:45.130
I'm a peppercorn, a brewer's horse.

1883
01:31:45.130 --> 01:31:48.530
The inside of a church.

1884
01:31:48.530 --> 01:31:53.070
Company, villainous company, hath been the spoil of me.

1885
01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:59.300
Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.

1886
01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.700
Why, there is it.

1887
01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.330
Come sing me a bawdy song.

1888
01:32:02.330 --> 01:32:03.370
Make me merry.

1889
01:32:03.370 --> 01:32:04.370
Oh--

1890
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:05.830
Oh, no, it's--

1891
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:08.570
I've been as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be,

1892
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:09.930
virtuous enough.

1893
01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:13.700
Swore little, diced not above seven times a week,

1894
01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:17.170
went to a bawdy-house not above once in a quarter...

1895
01:32:17.170 --> 01:32:19.130
of an hour,

1896
01:32:19.130 --> 01:32:23.470
paid money that I borrowed three or four times,

1897
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:25.630
lived well and in good compass.

1898
01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:28.930
And now I live out of all order, out of all compass.

1899
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:30.870
You are so fat, Sir John,

1900
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:33.000
you must needs be out of all compass,

1901
01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.600
out of all reasonable...

1902
01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.030
compass, Sir John.

1903
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:44.800
Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life.

1904
01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:47.130
Thou art our admiral.

1905
01:32:47.130 --> 01:32:50.330
Thou bearest the lantern in the poop,

1906
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:52.770
but 'tis in the nose of thee.

1907
01:32:52.770 --> 01:32:55.930
Thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.

1908
01:32:55.930 --> 01:33:00.770
Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.

1909
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:01.870
No, I'll be sworn.

1910
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:03.600
I make as good use of it as many a man doth

1911
01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.570
of a Death's-head or a memento mori.

1912
01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:08.570
I never see thy face but I think of hell-fire

1913
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:11.830
and Dives that lived in purple,

1914
01:33:11.830 --> 01:33:16.900
for there he is in his robes, burning, burning.

1915
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:18.800
Oh, thou art a perpetual triumph,

1916
01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:20.970
an everlasting bonfire-light.

1917
01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:23.500
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks

1918
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:26.830
in links and torches, walking with thee

1919
01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:28.930
in the night betwixt tavern and tavern.

1920
01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:32.970
But the sack that thou hast drunk me

1921
01:33:32.970 --> 01:33:35.630
would have bought me lights as good cheap

1922
01:33:35.630 --> 01:33:37.670
at the dearest chandler's in Europe.

1923
01:33:37.670 --> 01:33:39.600
I have maintained that salamander of yours

1924
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.600
with fire any time this two and thirty years.

1925
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.830
God reward me for it.

1926
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:46.000
'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!

1927
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.170
God-a-mercy!

1928
01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:50.370
So should I be sure to be heart-burned.

1929
01:33:56.300 --> 01:33:58.900
How now, Dame Partlet the hen.

1930
01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:02.370
Have you inquired yet who picked my pocket?

1931
01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:04.670
Why, what do you think, Sir John?

1932
01:34:04.670 --> 01:34:07.130
Do you think I keep thieves in my house?

1933
01:34:07.130 --> 01:34:08.270
I have searched.

1934
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:09.430
I have inquired

1935
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:12.070
man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant.

1936
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:14.300
The tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.

1937
01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:15.530
Ye lie, hostess.

1938
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:17.930
Bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair.

1939
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.370
And I'll be sworn my pocket was picked.

1940
01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:22.070
Go to. You're a woman; go.

1941
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:23.070
Who, I?

1942
01:34:23.070 --> 01:34:24.170
No, I defy thee.

1943
01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:25.670
God's light, I was never called so

1944
01:34:25.670 --> 01:34:26.770
in mine own house before.

1945
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:28.500
Go to. I know you well enough.

1946
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:30.130
No, Sir John.

1947
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:32.070
You do not know me, Sir John.

1948
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:33.270
I know you, Sir John.

1949
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:35.200
You owe me money, Sir John,

1950
01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.800
and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it.

1951
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.130
I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.

1952
01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:42.270
Dowlas, filthy dowlas.

1953
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:44.030
I gave them away to bakers' wives,

1954
01:34:44.030 --> 01:34:45.600
and they have made bolters of them.

1955
01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.670
Oh!

1956
01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:48.600
Now, as I'm a true woman,

1957
01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.630
holland of eight shillings an ell.

1958
01:34:51.630 --> 01:34:53.530
You owe money here besides, Sir John,

1959
01:34:53.530 --> 01:34:56.900
for your diet and by-drinkings and money lent you,

1960
01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:58.070
four and twenty pound.

1961
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.730
He had his share of it; let him pay.

1962
01:34:59.730 --> 01:35:00.830
He?

1963
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:02.770
Alas, he's poor. He has nothing.

1964
01:35:02.770 --> 01:35:04.370
How, poor?

1965
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:07.630
Look at his face; what call you rich?

1966
01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:08.800
Let them coin his nose.

1967
01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.230
Let them coin his cheeks.

1968
01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:11.300
I'll not pay a denier.

1969
01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.170
What, will you make a younker of me?

1970
01:35:13.170 --> 01:35:14.800
Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn

1971
01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.500
but I shall have my pocket picked?

1972
01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:18.900
I have lost a seal-ring of my grandfather's

1973
01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:20.030
was worth forty mark.

1974
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:22.330
Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him,

1975
01:35:22.330 --> 01:35:25.070
I know not how oft, that that ring was copper!

1976
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:26.170
How?

1977
01:35:26.170 --> 01:35:28.230
The prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup.

1978
01:35:28.230 --> 01:35:30.630
'Sblood, an he were here, I'd cudgel him like a dog

1979
01:35:30.630 --> 01:35:32.170
if he should say so.

1980
01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:34.730
How now, lad.

1981
01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:37.230
Is the wind in that door, i' faith?

1982
01:35:37.230 --> 01:35:38.330
Must we all march?

1983
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:41.770
Ay, two and two, Newgate fashion.

1984
01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:42.900
My lord, will you hear me?

1985
01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:45.530
Let her alone, and list to me.

1986
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:46.570
What sayest thou, Jack?

1987
01:35:46.570 --> 01:35:48.170
The other night, I fell asleep here

1988
01:35:48.170 --> 01:35:50.100
behind the arras and had my pocket picked.

1989
01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:51.670
This house is turned bawdy-house.

1990
01:35:51.670 --> 01:35:52.670
They pick pockets.

1991
01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:53.870
What didst thou lose, Jack?

1992
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:55.000
Wilt thou believe it, Hal?

1993
01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.970
Three or four bonds worth forty pound apiece

1994
01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:58.700
and a seal-ring of my grandfather's.

1995
01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.430
A trifle, some eight-penny matter.

1996
01:36:00.430 --> 01:36:01.600
So I told him, my lord,

1997
01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:03.370
and I said that I heard your grace say so.

1998
01:36:03.370 --> 01:36:05.700
And, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you,

1999
01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.430
like a foul-mouthed man as he is,

2000
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:08.730
and said he would cudgel you.

2001
01:36:08.730 --> 01:36:09.770
What?

2002
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:11.230
He did not.

2003
01:36:11.230 --> 01:36:13.700
There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.

2004
01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:16.070
There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune.

2005
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:17.800
Go, you thing, go.

2006
01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:19.300
Say, what thing?

2007
01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:20.300
What thing?

2008
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.300
What thing?

2009
01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:23.270
Well, a thing to thank God on.

2010
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:25.430
Oh, I'm no thing to thank God on.

2011
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:27.830
And, setting thy knighthood aside,

2012
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:29.300
thou art a knave to say so.

2013
01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.630
Setting thy womanhood aside,

2014
01:36:30.630 --> 01:36:32.200
thou art a beast to say otherwise.

2015
01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:34.700
Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?

2016
01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:36.370
What beast? Why, an otter.

2017
01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:37.900
Oh!

2018
01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.000
An otter, Sir John?

2019
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.400
Why an otter?

2020
01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:43.170
Well, because she's neither fish nor flesh,

2021
01:36:43.170 --> 01:36:45.200
and a man knows not where to have her.

2022
01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.530
Thou art an unjust man to say so.

2023
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:52.930
Thou or any man know where to have me!

2024
01:36:52.930 --> 01:36:54.630
Thou knave, thou!

2025
01:36:54.630 --> 01:36:56.370
Thou sayest true, hostess,

2026
01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:58.400
and he slanders thee most grossly.

2027
01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.830
Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket?

2028
01:37:00.830 --> 01:37:05.230
Why, thou whoreson, impudent, embossed rascal.

2029
01:37:05.230 --> 01:37:06.870
If there were anything in thy pocket

2030
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:11.800
but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of bawdy-houses,

2031
01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:15.200
and one poor penny-worth of sugar-candy

2032
01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:18.300
to make thee long-winded, if thy pockets were enriched

2033
01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:21.800
with any other injuries but these, I am a villain.

2034
01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:26.430
You will confess then, that you picked my pocket?

2035
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:28.500
It appears so by the story.

2036
01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:29.700
Hostess, I forgive thee.

2037
01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:32.600
Go, make ready breakfast.

2038
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.630
Cherish thy servants, and look to thy guests.

2039
01:37:34.630 --> 01:37:35.830
Nay, prithee, be gone.

2040
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:37.170
Now Hal, to the news at court.

2041
01:37:37.170 --> 01:37:39.100
For the robbery, lad, how is that answered?

2042
01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:41.870
Oh, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee.

2043
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:43.830
The money is paid back again.

2044
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:45.570
Oh, I like not that paying back.

2045
01:37:45.570 --> 01:37:47.330
'Tis a double labor.

2046
01:37:47.330 --> 01:37:49.970
I'm good friends with my father and may do any thing.

2047
01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:52.100
Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest.

2048
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.230
Do, my lord.

2049
01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:56.830
I have procured thee, Jack, a charge...

2050
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:58.370
of foot.

2051
01:37:58.370 --> 01:38:00.200
-Bardolph! -My lord?

2052
01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.270
Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,

2053
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:04.570
to my brother John, this to my Lord of Westmoreland.

2054
01:38:04.570 --> 01:38:06.400
Jack, meet me tomorrow in the temple hall

2055
01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:07.870
at two o'clock in the afternoon.

2056
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:10.230
There shalt thy know thy charge,

2057
01:38:10.230 --> 01:38:13.800
and there receive money and order for their furniture.

2058
01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.700
The land is burning,

2059
01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:17.600
Percy stands on high,

2060
01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:21.170
and either we or they must lower lie.

2061
01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:30.200
Rare words.

2062
01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.030
Brave world.

2063
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:36.230
Hostess, my breakfast.

2064
01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:38.170
Come.

2065
01:38:38.170 --> 01:38:43.870
Oh, I could wish this tavern were my drum.

2066
01:38:45.630 --> 01:38:47.270
Well said, my noble Scot.

2067
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:49.000
If speaking truth in this fine age

2068
01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.230
were not thought flattery,

2069
01:38:50.230 --> 01:38:52.170
such attribution should the Douglas have,

2070
01:38:52.170 --> 01:38:53.900
as not a soldier of this season's stamp

2071
01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.000
should go so general current through the world.

2072
01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.370
By God, I cannot flatter.

2073
01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:00.500
I do defy the tongues of soothers.

2074
01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:02.230
But a braver place in my heart's love

2075
01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:03.700
hath no man than yourself.

2076
01:39:03.700 --> 01:39:05.000
Nay, task me to my word.

2077
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.270
Approve me, lord.

2078
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:10.270
Thou art the king of honor.

2079
01:39:11.770 --> 01:39:14.730
No man more potent breathes upon the ground

2080
01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:15.730
but I will beard him.

2081
01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:16.730
Do so, and 'tis well.

2082
01:39:16.730 --> 01:39:19.130
What letters hast thou there?

2083
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:20.700
I can but thank you.

2084
01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.370
These letters come from your father.

2085
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:23.400
Letters from him?

2086
01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.570
Why comes he not himself?

2087
01:39:24.570 --> 01:39:27.770
He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.

2088
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:29.600
'Zounds, how has he the leisure to be sick

2089
01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:31.170
in such a justling time?

2090
01:39:31.170 --> 01:39:32.430
Who leads his power?

2091
01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.800
Under whose government come they along?

2092
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:36.870
His letters bear his mind, my lord, not I.

2093
01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:41.030
I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?

2094
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:43.330
He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth.

2095
01:39:43.330 --> 01:39:45.130
And at the time of my departure thence,

2096
01:39:45.130 --> 01:39:47.400
he was much fear'd by his physicians.

2097
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.800
I would the state of time had first been whole

2098
01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:51.870
ere he by sickness had been visited.

2099
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:54.100
His health was never better worth than now.

2100
01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:55.500
Sick now.

2101
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:58.130
Droop now?

2102
01:39:58.130 --> 01:40:00.400
This sickness doth infect the very life-blood

2103
01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.670
of our enterprise.

2104
01:40:01.670 --> 01:40:03.630
'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.

2105
01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:06.970
He writes me here that inward sickness--

2106
01:40:06.970 --> 01:40:10.900
and that his friends could not by deputation

2107
01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:15.370
so soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet

2108
01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:17.270
to lay so dangerous and dear a trust

2109
01:40:17.270 --> 01:40:19.300
on any soul removed but on his own.

2110
01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:21.030
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement

2111
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:24.130
that with our small conjunction we should on

2112
01:40:24.130 --> 01:40:25.770
to see how fortune is disposed to us,

2113
01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:31.970
for, as he writes, there is no quailing now.

2114
01:40:31.970 --> 01:40:35.000
Because the king is certainly possess'd

2115
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.300
of all our purposes.

2116
01:40:38.930 --> 01:40:41.070
What say you to it?

2117
01:40:43.470 --> 01:40:46.600
Your father's sickness is a maim to us.

2118
01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:51.230
A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off.

2119
01:40:52.730 --> 01:40:54.800
And yet, in faith, it is not.

2120
01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.870
I rather of his absence make this use.

2121
01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:00.970
It lends a luster and more great opinion,

2122
01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:03.200
a larger dare to our great enterprise

2123
01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.330
than if the earl were here, for men must think,

2124
01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:06.970
if we without his help can make a head

2125
01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:08.800
to push against a kingdom, with his help,

2126
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.600
we can o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.

2127
01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:11.970
Yet all goes well.

2128
01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:13.230
Yet all our joints are whole.

2129
01:41:13.230 --> 01:41:14.770
As heart can think.

2130
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:16.930
There's not a word spoke of in Scotland

2131
01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:18.900
as this term of fear.

2132
01:41:18.900 --> 01:41:22.500
My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.

2133
01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.330
Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.

2134
01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:26.570
The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,

2135
01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:28.770
is marching hitherwards; with him, Prince John.

2136
01:41:28.770 --> 01:41:30.000
No harm. What more?

2137
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.270
And further, I have learn'd,

2138
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:33.030
the king himself in person is set forth,

2139
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:35.000
or hitherwards intended speedily,

2140
01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.700
with strong and mighty preparation.

2141
01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:37.730
He shall be welcome too.

2142
01:41:37.730 --> 01:41:38.930
Where is his son,

2143
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:44.270
the nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,

2144
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:46.470
and his comrades that daff'd the world aside

2145
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:47.930
and bid it pass?

2146
01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:53.100
All furnish'd, all in arms, all plumed like estridges

2147
01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:55.870
that with the wind baited like eagles having lately bathed,

2148
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:58.830
glittering in golden coats like images,

2149
01:41:58.830 --> 01:42:00.870
as full of spirit as the month of May

2150
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:02.870
and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer

2151
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:07.430
wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.

2152
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:09.800
I saw young Harry with his beaver on,

2153
01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.670
his cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd

2154
01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:14.930
rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury

2155
01:42:14.930 --> 01:42:16.870
and vaulted with such ease into his seat

2156
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:19.330
as if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds

2157
01:42:19.330 --> 01:42:20.800
to turn and wind a fiery Pegasus

2158
01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:24.600
and witch the world with noble horsemanship.

2159
01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:26.570
No more, no more.

2160
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:30.900
Worse than the sun in March, this praise doth nourish agues.

2161
01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:33.370
Let them come.

2162
01:42:33.370 --> 01:42:36.370
They come like sacrifices in their trim.

2163
01:42:36.370 --> 01:42:39.170
And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war,

2164
01:42:39.170 --> 01:42:41.030
all hot and bleeding, shall we offer them.

2165
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:43.330
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit

2166
01:42:43.330 --> 01:42:45.230
up to the ears in blood.

2167
01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:47.670
I am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh

2168
01:42:47.670 --> 01:42:49.630
and yet not ours.

2169
01:42:49.630 --> 01:42:51.800
Come; let me taste my horse,

2170
01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:53.400
who is to bear me like a thunderbolt

2171
01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.670
against the bosom of the Prince of Wales.

2172
01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:57.930
Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,

2173
01:42:57.930 --> 01:43:02.170
meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.

2174
01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:04.400
O that Glendower were come!

2175
01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.470
There is more news.

2176
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:07.930
I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,

2177
01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:10.670
he cannot draw his power this fourteen days.

2178
01:43:12.570 --> 01:43:14.630
These are the worst tidings I hear of yet.

2179
01:43:14.630 --> 01:43:18.730
Ay, my faith, that bears a frosty sound.

2180
01:43:21.630 --> 01:43:26.730
What may the king's whole battle reach unto?

2181
01:43:26.730 --> 01:43:29.500
To thirty thousand.

2182
01:43:31.170 --> 01:43:33.030
Forty, let it be.

2183
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:36.430
My father and Glendower being both away,

2184
01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:39.570
the powers of us may serve so great a day.

2185
01:43:39.570 --> 01:43:43.200
Come; let us take a muster speedily.

2186
01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.530
Doomsday is near.

2187
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:50.930
Die all.

2188
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:52.230
Die merrily.

2189
01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:53.530
Talk not of dying.

2190
01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:56.870
I'm out of fear of death or death's hand

2191
01:43:56.870 --> 01:43:58.700
this one-half year.

2192
01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.900
Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry.

2193
01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:14.400
Fill me a bottle of sack.

2194
01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.970
Our soldiers shall march through.

2195
01:44:15.970 --> 01:44:18.300
We'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.

2196
01:44:19.900 --> 01:44:24.830
Bardolph, bid my lieutenant Peto meet me at the town's end.

2197
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:27.670
Will you give me money,captain?

2198
01:44:27.670 --> 01:44:29.270
Lay out. Lay out.

2199
01:44:30.170 --> 01:44:31.370
This bottle makes an angel.

2200
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:33.230
An if it do, take it for thy labor.

2201
01:44:33.230 --> 01:44:35.030
And if it make twenty, take them all.

2202
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:36.130
I'll answer the coinage.

2203
01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:37.400
I will, captain. Farewell!

2204
01:44:37.400 --> 01:44:40.230
Farewell.

2205
01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:48.470
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers,

2206
01:44:48.470 --> 01:44:51.330
I'm a soused gurnet.

2207
01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:56.900
I have misused the king's press damnably.

2208
01:44:56.900 --> 01:45:00.470
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers,

2209
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:05.470
three hundred and odd pound.

2210
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:07.230
I press me none but good house-holders,

2211
01:45:07.230 --> 01:45:08.870
yeoman's sons,

2212
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:11.330
inquire me out contracted bachelors

2213
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:14.030
such as had been asked twice on the banns,

2214
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:16.200
such a commodity of warm slaves

2215
01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.470
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum,

2216
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:21.100
such as fear the report of a caliver worse

2217
01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:24.000
than a struck fowl or a hurt wild-duck.

2218
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:27.600
I pressed me none but such toasts-and-butter,

2219
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:30.370
with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins' heads,

2220
01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:33.500
and they...

2221
01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:36.700
have bought out their services.

2222
01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:39.500
And now my whole charge consists

2223
01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:41.800
of discarded unjust serving-men,

2224
01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:44.900
the younger sons of younger brothers,

2225
01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:48.030
revolted tapsters and ostlers trade-fallen,

2226
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:51.830
the cankers of a calm world and a long peace.

2227
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:53.570
Such have I, to fill up the rooms of them

2228
01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:55.230
that have bought out their services,

2229
01:45:55.230 --> 01:45:56.570
that you'd think that I had

2230
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:59.270
a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come

2231
01:45:59.270 --> 01:46:03.600
from swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks.

2232
01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:08.400
A mad fellow met me on the way and told me

2233
01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:12.370
I had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies.

2234
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:15.900
No eye hath seen such scarecrows.

2235
01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:19.430
I'll not march through Coventry with them; that's flat.

2236
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:20.470
How now, blown Jack!

2237
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:23.530
What, Hal!

2238
01:46:23.530 --> 01:46:26.670
How now, mad wag!

2239
01:46:26.670 --> 01:46:28.430
What a devil dost thou in Warwickshire?

2240
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:30.600
My Lord of Westmoreland, I cry your honor mercy.

2241
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.670
I thought you had already been at Shrewsbury.

2242
01:46:32.670 --> 01:46:34.330
In faith, Sir John,

2243
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:37.000
'tis more than time that I were there, and you too.

2244
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:38.670
But my powers are there already.

2245
01:46:38.670 --> 01:46:40.930
The king, I can tell you, looks for us all.

2246
01:46:40.930 --> 01:46:42.030
We must away all night.

2247
01:46:42.030 --> 01:46:43.270
Tut, man, never fear me.

2248
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:45.000
I'm as vigilant as a cat to steal cream.

2249
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:46.300
I think to steal cream indeed,

2250
01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:48.270
for thy theft hath already made thee butter.

2251
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:52.830
But tell me, Jack, whose fellows are these?

2252
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:54.400
Mine, Hal, mine.

2253
01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.470
I did never see, such pitiful rascals.

2254
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:57.500
Oh, tut, tut, man.

2255
01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:58.530
Good enough to toss.

2256
01:46:58.530 --> 01:47:01.500
Food for powder. Food for powder.

2257
01:47:01.500 --> 01:47:03.930
Well, they'll fill a pits as well as better.

2258
01:47:03.930 --> 01:47:07.030
Tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.

2259
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:08.970
Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are

2260
01:47:08.970 --> 01:47:11.370
exceeding poor and bare, too beggarly.

2261
01:47:11.370 --> 01:47:14.630
'Faith, for their poverty, I know not how they came by that.

2262
01:47:14.630 --> 01:47:15.900
And for their bareness,

2263
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:17.630
I'm sure they never learned that of me.

2264
01:47:17.630 --> 01:47:18.930
No, I'll be sworn,

2265
01:47:18.930 --> 01:47:21.500
unless you call three fingers in the ribs bare.

2266
01:47:21.500 --> 01:47:23.200
Sirrah, make haste.

2267
01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:24.600
Percy is already in the field!

2268
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.200
What, is the king encamped?

2269
01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.230
He is, Sir John.

2270
01:47:27.230 --> 01:47:28.500
I fear we shall stay too long!

2271
01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:43.570
Well, to the latter end of a fray

2272
01:47:43.570 --> 01:47:47.200
and the beginning of a feast

2273
01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:51.770
fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

2274
01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.500
We'll fight with him tonight.

2275
01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:57.500
It may not be.

2276
01:47:57.500 --> 01:47:58.970
You give him then the advantage.

2277
01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:59.830
Not a whit.

2278
01:47:59.830 --> 01:48:01.130
Why say you so? Looks he not for supply?

2279
01:48:01.130 --> 01:48:01.930
So do we.

2280
01:48:01.930 --> 01:48:03.370
His is certain; ours is doubtful.

2281
01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:05.270
Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.

2282
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:06.530
Do not, my lord.

2283
01:48:06.530 --> 01:48:08.330
You do not counsel well.

2284
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:10.670
You speak it out of fear and cold heart.

2285
01:48:10.670 --> 01:48:12.730
Do me no slander, Douglas.

2286
01:48:12.730 --> 01:48:15.370
By my life, and I dare well maintain it with my life,

2287
01:48:15.370 --> 01:48:17.530
if well-respected honor prick me on,

2288
01:48:17.530 --> 01:48:20.900
I hold as little counsel with weak fear as you, my lord,

2289
01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:22.870
or any Scot that this day lives.

2290
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:25.930
Let it be seen tomorrow in the battle which of us fears.

2291
01:48:25.930 --> 01:48:28.200
Yea, or tonight.

2292
01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.130
Content.

2293
01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:31.970
Tonight, say I.

2294
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:33.500
Come, come. It may not be.

2295
01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:36.070
I do wonder much, being men of such great leading as you are,

2296
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:37.800
that you foresee not what impediments

2297
01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.700
drag back our expedition.

2298
01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:41.330
Certain horse of my cousin Vernon's

2299
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:42.630
are not yet come up.

2300
01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:44.770
Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today.

2301
01:48:44.770 --> 01:48:46.530
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,

2302
01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:49.000
their courage with hard labor tame and dull,

2303
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.030
that not a horse is half the half of himself.

2304
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:52.800
So are the horses of the enemy in general

2305
01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:54.200
journey-bated and brought low.

2306
01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.970
The better part of ours are full of rest.

2307
01:48:55.970 --> 01:48:57.730
The number of the king exceedeth ours.

2308
01:48:57.730 --> 01:48:59.770
For God's sake, cousin, stay till all come in.

2309
01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:10.070
I come with gracious offers from the king

2310
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:13.530
if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.

2311
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:16.500
Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt.

2312
01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.470
And would to God you were of our determination.

2313
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:27.130
Some of us love you well and even though some envy

2314
01:49:27.130 --> 01:49:29.000
your great deservings and good name,

2315
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:30.500
because you're not of our quality

2316
01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.070
but stand against us like an enemy.

2317
01:49:32.070 --> 01:49:34.430
And God defend but still I should stand so,

2318
01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:36.530
so long as out of limit and true rule

2319
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:40.070
you stand against anointed majesty.

2320
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:43.370
But to my charge.

2321
01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:49.170
The king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs

2322
01:49:49.170 --> 01:49:51.830
and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace

2323
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:53.930
such bold hostility,

2324
01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:58.330
teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty.

2325
01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:04.070
If that the king have any way your just deserts forgot,

2326
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:06.730
which he confesseth to be manifold,

2327
01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:09.930
he bids you name your griefs.

2328
01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:12.730
And with all speed, you shall have your desires

2329
01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:17.700
with interest and pardon absolute for yourself

2330
01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:22.570
and these herein misled by your suggestion.

2331
01:50:22.570 --> 01:50:26.870
The king is kind, and well we know the king knows

2332
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:30.630
at what time to promise, when to pay.

2333
01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:33.200
My father and my uncle and myself did give him

2334
01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:35.200
that same royalty he wears.

2335
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.370
And when he was not six and twenty strong,

2336
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:39.400
sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,

2337
01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.500
a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,

2338
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:43.800
my father gave him welcome to the shore.

2339
01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.570
And when he heard him swear and vow to God

2340
01:50:45.570 --> 01:50:47.130
he came but to be Duke of Lancaster,

2341
01:50:47.130 --> 01:50:49.270
to sue his livery and beg his peace

2342
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:51.630
with tears of innocency and terms of zeal,

2343
01:50:51.630 --> 01:50:54.400
my father, in kind heart and pity moved,

2344
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:58.500
swore him assistance and perform'd it too.

2345
01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.930
And when the lords and barons of the realm

2346
01:51:00.930 --> 01:51:04.330
perceived Northumberland did lean to him,

2347
01:51:04.330 --> 01:51:06.700
the more and less came in with cap and knee,

2348
01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.830
met him in boroughs, cities, villages,

2349
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:11.200
attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,

2350
01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:13.730
laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,

2351
01:51:13.730 --> 01:51:16.400
gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him

2352
01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.800
even at the heels in golden multitudes.

2353
01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:25.070
He presently,as greatness knows itself,

2354
01:51:25.070 --> 01:51:27.930
steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father,

2355
01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:29.070
while his blood was poor,

2356
01:51:29.070 --> 01:51:31.730
upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh

2357
01:51:31.730 --> 01:51:33.700
and now, forsooth, takes on him to reform

2358
01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:35.670
some certain edicts and some strait decrees

2359
01:51:35.670 --> 01:51:37.430
that lie too heavy on the commonwealth,

2360
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:38.670
cries out upon abuses,

2361
01:51:38.670 --> 01:51:40.670
seems to weep over his country's wrongs,

2362
01:51:40.670 --> 01:51:44.930
and by this face, this seeming brow of justice,

2363
01:51:44.930 --> 01:51:47.400
did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for.

2364
01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.300
Proceeded further; cuts me off the heads

2365
01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:51.170
of all the favorites that the absent king

2366
01:51:51.170 --> 01:51:53.170
in deputation left behind him here

2367
01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:55.000
while he was personal in the Irish wars.

2368
01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Tut!

2369
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.930
I came not to hear this.

2370
01:51:57.930 --> 01:51:59.230
Then to the point.

2371
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:01.200
In short time after, he deposed the king;

2372
01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:03.070
soon after that, deprived him of his life;

2373
01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:07.970
and, in the neck of that, task'd the whole state.

2374
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:12.130
To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman Mortimer,

2375
01:52:12.130 --> 01:52:13.930
who is, if every owner were well placed,

2376
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:16.870
indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,

2377
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:18.800
there without ransom to lie forfeited;

2378
01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:20.970
disgraced me in my happy victories;

2379
01:52:20.970 --> 01:52:23.200
sought to entrap me by intelligence;

2380
01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.170
rated mine uncle from the council-board;

2381
01:52:26.170 --> 01:52:28.100
in rage, dismiss'd my father from the court;

2382
01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:31.970
broke oath on oath; committed wrong on wrong;

2383
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:33.330
and, in conclusion,

2384
01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:35.430
drove us to seek out this head of safety

2385
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:37.800
and withal to pry into his title,

2386
01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:44.100
the which we find too indirect for long continuance.

2387
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:50.330
Shall I return this answer to the king?

2388
01:52:55.700 --> 01:52:58.900
Not so, Sir Walter.

2389
01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:01.600
We'll withdraw a while.

2390
01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.630
Go to the king.

2391
01:53:04.630 --> 01:53:07.200
Let there be impawn'd some surety for a safe return again,

2392
01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:11.200
and in the morning earl

2393
01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:15.500
shall mine uncle bring him our purposes.

2394
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:19.270
And so farewell.

2395
01:53:21.100 --> 01:53:25.600
I would you would accept of grace and love.

2396
01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:30.400
And may be so we shall.

2397
01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:34.430
Pray God you do.

2398
01:53:51.230 --> 01:53:53.570
Hie, good Sir Michael.

2399
01:53:53.570 --> 01:53:55.670
Bear this sealed brief with winged haste

2400
01:53:55.670 --> 01:53:59.270
to the lord marshal, this to my cousin Scroop,

2401
01:53:59.270 --> 01:54:01.770
and all the rest to whom they are directed.

2402
01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:03.570
If you knew how much they do to import,

2403
01:54:03.570 --> 01:54:04.670
you would make haste.

2404
01:54:04.670 --> 01:54:06.870
My good lord, I do guess their tenor.

2405
01:54:06.870 --> 01:54:08.730
Like enough you do.

2406
01:54:08.730 --> 01:54:12.230
Tomorrow, good Sir Michael, is a day

2407
01:54:12.230 --> 01:54:15.830
wherein the fortune of ten thousand men

2408
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:18.600
must bide the touch.

2409
01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:19.730
For, sir, at Shrewsbury,

2410
01:54:19.730 --> 01:54:21.230
as I am truly given to understand,

2411
01:54:21.230 --> 01:54:24.770
the king, with mighty and quick-raised power,

2412
01:54:24.770 --> 01:54:27.770
meets with Lord Harry.

2413
01:54:27.770 --> 01:54:30.770
And, I fear, Sir Michael,

2414
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:33.030
what with the sickness of Northumberland,

2415
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:34.870
whose power was in the first proportion,

2416
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:37.070
and what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,

2417
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:38.600
who with them was a rated sinew too

2418
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:42.700
and comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,

2419
01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:44.970
I fear the power of Percy is too weak

2420
01:54:44.970 --> 01:54:46.700
to wage an instant trial with the king.

2421
01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:49.300
Doubt not, my lord; they shall be well opposed.

2422
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:51.100
I hope no less.

2423
01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:53.000
Yet needful 'tis to fear.

2424
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.800
And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed,

2425
01:54:55.800 --> 01:54:59.830
for if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king dismiss his power,

2426
01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:01.700
he means to visit us,

2427
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:04.430
for he hath heard of our confederacy,

2428
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:06.930
and 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him.

2429
01:55:06.930 --> 01:55:08.100
Therefore, make haste.

2430
01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:11.200
I must go write again to other friends.

2431
01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:14.700
So farewell, Sir Michael.

2432
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:26.030
How bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon busky hill.

2433
01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:29.400
The day looks pale at his distemperature.

2434
01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:31.900
The southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes,

2435
01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:33.870
and, by his hollow whistling in the leaves,

2436
01:55:33.870 --> 01:55:36.570
foretells a tempest and a blustering day.

2437
01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:39.130
Then with the losers let it sympathize,

2438
01:55:39.130 --> 01:55:42.970
for nothing can seem foul to those that win.

2439
01:55:48.630 --> 01:55:51.270
How now, my Lord of Worcester.

2440
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:54.800
'Tis not well that you and I should meet

2441
01:55:54.800 --> 01:55:57.530
upon such terms as now we meet.

2442
01:55:57.530 --> 01:56:00.130
You have deceived our trust

2443
01:56:00.130 --> 01:56:03.600
and made us doff our easy robes of peace

2444
01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:07.370
to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.

2445
01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:09.430
This is not well, my lord.

2446
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:11.000
This is not well.

2447
01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.700
What say you to it?

2448
01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:15.670
Will you again unknit this churlish knot

2449
01:56:15.670 --> 01:56:17.600
of all-abhorred war

2450
01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:20.430
And move in that obedient orb again

2451
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:23.500
where you did give a fair and natural light

2452
01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:27.230
and be no more an exhaled meteor,

2453
01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:30.930
a prodigy of fear and a portent of mischief

2454
01:56:30.930 --> 01:56:33.100
to the unborn times?

2455
01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:36.800
Hear me, my liege.

2456
01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:39.030
For mine own part, I could be well content

2457
01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:42.430
to entertain the lag-end of my life with quiet hours,

2458
01:56:42.430 --> 01:56:43.530
for I protest,

2459
01:56:43.530 --> 01:56:46.030
I have not sought the day of this dislike.

2460
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:49.370
You have not sought it?

2461
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:51.270
How comes it, then?

2462
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:53.500
Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.

2463
01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.670
Peace, chewet, peace!

2464
01:56:55.670 --> 01:56:59.770
It pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favor

2465
01:56:59.770 --> 01:57:03.070
from myself and all our house.

2466
01:57:03.070 --> 01:57:05.200
And yet I must remember you, my lord,

2467
01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.770
we were the first and dearest of your friends.

2468
01:57:07.770 --> 01:57:10.970
For you, my staff of office did I break In Richard's time

2469
01:57:10.970 --> 01:57:12.930
and posted day and night to meet you on the way

2470
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:14.100
and kiss your hand,

2471
01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:15.930
while yet you were in place and in account

2472
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:18.630
nothing so strong and fortunate as I.

2473
01:57:18.630 --> 01:57:20.630
It was myself, my brother, and his son

2474
01:57:20.630 --> 01:57:21.830
who brought you home

2475
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:25.030
and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time.

2476
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:28.000
And being fed by us, you used us so

2477
01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.330
as that ungentle gull, the cuckoo's bird,

2478
01:57:30.330 --> 01:57:33.400
useth the sparrow: did oppress our nest,

2479
01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:35.700
grew by our feeding to so great a bulk

2480
01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.830
that even our love durst not come near your sight

2481
01:57:37.830 --> 01:57:39.130
for fear of swallowing.

2482
01:57:39.130 --> 01:57:40.900
But with nimble wing, we were enforced,

2483
01:57:40.900 --> 01:57:43.300
for safety sake, to fly out of your sight

2484
01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:45.000
and raise this present head,

2485
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.700
whereby we stand opposed by such means

2486
01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.830
as you yourself have forged against yourself

2487
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:54.400
by unkind usage, dangerous countenance,

2488
01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:57.400
and violation of all faith and troth

2489
01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:00.370
sworn to us in your younger enterprise!

2490
01:58:00.370 --> 01:58:04.630
These things indeed you have articulate,

2491
01:58:04.630 --> 01:58:09.700
proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,

2492
01:58:09.700 --> 01:58:13.670
to face the garment of rebellion with some fine color

2493
01:58:13.670 --> 01:58:14.900
that may please the eye

2494
01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:18.530
of fickle changelings and poor discontents,

2495
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:21.370
which gape and rub the elbow at the news

2496
01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:23.900
o hurlyburly innovation.

2497
01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:26.770
And never yet did insurrection want

2498
01:58:26.770 --> 01:58:30.000
such water-colors to impaint his cause,

2499
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.400
nor moody beggars, starving for a time

2500
01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:37.730
of pellmell havoc and confusion.

2501
01:58:37.730 --> 01:58:40.400
In both our armies, there is many a soul

2502
01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:42.270
shall pay full dearly for this encounter

2503
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:45.130
if once they join in trial.

2504
01:58:45.130 --> 01:58:48.230
Tell your nephew the Prince of Wales

2505
01:58:48.230 --> 01:58:51.400
doth join with all the world in praise of Henry Percy.

2506
01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:54.530
By my hopes, this present enterprise set off his head,

2507
01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:56.670
I do not think a braver gentleman,

2508
01:58:56.670 --> 01:58:59.900
more active-valiant or more valiant-young,

2509
01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:02.370
more daring or more bold, is now alive

2510
01:59:02.370 --> 01:59:05.300
to grace this latter age with noble deeds.

2511
01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:08.670
For my part, I may speak it to my shame,

2512
01:59:08.670 --> 01:59:10.600
I have a truant been to chivalry,

2513
01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:14.170
and so I hear he doth account me too.

2514
01:59:14.170 --> 01:59:17.130
Yet this before my father's majesty.

2515
01:59:17.130 --> 01:59:19.130
I am content that he shall take the odds

2516
01:59:19.130 --> 01:59:22.030
of his great name and estimation

2517
01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:24.270
and will, to save the blood on either side,

2518
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:30.070
try fortune with him in a single fight.

2519
01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:33.130
And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,

2520
01:59:33.130 --> 01:59:38.770
albeit considerations infinite do make against it.

2521
01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:39.930
No, good Worcester, no.

2522
01:59:39.930 --> 01:59:42.100
We love our people well.

2523
01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:44.070
Even those we love

2524
01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:47.070
that are misled upon your cousin's part.

2525
01:59:47.070 --> 01:59:50.070
And, will they take the offer of our grace,

2526
01:59:50.070 --> 01:59:55.130
both he and they and you,yea, every man,

2527
01:59:55.130 --> 01:59:57.630
shall be my friend again and I'll be his.

2528
01:59:57.630 --> 01:59:59.570
So tell your cousin,

2529
01:59:59.570 --> 02:00:02.100
and bring me word what he will do.

2530
02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:04.830
But if he will not yield,

2531
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:07.800
rebuke and dread correction wait on us,

2532
02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:10.270
and they shall do their office.

2533
02:00:10.270 --> 02:00:12.500
So be gone.

2534
02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:15.070
We will not now be troubled with reply.

2535
02:00:15.070 --> 02:00:17.070
We offer fair.

2536
02:00:17.070 --> 02:00:19.900
Take it advisedly.

2537
02:00:27.370 --> 02:00:30.170
It will not be accepted, on my life.

2538
02:00:30.170 --> 02:00:32.430
The Douglas and the Hotspur both together

2539
02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:35.030
are confident against the world in arms.

2540
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:38.670
Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge,

2541
02:00:38.670 --> 02:00:42.530
for, on their answer, will we set on them.

2542
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:47.030
And God befriend us,as our cause is just!

2543
02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:59.170
Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me, so.

2544
02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:01.330
'Tis a point of friendship.

2545
02:01:01.330 --> 02:01:04.030
Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.

2546
02:01:04.030 --> 02:01:06.930
Say thy prayers, and farewell.

2547
02:01:06.930 --> 02:01:09.130
I--

2548
02:01:09.130 --> 02:01:14.670
I would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.

2549
02:01:14.670 --> 02:01:17.570
Why, thou owest God a death.

2550
02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:19.700
'Tis not due yet!

2551
02:01:19.700 --> 02:01:22.370
I would be loath to pay him before his day.

2552
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:25.830
What need I be so forward with him that calls not on me?

2553
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:29.830
Well, 'tis no matter; honor pricks me on.

2554
02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:34.330
Yea, but how if honor prick me off when I come on?

2555
02:01:34.330 --> 02:01:35.970
How then?

2556
02:01:35.970 --> 02:01:39.470
Can honor set to a leg?

2557
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:42.870
No, or an arm?

2558
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:48.830
No, or take away the grief of a wound?

2559
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:52.070
No.

2560
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:57.670
Honor hath then no skill in surgery?

2561
02:01:57.670 --> 02:01:59.670
No.

2562
02:01:59.670 --> 02:02:02.970
What is honor?

2563
02:02:02.970 --> 02:02:05.400
A word.

2564
02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:09.700
What is in that word "honor"?

2565
02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:13.130
What is that honor?

2566
02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:16.030
Air.

2567
02:02:16.030 --> 02:02:17.330
A trim reckoning.

2568
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:19.770
Who hath it?

2569
02:02:19.770 --> 02:02:23.570
He that died o' Wednesday.

2570
02:02:23.570 --> 02:02:25.800
Doth he feel it?

2571
02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:27.470
No.

2572
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:29.100
Doth he hear it?

2573
02:02:29.100 --> 02:02:31.030
No.

2574
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:33.930
'Tis insensible, then

2575
02:02:33.930 --> 02:02:36.670
Yea, to the dead.

2576
02:02:36.670 --> 02:02:39.300
But will it not live with the living?

2577
02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:41.000
No.

2578
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.100
Why?

2579
02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:47.130
Detraction will not suffer it.

2580
02:02:47.130 --> 02:02:50.730
Therefore, I'll none of it.

2581
02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:53.100
Honor is a mere scutcheon.

2582
02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:56.170
And so ends my catechism.

2583
02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:01.570
O, no, Sir Richard, my nephew must not know

2584
02:03:01.570 --> 02:03:03.700
the liberal and kind offer of the king.

2585
02:03:03.700 --> 02:03:04.730
'Twere best he did.

2586
02:03:04.730 --> 02:03:07.070
Then are we all undone.

2587
02:03:07.070 --> 02:03:08.800
It is not possible, it cannot be,

2588
02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:10.700
the king should keep his word in loving us.

2589
02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:12.970
He will suspect us still and find a time

2590
02:03:12.970 --> 02:03:14.800
to punish this offense in other faults.

2591
02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:17.230
Therefore, dear cousin, let not Harry know,

2592
02:03:17.230 --> 02:03:21.570
in any case, the offer of the king.

2593
02:03:21.570 --> 02:03:24.570
Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.

2594
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:29.230
My uncle is return'd.

2595
02:03:29.230 --> 02:03:31.300
Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.

2596
02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:32.430
Uncle, what news?

2597
02:03:32.430 --> 02:03:34.170
The king will bid you battle presently.

2598
02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:39.230
Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.

2599
02:03:39.230 --> 02:03:41.600
Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.

2600
02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:43.870
Marry, I shall, and very willingly.

2601
02:03:43.870 --> 02:03:46.570
There's no seeming mercy in the king.

2602
02:03:46.570 --> 02:03:47.570
Did you beg any?

2603
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:48.770
God forbid.

2604
02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:50.400
I told him gently of our grievances,

2605
02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:52.330
of his oath-breaking, which he mended thus

2606
02:03:52.330 --> 02:03:54.100
by now forswearing that he is forsworn.

2607
02:03:54.100 --> 02:03:56.030
He calls us rebels, traitors,

2608
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:58.370
will purge with haughty arms this hateful name in us.

2609
02:03:58.370 --> 02:04:00.670
Arm, gentlemen; to arms.

2610
02:04:00.670 --> 02:04:02.970
I have thrown a brave defiance in King Harry's teeth,

2611
02:04:02.970 --> 02:04:05.170
and Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it.

2612
02:04:05.170 --> 02:04:07.830
This cannot choose but bring him quickly on.

2613
02:04:11.970 --> 02:04:14.630
The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king

2614
02:04:14.630 --> 02:04:17.400
and, nephew, challenged you to single fight.

2615
02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.970
Oh, would to God the quarrel lay upon our heads

2616
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:22.470
and that no man might draw short breath today

2617
02:04:22.470 --> 02:04:25.100
but I and Harry Monmouth.

2618
02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:28.700
Tell me, tell me, how show'd his tasking?

2619
02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:29.970
Seem'd it in contempt?

2620
02:04:29.970 --> 02:04:31.900
No, by my soul, I never in my life

2621
02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:33.770
did hear a challenge urged more modestly,

2622
02:04:33.770 --> 02:04:35.670
unless a brother should a brother dare

2623
02:04:35.670 --> 02:04:37.700
to gentle exercise and proof of arms.

2624
02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:39.270
He gave you all the virtues of a man,

2625
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:41.630
trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,

2626
02:04:41.630 --> 02:04:43.500
spoke to your deserving like a chronicle,

2627
02:04:43.500 --> 02:04:45.770
making you ever better than his praise

2628
02:04:45.770 --> 02:04:49.300
by still dispraising praise valued with you.

2629
02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:51.470
And, which became him like a prince indeed,

2630
02:04:51.470 --> 02:04:54.070
he made a blushing cital of himself

2631
02:04:54.070 --> 02:04:56.000
and chid his truant youth with such a grace

2632
02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.270
as if he master'd there a double spirit,

2633
02:04:58.270 --> 02:05:00.400
of teaching and of learning instantly.

2634
02:05:00.400 --> 02:05:02.630
There did he pause.

2635
02:05:02.630 --> 02:05:04.700
But let me tell the world,

2636
02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:07.230
if he outlive the envy of this day,

2637
02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:10.230
England did never own so sweet a hope,

2638
02:05:10.230 --> 02:05:13.500
so much misconstrued in his wantonness.

2639
02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:17.130
Cousin, I think thou art enamored of his follies.

2640
02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:20.600
Never did I hear of any prince so wild a libertine.

2641
02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:22.970
But be he as he will, yet once ere night

2642
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:25.270
I will embrace him with a soldier's arm

2643
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:27.330
that he shall shrink under my courtesy.

2644
02:05:27.330 --> 02:05:29.630
Arm, arm with speed.

2645
02:05:29.630 --> 02:05:36.630
And, fellows, soldiers, friends,

2646
02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:39.170
better consider what you have to do than I,

2647
02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:40.270
that have not well the gift of tongue,

2648
02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:42.030
can lift your blood up with persuasion.

2649
02:05:42.030 --> 02:05:44.100
My lord, here are letters for you.

2650
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:46.200
I cannot read them now.

2651
02:05:48.230 --> 02:05:53.370
Oh, gentlemen, the time of life is short.

2652
02:05:53.370 --> 02:05:56.970
To spend that shortness basely were too long,

2653
02:05:56.970 --> 02:05:58.600
if life did ride upon a dial's point,

2654
02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:00.430
still ending at the arrival of an hour.

2655
02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:02.870
An if we live, we live to tread on kings;

2656
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:08.370
if die, brave death, when princes die with us.

2657
02:06:08.370 --> 02:06:10.830
Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair

2658
02:06:10.830 --> 02:06:12.970
when the intent of bearing them is just.

2659
02:06:12.970 --> 02:06:14.430
My lord, prepare.

2660
02:06:14.430 --> 02:06:16.200
The king comes on apace.

2661
02:06:16.200 --> 02:06:17.930
I thank him that he cuts me from my tale,

2662
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:22.370
for I profess not talking, only this:

2663
02:06:22.370 --> 02:06:26.900
let each man do his best.

2664
02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:32.600
And here draw I a sword, whose temper I intend to stain

2665
02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:34.730
with the best blood that I can meet withal

2666
02:06:34.730 --> 02:06:38.200
in the adventure of this perilous day.

2667
02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:41.130
Now, Esperance.

2668
02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:44.570
Percy.

2669
02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:48.330
And set on.

2670
02:06:52.570 --> 02:06:55.170
Sound all the lofty instruments of war,

2671
02:06:55.170 --> 02:07:00.670
and, by that music, let us all embrace.

2672
02:07:08.970 --> 02:07:12.500
For, heaven to earth, some of us never shall

2673
02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:15.670
a second time do such a courtesy.

2674
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:44.570
What is thy name,

2675
02:07:44.570 --> 02:07:47.670
that in this battle thus thou crossest me?

2676
02:07:47.670 --> 02:07:50.700
What honors dost thou seek upon my head?

2677
02:07:50.700 --> 02:07:52.000
Know then, my name is Douglas;

2678
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.870
and I do haunt thee in battle thus

2679
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:56.530
because some tell me thou art a king.

2680
02:07:56.530 --> 02:07:58.700
They tell thee true.

2681
02:07:58.700 --> 02:08:02.670
My Lord of Stafford dear today hath bought thy likeness,

2682
02:08:02.670 --> 02:08:05.830
for instead of thee, King Harry, this sword has ended him,

2683
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:07.370
which shall it thee,

2684
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:10.270
unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.

2685
02:08:10.270 --> 02:08:14.270
I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot,

2686
02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:16.070
and thou shalt find a king

2687
02:08:16.070 --> 02:08:19.470
that will revenge Lord Stafford's death.

2688
02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:37.500
Ohm Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,

2689
02:08:37.500 --> 02:08:40.030
never had triumph'd upon a Scot.

2690
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:42.600
All's done. All's won.

2691
02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:45.800
See; here, breathless lies the king.

2692
02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:46.800
Where?

2693
02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:48.470
Here.

2694
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:49.770
This, Douglas?

2695
02:08:49.770 --> 02:08:53.600
No, I know this face full well.

2696
02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:55.670
A gallant knight he was.

2697
02:08:55.670 --> 02:08:57.630
His name was Blunt.

2698
02:08:57.630 --> 02:08:59.900
Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.

2699
02:08:59.900 --> 02:09:03.230
A fool go with thy soul, whither it will.

2700
02:09:03.230 --> 02:09:05.170
A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear.

2701
02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:07.430
Why didst thou tell me thou wert a king?

2702
02:09:07.430 --> 02:09:09.270
The king has many marching in his coats.

2703
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:11.500
Then, by my sword, I will kill all his coats.

2704
02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:15.500
I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,

2705
02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:17.230
until I find the king.

2706
02:09:17.230 --> 02:09:18.400
Up, and away!

2707
02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:21.430
Our soldiers stand full fairly for the day!

2708
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:23.300
This way! Follow me!

2709
02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:24.330
Follow him, lads!

2710
02:09:24.330 --> 02:09:25.900
Come on! Hurry!

2711
02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:28.470
Come on, men!

2712
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:31.370
Though I could 'scape shot-free at London,

2713
02:09:31.370 --> 02:09:32.600
yet I fear the shot here.

2714
02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:34.500
Here's no scoring but upon the pate.

2715
02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:35.530
Soft!

2716
02:09:35.530 --> 02:09:37.200
Who are you?

2717
02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:40.300
Sir Walter Blunt.

2718
02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:43.330
There's honor for you.

2719
02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:45.770
I'm as hot as molten lead and as heavy.

2720
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:47.630
God keep lead out of me!

2721
02:09:47.630 --> 02:09:49.930
I need no more weight than mine own bowels.

2722
02:09:49.930 --> 02:09:52.170
I have led my ragamuffins where they are peppered.

2723
02:09:52.170 --> 02:09:54.470
There's not three of my hundred and fifty left alive.

2724
02:09:54.470 --> 02:09:56.730
And they are for the town's end, to beg during life.

2725
02:09:56.730 --> 02:09:58.200
But who comes here?

2726
02:09:58.200 --> 02:09:59.270
What?

2727
02:09:59.270 --> 02:10:00.600
Stand'st thou idle here?

2728
02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.600
What?

2729
02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.300
Lend me thy sword.

2730
02:10:03.300 --> 02:10:05.070
Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff

2731
02:10:05.070 --> 02:10:06.730
under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,

2732
02:10:06.730 --> 02:10:08.500
whose deaths are yet unrevenged.

2733
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:09.800
I prithee, lend me thy sword!

2734
02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:12.200
Oh, Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.

2735
02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:14.100
Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms

2736
02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:15.330
as I have done this day.

2737
02:10:15.330 --> 02:10:17.070
I have paid Percy. I have made him sure.

2738
02:10:17.070 --> 02:10:18.800
He is, indeed, and living to kill thee.

2739
02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:20.100
I prithee, lend me thy sword!

2740
02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.870
Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive,

2741
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:23.000
thou get'st not my sword.

2742
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.730
Take my pistol, if thou wilt.

2743
02:10:24.730 --> 02:10:25.770
Give it to me.

2744
02:10:25.770 --> 02:10:27.170
What, is it in the case?

2745
02:10:27.170 --> 02:10:29.600
Ay, 'tis hot. 'Tis hot.

2746
02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.900
There's that will sack a city.

2747
02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:33.030
What?

2748
02:10:33.030 --> 02:10:36.600
Is it a time to jest and dally now?

2749
02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:40.470
Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him.

2750
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:42.800
If he do come in my way, so.

2751
02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:45.030
If he do not, if I come in his willingly,

2752
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:47.770
let him make a carbonado of me.

2753
02:10:47.770 --> 02:10:50.630
I like not such grinning honor as Sir Walter hath.

2754
02:10:50.630 --> 02:10:54.300
Give me life, which, if I can save, so.

2755
02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:56.970
If not, honor comes unlooked for,

2756
02:10:56.970 --> 02:10:58.100
and there's an end.

2757
02:10:58.100 --> 02:10:59.870
This way! Follow me!

2758
02:10:59.870 --> 02:11:02.670
I prithee, Harry, withdraw thyself.

2759
02:11:02.670 --> 02:11:03.900
Thou bleed'st too much.

2760
02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:05.700
Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.

2761
02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:08.130
Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.

2762
02:11:08.130 --> 02:11:10.400
I do beseech your majesty, make up,

2763
02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:12.900
lest your retirement do amaze your friends.

2764
02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:13.900
I will do so.

2765
02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:15.800
My Lord of Westmoreland, go you with him.

2766
02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:18.430
Come, come, my lord; I'll lead you to your tent.

2767
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:19.470
Lead me, my lord?

2768
02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:20.870
I do not need your help.

2769
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:23.700
And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive the Prince of Wales

2770
02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:25.570
from such a field as this,

2771
02:11:25.570 --> 02:11:27.830
where stain'd nobility lies trodden on

2772
02:11:27.830 --> 02:11:29.800
and rebels' arms triumph in massacres.

2773
02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:30.830
We breathe too long.

2774
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:32.300
Come, cousin Westmoreland.

2775
02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:33.500
Our duty this way lies.

2776
02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:35.700
For God's sake, come.

2777
02:11:37.630 --> 02:11:40.200
By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster.

2778
02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:42.330
I did not think thee lord of such a spirit.

2779
02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:44.400
Before, I loved thee as a brother, John.

2780
02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:46.830
Now I do respect thee as my soul.

2781
02:11:46.830 --> 02:11:49.230
I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point

2782
02:11:49.230 --> 02:11:51.600
with lustier maintenance than I did look for

2783
02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:55.170
of such an ungrown warrior.

2784
02:11:55.170 --> 02:11:58.170
Oh, this boy lends mettle to us all.

2785
02:12:01.730 --> 02:12:03.200
Another king.

2786
02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:05.600
They grow like Hydra's heads.

2787
02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.930
I am the Douglas, fatal to all those

2788
02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:09.570
that wear those colors on them.

2789
02:12:09.570 --> 02:12:12.770
Who art thou that counterfeit'st the person of a king?

2790
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:16.600
The king himself, who, Douglas,

2791
02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:18.670
grieves at heart so many of his shadows

2792
02:12:18.670 --> 02:12:20.570
thou hast met and not the very king.

2793
02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:24.770
I have two boys seek Percy and thyself about the field.

2794
02:12:24.770 --> 02:12:27.900
But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,

2795
02:12:27.900 --> 02:12:31.330
I will assay thee, so defend thyself.

2796
02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.870
I fear thou art another counterfeit.

2797
02:12:50.870 --> 02:12:53.800
Yet thou bear'st thee like a king.

2798
02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:57.730
But mine thou art, whoe'er thou be,

2799
02:12:57.730 --> 02:13:01.470
and thus I win thee.

2800
02:13:02.500 --> 02:13:03.970
Hold up thy head, vile Scot,

2801
02:13:03.970 --> 02:13:05.800
or thou art like never to hold it up again,

2802
02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:08.900
The spirits of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms.

2803
02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:10.930
It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee,

2804
02:13:10.930 --> 02:13:12.930
who never promiseth but he means to pay.

2805
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:17.070
Cheerly, my lord, how fares your grace?

2806
02:13:17.070 --> 02:13:19.800
Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,

2807
02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:20.870
and so hath Clifton.

2808
02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:22.070
I'll to Clifton straight.

2809
02:13:22.070 --> 02:13:24.370
Stay, and breathe awhile.

2810
02:13:24.370 --> 02:13:27.000
Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion

2811
02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.200
and show'd thou makest some tender of my life

2812
02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:32.600
in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.

2813
02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:33.770
O God!

2814
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:35.000
They did me too much injury

2815
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.870
that ever said I hearken'd for your death.

2816
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:38.430
If it were so, I might have let alone

2817
02:13:38.430 --> 02:13:40.200
the insulting hand of Douglas over you,

2818
02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:42.030
which would have been as speedy in your end

2819
02:13:42.030 --> 02:13:43.900
as all the poisonous potions in the world

2820
02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:47.130
and saved the treacherous labor of your son!

2821
02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:48.330
Make up to Clifton.

2822
02:13:48.330 --> 02:13:50.670
I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.

2823
02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:01.630
If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.

2824
02:14:01.630 --> 02:14:03.430
Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.

2825
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:08.800
My name is Harry Percy.

2826
02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:13.370
Why, then I see a very valiant rebel of the name.

2827
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:15.970
I am the Prince of Wales, and think not, Percy,

2828
02:14:15.970 --> 02:14:18.200
to share with me in glory any more.

2829
02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:21.000
Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere,

2830
02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.200
nor can one England brook a double reign

2831
02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.200
of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.

2832
02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:26.600
Nor shall it, Harry,

2833
02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:29.830
for the hour is come to end the one of us.

2834
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:32.270
And would to God thy name in arms were now

2835
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:33.530
as great as mine.

2836
02:14:33.530 --> 02:14:36.730
I'll make it greater ere I part from thee,

2837
02:14:36.730 --> 02:14:39.470
and all the budding honors on thy crest I'll crop

2838
02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:40.930
to make a garland for my head.

2839
02:14:40.930 --> 02:14:44.870
I can no longer brook thy vanities.

2840
02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:09.530
Oh!

2841
02:15:09.530 --> 02:15:10.630
Well said, Hal!

2842
02:15:10.630 --> 02:15:12.000
To it, Hal!

2843
02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.730
Nay, you shall find no boy's play here,

2844
02:15:13.730 --> 02:15:14.730
I can tell you.

2845
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:47.200
Oh, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth.

2846
02:16:49.930 --> 02:16:52.100
I better brook the loss of brittle life

2847
02:16:52.100 --> 02:16:55.370
than those proud titles thou hast won of me.

2848
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:58.700
They wound my thoughts worse than thy sword my flesh.

2849
02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:04.970
But thoughts the slaves of life, and life time's fool.

2850
02:17:04.970 --> 02:17:08.330
And time itself, that takes survey of all the world,

2851
02:17:08.330 --> 02:17:11.330
must have a stop.

2852
02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:22.100
Oh, I could prophesy,

2853
02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:26.170
but that the earthy and co--

2854
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:30.630
cold hand of death lies on my tongue.

2855
02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:38.030
No, Percy, thou art dust and food for--

2856
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:58.300
For worms, brave Percy.

2857
02:17:58.300 --> 02:18:01.030
Fare thee well, great heart.

2858
02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:10.930
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk.

2859
02:18:10.930 --> 02:18:14.930
When that this body did contain a spirit,

2860
02:18:14.930 --> 02:18:18.070
a kingdom for it was too small a bound.

2861
02:18:18.070 --> 02:18:21.630
But now two paces of the vilest earth

2862
02:18:21.630 --> 02:18:25.270
is room enough.

2863
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:28.700
This earth that bears thee dead

2864
02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:30.870
bears not alive so stout a gentleman.

2865
02:18:38.630 --> 02:18:40.830
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,

2866
02:18:40.830 --> 02:18:44.030
I should not make so dear a show of zeal.

2867
02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:47.470
But let my favors hide thy mangled face.

2868
02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:53.770
And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself

2869
02:18:53.770 --> 02:18:56.800
for doing these fair rites of tenderness.

2870
02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:05.870
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven.

2871
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:11.900
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave

2872
02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:15.270
but not remember'd in thy epitaph.

2873
02:19:25.230 --> 02:19:30.730
What, old acquaintance?

2874
02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:42.200
Could not all this flesh keep in a little life?

2875
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:46.530
Poor Jack, farewell.

2876
02:19:49.170 --> 02:19:52.330
I could have better spared a better man.

2877
02:19:52.330 --> 02:19:54.170
Oh, I should have a heavy miss of thee

2878
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:57.370
if I were much in love with vanity.

2879
02:19:57.370 --> 02:20:01.170
Death hath not struck so fat a deer today,

2880
02:20:01.170 --> 02:20:05.630
though many dearer, in this bloody fray.

2881
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:09.200
Embowell'd will I see thee by and by.

2882
02:20:12.730 --> 02:20:18.030
Till then, in blood by noble Percy lie.

2883
02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:27.030
Embowelled?

2884
02:20:27.030 --> 02:20:28.670
If thou embowel me to-day,

2885
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:31.900
I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too tomorrow.

2886
02:20:31.900 --> 02:20:34.630
'Sblood, twas time to counterfeit,

2887
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:37.570
or that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.

2888
02:20:37.570 --> 02:20:39.430
Counterfeit?

2889
02:20:39.430 --> 02:20:41.130
I lie; I am no counterfeit.

2890
02:20:41.130 --> 02:20:42.900
To die is to be a counterfeit,

2891
02:20:42.900 --> 02:20:44.530
for he is but the counterfeit of a man

2892
02:20:44.530 --> 02:20:46.170
who hath not the life of a man.

2893
02:20:46.170 --> 02:20:49.130
But to counterfeit dying when a man thereby liveth

2894
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:50.430
is to be no counterfeit

2895
02:20:50.430 --> 02:20:54.230
but the true and perfect image of life indeed.

2896
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:57.230
The better part of valor is discretion,

2897
02:20:57.230 --> 02:21:00.330
in the which better part I have saved my life.

2898
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:20.030
'Zounds, I'm afraid of this gunpowder Percy,

2899
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:21.470
though he be dead.

2900
02:21:21.470 --> 02:21:24.430
How, if he should counterfeit too and rise?

2901
02:21:24.430 --> 02:21:26.070
By my faith, I'm afraid

2902
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:28.200
he'd prove the better counterfeit.

2903
02:21:28.200 --> 02:21:30.530
Therefore I'll make him sure.

2904
02:21:30.530 --> 02:21:33.500
Yea, and I'll swear I killed him.

2905
02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:36.530
Why may not he rise as well as I?

2906
02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:40.200
Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.

2907
02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:41.300
Therefore, sirrah...

2908
02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:49.200
with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.

2909
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:55.670
Come, brother John.

2910
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:58.170
Full bravely hast thou flesh'd thy maiden sword.

2911
02:21:58.170 --> 02:21:59.170
But soft.

2912
02:21:59.170 --> 02:22:00.400
Whom have we here?

2913
02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:03.930
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?

2914
02:22:03.930 --> 02:22:04.930
I did.

2915
02:22:04.930 --> 02:22:06.070
I saw him dead.

2916
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:08.600
Breathless and bleeding on the ground.

2917
02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:10.500
Art thou alive?

2918
02:22:10.500 --> 02:22:12.730
Or is it some fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?

2919
02:22:12.730 --> 02:22:13.970
I prithee, speak.

2920
02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:16.500
We will not trust our eyes without our ears.

2921
02:22:16.500 --> 02:22:18.530
Thou art not what thou seem'st.

2922
02:22:18.530 --> 02:22:20.030
No, that's certain.

2923
02:22:20.030 --> 02:22:22.430
I am no double man.

2924
02:22:22.430 --> 02:22:25.200
But if I be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack.

2925
02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.870
There is Percy.

2926
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:29.870
If your father will do me any honor, so.

2927
02:22:29.870 --> 02:22:32.570
If not, let him kill the next Percy himself.

2928
02:22:32.570 --> 02:22:34.770
I look to be either earl or duke,

2929
02:22:34.770 --> 02:22:36.000
I can assure you.

2930
02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:39.900
Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.

2931
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:41.130
Didst thou?

2932
02:22:41.130 --> 02:22:43.800
Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying.

2933
02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:45.770
I grant, I was down and out of breath,

2934
02:22:45.770 --> 02:22:46.830
and so was he.

2935
02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:48.730
But we rose both at an instant

2936
02:22:48.730 --> 02:22:51.770
and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock.

2937
02:22:51.770 --> 02:22:54.200
If I may be believed, so.

2938
02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:56.470
If not, let them that should reward valor

2939
02:22:56.470 --> 02:22:57.970
take the sin upon their own heads.

2940
02:22:57.970 --> 02:22:59.130
I'll take it upon my death,

2941
02:22:59.130 --> 02:23:00.900
I gave him this wound in the thigh.

2942
02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:03.500
If the man were alive and would deny it,

2943
02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:06.170
'zounds, I'd make him eat a piece of my sword.

2944
02:23:06.170 --> 02:23:09.170
This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.

2945
02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:11.530
It is the strangest fellow, brother John.

2946
02:23:11.530 --> 02:23:16.700
Come; bring your luggage nobly on your back.

2947
02:23:16.700 --> 02:23:19.370
If a lie may do thee grace,

2948
02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:22.370
I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.

2949
02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:27.930
The trumpet sounds retreat.

2950
02:23:27.930 --> 02:23:30.670
The day is ours.

2951
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:34.370
Come, brother; let us to the highest of the field

2952
02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:36.300
to see what friends are living, who are dead.

2953
02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:40.770
I'll follow, as they say, for reward.

2954
02:23:40.770 --> 02:23:44.600
He that rewards me, God reward him.

2955
02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:48.730
If I do grow great, I'll grow less,

2956
02:23:48.730 --> 02:23:51.430
for I'll purge and leave sack

2957
02:23:51.430 --> 02:23:55.070
and live cleanly as a nobleman should do.

2958
02:24:00.470 --> 02:24:03.670
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.

2959
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:06.570
Ill-spirited Worcester.

2960
02:24:06.570 --> 02:24:12.330
Did not we send grace, pardon, and terms of love to all of you?

2961
02:24:12.330 --> 02:24:16.130
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary,

2962
02:24:16.130 --> 02:24:19.900
misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?

2963
02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:22.830
Three knights upon our party slain today,

2964
02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:26.270
a noble earl and many a creature else

2965
02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:29.430
had been alive this hour if, like a Christian,

2966
02:24:29.430 --> 02:24:32.070
thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies

2967
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:33.400
true intelligence.

2968
02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.170
What I have done, my safety urged me to,

2969
02:24:38.170 --> 02:24:40.870
and I embrace my fortune patiently,

2970
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:44.330
since not to be avoided it falls on me.

2971
02:24:44.330 --> 02:24:49.530
Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too.

2972
02:24:49.530 --> 02:24:53.600
Other offenders, we will pause upon.

2973
02:24:56.170 --> 02:24:57.370
How goes the field?

2974
02:24:57.370 --> 02:25:00.270
The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw

2975
02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:02.670
the fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,

2976
02:25:02.670 --> 02:25:03.730
the noble Percy slain,

2977
02:25:03.730 --> 02:25:05.800
and all his men upon the foot of fear,

2978
02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:07.670
fled with the rest.

2979
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:09.230
Falling from a hill,

2980
02:25:09.230 --> 02:25:11.830
he was so bruised that the pursuers took him.

2981
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:13.930
At my tent, the Douglas is,

2982
02:25:13.930 --> 02:25:15.900
and I beseech your grace I may dispose of him.

2983
02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:18.130
With all my heart.

2984
02:25:20.830 --> 02:25:22.000
Brother John of Lancaster, to you,

2985
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:23.770
this honorable bounty shall belong.

2986
02:25:23.770 --> 02:25:25.030
Go to the Douglas,

2987
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:27.630
deliver him up to his pleasure, ransomless and free.

2988
02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:30.670
His valor shown upon our crests today

2989
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:33.100
hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds

2990
02:25:33.100 --> 02:25:35.370
even in the bosom of our adversaries.

2991
02:25:35.370 --> 02:25:37.600
I thank your grace for this high courtesy,

2992
02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:40.400
which I shall give away immediately.

2993
02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:45.770
Then this remains: that we divide our power.

2994
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:49.230
You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland

2995
02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:52.830
towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed

2996
02:25:52.830 --> 02:25:55.270
to meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,

2997
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:58.100
who, as we hear, are busily in arms.

2998
02:25:58.100 --> 02:26:02.930
Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales

2999
02:26:02.930 --> 02:26:05.730
to fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.

3000
02:26:05.730 --> 02:26:09.500
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,

3001
02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:12.700
meeting the cheque of such another day.

3002
02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:16.830
And since this business so fair is done,

3003
02:26:16.830 --> 02:26:21.900
let us not leave till all our own be won.

3004
02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:16.800
