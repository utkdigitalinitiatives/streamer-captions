00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:00.400


2
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.600
I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon

3
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.470
comes this night to Messina.

4
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.730
He is very near by this:

5
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.400
he was not three leagues off when I left him.

6
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.430
How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?

7
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.700
But few of any sort, and none of name.

8
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.970
A victory is twice itself when the achiever

9
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.470
brings home full numbers.

10
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.670
I find here that Don Peter hath bestowed much honour

11
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.100
on a young Florentine called Claudio.

12
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.000
Much deserved on his part

13
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.030
and equally remembered by Don Pedro:

14
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.470
he hath borne himself beyond the promise of his age,

15
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.630
doing, in the figure of a lamb,

16
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.170
the feats of a lion:

17
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.270
I pray you,

18
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.230
is Signior Mountanto returned from the wars or no?

19
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.370
I know none of that name, lady:

20
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.070
there was none such in the army of any sort.

21
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.500
What is he that you ask for, niece?

22
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.670
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

23
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.830
O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.

24
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.930
I pray you, how many hath he killed and eaten in these wars?

25
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.470
But how many hath he killed?

26
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.430
for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

27
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.300
Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;

28
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.300
but he'll be meet with you,

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.330
I doubt it not.

30
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.670
He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

31
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.900
You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:

32
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.530
he is a very valiant trencherman;

33
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.570
he hath an excellent stomach.

34
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.770
And a good soldier too, lady.

35
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.830
And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?

36
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.900
A lord to a lord, a man to a man;

37
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.970
stuffed with all honourable virtues.

38
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.900
It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:

39
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.370
but for the stuffing,

40
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.530
-well, we are all mortal.

41
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.470
You must not, sir, mistake my niece.

42
00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.130
There is a kind of merry war betwixt

43
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.530
Signior Benedick and her:

44
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.200
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them.

45
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.570
Alas! he gets nothing by that.

46
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.800
In our last conflict four of his five wits went halting off,

47
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.000
and now is the whole man governed with one:

48
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.530
so that if he have wit enough to keep himself warm,

49
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.530
let him bear it for a difference

50
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.930
between himself and his horse;

51
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.430
for it is all the wealth that he hath left,

52
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.630
to be known a reasonable creature.

53
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.130
Who is his companion now?

54
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.030
He hath every month a new sworn brother.

55
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.000
Is't possible?

56
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.570
Very easily possible:

57
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.230
he wears his faith but as the fashion of his hat;

58
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.630
it ever changes with the next block.

59
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.170
I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.

60
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.500
No; an he were, I would burn my study.

61
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.700
But, I pray you, who is his companion?

62
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.930
Is there no young squarer now

63
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.630
that will make a voyage with him to the devil?

64
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.470
He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

65
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.030
O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease:

66
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.230
he is sooner caught than the pestilence,

67
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.030
and the taker runs presently mad.

68
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.770
God help the noble Claudio!

69
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.900
if he have caught the Benedick,

70
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.300
it will cost him a thousand pound ere a' be cured.

71
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.370
I will hold friends with you, lady.

72
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.000
Do, good friend.

73
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.270
You will never run mad, niece.

74
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.330
No, not till a hot January.

75
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.000
Don Pedro is approached.

76
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.770
(♪music)

77
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.630
Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your trouble:

78
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.000
the fashion of the world is to avoid cost,

79
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.500
and you encounter it.

80
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.670
Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of your grace:

81
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.600
for trouble being gone, comfort should remain;

82
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.870
but when you depart from me,

83
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.200
sorrow abides and happiness takes his leave.

84
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.100
You embrace your charge too willingly.

85
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.470
I think this is your daughter.

86
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.200
Her mother hath many times told me so.

87
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.470
Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?

88
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.700
Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.

89
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.800
You have it full, Benedick:

90
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.070
Truly, the lady fathers herself.

91
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.730
Be happy, lady; for you are like an honourable father.

92
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.830
If Signior Leonato be her father,

93
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.600
she would not have his head on her shoulders for all Messina,

94
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.400
as like him as she is.

95
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.030
I wonder that you will still be talking,

96
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.500
Signior Benedick: nobody marks you.

97
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.800
What, my dear Lady Disdain!

98
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.730
are you yet living?

99
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.330
Is it possible disdain should die

100
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
while she hath such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?

101
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.230
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain,

102
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.530
if you come in her presence.

103
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.500
Then is courtesy a turncoat.

104
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.070
But it is certain I am loved of all ladies,

105
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.500
only you excepted:

106
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.130
and I would I could find in my heart

107
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.270
that I had not a hard heart; for, truly, I love none.

108
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.200
A dear happiness to women: they would else have been

109
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.130
troubled with a pernicious suitor.

110
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.700
I thank God and my cold blood,

111
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.630
I am of your humour for that:

112
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.630
I had rather hear my dog bark at a crow

113
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.600
than a man swear he loves me.

114
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.570
God keep your ladyship still in that mind!

115
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.730
so some gentleman or other shall 'scape

116
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.400
a predestinate scratched face.

117
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.400
Scratching could not make it worse,

118
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.670
an 'twere such a face as yours were.

119
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.330
Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.

120
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.270
A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.

121
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.130
I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,

122
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.030
and so good a continuer.

123
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.900
But keep your way, i' God's name;

124
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.200
I have done.

125
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:54.000
You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.

126
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.200
That is the sum of all, Leonato.

127
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.100
Signior Claudio and Signior Benedick,

128
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.300
my dear friend Leonato hath invited you all.

129
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.670
I tell him we shall stay here at the least a month;

130
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.000
and he heartily prays some occasion may detain us longer.

131
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.800
I dare swear he is no hypocrite,

132
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.270
but prays from his heart.

133
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.970
If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.

134
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.570
Let me bid you welcome, my lord:

135
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.830
being reconciled to the prince your brother,

136
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.700
I owe you all duty.

137
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.200
I thank you: I am not of many words,

138
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.600
but I thank you.

139
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.230
Please it your grace lead on?

140
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.600
Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.

141
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.100
Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?

142
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.300
I noted her not; but I looked on her.

143
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.270
Is she not a modest young lady?

144
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.270
Do you question me, as an honest man should do,

145
00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.500
for my simple true judgment;

146
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.370
or would you have me speak after my custom,

147
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.230
as being a professed tyrant to their sex?

148
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.670
No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.

149
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.700
Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high praise,

150
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.300
too brown for a fair praise and too little for a great praise:

151
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.970
only this commendation I can afford her,

152
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.530
that were she other than she is,

153
00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.030
she were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is,

154
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.630
I do not like her.

155
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.700
Thou thinkest I am in sport:

156
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.230
I pray thee tell me truly how thou likest her.

157
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.670
Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?

158
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.030
Can the world buy such a jewel?

159
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.200
In mine eye she is the sweetest lady

160
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.400
that ever I looked on.

161
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.700
I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such matter:

162
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.930
there's her cousin,

163
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.830
an she were not possessed with a fury,

164
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.430
exceeds her as much in beauty as the first of May

165
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.070
doth the last of December.

166
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.470
But I hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?

167
00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.470
I would scarce trust myself,

168
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.500
though I had sworn the contrary,

169
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.900
if Hero would be my wife.

170
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.130
Is't come to this?

171
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.500
In faith, hath not the world one man

172
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.930
but he will wear his cap with suspicion?

173
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.170
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?

174
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.200
Go to, i' faith;

175
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.970
an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck into a yoke,

176
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.800
wear the print of it and sigh away Sundays.

177
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.700
Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.

178
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.270
What secret hath held you here,

179
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.770
that you followed not to Leonato's?

180
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.600
I would your grace would constrain me to tell.

181
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.700
I charge thee on thy allegiance.

182
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:30.300
You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb man;

183
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.500
I would have you think so;

184
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.730
but, on my allegiance,

185
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.470
mark you, on my allegiance.

186
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:38.870
He is in love.

187
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.700
With who?

188
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.770
now that is your grace's part.

189
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.800
Mark how short his answer is;

190
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.570
-With Hero, Leonato's short daughter.

191
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.230
If this were so, so were it uttered.

192
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.970
Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so,

193
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.370
nor 'twas not so, but, indeed,

194
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.100
God forbid it should be so.'

195
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.430
If my passion change not shortly,

196
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.270
God forbid it should be otherwise.

197
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.730
Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.

198
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.370
You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

199
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.200
By my troth, I speak my thought.

200
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.670
And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

201
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.200
And, by my two faiths and troths,

202
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.530
my lord, I spoke mine.

203
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.370
That I love her, I feel.

204
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.570
That she is worthy, I know.

205
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.070
That I neither feel how she should be loved

206
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.200
nor know how she should be worthy,

207
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.170
is the opinion that fire cannot melt out of me:

208
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.900
I will die in it at the stake.

209
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.670
Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic

210
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.270
in the despite of beauty.

211
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.570
And never could maintain his part

212
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.170
but in the force of his will.

213
00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:28.830
That a woman conceived me, I thank her;

214
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.130
that she brought me up,

215
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:33.230
I likewise give her most humble thanks:

216
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.330
but all women shall pardon me.

217
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.500
Because I will not do them the wrong to mistrust any,

218
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.330
I will do myself the right to trust none;

219
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:43.130
and the fine is, for the which I may go the finer,

220
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.430
I will live a bachelor.

221
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.700
I shall see thee, ere I die,

222
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.230
look pale with love.

223
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.630
With anger, with sickness, or with hunger,

224
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.300
my lord, not with love:

225
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.000
prove that ever I lose more blood with love

226
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.030
than I will get again with drinking,

227
00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.400
pick out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen

228
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.130
and hang me up at the door of a brothel-house

229
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.370
for the sign of blind Cupid.

230
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.600
Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith,

231
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.570
thou wilt prove a notable argument.

232
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.830
If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot at me;

233
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.800
and he that hits me, let him be clapped on the shoulder,

234
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.800
and called Adam.

235
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.030
Well, as time shall try:

236
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.530
'In time the savage bull doth bear the yoke.'

237
00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.430
The savage bull may;

238
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.670
but if ever the sensible Benedick bear it,

239
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.470
pluck off the bull's horns and set them in my forehead:

240
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.000
and let me be vilely painted,

241
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and in such great letters as they write

242
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.530
'Here is good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign

243
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.730
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'

244
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.670
Well, you temporize with the hours.

245
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:38.230
In the meantime, good Signior Benedick,

246
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.800
repair to Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him

247
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.030
I will not fail him at supper;

248
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.530
for indeed he hath made great preparation.

249
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.900
I have almost matter enough in me for such an embassage;

250
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.570
and so I commit you--

251
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.600
To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,

252
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.170
- The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.

253
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.870
Mock not, mock not.

254
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.030
ere you flout old ends any further,

255
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:07.930
examine your conscience: and so I leave you.

256
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:12.130
My liege, your highness now may do me good.

257
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:15.670
My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,

258
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.170
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn

259
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.830
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.

260
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:28.500
Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

261
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.500
No child but Hero; she's his only heir.

262
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.570
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

263
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.900
O, my lord, When you went onward on this ended action,

264
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.330
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,

265
00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.630
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand

266
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.070
Than to drive liking to the name of love:

267
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.570
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts

268
00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.870
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms

269
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.430
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,

270
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.530
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,

271
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.500
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.

272
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.570
Thou wilt be like a lover presently

273
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.130
And tire the hearer with a book of words.

274
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.370
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,

275
00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.770
And I will break with her and with her father,

276
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:19.300
And thou shalt have her.

277
00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.530
Was't not to this end

278
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.300
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?

279
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.670
How sweetly you do minister to love,

280
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.830
That know love's grief by his complexion!

281
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.570
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,

282
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.500
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.

283
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.070
What need the bridge much broader than the flood?

284
00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.100
The fairest grant is the necessity.

285
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.570
Look, what will serve is fit:

286
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:46.170
'tis once, thou lovest, And I will fit thee with the remedy.

287
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.300
I know we shall have revelling to-night:

288
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.300
I will assume thy part in some disguise

289
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.170
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,

290
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.930
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart

291
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.930
And take her hearing prisoner with the force

292
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.570
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:

293
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:07.430
Then after to her father will I break;

294
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:12.430
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.

295
00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.130
In practise let us put it presently.

296
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:20.970
How now, brother!

297
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:21.970
Where is my cousin?

298
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.330
hath he provided this music?

299
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.100
He is very busy about it.

300
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.730
But, brother, I can tell you strange news

301
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.700
that you yet dreamt not of.

302
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.870
Are they good?

303
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.370
As the event stamps them: but they have a good cover;

304
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.470
they show well outward.

305
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.670
The prince and Count Claudio,

306
00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:41.430
walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine orchard,

307
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.230
were thus much overheard by a man of mine:

308
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.700
the prince discovered to Claudio

309
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.530
that he loved my niece your daughter

310
00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.270
and meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance:

311
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:54.370
and if he found her accordant,

312
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.230
he meant to take the present time by the top

313
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.170
and instantly break with you of it.

314
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.770
Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?

315
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.070
A good sharp fellow: I will send for him;

316
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.270
and question him yourself.

317
00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.900
No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear itself:

318
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.000
but I will acquaint my daughter withal,

319
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.330
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,

320
00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.600
if peradventure this be true.

321
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.770
Go you and tell her of it.

322
00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.670
Cousins, you know what you have to do.

323
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.600
O, I cry you mercy, friend;

324
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.330
go you with me, and I will use your skill.

325
00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.400
Good cousin, have a care this busy time.

326
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.500
What the good-year, my lord!

327
00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.900
why are you thus out of measure sad?

328
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.830
There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;

329
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.830
therefore the sadness is without limit.

330
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.100
You should hear reason.

331
00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.000
And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?

332
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.670
If not a present remedy, at least a patient sufferance.

333
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.770
I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,

334
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.500
born under Saturn, goest about

335
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.400
to apply a moral medicine to a mortifying mischief.

336
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.170
I cannot hide what I am: I must be sad when I have cause

337
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.930
and smile at no man's jests,

338
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.530
eat when I have stomach and wait for no man's leisure,

339
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.870
sleep when I am drowsy and tend on no man's business,

340
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.230
laugh when I am merry and claw no man in his humour.

341
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.200
Yea, but you must not make the full show of this

342
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.630
till you may do it without controlment.

343
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.270
You have of late stood out against your brother,

344
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.400
and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace;

345
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.730
where it is impossible you should take true root

346
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.530
but by the fair weather that you make yourself:

347
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:53.330
it is needful that you frame the season for your own harvest.

348
00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.700
I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in his grace,

349
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.070
and it better fits my blood to be disdained of all

350
00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:06.070
than to fashion a carriage to rob love from any:

351
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.930
in this, though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man,

352
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.230
it must not be denied but I am a plain-dealing villain.

353
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:18.230
I am trusted with a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog;

354
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.070
therefore I have decreed not to sing in my cage.

355
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.830
If I had my mouth, I would bite;

356
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:32.730
if I had my liberty, I would do my liking:

357
00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:36.700
in the meantime let me be that I am and seek not to alter me.

358
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.600
Can you make no use of your discontent?

359
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.830
I make all use of it, for I use it only.

360
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.500
Who comes here?

361
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.270
What news, Borachio?

362
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.830
I came yonder from a great supper:

363
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.200
the prince your brother is royally entertained by Leonato:

364
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.230
and I can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.

365
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.930
Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?

366
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.030
What is he for a fool

367
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.430
that betroths himself to unquietness?

368
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:12.230
Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

369
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:13.830
Who?

370
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:15.500
the most exquisite Claudio?

371
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.330
Even he.

372
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.230
A proper squire!

373
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.200
And who, and who?

374
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.430
which way looks he?

375
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.700
Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.

376
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.530
A very forward March-chick!

377
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:32.670
How came you to this?

378
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.600
Being entertained for a perfumer,

379
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.730
as I was smoking a musty room,

380
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.230
comes me the prince and Claudio,

381
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.930
hand in hand in sad conference:

382
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.070
I whipt me behind the arras; and there heard it agreed upon

383
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.930
that the prince should woo Hero for himself,

384
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:54.300
and having obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.

385
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.930
Come, come, let us thither:

386
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.300
this may prove food to my displeasure.

387
00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:05.100
That young start-up hath all the glory of my overthrow:

388
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.270
if I can cross him any way,

389
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.700
I bless myself every way.

390
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.400
You are both sure, and will assist me?

391
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.500
To the death, my lord.

392
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.630
Let us to the great supper:

393
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.870
their cheer is the greater that I am subdued.

394
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.500
Would the cook were of my mind!

395
00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.570
Shall we go prove what's to be done?

396
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:28.570
We'll wait upon your lordship.

397
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.230
Was not Count John here at supper?

398
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.670
I saw him not.

399
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.800
How tartly that gentleman looks!

400
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.930
I never can see him but I am heart-burned an hour after.

401
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.200
He is of a very melancholy disposition.

402
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.830
He were an excellent man that were made just

403
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.570
in the midway between him and Benedick:

404
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:57.530
the one is too like an image and says nothing,

405
00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.330
and the other too like my lady's eldest son,

406
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.430
evermore tattling.

407
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.070
Then half Signior Benedick's tongue

408
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.170
in Count John's mouth, and half Count John's melancholy

409
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.730
in Signior Benedick's face,--

410
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.430
With a good leg and a good foot, uncle,

411
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:10.670
and money enough in his purse,

412
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.600
such a man would win any woman in the world,

413
00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.200
if a' could get her good-will.

414
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.730
By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a husband,

415
00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.500
if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

416
00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.270
In faith, she's too curst.

417
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.370
Too curst is more than curst:

418
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.270
I shall lessen God's sending that way; for it is said,

419
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.070
'God sends a curst cow short horns;

420
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.800
but to a cow too curst he sends none.

421
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.970
So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.

422
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.100
Just, if he send me no husband;

423
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.230
for the which blessing

424
00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.500
I am at him upon my knees every morning and evening.

425
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.400
Lord, I could not endure a husband

426
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.270
with a beard on his face:

427
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.630
I had rather lie in the woollen.

428
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.670
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.

429
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.270
What should I do with him?

430
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.370
dress him in my apparel and make him my waiting-gentlewoman?

431
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.200
He that hath a beard is more than a youth,

432
00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.370
and he that hath no beard is less than a man:

433
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.670
and he that is more than a youth is not for me,

434
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.670
and he that is less than a man,

435
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.530
I am not for him:

436
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.800
therefore, I will even take sixpence

437
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.130
in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his apes into hell.

438
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.500
Well, then, go you into hell?

439
00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.270
No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet me,

440
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.330
like an old cuckold, with horns on his head,

441
00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.500
and say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice,

442
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:24.700
get you to heaven;

443
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.730
here's no place for you maids:' so deliver I up my apes,

444
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.500
and away to Saint Peter for the heavens;

445
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.600
he shows me where the bachelors sit,

446
00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.170
and there live we as merry as the day is long.

447
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.270
Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled by your father.

448
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.100
Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy

449
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.330
and say 'Father, as it please you.'

450
00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:47.430
But yet for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow,

451
00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:50.330
or else make another curtsy and say 'Father,

452
00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:52.300
as it please me.'

453
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.770
Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.

454
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.430
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.

455
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:02.170
Would it not grieve a woman to be overmastered

456
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:04.630
by a pierce of valiant dust?

457
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:08.800
to make an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?

458
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.800
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;

459
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.830
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.

460
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.770
Daughter, remember what I told you:

461
00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:21.830
if the prince do solicit you in that kind,

462
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.570
you know your answer.

463
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:24.870
The fault will be in the music, cousin,

464
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.870
if you be not wooed in good time:

465
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.700
if the prince be too important, tell him there is measure

466
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.200
in every thing and so dance out the answer.

467
00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.670
For, hear me, Hero: wooing,

468
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.630
wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,

469
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.470
a measure, and a cinque pace:

470
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.300
the first suit is hot and hasty, like a Scotch jig,

471
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.970
and full as fantastical; the wedding,

472
00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.230
mannerly-modest, as a measure,

473
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.730
full of state and ancientry;

474
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.900
and then comes repentance

475
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.200
and, with his bad legs, falls into the cinque pace

476
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.530
faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.

477
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.400
Neice, you apprehend passing shrewdly.

478
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.700
I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.

479
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.130
The revellers are entering, brother:

480
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.570
make good room.

481
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.070
(♪music for dancing)

482
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.530
Lady, will you walk about with your friend?

483
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:36.170
So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,

484
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.370
I am yours for the walk;

485
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.430
especially when I walk away.

486
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.770
With me in your company?

487
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.200
I may say so, when I please.

488
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.430
And when please you to say so?

489
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.170
When I like your favour;

490
00:22:54.170 --> 00:23:00.270
for God defend the lute should be like the case!

491
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.970
My visor is Philemon's roof;

492
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:06.730
within the house is Jove.

493
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.370
Why, then, your visor should be thatched.

494
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.400
Speak low, if you speak love.

495
00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:24.100
Well, I would you did like me.

496
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.700
So would not I, for your own sake;

497
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.670
for I have many ill-qualities.

498
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.930
Which is one?

499
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.330
I say my prayers aloud.

500
00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:38.570
I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.

501
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.930
God match me with a good dancer!

502
00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.600
Amen.

503
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.300
And God take him out of my sight when the dance is done!

504
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.570
Answer, clerk.

505
00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:51.400
No more words: the clerk is answered.

506
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.270
I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.

507
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.500
At a word, I am not.

508
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.900
I know you by the waggling of your head.

509
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.370
To tell you true, I counterfeit him.

510
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.170
You could never do him so ill-well,

511
00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.700
unless you were the very man.

512
00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.430
Here's his dry hand up and down: you are he, you are he.

513
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:14.230
At a word, I am not.

514
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.930
Will you not tell me who told you so?

515
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.030
No, you shall pardon me.

516
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.530
Nor will you not tell me who you are?

517
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.500
Not now.

518
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.830
That I was disdainful,

519
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.870
and that I had my good wit out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'

520
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.370
--well this was Signior Benedick that said so.

521
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:52.430
What's he?

522
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.800
I am sure you know him well enough.

523
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.730
Not I, believe me.

524
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.230
Did he never make you laugh?

525
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.800
I pray you, what is he?

526
00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.200
Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;

527
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.400
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:

528
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.630
none but libertines delight in him;

529
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.000
and the commendation is not in his wit,

530
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.970
but in his villany; for he both pleases men

531
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.670
and angers them, and then they laugh at him and beat him.

532
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:20.000
I am sure he is in the fleet: I would he had boarded me.

533
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.430
When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.

534
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.530
Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;

535
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.300
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,

536
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.030
strikes him into melancholy;

537
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.800
and then there's a partridge wing saved,

538
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.970
for the fool will eat no supper that night.

539
00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.630
We must follow the leaders.

540
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:36.730
In every good thing.

541
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.230
Nay, if they lead to any ill,

542
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.800
I will leave them at the next turning.

543
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.670
Sure my brother is amorous on Hero

544
00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:34.070
and hath withdrawn her father to break with him about it.

545
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.700
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.

546
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.230
And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.

547
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.800
Are not you Signior Benedick?

548
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.470
You know me well; I am he.

549
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.630
Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:

550
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:56.770
he is enamoured on Hero;

551
00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.670
I pray you, dissuade him from her:

552
00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:01.470
she is no equal for his birth:

553
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.070
you may do the part of an honest man in it.

554
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.300
How know you he loves her?

555
00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.730
I heard him swear his affection.

556
00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:12.470
So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.

557
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.330
Come, let us to the banquet.

558
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.230
Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,

559
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:32.300
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.

560
00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:35.900
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.

561
00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.970
Friendship is constant in all other things

562
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.030
Save in the office and affairs of love:

563
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.300
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;

564
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.500
Let every eye negotiate for itself

565
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.700
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch

566
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:54.670
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.

567
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.200
This is an accident of hourly proof,

568
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.970
Which I mistrusted not.

569
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:02.430
Farewell, therefore, Hero!

570
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.130
Count Claudio?

571
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.200
Yea, the same.

572
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.100
Come, will you go with me?

573
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.300
Whither?

574
00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:17.570
Even to the next willow, about your own business, county.

575
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.900
What fashion will you wear the garland of?

576
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.670
about your neck, like an usurer's chain?

577
00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.200
or under your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf?

578
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.230
You must wear it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.

579
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.400
I wish him joy of her.

580
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.200
Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier:

581
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.230
so they sell bullocks.

582
00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.200
But did you think the prince would have served you thus?

583
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.300
I pray you, leave me.

584
00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.800
Ho! now you strike like the blind man:

585
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.170
'twas the boy that stole your meat,

586
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.770
and you'll beat the post.

587
00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.170
If it will not be, I'll leave you.

588
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.770
Alas, poor hurt fowl!

589
00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:53.730
now will he creep into sedges.

590
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.200
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me,

591
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.400
and not know me!

592
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.170
The prince's fool!

593
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:07.500
Ha?

594
00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.370
It may be I go under that title because I am merry.

595
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.170
Yea, but so I am apt to do myself wrong;

596
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.400
I am not so reputed:

597
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.030
it is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice

598
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.030
that puts the world into her person and so gives me out.

599
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.700
Well, I'll be revenged as I may.

600
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.300
Now, signior, where's the count?

601
00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.230
did you see him?

602
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:33.130
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a warren:

603
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.830
I told him, and I think I told him true,

604
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.870
that your grace had got the good will of this young lady;

605
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.730
and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,

606
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.100
either to make him a garland,

607
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.370
as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod,

608
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.930
as being worthy to be whipped.

609
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.070
To be whipped!

610
00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:47.970
What's his fault?

611
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.330
The flat transgression of a schoolboy,

612
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.930
who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest,

613
00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.270
shows it his companion, and he steals it.

614
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.600
Wilt thou make a trust a transgression?

615
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.870
The transgression is in the stealer.

616
00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:00.700
Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,

617
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.630
and the garland too;

618
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:02.870
for the garland he might have worn himself,

619
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.870
and the rod he might have bestowed on you,

620
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.800
who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.

621
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.470
I will but teach them to sing,

622
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.830
and restore them to the owner.

623
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.630
If their singing answer your saying,

624
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:22.670
by my faith, you say honestly.

625
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:27.570
The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you:

626
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.330
the gentleman that danced with her

627
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:34.400
told her she is much wronged by you.

628
00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:41.030
O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!

629
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.800
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have answered her;

630
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.700
my very visor began to assume life and scold with her.

631
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:51.000
She told me, not thinking I had been myself,

632
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.970
that I was the prince's jester,

633
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.470
that I was duller than a great thaw;

634
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.800
huddling jest upon jest with such impossible

635
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.170
conveyance upon me that I stood like a man at a mark,

636
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.100
with a whole army shooting at me.

637
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:08.130
She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:

638
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.730
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,

639
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.930
there were no living near her;

640
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.900
she would infect to the north star.

641
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.130
I would not marry her, though she were endowed

642
00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:21.930
with all that Adam bad left him before he transgressed:

643
00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:25.070
Come, talk not of her:

644
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.270
you shall find her the infernal Ate in good apparel.

645
00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.800
I would to God some scholar would conjure her;

646
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.570
for certainly, while she is here,

647
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.970
a man may live as quiet in hell as in a sanctuary;

648
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.530
and people sin upon purpose,

649
00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.230
because they would go thither;

650
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.130
so, indeed, all disquiet, horror and perturbation follows her.

651
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:48.130
Look, here she comes.

652
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:53.570
Will your grace command me any service to the world's end?

653
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:55.270
I will go on the slightest errand now

654
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:57.970
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;

655
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:00.170
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now

656
00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:02.030
from the furthest inch of Asia,

657
00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.430
bring you the length of Prester John's foot,

658
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.470
fetch you a hair off the great Cham's beard,

659
00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.830
do you any embassage to the Pigmies,

660
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:14.100
rather than hold three words' conference with this harpy.

661
00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.330
You have no employment for me?

662
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:21.030
None, but to desire your good company.

663
00:32:24.170 --> 00:32:31.670
O God, sir, here's a dish I love not:

664
00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.400
I cannot endure my Lady Tongue.

665
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.930
Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of Signior Benedick.

666
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:52.230
Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile;

667
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.200
and I gave him use for it,

668
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.730
a double heart for his single one:

669
00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.970
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,

670
00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:04.100
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.

671
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.730
You have put him down, lady,

672
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:06.800
you have put him down.

673
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.200
So I would not he should do me,

674
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.670
my lord, lest I should prove the mother of fools.

675
00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:16.070
I have brought Count Claudio,

676
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.530
whom you sent me to seek.

677
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.970
Why, how now, count!

678
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.170
wherefore are you sad?

679
00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:24.930
Not sad, my lord.

680
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:26.370
How then? sick?

681
00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:27.900
Neither, my lord.

682
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:29.930
The count is neither sad, nor sick,

683
00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:35.470
nor merry, nor well; but civil count, civil as an orange,

684
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.270
and something of that jealous complexion.

685
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:41.200
I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;

686
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.370
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so,

687
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:46.900
his conceit is false.

688
00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.470
Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name,

689
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:56.230
and fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,

690
00:33:56.230 --> 00:34:00.870
and his good will obtained: name the day of marriage,

691
00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.700
and God give thee joy!

692
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.070
Count, take of me my daughter,

693
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:09.670
and with her my fortunes: his grace hath made the match,

694
00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:13.870
and an grace say Amen to it.

695
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.470
Speak, count, 'tis your cue.

696
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:21.770
Silence is the perfectest herald of joy:

697
00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:26.830
I were but little happy, if I could say how much.

698
00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:32.170
Lady, as you are mine, I am yours:

699
00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:39.300
I give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange.

700
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.300
Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot,

701
00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.170
stop his mouth with a kiss,

702
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.900
and let not him speak neither.

703
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.270
In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.

704
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.770
Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool,

705
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.800
it keeps on the windy side of care.

706
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.270
My cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart.

707
00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:01.370
And so she doth, cousin.

708
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:05.270
Good Lord, for alliance!

709
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.570
Thus goes every one to the world but I,

710
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:12.130
I may sit in a corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!

711
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.000
Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

712
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.370
I would rather have one of your father's getting.

713
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.700
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you?

714
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:20.970
Your father got excellent husbands,

715
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:22.800
if a maid could come by them.

716
00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.630
Will you have me, lady?

717
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.830
No, my lord, unless I might have another for working-days:

718
00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:32.670
your grace is too costly to wear every day.

719
00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.770
But, I beseech your grace, pardon me:

720
00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:39.030
I was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

721
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.830
Your silence most offends me,

722
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.230
and to be merry best becomes you;

723
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.870
for, out of question, you were born in a merry hour.

724
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:50.070
No, sure, my lord, my mother cried;

725
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.330
but then there was a star danced,

726
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:54.500
and under that was I born.

727
00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.900
Cousins, God give you joy!

728
00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:03.530
Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?

729
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.500
I cry you mercy, uncle.

730
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:09.470
By your grace's pardon.

731
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.530
By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.

732
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.870
There's little of the melancholy element in her, my lord:

733
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.700
she is never sad but when she sleeps,

734
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.000
and not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,

735
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.500
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness

736
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.430
and waked herself with laughing.

737
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:32.300
She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

738
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:37.300
O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.

739
00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.030
She were an excellent wife for Benedict.

740
00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.100
O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,

741
00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:44.900
they would talk themselves mad.

742
00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.400
County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?

743
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.900
To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches

744
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.370
till love have all his rites.

745
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.330
Not till Monday, my dear son,

746
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.970
which is hence a just seven-night;

747
00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:01.100
and a time too brief, too, to have all things answer my mind.

748
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:04.200
Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:

749
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.900
but, I warrant thee, Claudio,

750
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.070
the time shall not go dully by us.

751
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:13.900
I will in the interim undertake one of Hercules' labours;

752
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.900
which is, to bring Signior Benedick and the Lady Beatrice

753
00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.470
into a mountain of affection the one with the other.

754
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.730
I would fain have it a match,

755
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.570
and I doubt not but to fashion it,

756
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.030
if you three will but minister such assistance

757
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.570
as I shall give you direction.

758
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.870
My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten nights' watchings.

759
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.900
And I, my lord.

760
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.800
And you too, gentle Hero?

761
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.830
I will do any modest office,

762
00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.330
my lord, to help my cousin to a good husband.

763
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.330
And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband

764
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:42.500
that I know.

765
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:48.430
Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble strain,

766
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:51.230
of approved valour and confirmed honesty.

767
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.430
I will teach you how to humour your cousin,

768
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:56.300
that she shall fall in love with Benedick;

769
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.970
and I, with your two helps,

770
00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.570
will so practise on Benedick that,

771
00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.270
in despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach,

772
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:06.330
he shall fall in love with Beatrice.

773
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:10.800
If we can do this, Cupid is no longer an archer:

774
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.770
his glory shall be ours, for we are the only love-gods.

775
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:20.930
Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.

776
00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.470
It is so;

777
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:34.330
the Count Claudio shall marry the daughter of Leonato.

778
00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.900
Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.

779
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.870
Any bar, any cross,

780
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.500
any impediment will be medicinable to me:

781
00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.100
I am sick in displeasure to him,

782
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.930
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection

783
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:50.800
ranges evenly with mine.

784
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.430
How canst thou cross this marriage?

785
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.130
Not honestly, my lord;

786
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.700
but so covertly that no dishonesty shall appear in me.

787
00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.030
Show me briefly how.

788
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.770
I think I told your lordship a year since,

789
00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:04.130
how much I am in the favour of Margaret,

790
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.200
the waiting gentlewoman to Hero.

791
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.270
I remember.

792
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.830
I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,

793
00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:13.530
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.

794
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:17.670
What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?

795
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.870
The poison of that lies in you to temper.

796
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:23.000
Go you to the prince your brother;

797
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.130
spare not to tell him that he hath wronged his honour

798
00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.430
in marrying the renowned Claudio

799
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:31.570
--whose estimation do you mightily hold up--

800
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.870
to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.

801
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.700
What proof shall I make of that?

802
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.330
Proof enough to misuse the prince,

803
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:43.270
to vex Claudio, to undo Hero and kill Leonato.

804
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.700
Look you for any other issue?

805
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.930
Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.

806
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.630
Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro

807
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:54.730
and the Count Claudio alone:

808
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:58.330
tell them that you know that Hero loves me;

809
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:02.070
intend a kind of zeal both to the prince and Claudio,

810
00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.870
as, -in love of your brother's honour,

811
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.230
who hath made this match, and his friend's reputation,

812
00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:11.400
who is thus like to be cozened with the semblance of a maid,

813
00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.830
-that you have discovered thus.

814
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:16.870
They will scarcely believe this without trial:

815
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:21.730
offer them instances; which shall bear no less likelihood

816
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.600
than to see me at her chamber-window,

817
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.700
hear me call Margaret Hero,

818
00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.430
hear Margaret term me Borachio;

819
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.000
and bring them to see this

820
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.900
the very night before the intended wedding,

821
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.700
--for in the meantime I will so fashion the matter

822
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.330
that Hero shall be absent,

823
00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.300
-and there shall appear

824
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.200
such seeming truth of Hero's disloyalty

825
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.570
that jealousy shall be called assurance

826
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:49.230
and all the preparation overthrown.

827
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.000
Grow this to what adverse issue it can,

828
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.230
I will put it in practise.

829
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:58.330
Be cunning in the working this,

830
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.100
and thy fee is a thousand ducats.

831
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.270
Be you constant in the accusation,

832
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.630
and my cunning shall not shame me.

833
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:13.400
I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

834
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:25.830
(♪song)

835
00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.830
Boy!

836
00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:06.170
Signior?

837
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.970
In my chamber-window lies a book:

838
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:11.200
bring it hither to me in the orchard.

839
00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:14.600
I am here already, sir.

840
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.670
I know that; but I would have thee hence,

841
00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.000
and here again.

842
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.600
I do much wonder that one man,

843
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.600
seeing how much another man is a fool

844
00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.900
when he dedicates his behaviors to love,

845
00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:37.930
will, after he hath laughed

846
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:39.970
at such shallow follies in others,

847
00:42:39.970 --> 00:42:44.600
become the argument of his own scorn by falling in love:

848
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:47.170
and such a man is Claudio.

849
00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:50.370
I have known when there was no music with him

850
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.030
but the drum and the fife;

851
00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:56.000
and now had he rather hear the tabour and the pipe:

852
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.770
I have known when he would have walked ten mile a-foot

853
00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:01.470
to see a good armour;

854
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:02.670
and now will he lie ten nights awake,

855
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.700
carving the fashion of a new doublet.

856
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.500
He was wont to speak plain and to the purpose,

857
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.070
like an honest man and a soldier;

858
00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:15.700
and now is he turned orthography;

859
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.530
his words are a very fantastical banquet,

860
00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:24.070
just so many strange dishes.

861
00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:28.870
May I be so converted and see with these eyes?

862
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:33.900
I cannot tell; I think not: I will not be sworn,

863
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:36.030
but love may transform me to an oyster;

864
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:37.630
but I'll take my oath on it,

865
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:39.500
till he have made an oyster of me,

866
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.100
he shall never make me such a fool.

867
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:47.670
One woman is fair, yet I am well;

868
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.230
another is wise, yet I am well;

869
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:53.700
another virtuous, yet I am well;

870
00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.930
but till all graces be in one woman,

871
00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:58.700
one woman shall not come in my grace.

872
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.930
Rich she shall be, that's certain;

873
00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.130
wise, or I'll none; virtuous,

874
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:06.830
or I'll never cheapen her; fair,

875
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:09.730
or I'll never look on her; mild,

876
00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:10.830
or come not near me;

877
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:15.970
noble, or not I for an angel; of good discourse,

878
00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:22.030
an excellent musician, and her hair

879
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.630
shall be of what colour it please God.

880
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:26.730
Ha!

881
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.270
the prince and Monsieur Love!

882
00:44:30.270 --> 00:44:33.530
I will hide me in the arbour.

883
00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:38.430
Come, shall we hear this music?

884
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.200
Yea, my good lord.

885
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.730
How still the evening is, As hush'd on purpose

886
00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.830
to grace harmony!

887
00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:48.800
See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

888
00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.430
O, very well, my lord: the music ended,

889
00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.200
We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.

890
00:44:54.430 --> 00:45:00.470
Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.

891
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.500
O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice

892
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.200
To slander music any more than once.

893
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.130
It is the witness still of excellency

894
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:10.570
To put a strange face on his own perfection.

895
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.270
I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.

896
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:19.630
Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.

897
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:30.200
Now, divine air!

898
00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.000
now is his soul ravished!

899
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.200
Is it not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls

900
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.500
out of men's bodies?

901
00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.730
Well, a horn for my money, when all's done.

902
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.830
(♪singing) Men were deceivers ever,

903
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:49.700
foot in sea and one on shore, To one thing constant never:

904
00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:54.630
Then sigh not so, but let them go,

905
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:59.700
And be you blithe and bonny,

906
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:11.000
Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

907
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.230
Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,

908
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:23.070
Of dumps so dull and heavy;

909
00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:27.270
The fraud of men was ever so,

910
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:32.800
Since summer first was leafy:

911
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:43.130
Then sigh not so, And be you blithe and bonny,

912
00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:53.170
Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

913
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:59.970
Converting all your sounds of woe Into Hey nonny, nonny.

914
00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.870
By my troth, a good song.

915
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.300
And an ill singer, my lord.

916
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.870
Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.

917
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.500
An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,

918
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:16.200
they would have hanged him: and I pray God

919
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.400
his bad voice bode no mischief.

920
00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.670
I had as lief have heard the night-raven,

921
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:23.770
come what plague could have come after it.

922
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.770
Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar?

923
00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.670
I pray thee, get us some excellent music;

924
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.400
for to-morrow night we would have it

925
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.000
at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.

926
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.600
The best I can, my lord.

927
00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.130
Do so: farewell.

928
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.400
Come hither, Leonato.

929
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.630
What was it you told me of to-day,

930
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.430
that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick?

931
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.000
O, ay:

932
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.270
stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits.

933
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:57.630
I did never think that lady would have loved any man.

934
00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.870
No, nor I neither; but most wonderful

935
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.930
that she should so dote on Signior Benedick,

936
00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:07.430
whom she hath in all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.

937
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.070
Is't possible?

938
00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.170
Sits the wind in that corner?

939
00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:13.470
By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think of it

940
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.830
but that she loves him with an enraged affection:

941
00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.100
it is past the infinite of thought.

942
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:20.600
May be she doth but counterfeit.

943
00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.070
Faith, like enough.

944
00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.230
O God, counterfeit!

945
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.000
There was never counterfeit of passion

946
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.470
came so near the life of passion as she discovers it.

947
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.470
Why, what effects of passion shows she?

948
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.630
Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.

949
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.900
What effects, my lord?

950
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:40.070
She will sit you, you heard my daughter tell you how.

951
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.100
She did, indeed.

952
00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.670
How, how, pray you?

953
00:48:43.670 --> 00:48:47.030
You amaze me: I would have I thought her spirit

954
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.900
had been invincible against all assaults of affection.

955
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.530
I would have sworn it had, my lord;

956
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.330
especially against Benedick.

957
00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:57.270
I should think this a gull,

958
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.630
but that the white-bearded fellow speaks it:

959
00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:04.530
knavery cannot, sure, hide himself in such reverence.

960
00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.770
He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.

961
00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.030
Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?

962
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:13.930
No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.

963
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.570
'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says:

964
00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.200
'Shall I, says she,

965
00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.100
'that have so oft encountered him with scorn,

966
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.300
write to him that I love him?'

967
00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.530
This says she now when she is beginning to write to him;

968
00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.070
for she'll be up twenty times a night,

969
00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.130
and there will she sit in her smock

970
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:30.930
till she have writ a sheet of paper:

971
00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.700
my daughter tells us all.

972
00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.530
Now you talk of a sheet of paper,

973
00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:36.970
I remember a pretty jest your daughter told us of.

974
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.030
O, when she had writ it and was reading it over,

975
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:43.830
she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?

976
00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:45.630
That.

977
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:48.770
O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;

978
00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:52.100
railed at herself, that she should be so immodest

979
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:54.270
to write to one that she knew would flout her;

980
00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.170
'I measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit;

981
00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.770
for I should flout him, if he writ to me;

982
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.730
yea, though I love him, I should.'

983
00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:04.700
Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,

984
00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.770
beats her heart, tears her hair,

985
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.430
prays, curses; 'O sweet Benedick!

986
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.770
God give me patience!' She doth indeed;

987
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:14.300
my daughter tells us:

988
00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.970
and her ecstasy hath so overcome her

989
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.100
that my daughter is sometime afeared

990
00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.570
she will do a desperate outrage to herself:

991
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:23.870
it is very true.

992
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:26.970
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other,

993
00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.900
if she will not discover it.

994
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:29.800
To what end?

995
00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.830
He would make but a sport of it

996
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.530
and torment the poor lady worse.

997
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.900
An he should, it were an alms to hang him.

998
00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:36.930
She's an excellent sweet lady;

999
00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:38.970
and, out of all suspicion, she is virtuous.

1000
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:40.570
And she is exceeding wise.

1001
00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.230
In every thing but in loving Benedick.

1002
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:49.500
O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender a body,

1003
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.930
we have ten proofs to one that blood hath the victory.

1004
00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.200
I am sorry for her, as I have just cause,

1005
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.270
being her uncle and her guardian.

1006
00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:00.070
I would she had bestowed this dotage on me:

1007
00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.770
I would have daffed all other respects

1008
00:51:02.770 --> 00:51:05.500
and made her half myself.

1009
00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.930
I pray you, tell Benedick of it,

1010
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:09.400
and hear what a' will say.

1011
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:10.900
Were it good, think you?

1012
00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.270
Hero thinks surely she will die;

1013
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:15.870
for she says she will die, if he love her not,

1014
00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:17.900
and she will die, ere she make her love known,

1015
00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.670
and she will die, if he woo her,

1016
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:21.270
rather than she will bate one breath

1017
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.400
of her accustomed crossness.

1018
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:31.830
She doth well: if she should make tender of her love,

1019
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.830
'tis very possible he'll scorn it;

1020
00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:35.170
for the man, as you know all,

1021
00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:36.800
hath a contemptible spirit.

1022
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.570
He is a very proper man.

1023
00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:40.870
He hath indeed a good outward happiness.

1024
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:42.100
Before God!

1025
00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:43.630
and, in my mind, very wise.

1026
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:47.670
He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.

1027
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:50.570
Well I am sorry for your niece.

1028
00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.230
Shall we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?

1029
00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:56.100
Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with good counsel.

1030
00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.130
Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.

1031
00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:03.230
Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:

1032
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:05.170
let it cool the while.

1033
00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:06.900
I love Benedick well;

1034
00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:10.100
and I could wish he would modestly examine himself,

1035
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.700
to see how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

1036
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:17.930
Will you walk, my Lord?

1037
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.670
dinner is ready.

1038
00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:23.300
If he do not dote on her upon this,

1039
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.830
I will never trust my expectation.

1040
00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:28.470
Let there be the same net spread for her;

1041
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.570
and that must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry.

1042
00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:32.730
The sport will be,

1043
00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:35.470
when they hold one an opinion of another's dotage,

1044
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:37.030
and no such matter:

1045
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:38.730
that's the scene that I would see,

1046
00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:42.100
which will be merely a dumb-show.

1047
00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:47.730
Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

1048
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.070
This can be no trick: the conference was sadly borne.

1049
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:14.100
They have the truth of this from Hero.

1050
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:18.330
They seem to pity the lady:

1051
00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:21.670
it seems her affections have their full bent.

1052
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:24.000
Love me!

1053
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.700
why, it must be requited.

1054
00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.100
I hear how I am censured: they say I will bear myself proudly,

1055
00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.000
if I perceive the love come from her;

1056
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.600
they say too that she will rather die

1057
00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.370
than give any sign of affection.

1058
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:48.030
I did never think to marry: I must not seem proud:

1059
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:49.870
happy are they that hear their detractions

1060
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:53.000
and can put them to mending.

1061
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.200
They say the lady is fair; 'tis a truth,

1062
00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:59.730
I can bear them witness; and virtuous;

1063
00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:01.170
'tis so, I cannot reprove it;

1064
00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:09.500
and wise, but for loving me;

1065
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.030
by my troth, it is no addition to her wit,

1066
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:14.630
nor no great argument of her folly,

1067
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:18.830
for I will be horribly in love with her.

1068
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:20.870
I may chance have some odd quirks

1069
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:22.700
and remnants of wit broken on me,

1070
00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:24.870
because I have railed so long against marriage:

1071
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:27.500
but doth not the appetite alter?

1072
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.500
a man loves the meat in his youth

1073
00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:33.730
that he cannot endure in his age.

1074
00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:35.770
Shall quips and sentences

1075
00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:37.130
and these paper bullets of the brain

1076
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.930
awe a man from the career of his humour?

1077
00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:48.030
No, the world must be peopled.

1078
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:50.900
When I said I would die a bachelor,

1079
00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:54.770
I did not think I should live till I were married.

1080
00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:00.400
Here comes Beatrice.

1081
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:01.870
By this day!

1082
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:08.700
she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in her.

1083
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.100
Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.

1084
00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:16.500
Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.

1085
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.370
I took no more pains for those thanks

1086
00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:21.470
than you take pains to thank me: if it had been painful,

1087
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:24.800
I would not have come.

1088
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.770
You take pleasure then in the message?

1089
00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:30.230
Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's point

1090
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:35.570
and choke a daw withal.

1091
00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:40.230
You have no stomach, signior: fare you well.

1092
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.200
Ha!

1093
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.830
'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner;'

1094
00:55:55.830 --> 00:56:00.270
there's a double meaning in that 'I took no more pains

1095
00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:02.870
for those thanks than you took pains to thank me.'

1096
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:04.130
that's as much as to say,

1097
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:11.200
Any pains that I take for you is as easy as thanks.

1098
00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:12.370
If I do not take pity of her,

1099
00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:15.470
I am a villain; if I do not love her,

1100
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:19.370
I am a Jew.

1101
00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:24.330
I will go get her picture.

1102
00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:31.730


1103
00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.400
Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;

1104
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.200
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice

1105
00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.770
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:

1106
00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:47.970
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula Walk in the orchard

1107
00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:51.600
and our whole discourse Is all of her;

1108
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.470
say that thou overheard'st us;

1109
00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:56.730
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,

1110
00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:58.700
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,

1111
00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:01.730
Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,

1112
00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:04.830
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride

1113
00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:07.570
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,

1114
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:09.330
To listen our purpose.

1115
00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:12.870
This is thy office; Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

1116
00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.400
I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.

1117
00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.730
Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,

1118
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.070
As we do trace this alley up and down,

1119
00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:24.600
Our talk must only be of Benedick.

1120
00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.500
When I do name him, let it be thy part

1121
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.400
To praise him more than ever man did merit:

1122
00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.700
My talk to thee must be how Benedick

1123
00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:36.270
Is sick in love with Beatrice.

1124
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:39.000
Of this matter Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,

1125
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.970
That only wounds by hearsay.

1126
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.530
Now begin; For look where Beatrice,

1127
00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:47.200
like a lapwing, runs Close by the ground,

1128
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.730
to hear our conference.

1129
00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:51.600
The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish

1130
00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:55.130
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,

1131
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:58.170
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:

1132
00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:01.000
So angle we for Beatrice;

1133
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.300
who even now Is couched in the woodbine coverture.

1134
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.630
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

1135
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:09.130
Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing

1136
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:13.030
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.

1137
00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:17.200
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;

1138
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.330
I know her spirits are as coy and wild

1139
00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:21.470
As haggerds of the rock.

1140
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:27.830
But are you sure That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?

1141
00:58:27.830 --> 00:58:30.330
So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.

1142
00:58:30.330 --> 00:58:32.400
And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

1143
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.200
They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;

1144
00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:38.070
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,

1145
00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:39.300
To wish him wrestle with affection,

1146
00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:41.430
And never to let Beatrice know of it.

1147
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.130
Why did you so?

1148
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:44.000
Doth not the gentleman

1149
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.800
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed

1150
00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:48.130
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?

1151
00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:49.170
O god of love!

1152
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:50.370
I know he doth deserve

1153
00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:52.570
As much as may be yielded to a man:

1154
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:55.600
But Nature never framed a woman's heart

1155
00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:59.500
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;

1156
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.530
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,

1157
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.300
Misprising what they look on,

1158
00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:08.130
and her wit Values itself so highly that to her

1159
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:12.430
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,

1160
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:14.670
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,

1161
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:16.770
She is so self-endeared.

1162
00:59:16.770 --> 00:59:19.570
Sure, I think so; And therefore certainly

1163
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.730
it were not good She knew his love,

1164
00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:23.730
lest she make sport at it.

1165
00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:25.030
Why, you speak truth.

1166
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:26.530
I never yet saw man, How wise,

1167
00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:30.300
how noble, young, how rarely featured,

1168
00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.770
But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,

1169
00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:37.800
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;

1170
00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.770
If black, why, Nature,

1171
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.500
drawing of an antique, Made a foul blot;

1172
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.200
if tall, a lance ill-headed;

1173
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.830
If low, an agate very vilely cut;

1174
00:59:46.830 --> 00:59:49.030
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;

1175
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:52.530
If silent, why, a block moved with none.

1176
00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:55.300
So turns she every man the wrong side out

1177
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.970
And never gives to truth and virtue that

1178
00:59:56.970 --> 01:00:00.030
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

1179
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:04.030
Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.

1180
01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:06.870
No, not to be so odd and from all fashions

1181
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:10.430
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:

1182
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:12.130
But who dare tell her so?

1183
01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:16.800
If I should speak, She would mock me into air;

1184
01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.000
O, she would laugh me

1185
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.500
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.

1186
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.830
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,

1187
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:29.500
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:

1188
01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.730
It were a better death than die with mocks,

1189
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:34.330
Which is as bad as die with tickling.

1190
01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:38.730
Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.

1191
01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:43.730
No; rather I will go to Benedick

1192
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:46.630
And counsel him to fight against his passion.

1193
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:49.830
And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders

1194
01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:52.930
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know

1195
01:00:52.930 --> 01:00:59.130
How much an ill word may empoison liking.

1196
01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:01.530
O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.

1197
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.330
She cannot be so much without true judgment--

1198
01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:06.770
Having so swift and excellent a wit

1199
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:09.530
As she is prized to have--as to refuse

1200
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:12.300
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.

1201
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:14.600
He is the only man of Italy.

1202
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.970
Always excepted my dear Claudio.

1203
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:21.530
I pray you, be not angry with me,

1204
01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.130
madam, Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,

1205
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:27.570
For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,

1206
01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:30.170
Goes foremost in report through Italy.

1207
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:33.500
Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.

1208
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:40.430
His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.

1209
01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:45.100
When are you married, madam?

1210
01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.470
Why, every day, to-morrow.

1211
01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.170
Come, go in: I'll show thee some attires,

1212
01:01:50.170 --> 01:01:51.330
and have thy counsel me

1213
01:01:51.330 --> 01:01:53.900
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.

1214
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:58.470
She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.

1215
01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:01.800
If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:

1216
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:07.230
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

1217
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:31.800
What fire is in mine ears?

1218
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:37.370
Can this be true?

1219
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:44.230
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?

1220
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:46.670
Contempt, farewell!

1221
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:49.730
and maiden pride, adieu!

1222
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:53.530
No glory lives behind the back of such.

1223
01:02:53.530 --> 01:03:03.930
And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,

1224
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:11.300
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:

1225
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:16.530
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee

1226
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:22.470
To bind our loves up in a holy band;

1227
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:28.000
For others say thou dost deserve,

1228
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.200
and I Believe it better than reportingly.

1229
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:44.930
I do but stay till your marriage be consummate,

1230
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:47.070
and then go I toward Arragon.

1231
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.330
I'll bring you thither, my lord,

1232
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:49.600
if you'll vouchsafe me.

1233
01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.000
Nay, that would be as great a soil

1234
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.970
in the new gloss of your marriage

1235
01:03:53.970 --> 01:03:59.570
as to show a child his new coat and forbid him to wear it.

1236
01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:02.530
I will only be bold with Benedick for his company;

1237
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:05.200
for, from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot,

1238
01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.730
he is all mirth:

1239
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:10.830
he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's bow-string

1240
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:14.070
and the little hangman dare not shoot at him;

1241
01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:16.500
he hath a heart as sound as a bell

1242
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.630
and his tongue is the clapper,

1243
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:22.630
for what his heart thinks his tongue speaks.

1244
01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.170
Gallants, I am not as I have been.

1245
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:30.630
So say I methinks you are sadder.

1246
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:32.430
I hope he be in love.

1247
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:34.270
Hang him, truant!

1248
01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:35.870
there's no true drop of blood in him,

1249
01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.030
to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,

1250
01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.370
he wants money.

1251
01:04:40.370 --> 01:04:41.700
I have the toothache.

1252
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.900
Draw it.

1253
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:43.900
Hang it!

1254
01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.730
You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.

1255
01:04:44.730 --> 01:04:45.670
What!

1256
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.630
sigh for the toothache?

1257
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:51.030
Well, every one can master a grief but he that has it.

1258
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.330
Yet say I, he is in love.

1259
01:04:53.330 --> 01:04:55.830
There is no appearance of fancy in him,

1260
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:58.370
unless it be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises;

1261
01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:59.670
as, to be a Dutchman today,

1262
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:01.270
a Frenchman to-morrow.

1263
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:03.700
Unless he have a fancy to this foolery,

1264
01:05:03.700 --> 01:05:06.700
as it appears he hath, he is no fool for fancy,

1265
01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.130
as you would have it appear he is.

1266
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:09.870
If he be not in love with some woman,

1267
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:12.870
there is no believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o' mornings;

1268
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.270
what should that bode?

1269
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:17.070
Hath any man seen him at the barber's?

1270
01:05:17.070 --> 01:05:20.530
No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,

1271
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:22.200
and the old ornament of his cheek

1272
01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.030
hath already stuffed tennis-balls.

1273
01:05:24.030 --> 01:05:26.030
Indeed, he looks younger than he did,

1274
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.870
by the loss of a beard.

1275
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:32.230
Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him out by that?

1276
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:35.670
That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.

1277
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:38.830
The greatest note of it is his melancholy.

1278
01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:41.070
And when was he wont to wash his face?

1279
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:43.770
Yea, or to paint himself?

1280
01:05:43.770 --> 01:05:46.070
for the which, I hear what they say of him.

1281
01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:48.770
Nay, but his jesting spirit;

1282
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:51.270
which is now crept into a lute-string

1283
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:52.930
and now governed by stops.

1284
01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:57.270
Indeed, that hangs a heavy tale for him:

1285
01:05:57.270 --> 01:06:00.670
conclude, conclude he is in love.

1286
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:02.700
Nay, but I know who loves him.

1287
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.000
That would I know too:

1288
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.730
I warrant, one that knows him not.

1289
01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:07.170
Yes, and his ill conditions;

1290
01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:10.000
and, in despite of all, dies for him.

1291
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.530
She shall be buried with her face upwards.

1292
01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:18.500
Yet is this no charm for the toothache.

1293
01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.400
Old signior, walk aside with me:

1294
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.630
I have studied eight or nine wise words to speak to you,

1295
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:28.570
which these hobby-horses must not hear.

1296
01:06:35.570 --> 01:06:38.970
For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.

1297
01:06:38.970 --> 01:06:39.630
'Tis even so.

1298
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:40.670
Hero and Margaret

1299
01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:42.400
have by this played their parts with Beatrice;

1300
01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.700
and then the two bears

1301
01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:46.930
will not bite one another when they meet.

1302
01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:49.270
My lord and brother, God save you!

1303
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:50.370
Good den, brother.

1304
01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:52.430
If your leisure served, I would speak with you.

1305
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:53.730
In private?

1306
01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:55.530
If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear;

1307
01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:58.470
for what I would speak of concerns him.

1308
01:06:58.470 --> 01:07:00.200
What's the matter?

1309
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.230
Means your lordship to be married to-morrow?

1310
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:03.870
You know he does.

1311
01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:06.630
I know not that, when he knows what I know.

1312
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:07.930
If there be any impediment,

1313
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:09.930
I pray you discover it.

1314
01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:11.570
You may think I love you not:

1315
01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:14.030
let that appear hereafter, and aim better at me

1316
01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.730
by that I now will manifest.

1317
01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:18.270
For my brother, I think he holds you well,

1318
01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:20.170
and in dearness of heart

1319
01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:23.330
hath holp to effect your ensuing marriage;

1320
01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:27.200
--surely suit ill spent and labour ill bestowed.

1321
01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.200
Why, what's the matter?

1322
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.670
I came hither to tell you;

1323
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:33.370
and, circumstances shortened, for she has been too long

1324
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:37.400
a talking of, the lady is disloyal.

1325
01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.330
Who, Hero?

1326
01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:44.470
Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero,

1327
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:48.000
every man's Hero: Disloyal?

1328
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
The word is too good to paint out her wickedness;

1329
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.570
I could say she were worse: think you of a worse title,

1330
01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:54.230
and I will fit her to it.

1331
01:07:56.430 --> 01:08:00.730
Wonder not till further warrant: go but with me to-night,

1332
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:04.200
you shall see her chamber-window entered,

1333
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.100
even the night before her wedding-day:

1334
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:15.870
if you love her then, to-morrow wed her;

1335
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:19.900
but it would better fit your honour to change your mind.

1336
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.270
May this be so?

1337
01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:23.170
I will not think it.

1338
01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.230
If you dare not trust that you see,

1339
01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:31.070
confess not that you know: if you will follow me,

1340
01:08:31.070 --> 01:08:32.700
I will show you enough;

1341
01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.100
and when you have seen more and heard more,

1342
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:42.670
proceed accordingly. If I see any thing to-night

1343
01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:47.470
why I should not marry her to-morrow in the congregation,

1344
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:50.730
where I should wed, there will I shame her.

1345
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:54.570
And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her,

1346
01:08:54.570 --> 01:08:56.770
I will join with thee to disgrace her.

1347
01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:00.330
I will disparage her no farther till you are my witnesses:

1348
01:09:00.330 --> 01:09:02.100
bear it coldly but till midnight,

1349
01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:05.800
and let the issue show itself.

1350
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.830
O day untowardly turned!

1351
01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:10.100
O mischief strangely thwarting!

1352
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.630
O plague right well prevented!

1353
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:14.230
so will you say when you have seen the sequel.

1354
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:32.130
(cats meowing, dogs barking)

1355
01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:47.330
Are you good men and true?

1356
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:50.400
Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer salvation,

1357
01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.430
body and soul.

1358
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:53.270
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them,

1359
01:09:53.270 --> 01:09:54.830
if they should have any allegiance in them,

1360
01:09:54.830 --> 01:09:57.270
being chosen for the prince's watch.

1361
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.830
Well, give them their charge,

1362
01:09:58.830 --> 01:10:00.230
neighbour Dogberry.

1363
01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:05.170
First, who think you the most desertless man to be constable?

1364
01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:09.200
Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole;

1365
01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.800
for they can write and read.

1366
01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:14.530
Come hither, neighbour Seacole.

1367
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.700
God hath blessed you with a good name:

1368
01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.700
to be a well-favoured man is the gift of fortune;

1369
01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:22.200
but to write and read comes by nature.

1370
01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.730
Both which, master constable,

1371
01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:25.970
- You have: I knew it would be your answer.

1372
01:10:25.970 --> 01:10:27.400
Well, for your favour, sir,

1373
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:30.000
why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it;

1374
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.130
and for your writing and reading,

1375
01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:35.170
let that appear when there is no need of such vanity.

1376
01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.670
You are thought here to be the most senseless

1377
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:42.200
and fit man for the constable of the watch;

1378
01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.130
therefore bear you the lantern.

1379
01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:49.330
This is your charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men;

1380
01:10:49.330 --> 01:10:52.400
you are to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.

1381
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.970
How if a' will not stand?

1382
01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:58.200
Why, take no note of him, but let him go;

1383
01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.200
and presently call the rest of the watch

1384
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.070
and thank God you are rid of a knave.

1385
01:11:03.070 --> 01:11:05.130
If he will not stand when he is bidden,

1386
01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:06.830
he is none of the prince's subjects.

1387
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.030
True, and they are to meddle

1388
01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:09.930
with none but the prince's subjects.

1389
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:13.730
Also, you shall make no noise in the streets;

1390
01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:17.030
for, for the watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable

1391
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.530
and not to be endured.

1392
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:20.430
We will rather sleep than talk:

1393
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:21.930
we know what belongs to a watch.

1394
01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:24.830
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman;

1395
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:27.830
for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:

1396
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:32.430
only, have a care that your bills be not stolen.

1397
01:11:32.430 --> 01:11:34.670
Well, you are to call at all the ale-houses,

1398
01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:37.900
and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.

1399
01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.170
How if they will not?

1400
01:11:40.170 --> 01:11:42.630
Why, then, let them alone till they are sober:

1401
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:44.400
if they make you not then the better answer,

1402
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.730
you may say they are not the men you took them for.

1403
01:11:47.730 --> 01:11:49.630
Well, sir.

1404
01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.030
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him,

1405
01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:55.370
by virtue of your office, to be no true man;

1406
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:57.430
and, for such kind of men,

1407
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:59.070
the less you meddle or make with them,

1408
01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:01.130
why the more is your honesty.

1409
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:03.030
If we know him to be a thief,

1410
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.470
shall we not lay hands on him?

1411
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.130
Truly, by your office, you may;

1412
01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:09.330
but I think they that touch pitch will be defiled:

1413
01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.100
the most peaceable way for you,

1414
01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.330
if you do take a thief, is to let him show himself

1415
01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:19.300
what he is and steal out of your company.

1416
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:21.970
You have been always called a merciful man, partner.

1417
01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:24.430
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will,

1418
01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:27.670
much more a man who hath any honesty in him.

1419
01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:30.300
If you hear a child cry in the night,

1420
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:33.500
you must call to the nurse and bid her still it.

1421
01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:38.270
How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?

1422
01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.800
Why, then, depart in peace,

1423
01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:44.530
and let the child wake her with crying;

1424
01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:47.200
for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes

1425
01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.600
will never answer a calf when he bleats.

1426
01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.270
'Tis very true.

1427
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:53.070
This is the end of the charge:--

1428
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:56.530
you, constable, are to present the prince's own person:

1429
01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:58.400
if you meet the prince in the night,

1430
01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.100
you may stay him.

1431
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.630
Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.

1432
01:13:03.630 --> 01:13:05.130
Five shillings to one on't,

1433
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:06.830
any man that knows the statutes,

1434
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:12.830
may stay him: marry, not without the prince be willing;

1435
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:15.600
for, indeed, the watch ought to offend no man;

1436
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.230
and it is an offence to stay a man against his will.

1437
01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.670
By'r lady, I think it be so.

1438
01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:23.270
Well, masters, good night:

1439
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:27.570
an there be any matter of weight chances, call up me:

1440
01:13:27.570 --> 01:13:32.230
keep your fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.

1441
01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:33.970
Come, neighbour.

1442
01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:37.170
Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here

1443
01:13:37.170 --> 01:13:39.070
upon the church-bench till two,

1444
01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.930
and then all to bed.

1445
01:13:39.930 --> 01:13:42.730
One word more, honest neighbours.

1446
01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:45.500
I pray you watch about Signior Leonato's door;

1447
01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:46.770
for the wedding being there to-morrow,

1448
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.900
there is a great coil to-night.

1449
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:54.570
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.

1450
01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:10.670
(♪music)

1451
01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:14.770
What Conrade!

1452
01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:16.130
Peace! stir not.

1453
01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:18.530
Conrade, I say!

1454
01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:21.070
Here, man; I am at thy elbow.

1455
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:22.130
Mass, and my elbow itched;

1456
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.370
I thought there would a scab follow.

1457
01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:27.270
I will owe thee an answer for that:

1458
01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:29.300
now forward with thy tale.

1459
01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.670
Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house,

1460
01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:33.230
for it drizzles rain;

1461
01:14:33.230 --> 01:14:36.900
and I will, like a true drunkard, utter all to thee.

1462
01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:39.030
Some treason, masters: yet stand close.

1463
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:43.200
Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.

1464
01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.900
Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?

1465
01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:47.330
Thou shouldst rather ask

1466
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:50.200
if it were possible any villany should be so rich;

1467
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.670
for when rich villains have need of poor ones,

1468
01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:55.230
poor ones may make what price they will.

1469
01:14:55.230 --> 01:14:56.330
I wonder at it.

1470
01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:59.330
That shows thou art unconfirmed.

1471
01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:00.770
Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet,

1472
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:03.300
or a hat, or a cloak, is nothing to a man.

1473
01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:04.670
Yes, it is apparel.

1474
01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:05.670
I mean, the fashion.

1475
01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:07.170
Yes, the fashion is the fashion.

1476
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.600
Tush!

1477
01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.630
I may as well say the fool's the fool.

1478
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:15.600
But seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion is?

1479
01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:16.670
I know that Deformed;

1480
01:15:16.670 --> 01:15:18.670
a' has been a vile thief this seven year;

1481
01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.530
a' goes up and down like a gentleman:

1482
01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:22.370
I remember his name.

1483
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:24.470
Didst thou not hear somebody?

1484
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:30.470
No; 'twas the vane on the house.

1485
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:34.600
Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this fashion is?

1486
01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.170
how giddily a' turns about all the hot bloods

1487
01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:40.130
between fourteen and five-and-thirty?

1488
01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:43.730
Art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too,

1489
01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:45.670
that thou hast shifted out of thy tale

1490
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:47.100
into telling me of the fashion?

1491
01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:53.000
Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night wooed

1492
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.830
Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman,

1493
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:58.370
by the name of Hero:

1494
01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:01.930
she leans me out at her mistress' chamber-window,

1495
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:08.030
bids me a thousand times good night,

1496
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:10.400
I tell this tale vilely:

1497
01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.200
I should first tell thee how the prince,

1498
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.300
and Claudio and my master, planted and placed

1499
01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:18.030
and possessed by my master Don John,

1500
01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:22.570
saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.

1501
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:24.470
And thought they Margaret was Hero?

1502
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:27.870
Two of them did, the prince and Claudio;

1503
01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:30.700
but the devil my master knew she was Margaret;

1504
01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.330
and partly by his oaths, which first possessed them,

1505
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:35.830
partly by the dark night,

1506
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:39.770
which did deceive them, but chiefly by my villany,

1507
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:43.200
which did confirm any slander that Don John had made,

1508
01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.500
away went Claudio enraged;

1509
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.270
swore he would meet her, as he was appointed,

1510
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.900
next morning at the temple,

1511
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:53.370
and there, before the whole congregation,

1512
01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:56.630
shame her with what he saw o'er night

1513
01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:00.970
and send her home again without a husband.

1514
01:17:00.970 --> 01:17:04.500
We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!

1515
01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.070
Call up the right master constable.

1516
01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.130
We have here recovered the most dangerous piece of

1517
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:10.570
lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth.

1518
01:17:10.570 --> 01:17:13.130
And one Deformed is one of them: I know him;

1519
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:14.630
a' wears a lock.

1520
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:15.870
Masters, masters,--

1521
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:18.870
You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.

1522
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.600
Masters,-- Never speak: we charge you

1523
01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:26.470
let us obey you to go with us.

1524
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:28.730
We are like to prove a goodly commodity,

1525
01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:30.370
being taken up of these men's bills.

1526
01:17:30.370 --> 01:17:32.570
A commodity in question, I warrant you.

1527
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:36.500
Come, we'll obey you.

1528
01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:52.100
Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice,

1529
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:53.900
and desire her to rise.

1530
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.370
I will, lady.

1531
01:17:56.370 --> 01:17:58.430
And bid her come hither.

1532
01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:00.870
Well.

1533
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:05.200
Troth, I think your other rabato were better.

1534
01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.530
No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.

1535
01:18:07.530 --> 01:18:08.700
By my troth, 's not so good;

1536
01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:10.170
and I warrant your cousin will say so.

1537
01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.900
My cousin's a fool, and thou art another:

1538
01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:14.930
I'll wear none but this.

1539
01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:22.630
I like the new tire within excellently,

1540
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:26.370
if the hair were a thought browner;

1541
01:18:26.370 --> 01:18:30.500
and your gown's a most rare fashion, i' faith.

1542
01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.970
I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown that they praise so.

1543
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:34.770
O, that exceeds, they say.

1544
01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:37.300
By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of yours:

1545
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.030
cloth o' gold, and cuts,

1546
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:41.430
and laced with silver, set with pearls,

1547
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:43.070
down sleeves, side sleeves,

1548
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:47.570
and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:

1549
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:52.530
but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent fashion,

1550
01:18:52.530 --> 01:18:54.600
yours is worth ten on 't.

1551
01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.970
God give me joy to wear it!

1552
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:58.800
for my heart is exceeding heavy.

1553
01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.430
'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.

1554
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:02.370
Fie upon thee!

1555
01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:03.930
art not ashamed?

1556
01:19:03.930 --> 01:19:06.170
Of what, lady?

1557
01:19:06.170 --> 01:19:07.570
of speaking honourably?

1558
01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:09.900
Is not marriage honourable in a beggar?

1559
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.900
Is not your lord honourable without marriage?

1560
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.130
I think you would have me say,

1561
01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:16.830
'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad thinking

1562
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:18.430
do not wrest true speaking,

1563
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:19.970
I'll offend nobody:

1564
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:23.200
is there any harm in 'the heavier for a husband'?

1565
01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.430
None, I think,

1566
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:27.070
and it be the right husband and the right wife;

1567
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:29.000
otherwise 'tis light, and not heavy:

1568
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.300
ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.

1569
01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:34.330
Good morrow, coz.

1570
01:19:34.330 --> 01:19:36.730
Good morrow, sweet Hero.

1571
01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.070
Why how now?

1572
01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:39.600
do you speak in the sick tune?

1573
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.270
I am out of all other tune, methinks.

1574
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:43.730
Clap's into 'Light o' love;

1575
01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:45.330
that goes without a burden:

1576
01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:47.370
do you sing it, and I'll dance it.

1577
01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:49.000
Ye light o' love, with your heels!

1578
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.070
'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin;

1579
01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:53.130
tis time you were ready.

1580
01:19:53.130 --> 01:20:01.200
By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!

1581
01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:03.130
For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?

1582
01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:04.900
For the letter that begins them all,

1583
01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.930
H.

1584
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:07.770
Well, and you be not turned Turk,

1585
01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:09.630
there's no more sailing by the star.

1586
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.530
What means the fool, trow?

1587
01:20:11.530 --> 01:20:15.030
Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!

1588
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:17.230
These gloves the count sent me;

1589
01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:19.300
they are an excellent perfume.

1590
01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:21.470
I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.

1591
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:22.770
A maid, and stuffed!

1592
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:24.600
there's goodly catching of cold.

1593
01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.830
O, God help me!

1594
01:20:26.830 --> 01:20:28.330
God help me!

1595
01:20:28.330 --> 01:20:30.400
how long have you professed apprehension?

1596
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.970
Even since you left it.

1597
01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:33.570
Doth not my wit become me rarely?

1598
01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:35.330
It is not seen enough often enough,

1599
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:37.230
you should wear it in your cap.

1600
01:20:37.230 --> 01:20:42.070
By my troth, I am ill.

1601
01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:45.370
Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,

1602
01:20:45.370 --> 01:20:46.200
and lay it to your heart:

1603
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.430
it is the only thing for a qualm.

1604
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:50.130
There thou prickest her with a thistle.

1605
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:52.070
Benedictus!

1606
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:54.870
why Benedictus?

1607
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:57.370
you have some moral in this Benedictus.

1608
01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:58.570
Moral!

1609
01:20:58.570 --> 01:21:01.630
no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning;

1610
01:21:01.630 --> 01:21:03.930
I meant, plain holy-thistle.

1611
01:21:03.930 --> 01:21:06.600
You may think perchance that I think you are in love:

1612
01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.270
nay, by'r lady, I am not such a fool to think what I list,

1613
01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:10.630
nor I list not to think what I can,

1614
01:21:10.630 --> 01:21:11.700
nor indeed I cannot think,

1615
01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.230
if I would think my heart out of thinking,

1616
01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:14.570
that you are in love or that you

1617
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:17.130
will be in love or that you can be in love.

1618
01:21:17.130 --> 01:21:19.430
Yet Benedick was such another,

1619
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:21.030
and now is he become a man:

1620
01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:22.800
he swore he would never marry,

1621
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.630
and yet now, in despite of his heart,

1622
01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.870
he eats his meat without grudging:

1623
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:29.070
and how you may be converted I know not,

1624
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:31.600
but methinks you look with your eyes as other women do.

1625
01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:32.900
What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?

1626
01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:33.830
Not a false gallop.

1627
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:37.800
Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count,

1628
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.270
Signior Benedick, Don John,

1629
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:41.230
and all the gallants of the town,

1630
01:21:41.230 --> 01:21:43.600
are come to fetch you to church.

1631
01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:46.700
Help to dress me, good coz,

1632
01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.270
good Meg, good Ursula.

1633
01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:55.970
What would you with me, honest neighbour?

1634
01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:58.830
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you

1635
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.570
that decerns you nearly.

1636
01:22:00.570 --> 01:22:04.670
Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.

1637
01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.600
Marry, this it is, sir.

1638
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.400
Yes, in truth it is, sir.

1639
01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.830
What is it, my good friends?

1640
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:12.570
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter:

1641
01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:14.930
an old man, sir, and his wits are not so blunt as,

1642
01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.630
God help, I would desire they were;

1643
01:22:16.630 --> 01:22:20.200
but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.

1644
01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.830
Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living

1645
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:28.330
that is an old man and no honester than I.

1646
01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:30.000
Comparisons are odorous:

1647
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.430
palabras, neighbour Verges.

1648
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:36.070
Neighbours, you are tedious.

1649
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:38.130
It pleases your worship to say so,

1650
01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:39.700
but we are the poor duke's officers;

1651
01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:41.800
but truly, for mine own part,

1652
01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.070
if I were as tedious as a king,

1653
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:48.800
I could find it in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.

1654
01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:50.930
All thy tediousness on me, ah?

1655
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:53.730
Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis;

1656
01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:55.630
for I hear as good exclamation on your

1657
01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:58.330
worship as of any man in the city;

1658
01:22:58.330 --> 01:23:00.470
and though I be but a poor man,

1659
01:23:00.470 --> 01:23:01.770
I am glad to hear it.

1660
01:23:01.770 --> 01:23:02.700
And so am I.

1661
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.130
I would fain know what you have to say.

1662
01:23:05.130 --> 01:23:07.730
Marry, sir, our watch to-night,

1663
01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:09.970
excepting your worship's presence,

1664
01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:14.670
ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant knaves as any in Messina.

1665
01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:16.730
A good old man, sir; he will be talking:

1666
01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:20.230
as they say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help us!

1667
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:21.630
it is a world to see.

1668
01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:23.770
Well said, i' faith, neighbour Verges:

1669
01:23:23.770 --> 01:23:27.630
well, God's a good man; an two men ride of a horse,

1670
01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:29.500
one must ride behind.

1671
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:31.370
An honest soul, i' faith, sir;

1672
01:23:31.370 --> 01:23:33.400
by my troth he is, as ever broke bread;

1673
01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:35.030
but God is to be worshipped;

1674
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:36.970
all men are not alike; alas,

1675
01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:39.230
good neighbour!

1676
01:23:39.230 --> 01:23:40.670
Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.

1677
01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:43.370
Gifts that God gives.

1678
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:45.100
I must leave you.

1679
01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:49.400
One word, sir: our watch, sir,

1680
01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.830
have indeed comprehended two aspicious persons,

1681
01:23:52.830 --> 01:23:55.430
and we would have them this morning examined

1682
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:56.900
before your worship.

1683
01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:01.100
Take their examination yourself and bring it me:

1684
01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:03.770
I am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.

1685
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:07.600
It shall be suffigance.

1686
01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.770
Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.

1687
01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:12.530
My lord, they stay for you

1688
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:13.800
to give your daughter to her husband.

1689
01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.000
I'll wait upon them: I am ready.

1690
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.070
Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;

1691
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:22.600
bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol:

1692
01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.500
we are now to examination these men.

1693
01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.670
And we must do it wisely.

1694
01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:28.800
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you;

1695
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.130
here's that shall drive some of them to a non-come:

1696
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:33.170
only get the learned writer

1697
01:24:33.170 --> 01:24:37.530
to set down our excommunication and meet me at the gaol.

1698
01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.830
Come, Friar Francis, be brief;

1699
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:29.730
only to the plain form of marriage,

1700
01:25:29.730 --> 01:25:33.630
and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards.

1701
01:25:33.630 --> 01:25:36.330
You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.

1702
01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:43.270
No.

1703
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:45.570
To be married to her: friar,

1704
01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:52.370
you come to marry her.

1705
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:57.500
Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.

1706
01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.030
I do.

1707
01:25:59.030 --> 01:26:01.100
If either of you know any inward impediment

1708
01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.370
why you should not be conjoined, charge you,

1709
01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:07.570
on your souls, to utter it.

1710
01:26:07.570 --> 01:26:09.900
Know you any, Hero?

1711
01:26:09.900 --> 01:26:11.730
None, my lord.

1712
01:26:11.730 --> 01:26:14.000
Know you any, count?

1713
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.670
I dare make his answer, none.

1714
01:26:17.670 --> 01:26:18.930
O, what men dare do!

1715
01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:20.370
what men may do!

1716
01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:21.870
what men daily do, not knowing what they do!

1717
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:22.870
How now!

1718
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:24.070
interjections?

1719
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:26.930
Why, then, some be of laughing,

1720
01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:31.800
Stand thee by, friar.

1721
01:26:43.370 --> 01:26:45.670
Father, by your leave:

1722
01:26:45.670 --> 01:26:48.100
Will you with free and unconstrained soul

1723
01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:51.130
Give me this maid, your daughter?

1724
01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:56.570
As freely, son, as God did give her me.

1725
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:57.770
And what have I to give you back,

1726
01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:01.700
whose worth May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

1727
01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:06.200
Nothing, unless you render her again.

1728
01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:09.330
Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.

1729
01:27:09.330 --> 01:27:14.570
There, Leonato, take her back again:

1730
01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:18.500
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;

1731
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:22.500
She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.

1732
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.830
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!

1733
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:29.270
O, what authority and show of truth

1734
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:31.870
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!

1735
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:34.070
Comes not that blood as modest evidence

1736
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:36.970
To witness simple virtue?

1737
01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:38.870
Would you not swear, All you that see her,

1738
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:43.230
that she were a maid, By these exterior shows?

1739
01:27:43.230 --> 01:27:48.400
But she is none: She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;

1740
01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.330
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

1741
01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:57.000
What do you mean, my lord?

1742
01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:03.570
Not to be married, Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.

1743
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.100
Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,

1744
01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.270
Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,

1745
01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:10.430
And made defeat of her virginity,

1746
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:14.870
- I know what you would say: if I have known her,

1747
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:16.870
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,

1748
01:28:16.870 --> 01:28:18.470
And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:

1749
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:22.270
No, Leonato, I never tempted her with word too large;

1750
01:28:22.270 --> 01:28:24.200
But, as a brother to his sister,

1751
01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.600
show'd Bashful sincerity and comely love.

1752
01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.270
And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?

1753
01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:29.270
Out on thee! Seeming!

1754
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:33.570
I will write against it:

1755
01:28:33.570 --> 01:28:37.870
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,

1756
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:41.630
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;

1757
01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:43.870
But you are more intemperate in your blood

1758
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:47.300
Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals

1759
01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.830
That rage in savage sensuality.

1760
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:52.170
Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

1761
01:28:52.170 --> 01:28:55.670
Sweet prince, why speak not you?

1762
01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:58.170
What should I speak?

1763
01:28:58.170 --> 01:29:00.430
I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about

1764
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:06.670
To link my dear friend to a common stale.

1765
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:13.730
Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?

1766
01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:17.100
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.

1767
01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.900
This looks not like a nuptial.

1768
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.470
True!

1769
01:29:22.470 --> 01:29:24.530
O God!

1770
01:29:24.530 --> 01:29:27.570
Leonato, stand I here?

1771
01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:28.870
Is this the prince?

1772
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:29.870
is this the prince's brother?

1773
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:30.900
Is this face Hero's?

1774
01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:32.800
are our eyes our own?

1775
01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.230
All this is so: but what of this, my lord?

1776
01:29:35.230 --> 01:29:37.000
Let me but move one question to your daughter;

1777
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.670
And, by that fatherly and kindly power

1778
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:41.770
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

1779
01:29:41.770 --> 01:29:45.530
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.

1780
01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:47.630
O, God defend me!

1781
01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:49.200
how am I beset!

1782
01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.300
What kind of catechising call you this?

1783
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.370
To make you answer truly to your name.

1784
01:29:53.370 --> 01:29:54.600
Is it not Hero?

1785
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.130
Who can blot that name With any just reproach?

1786
01:29:57.130 --> 01:29:59.430
Marry, that can Hero;

1787
01:29:59.430 --> 01:30:03.670
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.

1788
01:30:03.670 --> 01:30:07.830
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight

1789
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:11.770
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?

1790
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:15.100
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

1791
01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:19.200
I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.

1792
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.170
Why, then are you no maiden.

1793
01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:26.800
Leonato, I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,

1794
01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.630
Myself, my brother and this grieved count

1795
01:30:30.630 --> 01:30:34.900
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night

1796
01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.500
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window

1797
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.030
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,

1798
01:30:40.030 --> 01:30:42.100
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had

1799
01:30:42.100 --> 01:30:43.930
A thousand times in secret.

1800
01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:45.430
Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,

1801
01:30:45.430 --> 01:30:49.870
Not to be spoke of; There is not chastity enough in language

1802
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:52.000
Without offence to utter them.

1803
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.870
Thus, pretty lady, I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.

1804
01:30:54.870 --> 01:31:00.270
O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,

1805
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:02.570
If half thy outward graces had been placed

1806
01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:07.970
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!

1807
01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:16.700
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair!

1808
01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:22.200
farewell, Thou pure impiety and impious purity!

1809
01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:27.330
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,

1810
01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:28.800
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,

1811
01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:32.430
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,

1812
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:36.330
And never shall it more be gracious.

1813
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:44.800
Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?

1814
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.730
Why, how now, cousin!

1815
01:31:46.730 --> 01:31:49.100
wherefore sink you down?

1816
01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:51.000
Come, let us go.

1817
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.530
These things, come thus to light,

1818
01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:56.830
Smother her spirits up.

1819
01:31:59.730 --> 01:32:01.030
How doth the lady?

1820
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:03.500
Dead, I think.

1821
01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:05.600
Help, uncle!

1822
01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.700
Hero!

1823
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:08.600
why, Hero!

1824
01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.530
Uncle!

1825
01:32:10.530 --> 01:32:11.370
Signior Benedick!

1826
01:32:11.370 --> 01:32:13.100
Friar!

1827
01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.200
O Fate!

1828
01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.400
take not away thy heavy hand.

1829
01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.230
Death is the fairest cover for her shame

1830
01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:20.970
That may be wish'd for.

1831
01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:24.670
How now, cousin Hero!

1832
01:32:24.670 --> 01:32:28.600
Have comfort, lady.

1833
01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.870
Dost thou look up?

1834
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:33.530
Yea, wherefore should she not?

1835
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:35.200
Wherefore!

1836
01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:37.430
Why, doth not every earthly thing

1837
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:39.470
Cry shame upon her?

1838
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:43.430
Could she here deny The story that is printed in her blood?

1839
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:47.530
Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:

1840
01:32:47.530 --> 01:32:50.270
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,

1841
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:53.200
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,

1842
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.500
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,

1843
01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:58.430
Strike at thy life.

1844
01:32:58.430 --> 01:33:02.030
Grieved I, I had but one?

1845
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:04.500
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?

1846
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:06.070
O, one too much by thee!

1847
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:08.700
Why had I one?

1848
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:12.930
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?

1849
01:33:12.930 --> 01:33:14.300
Why had I not with charitable hand

1850
01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:16.630
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,

1851
01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:19.000
Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,

1852
01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.570
I might have said 'No part of it is mine;

1853
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:24.130
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?

1854
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:28.270
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised

1855
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:33.070
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much

1856
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:38.170
That I myself was to myself not mine, Valuing of her,

1857
01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:45.670
-why, she, O, she is fallen Into a pit of ink,

1858
01:33:45.670 --> 01:33:49.230
that the wide sea Hath drops too few to wash her clean again

1859
01:33:49.230 --> 01:33:51.730
And salt too little which may season give

1860
01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:53.370
To her foul-tainted flesh!

1861
01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:59.870
Sir, sir, be patient.

1862
01:33:59.870 --> 01:34:01.130
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,

1863
01:34:01.130 --> 01:34:03.030
I know not what to say.

1864
01:34:03.030 --> 01:34:06.070
O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!

1865
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:10.200
Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?

1866
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:15.700
No, truly not; although, until last night,

1867
01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:18.030
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.

1868
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:21.100
Confirm'd, confirm'd!

1869
01:34:21.100 --> 01:34:23.870
O, that is stronger made Which was before barr'd up

1870
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:26.000
with ribs of iron!

1871
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.300
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,

1872
01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:31.470
Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,

1873
01:34:31.470 --> 01:34:33.570
Wash'd it with tears?

1874
01:34:33.570 --> 01:34:34.400
Hence from her!

1875
01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.500
let her die.

1876
01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:41.130
Hear me a little; For I have only been silent so long

1877
01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:43.830
And given way unto this course of fortune.

1878
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:48.430
By noting of the lady I have mark'd

1879
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:53.330
A thousand blushing apparitions To start into her face,

1880
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:56.270
a thousand innocent shames In angel whiteness

1881
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:58.570
beat away those blushes;

1882
01:34:58.570 --> 01:35:01.470
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,

1883
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:05.000
To burn the errors that these princes hold

1884
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:12.230
Against her maiden truth.

1885
01:35:12.230 --> 01:35:16.530
Call me a fool; Trust not my reading nor my observations,

1886
01:35:16.530 --> 01:35:18.470
Which with experimental seal doth warrant

1887
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:19.870
The tenor of my book;

1888
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:22.370
trust not my age,

1889
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:24.830
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,

1890
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:27.600
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here

1891
01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.730
Under some biting error.

1892
01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:31.970
Friar, it cannot be.

1893
01:35:31.970 --> 01:35:34.330
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left

1894
01:35:34.330 --> 01:35:36.570
Is that she will not add to her damnation

1895
01:35:36.570 --> 01:35:41.200
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:

1896
01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:43.630
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse

1897
01:35:43.630 --> 01:35:46.730
That which appears in proper nakedness?

1898
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:50.300
Lady, what man is he you are accused of?

1899
01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:53.030
They know that do accuse me;

1900
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:58.270
I know none: If I know more of any man alive

1901
01:35:58.270 --> 01:35:59.970
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,

1902
01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:05.130
Let all my sins lack mercy!

1903
01:36:05.130 --> 01:36:10.000
O my father, Prove you that any man with me conversed

1904
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.630
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight

1905
01:36:12.630 --> 01:36:15.630
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,

1906
01:36:15.630 --> 01:36:21.930
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!

1907
01:36:21.930 --> 01:36:26.400
There is some strange misprision in the princes.

1908
01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.830
Two of them have the very bent of honour;

1909
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:32.700
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,

1910
01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:35.830
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,

1911
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:40.130
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.

1912
01:36:40.130 --> 01:36:43.500
I know not.

1913
01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:46.100
If they speak but truth of her,

1914
01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.570
These hands shall tear her;

1915
01:36:48.570 --> 01:36:51.300
if they wrong her honour,

1916
01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:54.570
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.

1917
01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:58.270
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,

1918
01:36:58.270 --> 01:37:00.570
Nor age so eat up my invention,

1919
01:37:00.570 --> 01:37:03.170
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,

1920
01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:06.500
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,

1921
01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:11.130
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,

1922
01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:14.000
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,

1923
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.530
Ability in means and choice of friends,

1924
01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:18.730
To quit me of them throughly.

1925
01:37:18.730 --> 01:37:24.370
Pause awhile, And let my counsel sway you in this case.

1926
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:39.700
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:

1927
01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:42.000
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,

1928
01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.330
And publish it that she is dead indeed;

1929
01:37:44.330 --> 01:37:46.830
Maintain a mourning ostentation

1930
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:47.970
And on your family's old monument

1931
01:37:47.970 --> 01:37:50.470
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites

1932
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:53.500
That appertain unto a burial.

1933
01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.800
What shall become of this? what will this do?

1934
01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.830
Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf

1935
01:37:58.830 --> 01:38:04.430
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:

1936
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:08.330
But not for that dream I on this strange course,

1937
01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:12.230
But on this travail look for greater birth.

1938
01:38:12.230 --> 01:38:14.000
She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,

1939
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.870
Upon the instant that she was accused,

1940
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:21.600
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused

1941
01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:25.170
Of every hearer: for it so falls out

1942
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:27.100
That what we have we prize not to the worth

1943
01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:30.330
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,

1944
01:38:30.330 --> 01:38:33.830
Why, then we rack the value, then we find

1945
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:36.230
The virtue that possession would not show us

1946
01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:39.070
Whiles it was ours.

1947
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:42.770
So will it fare with Claudio:

1948
01:38:42.770 --> 01:38:45.900
When he shall hear she died upon his words,

1949
01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.530
The idea of her life

1950
01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:52.270
shall sweetly creep Into his study of imagination,

1951
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:54.130
And every lovely organ of her life

1952
01:38:54.130 --> 01:38:57.330
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,

1953
01:38:57.330 --> 01:38:59.330
More moving-delicate and full of life,

1954
01:38:59.330 --> 01:39:03.730
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,

1955
01:39:03.730 --> 01:39:08.770
Than when she lived indeed;

1956
01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:13.200
then shall he mourn, If ever love had interest in his liver,

1957
01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.930
And wish he had not so accused her,

1958
01:39:15.930 --> 01:39:21.400
No, though he thought his accusation true.

1959
01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:24.330
Let this be so, and doubt not but success

1960
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:26.470
Will fashion the event in better shape

1961
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:28.530
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.

1962
01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:30.530
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,

1963
01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:32.200
The supposition of the lady's death

1964
01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.330
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:

1965
01:39:35.330 --> 01:39:38.430
And if it sort not well,

1966
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:42.070
you may conceal her, As best befits her wounded reputation,

1967
01:39:42.070 --> 01:39:45.070
In some reclusive and religious life,

1968
01:39:45.070 --> 01:39:51.800
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.

1969
01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:58.370
Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:

1970
01:39:58.370 --> 01:40:00.070
And though you know my inwardness

1971
01:40:00.070 --> 01:40:03.930
and love Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,

1972
01:40:03.930 --> 01:40:05.230
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this

1973
01:40:05.230 --> 01:40:10.600
As secretly and justly as your soul Should with your body.

1974
01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.470
Being that I flow in grief,

1975
01:40:14.470 --> 01:40:16.930
The smallest twine may lead me.

1976
01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:22.370
'Tis well consented: presently away;

1977
01:40:22.370 --> 01:40:30.170
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.

1978
01:40:30.170 --> 01:40:35.970
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day

1979
01:40:35.970 --> 01:40:44.270
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.

1980
01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:05.170
Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?

1981
01:41:05.170 --> 01:41:09.100
Yea, and I will weep a while longer.

1982
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:14.230
I will not desire that.

1983
01:41:14.230 --> 01:41:16.330
You have no reason; I do it freely.

1984
01:41:16.330 --> 01:41:20.270
Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.

1985
01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:26.400
Ah, how much might the man deserve of me

1986
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:29.900
that would right her!

1987
01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:31.600
Is there any way to show such friendship?

1988
01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.630
A very even way, but no such friend.

1989
01:41:36.630 --> 01:41:37.700
May a man do it?

1990
01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:47.730
It is a man's office, but not yours.

1991
01:41:47.730 --> 01:41:55.430
I do love nothing in the world so well as you:

1992
01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:01.300
is not that strange?

1993
01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:11.630
As strange as the thing I know not.

1994
01:42:11.630 --> 01:42:13.070
It were as possible for me to say

1995
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:16.530
I loved nothing so well as you: but believe me not;

1996
01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:21.300
and yet I lie not; I confess nothing,

1997
01:42:21.300 --> 01:42:23.700
nor I deny nothing.

1998
01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:27.430
I am sorry for my cousin.

1999
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:29.770
By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.

2000
01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:31.270
Do not swear, and eat it.

2001
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:32.770
I will swear by it that you love me;

2002
01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:38.170
and I will make him eat it that says I love not you.

2003
01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:39.270
Will you not eat your word?

2004
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:40.870
With no sauce that can be devised to it.

2005
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:46.200
I protest I love thee.

2006
01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.430
Why, then, God forgive me!

2007
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:48.900
What offence, sweet Beatrice?

2008
01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:49.930
You have stayed me in a happy hour:

2009
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:51.130
I was about to protest I loved you.

2010
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:56.000
And do it with all thy heart.

2011
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.030
I love you with so much of my heart

2012
01:42:58.030 --> 01:43:00.870
that none is left to protest.

2013
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:04.270
Come, bid me do any thing for thee.

2014
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:11.530
Kill Claudio.

2015
01:43:11.530 --> 01:43:14.500
Ha!

2016
01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.870
not for the wide world.

2017
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:19.900
You kill me to deny it.

2018
01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:20.600
Farewell.

2019
01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:22.230
Tarry, sweet Beatrice.

2020
01:43:22.230 --> 01:43:27.070
I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in you:

2021
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:28.200
nay, I pray you, let me go.

2022
01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.170
Beatrice,-- In faith, I will go.

2023
01:43:30.170 --> 01:43:31.430
We'll be friends first.

2024
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:35.030
You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.

2025
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:36.500
Is Claudio thine enemy?

2026
01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:38.900
Is he not approved in the height a villain,

2027
01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:40.800
that hath slandered, scorned,

2028
01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:43.430
dishonoured my kinswoman?

2029
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:46.270
O that I were a man!

2030
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:49.800
What, bear her in hand until they come to take hands;

2031
01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.770
and then, with public accusation,

2032
01:43:53.770 --> 01:43:57.970
uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,

2033
01:43:57.970 --> 01:44:00.470
--O God, that I were a man!

2034
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:02.500
I would eat his heart in the market-place.

2035
01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:03.630
Hear me, Beatrice,--

2036
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:06.300
Talk with a man out at a window!

2037
01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:07.130
A proper saying!

2038
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:08.870
Nay, but, Beatrice,-- Sweet Hero!

2039
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:10.630
She is wronged, she is slandered,

2040
01:44:10.630 --> 01:44:11.800
she is undone.

2041
01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:12.500
Beat--

2042
01:44:12.500 --> 01:44:14.300
Princes and counties!

2043
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:16.500
Surely, a princely testimony,

2044
01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.830
a goodly count, Count Comfect;

2045
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:21.630
a sweet gallant, surely!

2046
01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:25.730
O that I were a man for his sake!

2047
01:44:25.730 --> 01:44:32.400
or that I had any friend would be a man for my sake!

2048
01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.300
But manhood is melted into courtesies,

2049
01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:44.070
valour into compliment, and men are only turned into tongue,

2050
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.930
and trim ones too:

2051
01:44:44.930 --> 01:44:46.630
he is now as valiant as Hercules

2052
01:44:46.630 --> 01:44:55.570
that only tells a lie and swears it.

2053
01:44:55.570 --> 01:44:58.030
I cannot be a man with wishing,

2054
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:59.770
therefore I will die a woman with grieving.

2055
01:44:59.770 --> 01:45:02.970
Tarry, good Beatrice.

2056
01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:06.430
By this hand, I love thee.

2057
01:45:06.430 --> 01:45:10.670
Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.

2058
01:45:13.770 --> 01:45:19.400
Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?

2059
01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:26.930
Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.

2060
01:45:26.930 --> 01:45:36.800
Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him.

2061
01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:42.130
I will kiss your hand, and so I leave you.

2062
01:45:42.130 --> 01:45:47.970
By this hand, Claudio shall render me a dear account.

2063
01:45:47.970 --> 01:45:50.800
As you hear of me, so think of me.

2064
01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:56.170
Go, comfort your cousin: I must say she is dead:

2065
01:45:56.170 --> 01:46:05.430
and so, farewell.

2066
01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:23.100


2067
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:43.000
Is our whole dissembly appeared?

2068
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.070
O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.

2069
01:46:49.330 --> 01:46:51.330
Which be the malefactors?

2070
01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:53.830
Marry, that am I and my partner.

2071
01:46:53.830 --> 01:46:56.570
Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.

2072
01:46:56.570 --> 01:47:00.600
But which are the offenders that are to be examined?

2073
01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.530
let them come before master constable.

2074
01:47:02.530 --> 01:47:07.400
Yea, marry, let them come before me.

2075
01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.100
What is your name, friend?

2076
01:47:09.100 --> 01:47:09.970
Borachio.

2077
01:47:09.970 --> 01:47:12.430
Pray, write down, Borachio.

2078
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:13.570
Yours, sirrah?

2079
01:47:13.570 --> 01:47:17.430
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.

2080
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:20.700
Write down, master gentleman Conrade.

2081
01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.070
Masters, do you serve God?

2082
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:23.600
Yea, sir, we hope.

2083
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:26.100
Write down, that they hope they serve God:

2084
01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:27.230
and write God first;

2085
01:47:27.230 --> 01:47:30.570
for God forbid but God should go before such villains!

2086
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:34.700
Masters, it is proved already

2087
01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:37.230
that you are little better than false knaves;

2088
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:39.600
and it will go near to be thought so shortly.

2089
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.370
How answer you for yourselves?

2090
01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:43.130
Marry, sir, we say we are none.

2091
01:47:43.130 --> 01:47:45.730
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you:

2092
01:47:45.730 --> 01:47:47.570
but I will go about with him.

2093
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:51.600
Come you, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir,

2094
01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:54.830
I say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.

2095
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:56.770
Sir, I say to you we are none.

2096
01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:59.270
Well, stand aside.

2097
01:47:59.270 --> 01:48:00.900
'Fore God, they are both in a tale.

2098
01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:02.270
Have you writ down, that they are none?

2099
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:05.400
Master constable, you go not the way to examine:

2100
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.230
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.

2101
01:48:08.230 --> 01:48:11.170
Yea, marry, that's the eftest way.

2102
01:48:11.170 --> 01:48:13.200
Let the watch come forth.

2103
01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.100
Masters, I charge you, in the prince's name,

2104
01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.230
accuse these men.

2105
01:48:17.230 --> 01:48:19.530
This man said, sir, that Don John,

2106
01:48:19.530 --> 01:48:23.300
the prince's brother, was a villain.

2107
01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:24.870
Write down Prince John a villain.

2108
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:25.930
Why, this is flat perjury,

2109
01:48:25.930 --> 01:48:27.570
to call a prince's brother villain.

2110
01:48:27.570 --> 01:48:28.200
Master constable,--

2111
01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:30.130
Pray thee, fellow, peace:

2112
01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:32.700
I do not like thy look, I promise thee.

2113
01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:34.130
What heard you him say else?

2114
01:48:34.130 --> 01:48:36.800
Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats

2115
01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:41.170
of Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.

2116
01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:43.600
Flat burglary as ever was committed.

2117
01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.630
Yea, by mass, that it is.

2118
01:48:45.630 --> 01:48:47.270
What else, fellow?

2119
01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:49.100
And that Count Claudio did mean,

2120
01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:53.600
upon his words, to disgrace Hero before the whole assembly.

2121
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.330
and not marry her.

2122
01:48:55.330 --> 01:48:57.370
O villain! thou wilt be condemned

2123
01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:59.270
into everlasting redemption for this.

2124
01:48:59.270 --> 01:49:02.770
What else?

2125
01:49:02.770 --> 01:49:04.500
This is all.

2126
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:07.600
And this is more, masters, than you can deny.

2127
01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.830
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;

2128
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:12.600
Hero was in this manner accused,

2129
01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:16.070
in this very manner refused,

2130
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:21.230
and upon the grief of this suddenly died.

2131
01:49:21.230 --> 01:49:23.430
Master constable, let these men be bound,

2132
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:25.670
and brought to Leonato's: I will go before

2133
01:49:25.670 --> 01:49:28.670
and show him their examination.

2134
01:49:28.670 --> 01:49:30.070
Come, let them be opinioned.

2135
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:32.100
Let them be in the hands--

2136
01:49:32.100 --> 01:49:33.570
Off, coxcomb!

2137
01:49:33.570 --> 01:49:36.000
God's my life, where's the sexton?

2138
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.370
let him write down the prince's officer coxcomb.

2139
01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:40.500
Bind them.

2140
01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:41.700
Thou naughty varlet!

2141
01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.600
Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.

2142
01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:48.270
Dost thou not suspect my place?

2143
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:51.730
dost thou not suspect my years?

2144
01:49:51.730 --> 01:49:54.600
O that he were here to write me down an ass!

2145
01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:56.830
But, masters, remember that I am an ass;

2146
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:58.630
though it be not written down,

2147
01:49:58.630 --> 01:50:00.630
yet forget not that I am an ass.

2148
01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:04.330
No, thou villain, thou art full of piety,

2149
01:50:04.330 --> 01:50:07.270
as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.

2150
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:09.930
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more,

2151
01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:12.000
an officer, and, which is more,

2152
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.830
a householder, and, which is more,

2153
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:17.730
as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in Messina,

2154
01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:19.700
and one that knows the law, go to;

2155
01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:22.330
and a rich fellow enough, go to;

2156
01:50:22.330 --> 01:50:23.930
and a fellow that hath had losses,

2157
01:50:23.930 --> 01:50:26.030
and one that hath two gowns

2158
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:28.330
and every thing handsome about him.

2159
01:50:28.330 --> 01:50:31.330
Bring him away.

2160
01:50:31.330 --> 01:50:35.530
O that I had been writ down an ass!

2161
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.630
If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:

2162
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:43.600
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief Against yourself.

2163
01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:46.170
I pray thee, cease thy counsel,

2164
01:50:46.170 --> 01:50:47.800
Which falls into mine ears as profitless

2165
01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.230
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;

2166
01:50:52.230 --> 01:50:54.430
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear

2167
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:59.970
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.

2168
01:50:59.970 --> 01:51:02.770
Bring me a father that so loved his child,

2169
01:51:02.770 --> 01:51:05.170
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,

2170
01:51:05.170 --> 01:51:08.330
And bid him speak of patience;

2171
01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:11.470
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine

2172
01:51:11.470 --> 01:51:13.770
And let it answer every strain for strain,

2173
01:51:13.770 --> 01:51:15.830
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,

2174
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:18.600
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:

2175
01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:22.200
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,

2176
01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:29.230
bring him yet to me, And I of him will gather patience.

2177
01:51:29.230 --> 01:51:32.630
But there is no such man: for, brother,

2178
01:51:32.630 --> 01:51:35.400
men Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief

2179
01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:37.600
Which they themselves not feel;

2180
01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.230
but, tasting it, Their counsel turns to passion,

2181
01:51:40.230 --> 01:51:42.870
which before Would give preceptial medicine to rage,

2182
01:51:42.870 --> 01:51:45.330
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,

2183
01:51:45.330 --> 01:51:48.100
Charm ache with air and agony with words:

2184
01:51:48.100 --> 01:51:51.600
No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience

2185
01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.430
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,

2186
01:51:54.430 --> 01:51:56.470
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency

2187
01:51:56.470 --> 01:51:59.870
To be so moral when he shall endure The like himself.

2188
01:51:59.870 --> 01:52:05.100
Therefore give me no counsel:

2189
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:07.830
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

2190
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:10.300
Therein do men from children nothing differ.

2191
01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.600
I pray thee, peace.

2192
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.570
I will be flesh and blood; For there was never yet philosopher

2193
01:52:15.570 --> 01:52:17.700
That could endure the toothache patiently,

2194
01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:19.570
However they have writ the style of gods

2195
01:52:19.570 --> 01:52:21.430
And made a push at chance and sufferance.

2196
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:25.130
Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;

2197
01:52:25.130 --> 01:52:26.900
Make those that do offend you suffer too.

2198
01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:29.600
There thou speak'st reason: nay,

2199
01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.330
I will do so.

2200
01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:34.430
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;

2201
01:52:34.430 --> 01:52:35.800
And that shall Claudio know;

2202
01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:40.670
so shall the prince And all of them that thus dishonour her.

2203
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:44.300
Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.

2204
01:52:48.370 --> 01:52:49.470
Good den, good den.

2205
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:51.200
Good day to both of you.

2206
01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:53.370
Hear you. my lords,--

2207
01:52:53.370 --> 01:52:55.300
We have some haste, Leonato.

2208
01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.770
Some haste, my lord!

2209
01:52:56.770 --> 01:53:00.570
well, fare you well, my lord: Are you so hasty now?

2210
01:53:00.570 --> 01:53:02.100
well, all is one.

2211
01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:05.000
Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

2212
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.800
If he could right himself with quarreling,

2213
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.430
Some of us would lie low.

2214
01:53:08.430 --> 01:53:09.500
Who wrongs him?

2215
01:53:09.500 --> 01:53:11.900
Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--

2216
01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:14.630
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;

2217
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:16.900
I fear thee not.

2218
01:53:16.900 --> 01:53:19.530
Marry, beshrew my hand, If it should give your age

2219
01:53:19.530 --> 01:53:21.970
such cause of fear:

2220
01:53:21.970 --> 01:53:23.800
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

2221
01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:27.030
Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:

2222
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:29.000
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,

2223
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:30.530
As under privilege of age to brag

2224
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:34.830
What I have done being young, or what would do Were I not old.

2225
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:37.530
Know, Claudio, to thy head,

2226
01:53:37.530 --> 01:53:40.430
Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me

2227
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:43.170
That I am forced to lay my reverence by

2228
01:53:43.170 --> 01:53:45.870
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,

2229
01:53:45.870 --> 01:53:47.970
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.

2230
01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:51.600
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;

2231
01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:54.230
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,

2232
01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:56.400
And she lies buried with her ancestors;

2233
01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.630
O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,

2234
01:53:58.630 --> 01:54:01.500
Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!

2235
01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:02.270
My villany?

2236
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:04.730
Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.

2237
01:54:04.730 --> 01:54:06.070
You say not right, old man.

2238
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:08.100
My lord, my lord, I'll prove it on his body,

2239
01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:11.570
if he dare, Despite his nice fence and his active practise,

2240
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:13.670
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.

2241
01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:15.030
Away!

2242
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:16.730
I will not have to do with you.

2243
01:54:16.730 --> 01:54:18.570
Canst thou so daff me?

2244
01:54:18.570 --> 01:54:20.700
Thou hast kill'd my child: If thou kill'st me, boy,

2245
01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:22.070
thou shalt kill a man.

2246
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:24.930
He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:

2247
01:54:24.930 --> 01:54:27.670
But that's no matter; let him kill one first;

2248
01:54:27.670 --> 01:54:29.830
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.

2249
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:31.230
Come, follow me, boy;

2250
01:54:31.230 --> 01:54:34.000
come, sir boy, come, follow me: Sir boy,

2251
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.070
I'll whip you from your foining fence;

2252
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:38.300
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.

2253
01:54:38.300 --> 01:54:39.830
Brother,-- Content yourself.

2254
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:41.870
God knows I loved my niece;

2255
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:46.070
And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,

2256
01:54:46.070 --> 01:54:48.400
That dare as well answer a man indeed

2257
01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.230
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:

2258
01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:55.530
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!

2259
01:54:55.530 --> 01:54:56.530
Brother Antony,--

2260
01:54:56.530 --> 01:54:59.700
Hold you content. What, man! I know them,

2261
01:54:59.700 --> 01:55:01.030
yea, And what they weigh,

2262
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:02.500
even to the utmost scruple,

2263
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:05.570
- Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,

2264
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:07.500
That lie and cog and flout,

2265
01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:09.800
deprave and slander,

2266
01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:11.600
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,

2267
01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.830
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,

2268
01:55:13.830 --> 01:55:16.600
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;

2269
01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.000
And this is all. But, brother Antony,--

2270
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.870
Come, 'tis no matter: Do not you meddle;

2271
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:26.300
let me deal in this.

2272
01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:31.670
Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.

2273
01:55:31.670 --> 01:55:34.200
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:

2274
01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.270
But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing

2275
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:39.930
But what was true and very full of proof.

2276
01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:41.530
My lord, my lord,--

2277
01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:43.100
I will not hear you.

2278
01:55:43.100 --> 01:55:47.600
No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.

2279
01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:52.000
And shall, or some of us will smart for it.

2280
01:55:55.130 --> 01:56:01.370
See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.

2281
01:56:01.370 --> 01:56:03.300
Now, signior, what news?

2282
01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:05.070
Good day, my lord.

2283
01:56:05.070 --> 01:56:09.500
Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part almost a fray.

2284
01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.400
We had like to have had our two noses snapped off

2285
01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:13.070
with two old men without teeth.

2286
01:56:13.070 --> 01:56:14.770
Leonato and his brother.

2287
01:56:14.770 --> 01:56:16.170
What thinkest thou?

2288
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:19.430
Had we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.

2289
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:22.200
In a false quarrel there is no true valour.

2290
01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:23.430
I came to seek you both.

2291
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:25.070
We have been up and down to seek thee;

2292
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:26.570
for we are high-proof melancholy

2293
01:56:26.570 --> 01:56:28.630
and would fain have it beaten away.

2294
01:56:28.630 --> 01:56:30.070
Wilt thou use thy wit?

2295
01:56:30.070 --> 01:56:33.000
It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?

2296
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.500
Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?

2297
01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:36.600
Never any did so,

2298
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:39.600
though very many have been beside their wit.

2299
01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.600
I will bid thee draw, as we do the minstrels;

2300
01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:43.630
draw, to pleasure us.

2301
01:56:43.630 --> 01:56:48.400
As I am an honest man, he looks pale.

2302
01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:51.000
Art thou sick, or angry?

2303
01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:52.330
What, courage, man!

2304
01:56:52.330 --> 01:56:53.730
What though care killed a cat,

2305
01:56:53.730 --> 01:56:56.000
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.

2306
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.230
Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career,

2307
01:56:59.230 --> 01:57:00.830
and you charge it against me.

2308
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:04.130
I pray you choose another subject.

2309
01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:05.300
Nay, then, give him another staff:

2310
01:57:05.300 --> 01:57:08.900
this last was broke cross.

2311
01:57:09.170 --> 01:57:12.370
By this light, he changes more and more:

2312
01:57:12.370 --> 01:57:14.330
I think he be angry indeed.

2313
01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:16.570
If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.

2314
01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:18.730
Shall I speak a word in your ear?

2315
01:57:18.730 --> 01:57:23.000
God bless me from a challenge!

2316
01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.630
You are a villain; I jest not:

2317
01:57:26.630 --> 01:57:28.570
I will make it good how you dare,

2318
01:57:28.570 --> 01:57:31.500
with what you dare, and when you dare.

2319
01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:35.930
Do me right, or I will protest your cowardice.

2320
01:57:35.930 --> 01:57:39.200
You have killed a sweet lady,

2321
01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:42.370
and her death shall fall heavy on you.

2322
01:57:44.900 --> 01:57:49.500
Let me hear from you.

2323
01:57:54.970 --> 01:58:00.130
Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.

2324
01:58:00.130 --> 01:58:02.100
What, a feast, a feast?

2325
01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.130
I' faith, I thank him;

2326
01:58:03.130 --> 01:58:05.770
he hath bid me to a calf's head and a capon;

2327
01:58:05.770 --> 01:58:07.500
the which if I do not carve most curiously,

2328
01:58:07.500 --> 01:58:08.970
say my knife's naught.

2329
01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:10.870
Shall I not find a woodcock too?

2330
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:14.900
Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.

2331
01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:20.530
I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the other day.

2332
01:58:20.530 --> 01:58:24.730
I said, thou hadst a fine wit:

2333
01:58:24.730 --> 01:58:27.900
'True, said she, 'a fine little one.'

2334
01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:30.370
'No, said I, 'a great wit:'

2335
01:58:30.370 --> 01:58:34.100
'Right, says she, 'a great gross one.'

2336
01:58:34.100 --> 01:58:37.400
'Nay, said I, 'a good wit:'

2337
01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:41.470
'Just, said she, 'it hurts nobody.'

2338
01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:44.800
'Nay, said I, 'the gentleman is wise:'

2339
01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:48.770
'Certain, said she, 'a wise gentleman.'

2340
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:51.830
'Nay, said I, 'he hath the tongues:'

2341
01:58:51.830 --> 01:58:54.300
'That I believe, said she,

2342
01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:56.970
'for he swore a thing to me on Monday night,

2343
01:58:56.970 --> 01:58:59.030
which he forswore on Tuesday morning;

2344
01:58:59.030 --> 01:59:02.570
there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.'

2345
01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:04.730
Thus did she, an hour together,

2346
01:59:04.730 --> 01:59:08.200
transshape thy particular virtues:

2347
01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:11.930
yet at last she concluded with a sigh,

2348
01:59:11.930 --> 01:59:15.700
thou wast the properest man in Italy.

2349
01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:18.770
For the which she wept heartily and said she cared not.

2350
01:59:18.770 --> 01:59:22.270
Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that,

2351
01:59:22.270 --> 01:59:24.900
an if she did not hate him deadly,

2352
01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:29.030
she would love him dearly: the old man's daughter

2353
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:30.530
told us all.

2354
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:33.070
All, all; and, moreover,

2355
01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:36.170
God saw him when he was hid in the garden.

2356
01:59:36.170 --> 01:59:39.600
But when shall we set the savage bull's horns

2357
01:59:39.600 --> 01:59:41.200
on the sensible Benedick's head?

2358
01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.700
Yea, and text underneath,

2359
01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:47.430
'Here dwells Benedick the married man'?

2360
01:59:48.670 --> 01:59:55.670
Fare you well, boy: you know my mind.

2361
01:59:55.670 --> 02:00:00.100
I will leave you now to your gossip-like humour:

2362
02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:02.800
you break jests as braggarts do their blades,

2363
02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.230
which God be thanked, hurt not.

2364
02:00:05.230 --> 02:00:09.370
My lord, for your many courtesies I thank you:

2365
02:00:09.370 --> 02:00:12.430
I must discontinue your company:

2366
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:16.370
your brother the bastard is fled from Messina:

2367
02:00:16.370 --> 02:00:18.670
you have among you killed a sweet and innocent lady.

2368
02:00:18.670 --> 02:00:21.470
For my Lord Lackbeard there,

2369
02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:25.230
he and I shall meet:

2370
02:00:25.230 --> 02:00:28.430
and, till then, peace be with him.

2371
02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.570
He is in earnest.

2372
02:00:37.570 --> 02:00:39.600
In profound earnest;

2373
02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:43.870
and, I'll warrant you, for the love of Beatrice.

2374
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:47.600
And hath challenged thee.

2375
02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:50.300
Most sincerely.

2376
02:00:50.300 --> 02:00:51.700
What a pretty thing man is

2377
02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:56.100
when he goes in his doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!

2378
02:00:56.100 --> 02:00:59.470
But, soft you, let me be:

2379
02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:05.030
pluck up, my heart, and be sad.

2380
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:09.200
Did he not say, my brother was fled?

2381
02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:11.930
Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you,

2382
02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:14.100
she shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance:

2383
02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:16.070
nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite once,

2384
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:17.630
you must be looked to.

2385
02:01:17.630 --> 02:01:18.500
How now?

2386
02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.370
two of my brother's men bound!

2387
02:01:20.370 --> 02:01:21.670
Borachio one!

2388
02:01:21.670 --> 02:01:23.670
Hearken after their offence, my lord.

2389
02:01:23.670 --> 02:01:28.100
Officers, what offence have these men done?

2390
02:01:28.100 --> 02:01:30.900
Marry, sir, they have committed false report;

2391
02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:33.800
moreover, they have spoken untruths;

2392
02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:36.370
secondarily, they are slanders;

2393
02:01:36.370 --> 02:01:39.800
sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady;

2394
02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:42.800
thirdly, they have verified unjust things;

2395
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:47.900
and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.

2396
02:01:49.330 --> 02:01:53.300
First, I ask thee what they have done;

2397
02:01:53.300 --> 02:01:56.830
thirdly, I ask thee what's their offence;

2398
02:01:56.830 --> 02:02:00.370
sixth and lastly, why they are committed;

2399
02:02:00.370 --> 02:02:05.000
and, to conclude, what you lay to their charge.

2400
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.100
Rightly reasoned, and in his own division:

2401
02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:09.530
Who have you offended, masters,

2402
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:12.530
that you are thus bound to your answer?

2403
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:15.830
this learned constable is too cunning to be understood:

2404
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:17.370
what's your offence?

2405
02:02:17.370 --> 02:02:21.170
Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:

2406
02:02:21.170 --> 02:02:24.400
do you hear me, and let this count kill me.

2407
02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:27.070
I have deceived even your very eyes:

2408
02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:29.430
what your wisdoms could not discover,

2409
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:31.970
these shallow fools have brought to light:

2410
02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:35.530
who in the night overheard me confessing to this man

2411
02:02:35.530 --> 02:02:36.970
how Don John your brother

2412
02:02:36.970 --> 02:02:39.830
incensed me to slander the Lady Hero,

2413
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:41.900
how you were brought into the orchard

2414
02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:45.770
and saw me court Margaret in Hero's garments,

2415
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:48.770
how you disgraced her, when you should marry her:

2416
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:50.770
my villany they have upon record;

2417
02:02:50.770 --> 02:02:52.770
which I had rather seal with my death

2418
02:02:52.770 --> 02:02:55.330
than repeat over to my shame.

2419
02:02:55.330 --> 02:02:59.270
The lady is dead upon mine and my master's false accusation;

2420
02:02:59.270 --> 02:03:01.130
and, briefly, I desire nothing

2421
02:03:01.130 --> 02:03:04.270
but the reward of a villain.

2422
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:09.600
Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?

2423
02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.230
I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.

2424
02:03:14.230 --> 02:03:16.300
But did my brother set thee on to this?

2425
02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:19.870
Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.

2426
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:24.000
He is composed and framed of treachery:

2427
02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:25.870
And fled he is upon this villany.

2428
02:03:25.870 --> 02:03:28.170
Sweet Hero!

2429
02:03:28.170 --> 02:03:29.270
now thy image doth appear

2430
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:32.100
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.

2431
02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:34.100
Come, bring away the plaintiffs:

2432
02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:35.230
by which time

2433
02:03:35.230 --> 02:03:38.200
our sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:

2434
02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:41.100
and, masters, do not forget to specify,

2435
02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:43.230
when time and place shall serve,

2436
02:03:43.230 --> 02:03:44.900
that I am an ass.

2437
02:03:44.900 --> 02:03:47.970
Here, here comes master Signior Leonato,

2438
02:03:47.970 --> 02:03:49.500
and the Sexton too.

2439
02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:52.970
Which is the villain?

2440
02:03:52.970 --> 02:03:55.230
let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him,

2441
02:03:55.230 --> 02:03:57.230
I may avoid him: which of these is he?

2442
02:03:57.230 --> 02:04:00.430
If you would know your wronger, look on me.

2443
02:04:00.430 --> 02:04:01.700
Art thou the slave

2444
02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:04.200
that with thy breath hast kill'd Mine innocent child?

2445
02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.470
Yea, even I alone.

2446
02:04:06.470 --> 02:04:10.970
No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:

2447
02:04:10.970 --> 02:04:13.830
Here stand a pair of honourable men;

2448
02:04:13.830 --> 02:04:15.900
A third is fled, that had a hand in it.

2449
02:04:15.900 --> 02:04:19.400
I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:

2450
02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.830
Record it with your high and worthy deeds:

2451
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:26.530
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.

2452
02:04:26.530 --> 02:04:29.900
I know not how to pray your patience;

2453
02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:35.230
Yet I must speak.

2454
02:04:35.230 --> 02:04:39.170
Choose your revenge yourself;

2455
02:04:39.170 --> 02:04:41.230
Impose me to what penance your invention

2456
02:04:41.230 --> 02:04:48.500
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not But in mistaking.

2457
02:04:48.500 --> 02:04:51.370
By my soul, nor I:

2458
02:04:51.370 --> 02:04:54.430
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,

2459
02:04:54.430 --> 02:04:57.100
I would bend under any heavy weight

2460
02:04:57.100 --> 02:04:59.770
That he'll enjoin me to.

2461
02:04:59.770 --> 02:05:04.100
I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;

2462
02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:08.300
That were impossible: but, I pray you both,

2463
02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:10.100
Possess the people in Messina here

2464
02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:13.630
How innocent she died;

2465
02:05:13.630 --> 02:05:16.830
and if your love Can labour ought in sad invention,

2466
02:05:16.830 --> 02:05:20.470
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb

2467
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:29.530
And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:

2468
02:05:29.530 --> 02:05:33.300
To-morrow morning come you to my house,

2469
02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:35.200
And since you could not be my son-in-law,

2470
02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:40.130
Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,

2471
02:05:40.130 --> 02:05:42.700
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,

2472
02:05:42.700 --> 02:05:46.770
And she alone is heir to both of us:

2473
02:05:46.770 --> 02:05:51.230
Give her the right you should have given her cousin,

2474
02:05:51.230 --> 02:05:54.970
And so dies my revenge.

2475
02:05:54.970 --> 02:05:56.970
O noble sir,

2476
02:05:56.970 --> 02:06:00.970
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!

2477
02:06:00.970 --> 02:06:03.170
I do embrace your offer;

2478
02:06:03.170 --> 02:06:06.970
and dispose For henceforth of poor Claudio.

2479
02:06:06.970 --> 02:06:10.270
To-morrow then I will expect your coming;

2480
02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:14.300
To-night I take my leave.

2481
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:17.900
This naughty man Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,

2482
02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:20.170
Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,

2483
02:06:20.170 --> 02:06:22.030
Hired to it by your brother.

2484
02:06:22.030 --> 02:06:23.800
No, by my soul, she was not,

2485
02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:26.370
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,

2486
02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:29.030
But always hath been just and virtuous

2487
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:31.100
In any thing that I do know by her.

2488
02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:34.270
Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white

2489
02:06:34.270 --> 02:06:37.300
and black, this plaintiff here, the offender,

2490
02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:39.330
did call me ass:

2491
02:06:39.330 --> 02:06:42.030
I beseech you, let it be remembered in his punishment.

2492
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:46.170
And also, the watch heard them talk of one Deformed:

2493
02:06:46.170 --> 02:06:49.470
they say be wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,

2494
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:51.170
and borrows money in God's name,

2495
02:06:51.170 --> 02:06:53.500
the which he hath used so long and never paid

2496
02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:55.470
that now men grow hard-hearted

2497
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:58.470
and will lend nothing for God's sake:

2498
02:06:58.470 --> 02:07:01.600
pray you, examine him upon that point.

2499
02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:05.230
I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

2500
02:07:05.230 --> 02:07:08.570
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverend youth;

2501
02:07:08.570 --> 02:07:11.970
and I praise God for you.

2502
02:07:14.970 --> 02:07:16.430
There's for thy pains.

2503
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:18.630
God save the foundation!

2504
02:07:18.630 --> 02:07:20.670
Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner,

2505
02:07:20.670 --> 02:07:22.930
and I thank thee.

2506
02:07:22.930 --> 02:07:25.630
I leave an arrant knave with your worship;

2507
02:07:25.630 --> 02:07:27.800
I beseech your worship to correct yourself,

2508
02:07:27.800 --> 02:07:29.830
for the example of others.

2509
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:31.270
God keep your worship!

2510
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:34.630
I wish your worship well; God restore you to health!

2511
02:07:34.630 --> 02:07:37.600
I humbly give you leave to depart;

2512
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:39.370
and if a merry meeting may be wished,

2513
02:07:39.370 --> 02:07:42.030
God prohibit it!

2514
02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:44.430
Come, neighbour.

2515
02:07:50.170 --> 02:07:53.270
Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.

2516
02:07:53.270 --> 02:07:56.900
Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.

2517
02:07:57.170 --> 02:07:59.530
We will not fail.

2518
02:07:59.530 --> 02:08:03.130
To-night I'll mourn with Hero.

2519
02:08:05.570 --> 02:08:07.530
Bring you these fellows on.

2520
02:08:07.530 --> 02:08:08.830
We'll talk with Margaret,

2521
02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:13.600
How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.

2522
02:08:25.800 --> 02:08:27.700
Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret,

2523
02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:29.270
deserve well at my hands

2524
02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:30.400
by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.

2525
02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.870
Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?

2526
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:35.230
In so high a style, Margaret,

2527
02:08:35.230 --> 02:08:37.630
that no man living shall come over it;

2528
02:08:37.630 --> 02:08:40.430
for, in most comely truth, thou deservest it.

2529
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:42.100
To have no man come over me!

2530
02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:44.600
why, shall I always keep below stairs?

2531
02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:47.070
Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth;

2532
02:08:47.070 --> 02:08:48.900
Margaret, it catches.

2533
02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:51.100
And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils,

2534
02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.400
which hit, but hurt not.

2535
02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:55.770
A most manly wit, Margaret;

2536
02:08:55.770 --> 02:08:59.030
it will not hurt a woman:

2537
02:08:59.030 --> 02:09:03.400
and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice:

2538
02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:04.630
I give thee the bucklers.

2539
02:09:04.630 --> 02:09:09.300
Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.

2540
02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:12.930
If you use them, Margaret,

2541
02:09:12.930 --> 02:09:17.130
you must put in the pikes with a vice;

2542
02:09:17.130 --> 02:09:19.930
and they are dangerous weapons for maids.

2543
02:09:19.930 --> 02:09:23.830
Well, I will call Beatrice to you,

2544
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:25.700
who I think hath legs.

2545
02:09:25.700 --> 02:09:32.470
And therefore will come.

2546
02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:48.370
The god of love, That sits above,

2547
02:09:48.370 --> 02:09:54.500
And knows me, and knows me,

2548
02:09:54.500 --> 02:10:03.870
How pitiful I deserve,-- I mean in singing;

2549
02:10:03.870 --> 02:10:08.500
but in loving, Leander the good swimmer,

2550
02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:10.500
Troilus the first employer of panders,

2551
02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:13.530
and a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,

2552
02:10:13.530 --> 02:10:15.300
whose names yet run smoothly

2553
02:10:15.300 --> 02:10:16.900
in the even road of a blank verse,

2554
02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:20.300
why, they were never so truly turned over and over

2555
02:10:20.300 --> 02:10:23.930
as my poor self in love.

2556
02:10:23.930 --> 02:10:25.400
Marry, I cannot show it in rhyme;

2557
02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:31.600
I have tried: I can find out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,'

2558
02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:38.270
an innocent rhyme; for 'scorn, 'horn,'

2559
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:41.900
a hard rhyme; for, 'school,' 'fool,'

2560
02:10:41.900 --> 02:10:44.500
a babbling rhyme; very ominous endings:

2561
02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:47.570
no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,

2562
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:52.330
nor I cannot woo in festival terms.

2563
02:10:54.170 --> 02:10:58.900
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?

2564
02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:01.730
Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.

2565
02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:04.370
O, stay but till then!

2566
02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:08.970
'Then' is spoken; fare you well now:

2567
02:11:08.970 --> 02:11:14.470
and yet, ere I go, let me go with that I came;

2568
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:16.430
which is, with knowing what hath passed

2569
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:17.500
between you and Claudio.

2570
02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:21.230
Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.

2571
02:11:21.230 --> 02:11:24.670
Foul words is but foul wind,

2572
02:11:24.670 --> 02:11:26.430
and foul wind is but foul breath,

2573
02:11:26.430 --> 02:11:27.730
and foul breath is noisome;

2574
02:11:27.730 --> 02:11:29.700
therefore I will depart unkissed.

2575
02:11:29.700 --> 02:11:33.030
Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,

2576
02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:37.170
so forcible is thy wit.

2577
02:11:37.170 --> 02:11:38.900
But I must tell thee plainly,

2578
02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:41.700
Claudio undergoes my challenge;

2579
02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:43.170
and either I must shortly hear from him,

2580
02:11:43.170 --> 02:11:47.700
or I will subscribe him a coward.

2581
02:12:05.670 --> 02:12:10.270
I pray you, tell me for which of my bad parts

2582
02:12:10.270 --> 02:12:15.030
didst thou first fall in love with me?

2583
02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:17.030
For them all together;

2584
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:19.070
which maintained so politic a state of evil

2585
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:20.730
that they will not admit any good part

2586
02:12:20.730 --> 02:12:22.300
to intermingle with them.

2587
02:12:22.300 --> 02:12:23.670
But for which of my good parts

2588
02:12:23.670 --> 02:12:25.270
did you first suffer love for me?

2589
02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:27.100
Suffer love!

2590
02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:29.700
a good epithet!

2591
02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:32.530
I do suffer love indeed, for I love thee against my will.

2592
02:12:32.530 --> 02:12:34.770
In spite of your heart, I think;

2593
02:12:34.770 --> 02:12:38.500
alas, poor heart!

2594
02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:39.570
If you spite it for my sake,

2595
02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:41.300
I will spite it for yours; for I will never love

2596
02:12:41.300 --> 02:12:43.370
that which my friend hates.

2597
02:12:43.370 --> 02:12:48.530
Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

2598
02:12:48.530 --> 02:12:50.700
It appears not in this confession:

2599
02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:52.130
there's not one wise man among twenty

2600
02:12:52.130 --> 02:12:55.000
that will praise himself.

2601
02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.530
An old, an old instance, Beatrice,

2602
02:12:58.530 --> 02:13:01.530
that lived in the lime of good neighbours.

2603
02:13:01.530 --> 02:13:06.670
If a man do not erect in this age his own tomb ere he dies,

2604
02:13:06.670 --> 02:13:08.070
he shall live no longer in monument

2605
02:13:08.070 --> 02:13:10.130
than the bell rings and the widow weeps.

2606
02:13:10.130 --> 02:13:11.330
And how long is that, think you?

2607
02:13:11.330 --> 02:13:16.970
Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in rheum:

2608
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:22.300
therefore is it most expedient for the wise,

2609
02:13:22.300 --> 02:13:24.930
if his conscience, find no impediment to the contrary,

2610
02:13:24.930 --> 02:13:26.900
to be the trumpet of his own virtues,

2611
02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:31.900
as I am to myself.

2612
02:13:32.670 --> 02:13:34.500
So much for praising myself,

2613
02:13:34.500 --> 02:13:41.900
who, I myself will bear witness, is praiseworthy:

2614
02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:44.430
how doth your cousin?

2615
02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:46.870
Very ill.

2616
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:50.970
And how do you?

2617
02:13:50.970 --> 02:13:53.770
Very ill too.

2618
02:13:53.770 --> 02:14:01.300
Serve God, love me and mend.

2619
02:14:06.230 --> 02:14:08.770
There will I leave you too, for here comes one in haste.

2620
02:14:08.770 --> 02:14:10.700
Madam, you must come to your uncle.

2621
02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:12.230
Yonder's old coil at home:

2622
02:14:12.230 --> 02:14:15.970
it is proved my Lady Hero hath been falsely accused,

2623
02:14:15.970 --> 02:14:18.570
the prince and Claudio mightily abused;

2624
02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:20.530
and Don John is the author of all,

2625
02:14:20.530 --> 02:14:22.200
who is fed and gone.

2626
02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.230
Will you come presently?

2627
02:14:24.230 --> 02:14:26.300
Will you go hear this news, signior?

2628
02:14:26.300 --> 02:14:28.830
I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap,

2629
02:14:28.830 --> 02:14:30.200
and be buried in thy eyes;

2630
02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:34.870
and moreover I will go with thee to thy uncle's.

2631
02:14:50.800 --> 02:15:00.900
(♪music)

2632
02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:06.700
(♪music)

2633
02:15:38.570 --> 02:15:40.070
Is this the monument of Leonato?

2634
02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:43.100
It is, my lord.

2635
02:15:49.370 --> 02:15:52.870
Done to death by slanderous tongues

2636
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:56.300
Was the Hero that here lies:

2637
02:15:56.300 --> 02:15:59.970
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,

2638
02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:04.900
Gives her fame which never dies.

2639
02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:09.330
So the life that died with shame

2640
02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:14.930
Lives in death with glorious fame.

2641
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:20.900
Hang thou there upon the tomb,

2642
02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:25.170
Praising her when I am dumb.

2643
02:16:25.170 --> 02:16:32.070
Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.

2644
02:16:32.070 --> 02:16:41.100
(♪SONG)

2645
02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:45.670
Pardon, goddess of the night,

2646
02:16:45.670 --> 02:16:50.400
Those that slew thy virgin knight;

2647
02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:55.400
For the which, with songs of woe,

2648
02:16:55.400 --> 02:17:00.130
Round about her tomb they go.

2649
02:17:00.130 --> 02:17:09.770
Midnight, assist our moan; Help us to sigh and groan,

2650
02:17:09.770 --> 02:17:14.500
Graves, yawn and yield your dead,

2651
02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:19.230
Till death be uttered,

2652
02:17:19.230 --> 02:17:23.800
Now, unto thy bones good night!

2653
02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:29.070
Yearly will I do this rite.

2654
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:31.000
(end of song)

2655
02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:43.170
Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:

2656
02:17:43.170 --> 02:17:45.570
The wolves have prey'd;

2657
02:17:45.570 --> 02:17:49.170
and look, the gentle day, Before the wheels of Phoebus,

2658
02:17:49.170 --> 02:17:55.130
round about Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.

2659
02:17:55.130 --> 02:18:00.330
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.

2660
02:18:00.330 --> 02:18:05.330
Good morrow, masters: each his several way.

2661
02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:09.830
Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;

2662
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:12.270
And then to Leonato's we will go.

2663
02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:15.370
And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's

2664
02:18:15.370 --> 02:18:19.900
Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.

2665
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:26.600
Did I not tell you she was innocent?

2666
02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:28.470
So are the prince and Claudio,

2667
02:18:28.470 --> 02:18:32.570
who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated:

2668
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:35.570
But Margaret was in some fault for this,

2669
02:18:35.570 --> 02:18:37.800
Although against her will, as it appears

2670
02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:39.700
In the true course of all the question.

2671
02:18:39.700 --> 02:18:43.070
Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.

2672
02:18:43.070 --> 02:18:46.600
And so am I, being else by faith enforced

2673
02:18:46.600 --> 02:18:48.930
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.

2674
02:18:48.930 --> 02:18:51.670
Daughter, and you gentle-women all,

2675
02:18:51.670 --> 02:18:53.900
Withdraw to a chamber by yourselves,

2676
02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:57.300
And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.

2677
02:18:59.030 --> 02:19:02.900
The prince and Claudio promised by this hour To visit me.

2678
02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:04.670
You know your office, brother:

2679
02:19:04.670 --> 02:19:06.700
You must be father to your brother's daughter

2680
02:19:06.700 --> 02:19:09.100
And give her to young Claudio.

2681
02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.900
Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.

2682
02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:17.700
Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

2683
02:19:17.700 --> 02:19:19.230
To do what, signior?

2684
02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:24.870
To bind me, or undo me; one of them.

2685
02:19:24.870 --> 02:19:27.830
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,

2686
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:30.400
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.

2687
02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:35.170
That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.

2688
02:19:35.170 --> 02:19:37.730
And I with an eye of love requite her.

2689
02:19:37.730 --> 02:19:40.130
The sight whereof I think she got from me,

2690
02:19:40.130 --> 02:19:44.830
From Claudio and the prince:

2691
02:19:44.830 --> 02:19:47.200
Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:

2692
02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:49.130
But, what's your will,

2693
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:55.170
my will? Oh, my will, is your good will

2694
02:19:55.170 --> 02:19:58.370
This day may stand with ours, to be conjoin'd

2695
02:19:58.370 --> 02:20:01.430
In the state of honourable marriage:

2696
02:20:01.430 --> 02:20:04.030
In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.

2697
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:06.370
My heart is with your liking.

2698
02:20:06.370 --> 02:20:08.630
And my help.

2699
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:11.170
Here comes the prince and Claudio.

2700
02:20:11.170 --> 02:20:13.070
Good morrow to this fair assembly.

2701
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:16.330
Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:

2702
02:20:16.330 --> 02:20:17.830
We here attend you.

2703
02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:19.100
Are you yet determined

2704
02:20:19.100 --> 02:20:21.970
To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?

2705
02:20:21.970 --> 02:20:25.400
I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.

2706
02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:31.870
Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.

2707
02:20:32.300 --> 02:20:34.930
Good morrow, Benedick.

2708
02:20:34.930 --> 02:20:36.200
Why, what's the matter,

2709
02:20:36.200 --> 02:20:38.930
That you have such a February face,

2710
02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:42.930
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?

2711
02:20:42.930 --> 02:20:44.870
I think he thinks upon the savage bull.

2712
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:48.800
Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold

2713
02:20:48.800 --> 02:20:50.630
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,

2714
02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:53.430
As once Europa did at lusty Jove,

2715
02:20:53.430 --> 02:20:55.300
When he would play the noble beast in love.

2716
02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:58.530
Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;

2717
02:20:58.530 --> 02:21:02.900
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,

2718
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:05.670
And got a calf in that same noble feat

2719
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:09.870
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

2720
02:21:09.870 --> 02:21:15.430
For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.

2721
02:21:22.930 --> 02:21:25.200
Which is the lady I must seize upon?

2722
02:21:25.200 --> 02:21:31.770
This same is she, and I do give you her.

2723
02:21:31.770 --> 02:21:34.130
Why, then she's mine.

2724
02:21:34.130 --> 02:21:35.370
Sweet, let me see your face.

2725
02:21:35.370 --> 02:21:39.500
No, that you shall not, till you take her hand

2726
02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:45.130
Before this friar and swear to marry her.

2727
02:21:45.130 --> 02:21:50.230
Give me your hand: before this holy friar,

2728
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:54.230
I am your husband, if you like of me.

2729
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:58.830
And when I lived, I was your other wife:

2730
02:21:58.830 --> 02:22:03.200
And when you loved, you were my other husband.

2731
02:22:03.200 --> 02:22:04.570
Another Hero!

2732
02:22:04.570 --> 02:22:08.230
Nothing certainer: One Hero died defiled,

2733
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:11.200
but I do live, And surely as I live,

2734
02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:13.170
I am a maid.

2735
02:22:13.170 --> 02:22:15.670
The former Hero!

2736
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:17.630
Hero that is dead!

2737
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:22.470
She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.

2738
02:22:22.470 --> 02:22:24.400
All this amazement can I qualify:

2739
02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:27.070
When after that the holy rites are ended,

2740
02:22:27.070 --> 02:22:31.370
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:

2741
02:22:31.370 --> 02:22:34.600
Meantime let wonder seem familiar,

2742
02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:37.900
And to the chapel let us presently.

2743
02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:43.400
Soft and fair, friar.

2744
02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:45.130
Which is Beatrice?

2745
02:22:45.130 --> 02:22:48.800
I answer to that name.

2746
02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:50.770
What is your will?

2747
02:22:50.770 --> 02:22:52.670
Do not you love me?

2748
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:55.900
(laughing)

2749
02:22:55.900 --> 02:23:00.270
Why, no; no more than reason.

2750
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:02.130
Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio

2751
02:23:02.130 --> 02:23:05.300
Have been deceived; they swore you did.

2752
02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:06.370
Do not you love me?

2753
02:23:06.370 --> 02:23:08.730
Troth, no; no more than reason.

2754
02:23:08.730 --> 02:23:12.900
Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula Are much deceived;

2755
02:23:12.900 --> 02:23:14.800
for they did swear you did.

2756
02:23:14.800 --> 02:23:16.430
They swore that you were almost sick for me.

2757
02:23:16.430 --> 02:23:17.830
They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.

2758
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:20.130
'Tis no such matter.

2759
02:23:20.130 --> 02:23:21.070
Then you do not love me?

2760
02:23:21.070 --> 02:23:24.270
No, truly, but in friendly recompense.

2761
02:23:24.270 --> 02:23:27.430
Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.

2762
02:23:27.430 --> 02:23:29.400
And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;

2763
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.600
For here's a paper written in his hand,

2764
02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:33.970
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,

2765
02:23:33.970 --> 02:23:35.770
Fashion'd to Beatrice.

2766
02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:38.200
And here's another Writ in my cousin's hand,

2767
02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:39.700
stolen from her pocket,

2768
02:23:39.700 --> 02:23:46.500
Containing her affection unto Benedick.

2769
02:23:46.500 --> 02:23:48.000
A miracle!

2770
02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:54.200
here's our own hands against our hearts.

2771
02:23:54.200 --> 02:23:55.330
Come, I will have thee;

2772
02:23:55.330 --> 02:23:58.500
but, by this light, I take thee for pity.

2773
02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:02.100
I would not deny you; but, by this good day,

2774
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:05.300
I yield upon great persuasion;

2775
02:24:05.300 --> 02:24:06.500
and partly to save your life,

2776
02:24:06.500 --> 02:24:07.830
for I was told you were in a consumption.

2777
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:15.030
Peace! I will stop your mouth.

2778
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:25.030
How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?

2779
02:24:25.030 --> 02:24:27.570
I'll tell thee what, prince;

2780
02:24:27.570 --> 02:24:31.400
a college of wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour.

2781
02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:34.600
Dost thou think I care for a satire or an epigram?

2782
02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:37.300
No: if a man will be beaten with brains,

2783
02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:38.800
a' shall wear nothing handsome about him.

2784
02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.630
In brief, since I do purpose to marry,

2785
02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:45.670
I will think nothing to any purpose

2786
02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:47.500
that the world can say against it;

2787
02:24:47.500 --> 02:24:49.070
and therefore never flout at me

2788
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:51.200
for what I have said against it;

2789
02:24:51.200 --> 02:25:00.270
for man is a giddy thing, and this is my conclusion.

2790
02:25:04.570 --> 02:25:07.600
Claudio, I did think to have beaten thee,

2791
02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.600
but in that thou art like to be my kinsman,

2792
02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:11.830
live unbruised and love my cousin.

2793
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:13.400
I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,

2794
02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:15.930
that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single life,

2795
02:25:15.930 --> 02:25:17.500
to make thee a double-dealer;

2796
02:25:17.500 --> 02:25:18.900
which, out of question, thou wilt be,

2797
02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:21.900
if my cousin do not look exceedingly narrowly to thee.

2798
02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:23.970
Come, come, we are friends:

2799
02:25:23.970 --> 02:25:26.000
let's have a dance ere we are married,

2800
02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:29.330
that we may lighten our own hearts and our wives' heels.

2801
02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:32.130
We'll have dancing afterward.

2802
02:25:32.130 --> 02:25:33.830
First, of my word;

2803
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:36.500
Prince, thou art sad; thou art sad.

2804
02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:39.230
get thee a wife, get thee a wife:

2805
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:42.570
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.

2806
02:25:42.570 --> 02:25:48.030
My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,

2807
02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:50.400
And brought with armed men back to Messina.

2808
02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:53.100
Think not on him till to-morrow:

2809
02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:55.970
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.

2810
02:25:55.970 --> 02:25:59.970
Strike up, pipers.

2811
02:25:59.970 --> 02:26:05.670
(♪music)

2812
02:28:33.330 --> 02:28:36.330
