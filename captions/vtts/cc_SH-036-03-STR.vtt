00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170


2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:11.170
(â™ª singing in French)

3
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.400
Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,

4
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.100
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately hither:

5
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600
He must carry me a letter to my love.

6
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.100
A message well sympathized;

7
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.670
Horse to be ambassador for an ass.

8
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.900
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?

9
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.070
Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,

10
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.600
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go sir.

11
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.970
As swift as lead.

12
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.330
The meaning, pretty ingenious?

13
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.130
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

14
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.670
Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.

15
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.970
I say lead is slow.

16
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.500
You are too swift, sir, to say so:

17
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.130
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?

18
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.730
A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!

19
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.100
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:

20
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.630
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.

21
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.100
A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.

22
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.900
Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.

23
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.470
No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the mail,

24
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.530
O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain!

25
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.770
no l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!

26
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.800
By virtue, thou enforcest laughter;

27
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.200
thy silly thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs

28
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
provokes me to ridiculous smiling.

29
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.530
O, pardon me, my stars!

30
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.500
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, for a salve?

31
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.370
Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?

32
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.630
No, page: it is some epilogue or discourse, to make plain

33
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.070
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.

34
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.730
I will example it:

35
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.200
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,

36
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.170
Were still at odds, being but three.

37
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.100
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

38
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.000
I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.

39
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.670
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,

40
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.830
Were still at odds, being but three.

41
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.300
Until the goose came out of door,

42
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.870
And stay'd the odds by adding four.

43
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.170
Now will I begin your moral,

44
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.430
and do you follow with my l'envoy.

45
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.600
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,

46
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.930
Were still at odds, being but three.

47
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.670
Until the goose came out of door,

48
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.800
Staying the odds by adding four.

49
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.530
A good l'envoy, ending in the goose:

50
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.770
would you desire more?

51
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.470
How did this argument begin?

52
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.570
By saying here's a costard broken in a shin.

53
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.970
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.

54
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.170
True, and I for a plantain:

55
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.700
But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?

56
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.100
I will tell you sensibly.

57
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.800
Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth:

58
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.470
I will speak that l'envoy:

59
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.670
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,

60
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.030
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.

61
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.800
We will talk no more of this matter.

62
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.270
Till there be more matter in the shin.

63
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.100
Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

64
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.430
O, marry me to one Frances:

65
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.130
I smell some l'envoy, some goose, in this.

66
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.970
By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,

67
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.200
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.030
restrained, captivated, bound.

69
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.130
True, true; and now you will be my purgation

70
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.430
and let me loose.

71
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.070
I will give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance;

72
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.430
and, in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:

73
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:38.230
bear this significant to the country maid Jaquenetta:

74
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.470
there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine

75
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:53.200
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

76
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.600
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!

77
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.530
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings:

78
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.370
three farthings-- remuneration.--

79
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.900
'What's the price of this inkle?'

80
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.530
--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a remuneration:'

81
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.730
why, it carries it. Remuneration!

82
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.500
why, it is a fairer name than French crown.

83
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.230
I will never buy and sell out of this word.

84
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.230
O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.

85
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.800
Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man

86
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.000
buy for a remuneration?

87
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.070
What is a remuneration?

88
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.530
Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

89
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.270
Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

90
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.770
I thank your worship: God be wi' you!

91
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.730
Stay, slave; I must employ thee:

92
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.270
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,

93
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.100
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

94
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.730
When would you have it done, sir?

95
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.770
This afternoon.

96
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.370
Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.

97
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.800
Thou knowest not what it is.

98
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.130
I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

99
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.500
Why, villain, thou must know first.

100
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.770
I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.

101
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.870
It must be done this afternoon.

102
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.870
Hark, slave, it is but this:

103
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.870
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,

104
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.570
And in her train there is a gentle lady;

105
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.500
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,

106
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.530
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;

107
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.500
And to her white hand see thou do commend

108
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:18.270
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.

109
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.400
Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,

110
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.470
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon!

111
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.300
I will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!

112
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.930
And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;

113
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.370
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;

114
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.800
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;

115
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.230
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;

116
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.200
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!

117
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.370
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;

118
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.930
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;

119
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.700
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,

120
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.730
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,

121
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.170
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,

122
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.600
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,

123
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.600
Sole imperator and great general

124
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.770
Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--

125
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.430
And I to be a corporal of his field,

126
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.870
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!

127
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:29.400
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!

128
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.000
A woman, that is like a German clock,

129
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.870
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,

130
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.170
And never going aright, being a watch,

131
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.100
But being watch'd that it may still go right!

132
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.230
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;

133
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.700
And, among three, to love the worst of all;

134
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.170
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,

135
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.500
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;

136
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.700
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed

137
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.700
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:

138
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.170
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!

139
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.430
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague

140
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.770
That Cupid will impose for my neglect

141
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.100
Of his almighty dreadful little might.

142
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:19.270
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:

143
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:26.030
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.

144
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.030
