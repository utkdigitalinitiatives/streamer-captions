00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.170


2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:11.170
(â™ª singing in French)

3
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.400
Sweet air! Go, tendernessof years; take this key,

4
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.100
give enlargement to the swain,bring him festinately hither:

5
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.600
He must carry me a letter to mylove.

6
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.100
A message well sympathized;

7
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.670
Horse to be ambassador foran ass.

8
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.900
Ha, ha! what sayest thou?

9
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.070
Marry, sir, you must sendthe ass upon the horse,

10
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.600
for he is veryslow-gaited. But I go sir.

11
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.970
As swift as lead.

12
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.330
The meaning, prettyingenious?

13
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.130
Is not lead a metal heavy,dull, and slow?

14
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.670
Minime, honest master; orrather, master, no.

15
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.970
I say lead is slow.

16
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.500
You are too swift, sir, tosay so:

17
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.130
Is that lead slow which isfired from a gun?

18
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.730
A most acute juvenal;voluble and free of grace!

19
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.100
By thy favour, sweet welkin,I must sigh in thy face:

20
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.630
Most rude melancholy,valour gives thee place.

21
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.100
A wonder, master! here's acostard broken in a shin.

22
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.900
Some enigma, some riddle:come, thy l'envoy; begin.

23
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.470
No enigma, no riddle, nol'envoy; no salve in the mail,

24
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.530
O, sir, plantain,a plain plantain!

25
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.770
no l'envoy, no l'envoy; nosalve, sir, but a plantain!

26
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.800
By virtue, thouenforcest laughter;

27
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.200
thy silly thought my spleen;the heaving of my lungs

28
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200
provokes me toridiculous smiling.

29
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.530
O, pardon me, my stars!

30
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.500
Doth the inconsiderate takesalve for l'envoy, for a salve?

31
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.370
Do the wise think them other?is not l'envoy a salve?

32
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.630
No, page: it is some epilogueor discourse, to make plain

33
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.070
Some obscure precedencethat hath tofore been sain.

34
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.730
I will example it:

35
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.200
The fox, the ape, and thehumble-bee,

36
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.170
Were still at odds, beingbut three.

37
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.100
There's the moral. Now thel'envoy.

38
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.000
I will add the l'envoy.Say the moral again.

39
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.670
The fox, the ape, and thehumble-bee,

40
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.830
Were still at odds, beingbut three.

41
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.300
Until the goose came outof door,

42
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.870
And stay'd the odds byadding four.

43
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.170
Now will I begin your moral,

44
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.430
and do you followwith my l'envoy.

45
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.600
The fox, the ape, and thehumble-bee,

46
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.930
Were still at odds, beingbut three.

47
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.670
Until the goose came outof door,

48
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.800
Staying the odds by addingfour.

49
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.530
A good l'envoy,ending in the goose:

50
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.770
would you desire more?

51
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.470
How did this argumentbegin?

52
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.570
By saying here's a costardbroken in a shin.

53
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.970
Then call'd you for thel'envoy.

54
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.170
True, and I for a plantain:

55
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.700
But tell me; how was therea costard broken in a shin?

56
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.100
I will tell you sensibly.

57
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.800
Thou hast no feelingof it, Moth:

58
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.470
I will speak that l'envoy:

59
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.670
I Costard, running out,that was safely within,

60
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.030
Fell over the thresholdand broke my shin.

61
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.800
We will talk no more ofthis matter.

62
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.270
Till there be more matterin the shin.

63
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.100
Sirrah Costard, I willenfranchise thee.

64
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.430
O, marry me to one Frances:

65
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.130
I smell some l'envoy,some goose, in this.

66
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.970
By my sweet soul, I meansetting thee at liberty,

67
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.200
enfreedoming thy person;thou wert immured,

68
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.030
restrained, captivated,bound.

69
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.130
True, true; and now youwill be my purgation

70
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.430
and let me loose.

71
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.070
I will give thee thy liberty,set thee from durance;

72
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.430
and, in lieu thereof, imposeon thee nothing but this:

73
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:38.230
bear this significant to thecountry maid Jaquenetta:

74
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.470
there is remuneration; forthe best ward of mine

75
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:53.200
honour is rewarding mydependents. Moth, follow.

76
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.600
Now will I look to hisremuneration. Remuneration!

77
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.530
O, that's the Latin wordfor three farthings:

78
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.370
three farthings--remuneration.--

79
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.900
'What's the priceof this inkle?'

80
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.530
--'One penny.'--'No, I'llgive you a remuneration:'

81
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.730
why, it carriesit. Remuneration!

82
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.500
why, it is a fairer namethan French crown.

83
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.230
I will never buy andsell out of this word.

84
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.230
O, my good knave Costard!exceedingly well met.

85
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.800
Pray you, sir, how muchcarnation ribbon may a man

86
00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.000
buy for a remuneration?

87
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.070
What is a remuneration?

88
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.530
Marry, sir, halfpennyfarthing.

89
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.270
Why, then, three-farthingworth of silk.

Well, I will do it, sir:fare you well.

97

Hark, slave, it is butthis:

103

The princess comes to hunthere in the park,

104
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.570
And in her train there isa gentle lady;

105
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.500
When tongues speak sweetly,then they name her name,

106
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.530
And Rosaline they callher: ask for her;

107
00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.500
And to her white hand seethou do commend

108

112
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.930
And I, forsooth, in love! I,that have been love's whip;

113
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.370
A very beadle to ahumorous sigh;

114
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.800
A critic, nay, anight-watch constable;

115
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.230
A domineering pedant o'erthe boy;

116
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.200
Than whom no mortal somagnificent!

117
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.370
This whimpled, whining,purblind, wayward boy;

118
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.930
This senior-junior,giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;

119
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.700
Regent of love-rhymes,lord of folded arms,

120
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.730
The anointed sovereign ofsighs and groans,

121
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.170
Liege of all loiterers andmalcontents,

122
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.600
Dread prince of plackets,king of codpieces,

123
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.600
Sole imperator and greatgeneral

124
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.770
Of trotting 'paritors:--Omy little heart:--

125
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.430
And I to be a corporal ofhis field,

126
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.870
And wear his colours likea tumbler's hoop!

127
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:29.400
What, I! I love! I sue! Iseek a wife!

128
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.000
A woman, that is like aGerman clock,

129
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.870
Still a-repairing, everout of frame,

130
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.170
And never going aright,being a watch,

131
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:38.100
But being watch'd that itmay still go right!

132
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.230
Nay, to be perjured, whichis worst of all;

133
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.700
And, among three, to lovethe worst of all;

134
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.170
A wightly wanton with avelvet brow,

135
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.500
With two pitch-balls stuckin her face for eyes;

136
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.700
Ay, and by heaven, onethat will do the deed

137
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.700
Though Argus were hereunuch and her guard:

138
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.170
And I to sigh for her! towatch for her!

139
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.430
To pray for her! Go to; itis a plague

140
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.770
That Cupid will impose formy neglect

141
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.100
Of his almighty dreadfullittle might.

142
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:19.270
Well, I will love, write,sigh, pray, sue and groan:

143
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:26.030
Some men must love my ladyand some Joan.

144
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.030
