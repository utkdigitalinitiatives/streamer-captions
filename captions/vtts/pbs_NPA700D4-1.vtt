00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.700
MAN: One learns that the
world, though made, is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.500
yet being made, that this is
still the morning of creation,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.500
that mountains long conceived
and now being born brought to

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.230
light by the glaciers,
channels traced for rivers,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.000
basins hollowed for lakes.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.560
When we try to pick out
anything by itself, we find it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.730
hitched to everything
else in the universe.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.000
The whole wilderness
in unity and interrelation

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.160
is alive and familiar.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.760
The very stones
seem talkative,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.200
sympathetic, brotherly.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.660
Everybody needs beauty,
as well as bread, places to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.930
play in and pray in, where
nature may heal and give

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.530
strength to body
and soul alike.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.900
This natural beauty hunger
is made manifest in our

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.730
magnificent national parks...

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.700
nature's sublime wonderlands,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.160
the admiration and joy
of the world.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.460
John Muir.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.030
PETER COYOTE: They are
a treasure house of nature's

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.160
superlatives, 84 million
acres of the most stunning

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.500
landscapes anyone
has ever seen...

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.330
including: a mountain so
massive it creates its own

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.100
weather, whose peak rises more
than 20,000 feet above

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.830
sea level, the highest point
on the continent...

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.000
a valley where a river
disappears into burning sands

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.530
282 feet below sea level,
the lowest and hottest

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.900
location in the hemisphere...

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.930
a labyrinth of caves longer
than any other ever measured...

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.460
and the deepest lake
in the nation

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.930
with the clearest water
in the world.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.730
They contain trees dead
for 225 million years

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.560
that are now solid rock...

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.560
and trees still growing that
were already saplings before

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.830
the time of Christ, before
Rome conquered the known

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.060
world, before the Greeks
worshipped in the Parthenon,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.030
before the Egyptians built
the pyramids, trees that are

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.260
the oldest
living things on Earth

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.230
and the tallest and the largest.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.730
They encompass a mile-deep
gash in the ground, where the

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:02.660
Hopis say the first people
emerged from the underworld

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.730
and where scientists say
a river has patiently carved its

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:12.800
way to expose rocks that are
1.7 billion years old,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.760
nearly half the age
of the planet itself...

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.560
and an island where a goddess
named Pele destroys everything

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.700
in her path while she
simultaneously gives birth

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.260
to new land.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.960
They preserve cathedrals
of stone gaily ornamented

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.400
by cascading ribbons
of water...

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.130
Arctic dreamscapes where
the rivers are made of ice...

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.560
and a geological wonderland
with rivers that steam,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.000
mud that boils amidst
the greatest collection

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.100
of geysers in the world.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.560
They became the last refuge
for magnificent species

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.000
of animals that otherwise
would have vanished forever...

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.830
and they remain a refuge
for human beings seeking to

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.600
replenish their spirit,
geographies of memory and hope

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.800
where countless American
families have forged

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.760
an intimate connection to
their land and then passed it

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.060
along to their children.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.100
MAN: I think that deep in our
DNA is this embedded memory

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.800
of when we were not separated
from the rest of the natural

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.060
world, that we
were part of it.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.830
The Bible talks about
the Garden of Eden as that

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.560
experience that we had at the
beginnings of our dimmest

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:27.200
memories as a species, and so
when we enter a park, we're

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.260
entering a place that has
been--at least the attempt has

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.360
been made to keep it like it
once was, and we cross that

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:38.860
boundary, and suddenly,
we're no longer masters

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.100
of the natural world.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:44.760
We're part of it,
and in that sense,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.900
it's like we're going home.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.300
It doesn't matter
where we're from.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.830
We've come back to a place
that is where we came from.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.600
MAN: It is the preservation of
the scenery, of the forests,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.660
and the wilderness game for
the people as a whole instead

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:15.030
of leaving the enjoyment
thereof to be confined to

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.530
the very rich.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.600
It is noteworthy in its
essential democracy, one

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.860
of the best bits of national
achievement which our people

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.960
have to their credit, and our
people should see to it that

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.660
they are preserved for their
children and their children's

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:42.730
children forever with their
majestic beauty all unmarred.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.160
Theodore Roosevelt.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.500
COYOTE: But they are more
than a collection of rocks

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:05.100
and trees and inspirational
scenes from nature.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.960
They embody something less
tangible yet equally enduring,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.430
an idea born in the
United States nearly a century

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:18.560
after its creation,
as uniquely American as

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.700
the Declaration of Independence
and just as radical.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.200
MAN: What could be more
democratic than owning

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:31.730
together the most magnificent
places on your continent?

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.700
Think about Europe.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.030
In Europe, the most
magnificent places,

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.800
the palaces, the parks,
are owned by aristocrats,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.830
by monarchs, by the wealthy.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:47.200
In America, magnificence is
a common treasure.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.200
That's the essence
of our democracy.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.860
COYOTE: "National parks,"
the writer and historian

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.500
Wallace Stegner once said,
"are the best idea

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.760
we've ever had."

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.400
MAN: It's not the best idea.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.330
The best idea came from
Thomas Jefferson, that all human

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.160
beings, irrespective of the
accident of their birth,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.060
are entitled to enjoy the
aspirations of being fully

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.160
complete and free
human beings.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.900
That's America's gift
to the world,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.300
but right up there
are the national parks.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.000
Jefferson, I think, would say
if you go out into the heart

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.600
of America and see this
continent in its glory,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.660
it will embolden
you to dream

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.060
about the possibilities of life,
that American nature is

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.160
the guarantor of American
Constitutional freedom,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.160
that if you don't have
a genuine link to nature

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.330
in a serious,
even profound way,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.460
you can't be an American.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.730
COYOTE: Like the idea
of America itself, full

00:11:55.730 --> 00:12:00.200
of competing demands and
impulses, the national park

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.460
idea has been constantly
debated, constantly tested,

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.430
and is constantly evolving,
ultimately embracing places

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:13.560
that also preserve the
nation's first principles,

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.260
its highest aspirations,
its greatest sacrifices,

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:25.460
even reminders of its
most shameful mistakes.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.530
Most of all, the story of the
national parks is the story

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.500
of people, people from every
conceivable background,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.200
rich and poor,
famous and unknown, soldiers

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.760
and scientists, natives and
newcomers, idealists, artists,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.900
and entrepreneurs, people
who were willing to devote

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.930
themselves to saving some
precious portion of the land

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:56.100
they loved and in doing so
reminded their fellow citizens

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:01.300
of the full meaning
of democracy.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.360
From the very beginning as
they struggled over who should

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.800
control their national parks,
what should be allowed within

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.230
their boundaries, even why
they should exist at all,

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.700
Americans have looked upon
these wonders of nature

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.660
and seen in them the
reflection of their own dreams.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.800
MAN: One of the things I think
we witness when we go to the

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:33.930
parks is the immensity and
the intimacy of time.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.230
On the one hand, we experience
the immensity of time,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:42.800
which is the creation itself,
it is the universe unfolding

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:49.300
before us, and yet it is also
time shared with the people

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.830
that we visit these places
with, and so it's the

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.400
experience that we remember
when our parents took us

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.000
for the first time to these
and then we as parents passing

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
them on to our children,
a kind intimate transmission

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.960
from generation to generation
to generation of the love

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:10.000
of place, the love of nation
that the national parks are

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.600
meant to stand for.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.200
[Birds chirping]

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.800
[Water running]

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.230
COYOTE: Early in 1851 during
the frenzy of the California

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.160
gold rush, an armed group of
white men was scouring the

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.160
western slopes of
the Sierra Nevada,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.000
searching for Indians,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.900
intent on driving them
from their homeland.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:50.260
They called themselves the
Mariposa Battalion, and late

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:54.900
on the afternoon of March 27,
they came to a narrow valley

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.900
lined by towering granite
cliffs where a series

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.100
of waterfalls dropped
thousands of feet to reach

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.800
the Merced River
on the valley's floor.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:10.330
One of the men, a young doctor
named Lafayette Bunnell stood

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:15.260
there transfixed.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.500
MAN AS LAFAYETTE AS BUNNELL:
As I looked, a peculiar,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.830
exalted sensation seemed
to fill my whole being,

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:26.000
and I found my eyes
in tears with emotion.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.660
I said with some enthusiasm,
"I have here seen the power

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.100
"and glory
of the Supreme Being.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.130
"The majesty of His handiwork
is in that testimony

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.230
"of the rocks."

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:43.730
COYOTE: Bunnell's enchantment
with the scenery was not

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.830
shared by the rest of the
Mariposa Battalion, who busied

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:53.530
themselves setting fire to
any Indian homes they found.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:57.500
Before the Battalion moved on,
Bunnell convinced the others

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.430
that as the first white men
ever to enter the valley they

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.230
should give it a name.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.730
He suggested Yosemite because
he thought that was the name

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:13.130
of the tribe they had
come to dispossess.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.060
Later, scholars would learn
that the people living in

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.400
the valley called it Ahwahnee,
meaning the place of a gaping

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:26.530
mouth, and they called
themselves the Ahwahneechee.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:29.230
Yosemite, it was learned,
meant something

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.360
entirely different.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.200
In the native language,
Yosemite refers to people

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.360
who should be feared.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.030
It means they are killers.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.130
4 years later in 1855,
a second group of white people

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.630
entered Yosemite Valley,
this time as tourists,

00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.530
not Indian fighters.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.330
They were led by
James Mason Hutchings,

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.460
an energetic Englishman
who had failed miserably

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.460
as a prospector
during the gold rush.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:11.900
Now he hoped to make a fortune
by promoting California's

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:18.130
scenic wonders through
an illustrated magazine.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.760
When a report about the
Indian campaign in the Sierras

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.560
mentioned a waterfall
more than 1,000 feet high,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.300
Hutchings rushed to see
it for himself.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.730
Word and images of
Yosemite quickly spread.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.760
Other tourists began
showing up to witness

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.730
its beauty firsthand.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.430
The trip required a two-day
journey from San Francisco to

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:57.460
the nearest town and then,
with no wagon road into

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:03.330
the valley, a grueling 3-day
trek by foot or horseback up

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.360
and down steep mountainsides
on narrow, rocky paths.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:19.300
But for most, the scenic
reward was worth the hardship.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:21.630
"Looking at the majestic
cathedral rocks

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.330
"and cathedral spires,"
wrote a Massachusetts

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.730
newspaperman, "made it easy to

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:30.130
"imagine that you are under
the ruins of an old gothic

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.900
"cathedral to which those of
Cologne and Milan are

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.260
"but baby houses."

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.830
Upon seeing Yosemite Falls,
the highest free-leaping

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.530
waterfall on the continent,
another visitor began

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.700
quoting The Bible.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:53.100
"Now let me die," he told his
companions, "for I am happy."

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.060
15 miles south of
Yosemite Valley,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.700
the Mariposa Grove
of giant sequoias contains

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.300
the largest living things

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.460
on earth, trees
nearly 3,000 years old.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.230
When Horace Greeley, editor
of the "New York Tribune,"

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.600
saw them, he boasted to his
readers that they were

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:19.030
"of substantial size when David
danced before the Ark."

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:23.000
Soon, the celebrated painter
Albert Bierstadt arrived

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.400
and produced a series
of masterpieces.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:33.260
One of them would command
a price of $25,000, equal to

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:40.360
the highest amount ever paid
for an American work of art.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.200
While Bierstadt painted,
his friend Fitz Hugh Ludlow

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.960
wrote dispatches that appeared
in "The Atlantic Monthly,"

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.760
the nation's most
prestigious magazine.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.830
MAN AS FITZ HUGH LUDLOW:
We did not so much seem to be

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:59.860
seeing from that crag of
vision a new scene on the old

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:05.000
familiar globe as a new heaven
and a new earth into which

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.030
the creative spirit had
just been breathed.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.760
I hesitate now, as I did then,
at the attempt to give my

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.760
vision utterance.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.130
Never were words as beggared
for an abridged translation

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.860
of any scripture of nature.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.630
JENKINSON: Jefferson looked
across America from the

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.260
portico at Monticello, and
he saw wilderness all the way

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:48.660
out, so he couldn't conceive
of a national park because,

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.700
for Jefferson, America
was a national park.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.400
This country is Eden, and we
Americans had this glorious

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.760
opportunity to see the world
in its infancy so that America

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.700
in a sense had been kept as
a symbol of what

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.060
the world once was.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:12.200
COYOTE: As Thomas Jefferson's
nation had grown,

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.860
the country's sense of itself
and its possibilities had

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:20.330
grown, as well, not only
in the political sphere

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:24.030
but in the arts, literature,
and in its citizens'

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:28.760
relationship to God.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.360
MAN: At the gates of the
forest, the surprised man

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.660
of the world is forced to
leave his city estimates

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.260
of great and small,
wise and foolish.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.730
The knapsack of custom falls
off his back with the first

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.330
step he takes.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.800
Here is sanctity which shames
our religions and reality

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.530
which discredits our heroes.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.900
Here, we find nature to be
the circumstance which dwarfs

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:05.730
every other circumstance
and judges like a god all men

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.530
that come to her.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:13.500
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.930
COYOTE: The transcendentalist
writer Ralph Waldo Emerson had

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.900
been telling Americans for
years that God was more easily

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:26.400
found in nature than
in the works of man.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.400
His disciple,
Henry David Thoreau,

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.460
had called for "little oases
of wildness in the desert

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.560
"of our civilization."

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:40.400
CRONON: What emerges in the
middle of the 19th Century is

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:48.330
this idea that going back to
wild nature is restorative,

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:51.700
it's a way of escaping the
corruptions of urban civilized

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.000
life, finding a more innocent
self, returning to who you

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.200
really are, returning to a
kind of authenticity, and if

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.460
you want to know God at
firsthand, the way to do that

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.700
is not to enter a cathedral,
not to open a book, but to go

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:11.360
to the mountaintop, and on the
mountaintop, there you will

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.030
see God as God truly is
in the world.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.930
COYOTE: But it was all
in danger as the nation,

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.800
in the name of manifest
destiny, marched inexorably

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.900
across the continent,
systematically dispossessing

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.360
Indian peoples from their
homelands and transforming

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.960
the land to new uses.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.700
The artist George Catlin
worried that the vast herds

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:45.630
of buffalo and the Indians who
depended on them would someday

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:50.230
be gone forever, and he called
for the creation of a nation's

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.800
park to save them both.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.230
No one listened.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:01.460
By the 1860s, the country's
most famous natural landmark,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.730
Niagara Falls, had
already been nearly ruined.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.100
Every overlook was owned by
a private landowner

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.330
charging a fee.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:14.630
Tourists could expect to
be badgered and oftentimes

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.830
swindled by the hucksters
and self-appointed guides who

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:22.860
swarmed the railroad depot
and carriage stands.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.260
European visitors publicly
belittled Americans

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.930
for allowing such a majestic
work of nature to become

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:33.860
blighted by commercial
development and offered it as

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.130
further evidence that the
United States was still

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.530
a backward,
uncivilized nation.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:44.830
CRONON: Americans feel that
the United States is somehow

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:49.530
inferior to Europe, where the
United States doesn't have the

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:52.560
ruins of Rome or of Greece,
it doesn't have the Acropolis,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.130
it doesn't have the Parthenon,
and so it seems like we're

00:24:55.130 --> 00:25:01.300
an inferior nation, and yet
the one thing we do have is

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.530
a nature that looks closer to
the new morning of God's own

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:08.600
creation, closer to paradise
than anything that Europe has

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.160
to offer, and so the thought
is that if we're to preserve

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.530
anything that stands for the
glory of America, then these

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:21.060
overwhelmingly beautiful,
sacred spots are the ones we

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.630
ought to preserve.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:29.560
COYOTE: On May 17, 1864,
in the midst of the Civil War,

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.500
with Union casualties
averaging 2,000 a day,

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.200
the junior senator from
California, John Conness,

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:42.700
rose to explain a bill
he had just introduced.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.730
It had nothing to do
with the war that threatened

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.160
to destroy his nation.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.100
MAN AS JOHN CONNESS: I will
state to the Senate that this

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.800
bill proposes to make a grant
of certain premises located

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.300
in the Sierra Nevada Mountains
in the state of California

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.700
that are for all public
purposes worthless but which

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.360
constitute perhaps some of the
greatest wonders of the world.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.000
It is a matter involving
no appropriation whatever.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.530
The property is of no
value to the government.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.500
COYOTE: Conness' bill
proposed something totally

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.560
unprecedented in human history,
setting aside not

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.200
a landscaped garden or a
city park but a large tract

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.560
of natural scenery for the
future enjoyment of everyone.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:39.660
More than 60 square miles of
federal land, encompassing

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:44.130
the Yosemite Valley and the
Mariposa Grove of big trees,

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.900
were to be transferred to
the care of the state

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.730
of California on the condition
that the land never be opened

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.900
for private ownership
and instead be preserved

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:01.830
for public use, resort,
and recreation.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.000
After only a few questions
and no objections, the Senate

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
passed Conness' bill and
moved on to other business.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.760
A month later, the House did
the same, and on June 30, 1864,

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.230
a day in which he also
signed bills increasing import

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.930
duties and broadening the
income tax in order to

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.500
continue a war to
preserve the Union,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.260
President Abraham Lincoln signed
a law to preserve forever

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.700
a beautiful valley and a grove
of trees that he had never seen

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:44.600
thousands of miles
away in California.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.760
JENKINSON: And so Lincoln,
who realizes that it's the

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.530
West that is the dynamo of
American life, it's the fuel

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:57.700
of American idealism--Lincoln
wants to save some significant

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:03.460
portions of it from what he
sees as the North's runaway

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:09.000
industrial idea of the
future of the continent.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.560
In a sense, the whole history
of America is a lament that

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.360
this Garden of Eden which we
have discovered is going to

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.260
slip away from us somehow.

00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.160
MAN: When I think of a grove
of giant sequoia, I think

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:37.000
of a cathedral or a church,
a place where you're not

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.230
necessarily worshipping
the name of something

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.900
but the presence
of something else.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.830
There's no need for someone
to remind you that there is

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.730
something in this world
that is larger than you are

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:56.360
because you can see it,
and you look up in a storm,

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.260
and you can't even see
the rim of the valley.

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.930
All you can see our clouds
gathered there at the rim

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.700
of the valley, and Yosemite
Falls seems to flow out

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:08.130
of the clouds itself
as if out of nowhere.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.530
It's a gathering place
of water, all the waters

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.430
of the sky flowing into that
one spot, which makes it

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:17.030
a gathering of life and a
gathering of spirit, as well,

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.600
and all of those things,
are flowing through Yosemite,

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.530
and so I think what better
place is there that has such

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.260
a confluence of so many
things flowing together

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:27.730
and the result is music?

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.400
MAN: Men who are rich enough
provide places of needed

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.700
recreation for themselves.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.000
They have done so from
the earliest periods known

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.660
in the history of the world.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.600
The enjoyment of the choicest
natural scenes in the country

00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.760
is thus a monopoly of a
very few, very rich people.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.260
The great mass of society,
including those to whom it

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:09.530
would be of the greatest
benefit, is excluded from it.

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.800
Thus, unless steps are taken
by government to withhold them

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.900
from the grasp of individuals,
all places favorable

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:21.830
in scenery to the recreation
of the mind and body will be

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:26.330
closed against the great
body of the people.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.600
Frederick Law Olmsted.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:34.200
COYOTE: 4 months after the
Civil War ended, a small group

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.330
gathered in Yosemite Valley
to hear Frederick Law Olmsted,

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:41.930
the celebrated designer of
New York City's Central Park,

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:45.360
read a report he had written
about the future of the land

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.900
that had just been entrusted
to the state of California.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:53.860
He called for strict
regulations to protect the

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.760
landscape from anything that
would, in his words, "obscure,

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.960
"distort, or detract from
the dignity of the scenery."

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.730
"In a place as special as
Yosemite," Olmsted said,

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:11.100
"the rights of posterity
were more important than

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:16.130
"the desires of the present."

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.960
MAN AS FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED:
Before many years if proper

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.860
facilities are offered,
these hundreds will become

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.900
thousands, and in a century,
the whole number of visitors

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.600
will be counted by millions.

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.830
An injury to the scenery so
slight that it may be unheeded

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:39.260
by any visitor now will be one
multiplied by those millions.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.500
COYOTE: But once Olmsted
returned to New York, a small

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.230
group of Yosemite
commissioners secretly

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:49.030
convened, decided his
recommendations were too

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.700
controversial to bring to the
state legislature, and quietly

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.260
shelved his report.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:01.160
Among those who studiously
ignored Olmsted's suggestions

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.730
on the future of Yosemite
was James Mason Hutchings.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:09.460
No one had done more than
Hutchings to bring the valley

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:13.760
to the nation's attention,
but now that the nation had

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.900
moved to protect it in
perpetuity by declaring it

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.230
public, no one
fought that decision

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:23.400
with greater vehemence.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.760
MAN: James Mason Hutchings
loved Yosemite, no doubt

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.100
about that, and every national
park will have somebody who

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.900
loves it deeply and then wants
to exploit the hell out of it.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.930
The thing about James Mason
Hutchings is that once he gets

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.260
control of Yosemite Valley
he does exactly what most

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.330
concessionaires do with a
beautiful place like that.

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.260
He begins to make it into
another Niagara Falls.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.000
You have to pay him for
the privilege of seeing

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.300
Yosemite Valley.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.260
COYOTE: He had already given
up his publishing business

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.030
and bought one of the valley's
two hotels, which he quickly

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:01.030
renamed The Hutchings House.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.800
He enjoyed lecturing his
guests and leading them

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.360
on sightseeing tours,
yet sometimes failed to

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.960
provide them with knives and
forks at dinner or forgetfully

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.800
filled their coffee
cups with cold water.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.560
"Guests would be better
served," one of his early

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.900
customers wrote, "if the
proprietor paid less attention

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.600
"to describing the beauties and
more to providing comfortable

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.330
"beds and properly
prepared meals."

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:32.400
WOMAN: Upstairs, the rooms
were only divided by pieces

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:37.460
of cotton cloth, and it
required some little strategy

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:40.930
to place the candle so that
one's figure should not appear

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:45.430
on the cloth partition hugely
magnified for the amusement

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:48.860
of one's neighbors.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.300
COYOTE: Hutchings was
technically a squatter

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.260
in Yosemite, but in brazen
defiance of the law, he went

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:58.360
about expanding
his operations.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.860
To provide the lumber he
needed would require a sawmill

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:07.800
Hutchings decided and
someone to run it.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:13.460
Just at that moment in the
fall of 1869, a 31-year-old

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:18.460
Scottish-born wanderer would
show up to apply for the job.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:23.260
He called himself "an unknown
nobody," but he would do far

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:27.230
more than Hutchings to extol
the beauty of Yosemite,

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.960
more than Frederick Law
Olmsted to protect it,

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:36.430
and with his lyrical voice
infuse the national park idea

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:39.630
with the passion of
religious fervor.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.460
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: I know
that I could under ordinary

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.360
circumstances accumulate
wealth and obtain a fair

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:53.130
position in society, but I
am sure that the mind of no

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.560
truant schoolboy is more free
and disengaged from all the

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.830
grave plans and purposes and
pursuits of ordinary orthodox

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.700
life than mine.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.400
John Muir.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.000
I don't know how you ever
account for an extraordinary

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.960
individual like John Muir.

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.660
It's one of the
enduring human mysteries.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:23.360
Out species is capable of such
pathetic, appalling narrowness

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.900
and occasionally of such
magnificent generosity.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:32.300
I don't know how to
account for that.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.000
COYOTE: John Muir was born in
Dunbar, Scotland, and raised

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.960
in Wisconsin, where he had
suffered a harsh childhood

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.000
at the hands of a tyrannical
father, an itinerant

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.060
Presbyterian minister who
insisted that Muir memorize

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:51.900
The Bible and repeatedly beat
him until by age 11 he was

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.030
able to recite 3/4
of The Old Testament

00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:01.060
and the entire
New Testament by heart.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.800
He was a natural-born
scientist, studied geology

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.460
and botany at the University
of Wisconsin, and coming

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.360
of age at a time when new
industries were transforming

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.560
post-war America, Muir also
showed great promise as

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:20.200
an inventor, increasing the
productivity of every one

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.460
of the businesses
that hired him.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.200
DUNCAN: He went to work in
a carriage factory

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:30.830
in Indianapolis and did a sort
of time-motion study that said

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:35.200
the factory is like a machine
itself and the human beings

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.400
are parts of that.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.060
He could have been
Andrew Carnegie, he could have

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.000
been--with his inventive genius,
he could have been

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.130
Thomas Edison, but something
inside of him drew him to

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:52.060
a different destiny.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.660
COYOTE: A factory accident
temporarily blinded him

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.600
for several months.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.930
When he regained his sight,
Muir fled his workday world

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:07.730
and set out on a thousand-mile
walk to Florida, pursuing his

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:11.530
passion for the natural
sciences, studying plants

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:16.860
and flowers, and beginning
a journal he would keep

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.560
for the rest of his life.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.760
MAN: When Muir began that walk,
he was intending to walk

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.760
to South America and to
eventually find the headwaters

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.230
of the Amazon, build himself
a raft, and float down the

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:48.600
entire length of the Amazon.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.930
Happily, he was discouraged
from doing so by a fever,

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.460
probably malaria that so
weakened him he decided that

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:59.060
going to the west coast and
what he had heard vaguely

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.260
of Yosemite might
be a better idea.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.260
COYOTE: After getting off a
boat in San Francisco, he was

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.560
asked, "Where do
you wish to go?"

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:14.460
Muir answered,
"Anywhere that's wild."

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.960
POPE: And he walks.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.130
The essence of John Muir
is the John Muir who walks.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:23.860
He immediately sets off across
Pacheco Pass, across the

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:30.260
Central Valley to Yosemite,
and it is this act of walking

00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:35.460
which actually creates a
faith for him, a new version

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.060
of Christianity,
a Christianity rooted in place

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.060
and wildness and nature.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:47.260
It's a Christianity that is
not about the built worship

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:50.630
of God but about the
worship of God's creation.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.530
COYOTE: Soon, he was rambling
across the Sierra Nevada,

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.830
the vast mountains he called
"the range of light, surely

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:10.460
"the brightest and best of
all the Lord has built."

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.260
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
We are now in the mountains,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.200
and they are in us,
kindling enthusiasm, making

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.100
every nerve quiver, filling
every pore and cell of us.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.700
Our flesh-and-bone tabernacle
seems transparent as glass to

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:44.160
the beauty about us, neither
old nor young, sick nor well,

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.830
but immortal.

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:56.230
COYOTE: Then he descended
into Yosemite Valley.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.660
"It was," Muir wrote,
"by far the

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.730
"grandest of all the special
temples of nature I was ever

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:07.560
"permitted to enter,

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.660
the sanctum sanctorum
of the Sierra."

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:17.660
When Hutchings offered him the
job, he realized he could make

00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:22.960
Yosemite his home.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.660
Muir built Hutchings' sawmill
and began producing lumber

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:29.830
for the many projects his
new employer directed him to

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.860
undertake: replacing the
muslin sheets with wooden

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.830
partitions in the hotel's
sleeping quarters; improving

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:41.760
a space called The Big Tree
Room built around the trunk

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:47.330
of a giant cedar; and erecting
two additional cottages to

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.230
accommodate the increasing
number of tourists,

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:55.060
now exceeding 1,000 a summer.

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.960
For himself and a fellow
worker, Muir built a one-room

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.460
cabin near the base of
Yosemite falls complete

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:06.400
with a single window facing
the falls, a floor paved

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.730
with stones spaced far enough
apart to allow ferns to

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:14.730
continue growing, and a
small ditch that brought part

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.830
of the creek into a corner of
the cabin "with just enough

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:21.530
"current," Muir wrote,
"to allow it to sing

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:26.160
"and warble in low, sweet
tones, delightful at night

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.600
"while I lay in my bed
suspended from the rafters."

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.400
Every free moment Muir devoted
to exploring the valley

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.800
and the mountain ramparts
surrounding it, traveling

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.960
for days with only a few
pounds of crackers, oatmeal,

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.960
and tea for nourishment,
the soles of his shoes studded

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.230
with nails for clamoring up
rocky slopes, pondering

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:55.330
the geology of the Sierras,
closely inspecting everything

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:59.860
he encountered, thinking
nothing of covering 50 miles

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.730
in a two-day excursion.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:08.100
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
I drifted from rock to rock,

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:14.400
from stream to stream,
from grove to grove.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.560
When I discovered a new plant,
I sat down beside it

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.430
for a minute or a day to make
its acquaintance and hear

00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:24.330
what it had to tell.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.130
I asked the boulders I met
whence they came and whither

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:32.800
they were going.

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:38.700
CRONON: One way to think
about John Muir is as a kind

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:43.260
of ecstatic holy man, a man
who is sort of in a berserk

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.560
rapture out there in nature
doing bizarre things that I

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.160
think most of us can't
imagine ever doing.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.960
DUNCAN: He decided he
wanted to go see the brink

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.400
of Yosemite falls a few
thousand feet or so above

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.160
the canyon floor, and
something, he said,

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.960
impelled him not just to go
look but to crawl out over the

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:11.260
edge and bring himself along
the side of the canyon face

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:14.300
so he could be--experience
what the water felt when it

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.130
goes, leaps over the edge.

00:43:17.130 --> 00:43:20.030
He went behind
Yosemite Falls, I mean,

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.300
crawling up just these very,
very dangerous,

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.500
slippery rocks.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.160
I mean, he didn't have
pitons and ice axes.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.460
He didn't have gear.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:34.500
He climbed up so he could
stand right behind the falls.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:38.760
He said, "I wanted to hear
the song of the waterfall."

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.860
STETSON: Some of the more
astonishing things he did

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:44.100
there was to ride a snow
avalanche to the bottom

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.560
of the valley, having spent
all day climbing to the top

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.830
of the Yosemite Valley walls
and then being swished to

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:53.960
the foot of that canyon in
just less than a minute.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.500
DUNCAN: He was interested in
the animals, and he saw a bear

00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:01.960
in a meadow and decided "If
I run at it, I can view it as

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.360
"what it looks like
when it's running."

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.360
Well, so he scampered and
made a bunch of noise.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.260
The bear raised up
an didn't run at all.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:15.360
He later called it "my
interview with the bear."

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.860
STETSON: An earthquake hit
Yosemite Valley, and Muir was

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.360
bounced from his bed and
ran outside, shouting,

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.260
"Noble earthquake!"

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:28.260
And as soon as a great section
of the wall had collapsed,

00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:29.800
he was racing to see it.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.260
[Thunder]

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.660
He celebrated trees by going
up, crawling up into the very

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.800
tops of them and letting
storms batter him so that he

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:45.360
understood what a storm
felt like to a tree.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.830
WOMAN: John Muir saw
the spirituality

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:50.900
inherent in granite.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.730
His view as a scientist and
his view as a deeply religious

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:58.700
man were the same view.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:02.500
He had this wonderful sense
of ecstasy, having been born

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:09.000
every single day new when he
was in a wild, raw landscape.

00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:24.130
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
I am a captive, I am bound.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.600
Love of pure, unblemished
nature seems to overmaster

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.760
and blur out of sight
all other objects

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:36.860
and considerations.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.460
COYOTE: "It was all part,"
Muir said, of his

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:44.960
"unconditional
surrender to nature.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:49.700
"The winds and cascading creeks
seemed to sing an exalting

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.700
"chorus audible to anyone
willing to listen."

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.560
He contemplated the life
of a raindrop, marveled

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:05.330
at the tenacity of plants
somehow clinging to life

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:09.760
on bare granite, soaked
sequoia cones in water

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.030
and drank the purple liquid.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:15.500
"To improve my color,"
he explained, "and render

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.260
"myself more tree-wise
and sequoical."

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.630
Other times, he liked to put
his head down between his

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:30.730
knees and look at the world
upside down to see what he

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:33.530
called "its upness."

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:40.200
Everywhere Muir turned,
he believed he was witnessing

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:45.260
the work and presence of God,
not the stern and wrathful God

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:51.000
of his father, who placed man
above nature, but a God who

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.100
revealed himself through
nature and for whom mankind

00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:01.130
was merely one part of a great,
joyously interconnected

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.960
web of being.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.900
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: I will
follow my instincts, be myself

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:12.760
for good or ill, and see
what will be the upshot.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.760
As long as I live, I'll hear
waterfalls and birds

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.230
and winds sing.

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:24.300
I'll interpret the rocks,
learn the language of flood,

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:28.030
storm, and the avalanche.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:32.060
I'll acquaint myself with
the glaciers and wild gardens

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:39.800
and get as near to the heart
of the world as I can.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.460
EHRLICH: John Muir once said,
"By going out into the natural

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.760
world, I'm really going in."

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:52.430
He defined in that sentence
what it is to be a human being

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:58.160
because I think we're born
lost, and we remain lost until

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:04.130
we remove the shell of who
we think we are, all the

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:10.560
preconceptions of who we think
we are and to expose ourselves

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:16.560
to the great power of the
natural world and to let that

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.630
power reshape us the way
it's reshaped the rocks

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:24.800
of Yosemite Valley.

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:28.600
COYOTE: Muir now felt he had
discovered something else,

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.760
his own destiny.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.260
The gaunt mountaineer with
blazing blue eyes and long

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:38.930
whiskers would devote
himself to understanding

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.100
the wilderness and then teach
others the lessons

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:43.130
he had learned.

00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:46.460
If Yosemite was a temple,
he would be come its

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.700
high priest.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:52.260
"Heaven knows," he wrote,
"that John the Baptist was not

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:56.130
"more eager to get all his
fellow sinners into the Jordan

00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.060
"than I to baptize all
of mine in the beauty

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:03.030
"of God's mountains."

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:06.730
The man who seemed to talk
to flowers and rocks was

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:10.360
considered by many people
as an eccentric, one more

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.430
of Yosemite's curiosities.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.460
On one excursion into the
mountains, he met a total

00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:20.330
stranger and told him he
was rambling across

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:23.360
the Sierra Nevada
looking at trees.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.630
"Oh, then,"
the stranger replied,

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:29.460
"you must be John Muir."

00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.930
Josiah Whitney,
California's state geologist,

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.360
grew indignant when
he heard that Muir was

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.260
disputing his theory that
Yosemite had been created by

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.500
a cataclysmic collapse
of the valley floor.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.960
Muir instead believed that
over thousands of years

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.360
glaciers had gouged out the
valley and polished smooth

00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:53.700
the granite domes.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.100
Whitney derided Muir as
"a mere sheep herder"

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.800
and "an ignoramus" and
scornfully dismissed

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.000
his conclusions,

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.900
but Muir persevered and in
1871 discovered a living

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:11.830
glacier in the recesses of the
Sierra, the first of 65 he

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:16.930
would eventually encounter and
study, and when he led other

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:20.800
geologists to his evidence,
they came to see that he was

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.300
right and Whitney was wrong.

00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:30.630
Meanwhile, James Mason
Hutchings has persuaded his

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:34.030
friends in the California
Legislature to pass a special

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:37.930
bill exempting him from the
law that had set the valley

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:43.360
aside as public property,
and twice, the U.S. House of

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.260
Representatives was
willing to go along.

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:52.500
Both times, however, the Senate
held firm against him.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:56.060
Hutchings sued, arguing all
the way to the U.S. Supreme

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:59.760
Court that the federal
government had no right to

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:03.760
dispose of public lands
for any purpose other than

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:06.360
private settlement.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.330
Ruling against him, the High
Court established a precedent

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:16.230
that the act creating Yosemite
was in fact Constitutional.

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:19.860
In 1875, Hutchings
was evicted from his

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.300
hotel and banished
from the valley he had

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.460
so tirelessly promoted.

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.630
DUNCAN: James Mason Hutchings
did 3 very important things

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.600
for the national park idea.

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.960
First of all, he brought
Yosemite and its wonders to

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.460
the attention of the world.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.930
Secondly, inadvertently,
by challenging the law that

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:44.300
set it aside and tried to kick
him out--by challenging that

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.060
all the way to the Supreme
Court, luckily, the Supreme

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.230
Court ruled that, in fact,
it was Constitutional to do.

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:52.800
So that was a very important
precedent that if it had gone

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.030
the other way who knows
what would have happened

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:56.530
with national parks.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:00.130
The third and probably most
important thing is he hired

00:52:00.130 --> 00:52:04.830
John Muir and helped introduce
him to the Yosemite Valley.

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.430
COYOTE: With the completion of
the Transcontinental Railroad,

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.330
even more tourists were
arriving in the par:

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:19.960
writers, artists, scientists,
and wealthy Easterners who

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.000
enjoyed listening to Muir
as he led them from one

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.600
spectacular viewpoint
to another.

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.100
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
How little note is taken

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.860
at the deeds of nature.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:45.730
What paper
publishes her reports?

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:51.630
Who publishes the sheet music
of the winds or the music

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:57.830
of water written
in river lines?

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:03.700
Who reports the works and ways
of the clouds, those wondrous

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:07.030
creations coming into being
every day like freshly

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:09.100
upheaved mountains?

00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:20.460
COYOTE: But soon, John Muir
would leave Yosemite, too.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.830
He packed his meager
belongings and moved to

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:27.560
Oakland, where he hoped to
spread his gospel of nature by

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:31.000
writing a series of reports
for the "Overland Monthly"

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.960
and other popular magazines.

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.260
"Writing," he said, "was
like the life of a glacier,

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:44.330
"one eternal grind," but over
the next several years,

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:46.900
that writing would help
articulate for millions

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:55.360
of Americans a deep and
abiding love for their land.

MAN: Sacred means different
things to different people,

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:11.460
and to the American Indians,
sacredness means you can go in

there walk as
your ancestors did,

you can go in there and you
can see what the creator has

made for us, and you can feel
it, you can feel the spirits,

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.900
but we can take it
one step farther.

00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.530
Because the environment is
still there as in the time

that it is still alive.

[Rumbling]

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.960
DUNCAN: In the early 1800s,
reports started filtering out

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.700
about this magical place.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:36.530
John Colter, who had been a
member of the Lewis and Clark

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:40.160
expedition had left them
instead of returning to

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:45.300
civilization, became the first
legendary mountain man, and he

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.160
came back with a tale of a
place where mud was boiling,

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:53.700
where steam was coming out
of the ground, water spouted,

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.460
and people sort
of made fun of it.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:01.060
They called it Colter's Hell.

00:56:01.060 --> 00:56:03.960
Joe Meek, the mountain man,
stumbled upon it and said it

00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.730
reminded him of the place that
the preachers had warned him

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:11.460
about back when he
went to church.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:15.000
COYOTE: Jim Bridger, another
mountain man, had also told

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.900
tales of the place, the
long-time home of the

00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:22.260
Sheepeater Band of Shoshone
Indians and a meeting place

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.100
for half a dozen other tribes.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.930
It included a lake,
he claimed, where a man could

00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:32.530
catch a fish in one spot and
then swing his line over a few

00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:40.260
feet to instantly cook his
catch in a hot spring.

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:43.530
"There was a canyon so deep,"
he added, "that a man could

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:47.360
"shout down into it at night
and be awakened by his echo

"the next morning."

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.430
As late at 1869, a group of
prospectors had ventured into

00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:06.100
the area they called the
Valley of Death, but when they

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:09.260
finally wrote a detailed
account of their journey,

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:13.230
magazines in the East
refused to publish it.

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:16.260
"Thank you," one editor
responded, "but we do not

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:20.300

Then in the late summer of
1870, a much more prestigious

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:29.500
group intended to put an end
to the mystery and either

00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:34.400
confirm or deny the
rumors once and for all.

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:38.230
Accompanied by a small
military escort, they included

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:42.500
a prominent banker, a son of a
United States Senator,

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.300
a part-time newspaper
correspondent,

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.900
and Truman C. Everts, at age

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.630
54 the oldest member
of the expedition,

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:56.800
a Vermonter who had
come along on a lark.

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.430
The moving force behind
the expedition was

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:02.360
Nathaniel P. Langford,
a well-connected

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.130
Montana politician who

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:08.160
believed the future prosperity
of the territory rested

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.500
with completion of a proposed
second transcontinental

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:16.300
railway, The Northern Pacific.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.560
Earlier in the year, Langford
had met privately with

00:58:19.560 --> 00:58:24.330
Jay Cooke, the financier
underwriting $100 million

00:58:24.330 --> 00:58:27.030
worth of Northern Pacific bonds.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:30.200
The two had agreed that any
publicity about the region's

00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:33.560
attractions would be good
for the territory, good

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.530
for The Northern Pacific's
bond sales, and good

00:58:37.530 --> 00:58:39.930
for Nathaniel Langford.

COYOTE: Two weeks into his
expedition's journey, Langford

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.960
came across the kind of
scenery the mountain men

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.500
had described.

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.700
MAN AS NATHANIEL LANGFORD:
We came suddenly upon a basin

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:13.530
of boiling sulfur springs,
boiling like a cauldron,

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.430
throwing water and fearful
volumes of vapor higher

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:19.230
than our heads.

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:22.830
The spring lying to the east
of this, more diabolical

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:25.900
in appearance and
filled with a hot,

00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:30.100
brownish substance of the
consistency of mucilage,

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:34.460
is in constant, noisy
ebullition, emitting fumes

00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:37.830
of a villainous odor.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:41.160
COYOTE: They kept moving
past more mud pots that made

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.960
noises, they said, "like the
safety valve of a laboring

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:49.230
"steamboat engine," over ground
that sounded hollow under

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:53.060
their horses' hooves,
near vents that were too hot

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:57.230
too touch even with gloved
hands, places to which they

00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:01.260
would attach names like
Hell Broth Springs,

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:06.100
Hell Roaring River,
Devil's Den, Brimstone Basin.

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.060
Farther on, they came to two
waterfalls slicing through

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.830
a steep and narrow canyon
they estimated at half a mile

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:23.060
in depth, the one Jim Bridger
had once bragged about,

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.860
the Grand Canyon
of the Yellowstone.

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:43.900
Langford was now convinced
that the Yellowstone could be

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.830
an even greater attraction
than he and the backers

01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:53.000
of The Northern Pacific
had dreamed.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.730
During their exploration,
the nearsighted Truman Everts

01:00:56.730 --> 01:01:01.800
somehow got separated from the
main group and went missing.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.600
Over the next several days,
search parties were

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:08.330
dispatched to find him.

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:11.530
They encountered grizzly bears,
heard the howls

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:20.160
of wolves, but found no trace
of Everts or his horse.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.800
On September 13, a surprise
storm dropped two feet

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.530
of snow on them.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:30.460
Running low on supplies,
the expedition had no choice

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.500
but to turn for home, leaving
notes behind for Everts

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:37.730
at each campsite along with
what little food they could

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:43.030
spare from their own
dwindling rations.

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:45.730
Heading for the Madison River
and the mining town

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:49.630
of Virginia City, they
struggled for days through

01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:53.100
snow and dense timber
until they came upon

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.400
a large clearing.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.000
MAN AS NATHANIEL LANGFORD:
We had already seen what we

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.600
believed to be the greatest
wonders on the continent.

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.700
Judge then of our astonishment
on entering this basin to see

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.660
at no great distance before us
an immense body of sparkling

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:15.800
water projected suddenly and
with terrific force into

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:22.200
the air to the height
of over 100 feet.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.000
General Washburn has named
it Old Faithful because

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.600
of the regularity of its
eruptions, the intervals

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:36.030
between which being
from 60 to 65 minutes.

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.400

the other geysers, too--

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.130
The Castle, The Bee Hive, and
The Giant--but because of their

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:47.800
shortage of food could not
stay long amidst the wonders

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.230
surrounding them.

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.800
Yet as they followed the
steaming Firehole River,

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.530
they came across still
more basins and still more

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:07.260
curiosities, the greatest
concentration of geothermal

01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:12.630
features on Earth, a vast
array of geysers, fumaroles,

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:15.100
mud pots, and hot springs

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.960
of unimaginable strangeness
and beauty.

01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.700
When the expedition finally
reached Virginia City and then

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:38.460
Helena, the big news was
Langford's confirmation

01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:42.160
of what had been considered
wild rumors about a place once

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:49.830
called Colter's Hell, but the
even bigger news was that

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.460
Truman Everts was
still lost there.

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.830
MAN AS TRUMAN EVERTS:
On the day that I found myself

01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:01.760
separated from my company,
our course had been impeded by

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.100
the dense growth
of the pine forest.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.960
As separations like this had
frequently occurred, it gave

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.460
me no alarm, and I rode on in
the direction which I supposed

01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:17.460
had been taken until
darkness overtook me.

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.300
I selected a spot for
comfortable repose,

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:28.960
picketed my horse, built a fire,
and went to sleep.

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:31.530
COYOTE: At first, Everts
thought his separation from

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:37.200
the expedition would be a
momentary inconvenience,

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.660
but on the second day,
his horse ran away, taking

01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:45.700
with it his guns, blankets,
fishing tackle, and matches,

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:49.960
everything but the clothes on
his back, a small opera glass,

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:54.000
and two knives, which the
hapless Everts promptly managed

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.100
to lose in the underbrush.

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.030
MAN AS TRUMAN EVERTS:
I realized I was lost.

01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:07.930
Then came a crushing sense of
destitution--no food, no fire,

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:13.300
no means to procure either,
alone in an unexplored

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:18.830
wilderness 150 miles from
the nearest human abode,

01:05:18.830 --> 01:05:24.460
surrounded by wild beasts,
and famishing with hunger.

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:26.500
WHITTLESEY: He didn't
have any matches.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:30.630
All he had was an opera glass,
and it took him quite a while

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:36.800
to figure out he could make
a fire with the opera glass.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.000
DUNCAN: Then he finally
figured out that

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.360
"if it's no sunny,
I can't start a fire."

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.660
So he learned that he had to
keep a stick burning, so you

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:48.130
can imagine him stumbling
around midday with a burning

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.800
stick, emaciated.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.930
I mean, this was not John Muir

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:54.860
in ecstasy becoming
one with nature.

01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:59.460
This was a horrific ordeal for
a poor guy who just got lost

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:01.400
at the wrong time.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.930
COYOTE: He wandered for days,
vainly searching for his

01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:11.100
friends or any sign
of their trail.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.760
He spent a night in a tree
cowering from a mountain lion

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:21.430
prowling underneath, suffered
frostbite on his feet from

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:24.930
the snowstorm that blanketed
the region and saturated his

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:30.460
clothes, found refuge for a
week huddling day and night

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:36.300
against the warm ground of
one of the thermal features.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.460
MAN AS TRUMAN EVERTS:
I was enveloped

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:40.030
in a perpetual steam bath.

01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:43.560
At first, this was barely
preferable to the storm,

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.000
but I soon became
accustomed to it,

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.700
and before I left, though
thoroughly parboiled,

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.860
actually enjoyed it.

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:55.700
COYOTE: At another hot spring,
Everts broke through the thin

01:06:55.700 --> 01:07:02.000
crust of earth, and his hip
was severely scalded by steam.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.160
One evening in his sleep,
he lurched forward into his

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.700
fire and burned his hands.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.360
Wasting away from exhaustion
and hunger, Everts began

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.530
seeing apparitions
and hearing voices.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:28.160
"I will not perish in this
wilderness," he told himself

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.630
and forced himself onward,
retracing the route that had

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:34.030
originally brought the
expedition into

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:36.430
the Yellowstone Plateau.

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.630
On October 16, 37 days after
being separated from the

01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:50.230
expedition, Everts was found
crawling along a hillside.

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:53.730
His starvation diet of thistle
roots had reduced him to

01:07:53.730 --> 01:07:55.960
a mere 50 pounds.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.360
The scalded flesh on his
thighs was blackened.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.230
His bare and frostbitten feet
had been worn to the bone.

01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:07.400
His burnt fingers were said to
resemble birds' claws.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:14.400
He was incoherent for days,
though he slowly recovered

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.330
and in time produced a widely
read account of his ordeal

01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.230
that "Scribner's Monthly"

01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:23.460
published for
popular consumption.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:27.260
MAN AS TRUMAN EVERTS:
My narrative is finished.

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:29.500
The time is not far
distant when the wonders

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.830
of the Yellowstone will be
made accessible to all lovers

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:38.760
of sublimity and novelty in
natural scenery, and when

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.460
that day arrives, I hope in
happier mood and under more

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.900
auspicious circumstances to
revisit scenes fraught for me

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.300
with such mingled
glories and terrors.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.200
Truman Everts.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.100
[Wolf howls]

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:00.730
BAKER: Every time I hear about
the white people coming into

01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:04.430
our national parks and
discovering something,

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.860
I can almost see them standing
there on top of this mountain,

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.430
3 or 4 of them saying,
"From now on, we'll call those

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:11.460
"mountains so and so because
we're the first ones here."

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.430
In the meantime, I can see my
relatives hiding behind

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:15.460
the rocks, looking at them,
saying, "Wow. What are these

01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.260
"guys doing up here?"

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.300
For us, it was almost
kind of humorous

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.330
because we've been there for
thousands upon thousands

01:09:24.330 --> 01:09:27.100
of years, and it didn't
need to be discovered.

01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.430
It was never lost.

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.200
All they had to do was ask us.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.500
All they had to do was get
together with the tribes,

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.830
"OK. What's there?"

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:35.960
And we could have told them.

01:09:39.530 --> 01:09:43.060
COYOTE: In the summer of 1871,
the United States government

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:46.460
decided it was time for
professionals to take a look

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.430
at the place where
Truman Everts had gotten

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:52.460
so helplessly lost.

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.600
Ferdinand Hayden, who had
been exploring other parts

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.630
of the West, now led an
expedition of topographers,

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:03.300
botanists, zoologists,
and mineralogists to

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:09.930
Yellowstone to determine once
and for all its real value,

01:10:09.930 --> 01:10:13.600
but perhaps even more
important than the scientists

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.360
was the presence of two other
men, a young artist named

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:22.360
Thomas Moran, who had
never ridden a horse before

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:26.900
and required a pillow on his
saddle, and William Henry

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.360
Jackson, a photographer from
Omaha who most recently had

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:37.300
chronicled the building of the
Transcontinental Railroad.

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:42.030
For the first time, Americans
could see what mere words had

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.100
previously described.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.300
As Ferdinand Hayden prepared
the report that Congress was

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:20.830
expecting, he received an
intriguing letter from a man

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:24.530
named A.B. Nettleton, a
shrewd lobbyist working

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:29.000
for The Northern Pacific,
suggesting that Hayden do more

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.960
than merely catalog
his discoveries.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.730
MAN AS A.B. NETTLETON: Dear,
Dr. Hayden, let Congress pass

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:39.800
a bill reserving the great
geyser basin as a public park

01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:44.360
forever just as it has
reserved the Yosemite Valley

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.930
and Big Trees.

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:49.900
If you approve this, would
such a recommendation be

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:54.100
appropriate in your
official report?

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:57.230
COYOTE: Hayden was
happy to oblige.

01:11:57.230 --> 01:12:00.130
His report took pains to
assure Congress that

01:12:00.130 --> 01:12:04.600
at an elevation of 6,000 feet
above sea level or higher the

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.230
Yellowstone region was totally
unsuitable for farming

01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:13.030
and ranching and that because
of its volcanic origins no

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:16.800
valuable mines were likely
to be found there, but,

01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:20.430
he warned, if congress did
not protect Yellowstone from

01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:24.960
private development, it would
become another Niagara Falls,

01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:28.460
another national
embarrassment.

01:12:28.460 --> 01:12:30.500
RUNTE: Well, if there had been
gold next to the geysers

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.300
in Yellowstone, there would
not be geysers in Yellowstone,

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:37.000
and if there had been a big
gold strike in the Yosemite

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.400
Valley, Yosemite Valley would
have been a mining pit,

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.900
and the reason for that
is that it was still very,

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:46.860
very difficult for the
American people to relent from

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:50.260
their commercial pursuits.

01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:53.160
COYOTE: With The Northern
Pacific quietly maneuvering

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.960
behind the scenes and with
Moran's sketches and Jackson's

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.630
photographs prominently
displayed in the halls

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:04.160
of the Capitol, a bill began
moving through congress,

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:08.460
and by late January of 1872,
it was ready for action

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:11.030
in the Senate.

01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:14.360
MAN: Be it enacted that the
tract of land lying near

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.600
the headwaters of the
Yellowstone River...

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.100
COYOTE: The senate
overwhelmingly

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.930
approved the bill.

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:29.060
The house passed it 115-65,
and on March 1, 1872,

01:13:29.060 --> 01:13:32.930
President Ulysses S. Grant
signed the bill creating

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.600
Yellowstone Park.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.130
Unlike Yosemite, which was
being administered by

01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:49.660
the state of California,
this would be a national park,

01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:56.500
the first national park in
the history of the world.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:00.060
You wish that they had,
you know, gone out and rang

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:05.460
bells to say, "This is
something new on Earth,"

01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.100
because it was.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.100
A federal government was
saying, "We're setting this

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.360
aside as a national park."

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:14.060
No government had ever done
that before, and you'd like

01:14:14.060 --> 01:14:18.460
them to make note of it in
that way just the way with the

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.730
Declaration of Independence

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:22.060
they read it
and bells were rung.

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:23.930
That didn't happen with this.

01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:27.130
It looks like they took it
maybe a little more seriously

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.800
than the decision of
whether or not to repaint

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.630
the cloak room.

01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:34.600
It wasn't that big
a deal to most of them.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.930
It was just business
as usual that day.

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:42.700
It's only hindsight
that allows us to see

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.530
what they started.

01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:46.600
You know, they were kicking
the rock off the cliff,

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.060
and most of them turned
and walked away.

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:52.100
There's no evidence that any
of them thought this was

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:55.560
the first of a type or that
"we're going to turn this into

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.930
"a hugely important
world institution."

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:03.130
COYOTE: The "New York Herald"
saw the new creation as one

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:06.360
more reason for
national bragging rights.

01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.060
"Why should we go to
Switzerland to see mountains

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:13.400
"or to Iceland for geysers?"
it asked, adding that

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:17.200
"with Yosemite and Yellowstone,
now we have attractions which

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.630
"diminish Niagara into
an ordinary exhibition."

01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:25.760
But the "Helena Rocky Mountain
Gazette" complained that

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.200
a great blow had been struck
against the prosperity

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.860
of the region.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:33.530
"The new park," it said,
"will keep the country

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:38.860
"a wilderness and prevent
economic development."

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.660
Its cross-town rival the
"Helena Herald" disagreed.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.130
"It will be a park,"
the paper said,

01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:49.330
"worthy of the great republic."

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.330
DUNCAN: I think that
if Wyoming had been

01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:55.960
a state in 1872,
they probably would have

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.800
followed the Yosemite model.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.300
They would have just given
it to the state of Wyoming

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:05.200
for safekeeping, but because
it was a territory, there was

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:09.030
no state to give it to, and so
therefore, almost by accident,

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:14.430
it became a national park,
and that doesn't seem like

01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:18.000
a big thing at first, but when
you think about it, it really

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:21.460
was an incredible
turning point.

01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.700
What would we think of
Yellowstone if it was

01:16:23.700 --> 01:16:26.560
Yellowstone State
Park in Wyoming?

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.900
It would still be--the
geysers would be going off,

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.530
the waterfall would still be
there, the mud would still be

01:16:31.530 --> 01:16:35.660
boiling, we'd be attracted to
go see it, but we wouldn't

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.500
feel the sense of
responsibility to it as

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.900
a citizen of our nation,
only if we were a citizen

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:45.000
of the state of Wyoming.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.960
By making it a national park,
implicitly it becomes

01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:53.830
ours, everybody's.

01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:56.200
We're all somehow
responsible for it,

01:16:56.200 --> 01:17:01.160
and we all can take pride in
it, and so by this accident

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.500
more or less, this precedent
was set that it's gonna be

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:12.330
a national park that we as a
nation have to take care of.

01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:15.030
COYOTE: By any standard,
the new national park

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:19.430
at Yellowstone was huge,
more than 2 million acres

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:23.000
of remote mountainous terrain
covering the northwestern

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.430
corner of Wyoming Territory

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:29.060
and spilling into Montana
and Idaho, bigger than

01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:32.860
the states of Delaware
and Rhode Island combined,

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:36.530
more than 50 times
larger than the Yosemite Grant

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:41.530
in California,
but having created the world's

01:17:41.530 --> 01:17:45.700
first national park,
Congress had seen no reason to

01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:49.960
appropriate any money to
manage it or protect it from

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:53.100
the people who
were sure to come.

01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:01.800
WOMAN: Our first site of
geysers made us simply wild

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.530
with the eagerness of
seeing all things at once.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:08.000
We ran and shouted
and called to each other

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.500
to see this or that.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:14.400
We had at last
reached Wonderland.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.960
Emma Cowan.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.000
COYOTE: In August of 1877,
a group of 9 tourists from

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.700
Montana had entered the park
bent on taking in the sights.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:30.260
Among them were Emma Cowan,
24 years old, and her husband

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.900
George, planning to celebrate
their second wedding

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.860
anniversary in Yellowstone.

01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.800
WOMAN AS EMMA COWAN: We seemed
to be in a world of our own.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.030
Not a soul had we seen
save our own party.

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:48.060
One can scarcely realize the
intense solitude which then

01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:52.630
pervaded this land fresh
from the Maker's hand.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.700
COYOTE: On the morning of
their anniversary, the Cowans

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:03.800
stepped outside their tent
and found themselves not only

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.030
in the middle of the world's
first national park

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:09.460
but in the middle of
an Indian war.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:17.160
WOMAN AS EMMA COWAN:
A pistol shot rang out.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:19.630
My husband's head fell back.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:26.530
A red stream trickled down
his face from beneath his hat.

01:19:26.530 --> 01:19:30.160
COYOTE: Chief Joseph and
hundreds of his Nez Perce Tribe

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.730
were streaming through
the park, pursued by

01:19:32.730 --> 01:19:35.860
the U.S. Army because they had
refused to move onto

01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:41.330
a reservation in Idaho.

01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:45.330
Only two weeks earlier, nearly
90 of them had been killed,

01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:48.530
more than half women and
children, when their sleeping

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:54.330
village had been attacked in
The Battle of the Big Hole.

01:19:54.330 --> 01:19:56.730
Some of the young warriors
were still incensed

01:19:56.730 --> 01:20:00.230
about the casualties they had
suffered and ignored Joseph's

01:20:00.230 --> 01:20:04.530
instructions not to harm
any white civilians.

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:08.130
[Hoofbeats]

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.560
As the Nez Perce continued
their flight through

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.160
Yellowstone, there were
other incidents

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:15.560
with unlucky tourists.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.000
Several were wounded,
and two were killed.

01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.100
Moving through a few days
behind the Indians, the army

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.630
picked up the survivors.

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:34.700
Among them was George Cowan,
somehow still alive.

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.630
Army surgeons probed his head
by candlelight and removed

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:42.130
the bullet, flattened
by his skull.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.700
By the time he was reunited
with his wife, the Nez Perce War

01:20:48.700 --> 01:20:52.500
was ending hundreds of
miles away with Chief Joseph's

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:55.960
surrender in northern Montana.

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.100
Yellowstone's superintendent
soon arranged for the native

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:02.660
Sheepeaters, who had not taken
part in the troubles, to be

01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:06.360
evicted from their homeland
so he could assure the public

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:13.500
that Yellowstone National Park
was now free of all Indians.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:17.260
Years later when the Cowans
returned to visit the park,

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.530
Emma would say she was
surprised any of her group had

01:21:20.530 --> 01:21:23.460
been spared given
the horrible treatment

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.100
the Indians had suffered.

01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:29.260
George meanwhile happily
recounted their tale of their

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:33.130
second anniversary and then
capped his story by showing

01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:37.860
off his proudest Yellowstone
souvenir, the bullet that had

01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.260
been removed from his skull,
which he had made into

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:44.260
a watch fob.

MAN: I had a vision of the
future of this great country.

01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:01.860
The iron horse had jumped the
Missouri and was rushing up

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:05.360
the bountiful valley of the
Yellowstone, carrying with it

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:09.630
all its civilization and change.

01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:13.060
Instead of the teepees of
the wild red men, there were

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:16.900
thousands of beautiful homes.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:20.260
In the bottomlands waved
the rich grain,

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:23.060
giving bread to millions.

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.200
The hillsides were covered
with stock, supplying

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:33.430
the world its meat, and still
thundered on the iron horse up

01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:39.430
over the Rocky Mountains,
and I thanked God that right

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:44.700
in the heart of all this noise
and restless life of millions

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:48.360
a wise government had forever
set apart that marvelous

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:52.360
region as a national park.

Colgate Hoyt.

01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:59.600
SCHULLERY: As early as 1871,
they began to call Yellowstone

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:03.860
Wonderland because "Alice
in Wonderland," the book,

01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:06.730
had just appeared
a few years earlier,

01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:08.200
and The Northern Pacific
Railroad took that

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.830
right up and began to produce

01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:13.930
pamphlets, brochures,
and guidebooks all

01:23:13.930 --> 01:23:18.860
with the title "Wonderland."

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:23.000
COYOTE: In 1883, The Northern
Pacific Railroad was finally

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.030
completed across
the continent.

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:29.930
Now tourists from the East,
well-to-do refugees from the

01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:33.360
increasingly industrialized
and crowded cities

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:38.030
of the Gilded Age, could reach
the entrance to Yellowstone

01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:43.500
National Park in relative
comfort and speed.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:48.900
That first year,
attendance increased 5-fold.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:52.930
Everything, the hotel,
the food, the tents,

01:23:52.930 --> 01:23:57.330
the stages, the guides,
was now under the exclusive

01:23:57.330 --> 01:24:01.330
control of the Yellowstone
Park Improvement Company,

01:24:01.330 --> 01:24:04.460
a politically well-connected
firm with close ties to

01:24:04.460 --> 01:24:08.430
The Northern Pacific.

01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:12.130
They had quietly arranged for
the secretary of the interior

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:15.030
to grant the company
a remarkable monopoly

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:17.700
within the park.

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:21.160
For a fee of only $2.00 an
acre, the lease allowed the

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:26.830
company to cut as much timber
as it needed, kill elk, deer,

01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:31.860
and bison in the park to feed
their work crews and guests,

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:35.330
plant crops and graze horses
and cattle wherever they

01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:41.000
wished, even mine coal for
their furnaces and rechannel

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.630
some of the hot springs
to heat the buildings.

01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:48.730
As if that weren't enough,
the contract granted the

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:53.700
company the right to choose
parcels of 640 acres,

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:57.200
one square mile,
at 7 different locations

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.900
within the park.

01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:03.200
The prime attractions of
Yellowstone were about to be

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.000
completely surrounded
and exploited.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.660
MAN: The project of the worthy
speculators, who are after

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:14.560
the people's pleasure ground,
appears to be flourishing.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:17.700
Here and there are feeble
voices raised in protest against

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:22.500
the steal, but with a powerful
lobby to back them and no

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:26.330
opposition from the interior
department, the grabbers have

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:30.960
little to fear.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:35.330
The park is at
present all our own.

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.830
How would the readers like
to see it become a second

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:43.160
Niagara, a place where one
goes only to be fleeced,

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:45.900
where patent medicine
advertisements stare one

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:49.060
in the face, and the beauties
of nature have all been

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:52.400
defiled by the greed of man?

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.860
George Bird Grinnell.

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:58.530
COYOTE: George Bird Grinnell
of New York City had been

01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:03.130
educated at Yale in
ornithology and paleontology

01:26:03.130 --> 01:26:06.560
and had made several trips to
the West to collect specimens

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:13.530
as a young man, including an
1875 excursion to Yellowstone,

01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:16.960
which had instilled in him
a deep love of the new park

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.560
and a fierce desire to
protect it and its wildlife.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.430
Having sold his father's
investment business, Grinnell

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.860
had taken control of
"Forest and Stream,"

01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:35.230
a sportsman's magazine he now
used to champion his causes.

01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:39.630
Yellowstone was one of them,
and he began a crusade to stop

01:26:39.630 --> 01:26:42.660
what he called
"the park grab."

01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:48.460
Grinnell's fight against the
railroad interests was soon

01:26:48.460 --> 01:26:53.130
joined by an unlikely ally,
General Philip Sheridan,

01:26:53.130 --> 01:26:56.530
a cavalry hero of the
Civil War and celebrated Indian

01:26:56.530 --> 01:27:00.730
fighter, who was now commander
of the U.S. Army

01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:03.000
for much of the West.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.930
MAN AS PHILIP SHERIDAN:
I regretted exceedingly to learn

01:27:04.930 --> 01:27:06.900
that the national park
had been rented out to

suggested that Yellowstone

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.060
should be expanded by more

doubled in size
to provide greater

01:27:35.530 --> 01:27:39.030
protection for the elk and

seasonal migrations.

01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:47.000
It was a radical idea
immediately opposed by Western

that Yellowstone was

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.130
already too big.

In Washington, Grinnell
took on the railroad lobby

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:01.400
directly, calling for an
investigation into the park

expansion of Yellowstone,

had tried his best to confine

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:45.930
himself to his writing desk in
Oakland, California, turning

01:31:45.930 --> 01:31:49.230
out article after article
for the "Overland Monthly,"

01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:53.060
"Scribner's," and "Harper's"
magazine about the majesty

01:31:53.060 --> 01:31:55.800
of Yosemite
and the Sierra Nevada,

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.260
about the necessity
to preserve forests from

01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:01.560
destruction, and about the joy

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:06.160
to be found in quietly
observing the world, all part

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.460

"like an apostle."

In the process, he had become
famous, but he had soon grown

restless to travel again,
and when the opportunity came

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:28.060
to visit Alaska, a vast
wilderness that had been part

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:31.630
of the United States
for barely a decade,

01:32:31.630 --> 01:32:34.630
he had jumped at the chance.

01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:38.460
At Fort Wrangell, hearing talk
of a remote and unexplored

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:43.530

he had hired 4 Tlingit Indians

01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:46.860
and their big canoe to
make the long 800-mile

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:49.700
journey there.

It was Glacier Bay.

Here, the glaciers marched
right down to the sea and were

can survive on a glacier."

shared around the campfire

He was living, he was
learning, he was living

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.400
with the elements out there,
and John Muir would have been

01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:18.560

of Martinez in
California's Alhambra Valley.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:48.060
Two children quickly followed,
and Muir single-mindedly threw

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:52.230
himself into providing for his
family, taking over management

01:35:52.230 --> 01:35:57.300
of his in-laws' 3,000 acres,
bringing to bear the same

01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:00.260
intensity and mechanical
inventiveness he had

01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:04.100
demonstrated as a young man.

01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:07.530
He improved the farm's
productivity, converting extra

01:36:07.530 --> 01:36:11.630
land from pasture into cash
crops of cherries,

01:36:11.630 --> 01:36:16.130
Tokay grapes, and Bartlett pears
and steadily amassed

01:36:16.130 --> 01:36:19.130
considerable wealth.

01:36:19.130 --> 01:36:23.430
Muir was tender and devoted
to his wife and daughters,

01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:27.030
but his health deteriorated
from the ceaseless dawn to

01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:31.060
dusk farm work and his
isolation from the mountains

01:36:31.060 --> 01:36:34.760
and forests and glaciers
that had always seemed to

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.060
replenish him.

01:36:38.060 --> 01:36:40.660
He lost weight.

01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:44.030
He'd become "nerve-shaken and
lean as a crow," he wrote his

01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:51.230
brother, "loaded with care,
work, and worry."

01:36:51.230 --> 01:36:55.300
The result was that he was
slowly weaning himself away

01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:57.930
from all that had compelled
him in his life up to that

01:36:57.930 --> 01:37:04.500
point, and his--his wife
essentially said,

01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:08.530
"You've got to go out
and engage the wilderness."

persuaded her husband to take

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.730
another outing to
Mount Rainier in the state

01:37:15.730 --> 01:37:19.530
of Washington, where he camped
at what he called "the most

01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:23.630

all the Alpine gardens I ever

"in a crystalline blue lake."

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:38.760
Captivated by the view,
he felt some of his old energy

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:44.430
returning, and when the young
men camping with him set off

01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:49.700
on a grueling 7 1/2-hour climb
up the 14,000-foot peak,

01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:52.930
the 50-year-old Muir
impulsively joined them.

01:37:57.230 --> 01:38:00.960
"Did not mean to climb it,"
Muir wrote his wife later,

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.960
"but got excited and
soon was on top."

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.030
The climb, he said, had left
him "with heart and limb

01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:19.060
"exultant and free."

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:21.460
STETSON: By the time he came
down from that mountain,

01:38:21.460 --> 01:38:25.500
he understood that his real
passion and his energy should

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:29.130
be devoted to preserving such
places, and that's where he

01:38:29.130 --> 01:38:33.060
went from there.

01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:35.960

had written her husband

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:39.460

noble life ought to be flung

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:56.330
away beyond all reach
and power for harm.

01:38:56.330 --> 01:39:00.100
The Alaska book and the
Yosemite book, dear John,

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:04.600
must be written, and you need
to be your own self, well

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:08.360
and strong, to make
them worthy of you.

01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:17.830
COYOTE: In 1889,
Robert Underwood Johnson,

01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:20.160
an editor of
"The Century Magazine,"

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:26.330
arrived from the East and asked
Muir for a tour of Yosemite.

01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:30.630
In the last 8 years, Muir had
managed only one brief visit

01:39:30.630 --> 01:39:33.260
to the place that had
changed his life,

01:39:33.260 --> 01:39:35.000
and he eagerly accepted.

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.760
But as they approached
Yosemite Valley, he began

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:49.200
seeing disturbing signs.

01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:51.700
Tunnels had been carved through
the heart of some of the big

01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:56.460
trees as gaudy tourist
attractions to entice visitors

01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.160
to use one road over another.

01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.930
In the valley itself, he found
piles of tin cans and other

01:40:03.930 --> 01:40:09.100
garbage in plain view, and the
meadows had been converted into

01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:13.830
hay fields and pastures,
even a hog pen "whose stink,"

01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:18.900
Muir wrote, "has got into
the pores of the rocks."

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:22.300
He was dismayed to learn of
plans to throw colored lights

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:25.930
upon the majestic waterfalls
as if that would make them

01:40:25.930 --> 01:40:28.330
more beautiful.

01:40:28.330 --> 01:40:31.730
"Perhaps," he said, "we may
yet hear of an appropriation

01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:35.100
"to whitewash the face
of El Capitan or correct

01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:39.600
"the curves of the domes."

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:45.100
Glacier Point, 3,254 feet
above the valley, had been one

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:49.400
of Muir's favorite spots from
which to contemplate the place

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:53.200
he considered
nature's cathedral.

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:56.100
Now it was a place
where tourists mugged

01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:57.460
for the camera.

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:12.700
An entrepreneur named
James McCauley had built

01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:15.100
the Mountain House Hotel there.

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:18.230
On summer nights, his sons
would collect donations from

01:41:18.230 --> 01:41:23.130
tourists for a firefall in
which McCauley would build

01:41:23.130 --> 01:41:27.960
a huge bonfire and then light
sticks of dynamite to send

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:34.130
the fire cascading over
the sheer cliff.

01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:36.830
The crowds loved it.

01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:38.500
[Cheering]

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:41.560
DUNCAN: Muir came back
into the Yosemite Valley,

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.030
his cathedral, and his
cathedral had been turned

01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:47.830
into a carnival.

01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:52.700
It wasn't what he
envisioned it should be.

01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:55.100
MAN AS JOHN MUIR: Like
anything else worthwhile,

01:41:55.100 --> 01:41:58.130
however well guarded,
they have always been subject

01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:02.230
to attack by despoiling
gain-seekers and mischief-makers

01:42:02.230 --> 01:42:07.660
of every degree from Satan to
senators, eagerly trying to

01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:12.200
make everything immediately
and selfishly commercial.

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:15.330
Thus long ago, a few
enterprising merchants

01:42:15.330 --> 01:42:19.960
utilized the Jerusalem temple
as a place of business instead

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:24.830
of a place of prayer,
and earlier still, the first

01:42:24.830 --> 01:42:28.830
forest reservation,
including only one tree,

01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:33.230
was likewise despoiled.

01:42:33.230 --> 01:42:35.330
COYOTE: Distressed at
everything he saw within

01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:38.700
Yosemite Valley, Muir
fled with his guest

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:43.400
Robert Underwood Johnson
into the high country,

01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.360
but here, too, much had changed.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:49.860
Beyond the boundaries of the
Yosemite Grant and therefore

01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:52.960
unprotected by even the
lackluster vigilance

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.360
of the state, the headwaters
of the streams feeding into

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:59.930
the valley had been left to
the mercy of the lumbermen

01:42:59.930 --> 01:43:01.400
and sheep herders.

01:43:04.130 --> 01:43:08.400
That evening at their camp in
Tuolumne Meadows, Muir spoke

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.830
passionately about
what they had seen.

01:43:12.830 --> 01:43:16.760
"The harm they do goes to the
heart," he said of the sheep,

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.530
and he predicted that if
the destruction continued

01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:23.930
unchecked without the trees
and grasses of the high Sierra

01:43:23.930 --> 01:43:28.100
to trap and hold the winter
snows, the springtime melts

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:32.100
would become swifter and more
destructive, the clear streams

01:43:32.100 --> 01:43:36.230
would become muddy with silt,
and by summertime, the valley

01:43:36.230 --> 01:43:41.230
and the waterfalls that
nourished it would be dry.

01:43:41.230 --> 01:43:44.760
Johnson suggested that the
high country be set aside as

01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:51.160
a national park and urged Muir
to become the public voice

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:55.130
for the campaign by writing
articles again describing not

01:43:55.130 --> 01:43:59.130
only the region's beauty
but its vulnerability.

01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.230
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
The mountains are

01:44:06.230 --> 01:44:10.630
fountains of men,
as well as of rivers,

01:44:10.630 --> 01:44:15.900
of glaciers, of fertile soil.

01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:21.230
The great poets, philosophers,
prophets, able men whose

01:44:21.230 --> 01:44:26.060
thoughts and deeds have moved
the world, have come down from

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:31.830
the mountains, mountain
dwellers who have grown strong

01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:36.330
there with the forest trees
in Nature's workshops.

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:45.300
CRONON: Muir in a way comes
from a literary rhetorical

01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:50.300
tradition that for most modern
Americans has been lost,

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:53.400
that comes from--as with
Abraham Lincoln with whom,

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:56.300
I think, he has a lot in
common--that knowing

01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:59.530
The Bible chapter and verse,
the entire text, knowing

01:44:59.530 --> 01:45:02.800
Shakespeare, these sort of
classic literary roots that

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.400
are as fundamental to the way
so many literate Americans are

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:09.200
educated in the 19th Century,
and Muir has that language,

01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:13.260
this rapturous, religious,
rhetorical set of images that

01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:17.660
he has at his fingertips,
and he maps them onto his

01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:20.930
concrete experiences out
in these natural settings

01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:25.100
in a way that makes
them transcendent.

01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:28.330
COYOTE: Muir threw himself
into what became a pitched

01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:31.300
battle to preserve
the high country.

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.030
Vested interests and opposing
politicians lied about his

01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:39.030
past, questioned his motives,
and publicly impugned

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:40.930
his integrity.

01:45:40.930 --> 01:45:44.800
Muir was hurt but endured it
all, going directly to

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:47.900
the people, who soon
flooded Congress

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.830
with letters and petitions.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:02.530
Finally on October 1, 1890,
President Benjamin Harrison

01:46:02.530 --> 01:46:11.130
signed into law a bill creating
Yosemite National Park,

01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:15.500
setting aside more
than 900,000 acres,

01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:19.500
nearly 1,500 square miles.

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:23.400
Muir was disappointed that
the original Yosemite Grant

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:27.100
encompassing the valley floor
and the Mariposa Grove was

01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:31.830
still left under state control,
but this new park was

01:46:31.830 --> 01:46:38.700
30 times bigger and, to Muir's
delight, included one of his

01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:43.200
favorite places on Earth,
the nearby Hetch Hetchy Valley,

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:47.000
which he considered
"a grand landscape garden,

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:54.960
"one of nature's rarest and most
precious mountain temples."

01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.560
At the same time as the
Yosemite Bill, two more groves

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:03.130
of big trees on the western
flank of the Sierras had also

01:47:03.130 --> 01:47:08.000
been preserved as Sequoia and
General Grant National Parks.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:11.560
"The majestic sequoia is the
king of the conifers,"

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:16.360
Muir had written, "the noblest
of all the noble race."

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:23.900
There were now 4
national parks.

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:27.160
Flushed with the success
of his first venture into

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.500
the world of politics,
Muir immediately began

01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.830
making new plans.

01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:36.400
He wanted more parks,
bigger parks, and more park

01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:40.160
supporters to defend them
against the enemies he knew

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.630
would oppose them.

01:47:43.630 --> 01:47:45.260
He was right.

01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:48.000
In the years to come,
the battle over parks would

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.830
intensify, threatening
even his own precious

01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:55.430
mountain temple.

01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:59.130
John Muir was 52
years old now.

01:47:59.130 --> 01:48:02.060
It had been nearly
a quarter century since,

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.400
as a self-described
"unknown nobody,"

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.800
he had first entered Yosemite
and then been transformed

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:16.200
by his "unconditional
surrender to nature."

01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.930
He would need to convince
many other Americans to

01:48:18.930 --> 01:48:23.600
surrender, as well,
to see the necessity, as he

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:30.800
said, "in all that is wild."

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:36.130
CRONON: What he means is that
wildness is an essential part

01:48:36.130 --> 01:48:41.260
of ourselves that our ordinary
lives tempt us to forget,

01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:45.200
and by losing touch with that
essential part of ourselves,

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.900
we risk losing our souls,
and so for him,

01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:53.860
going out into nature to
these parks is how we recover

01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:58.260
ourselves, remember who we
truly are, and reconnect

01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:02.460
with the core roots of our
own identity, of our own

01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:05.960
spirituality, that which is
sacred in our experience.

01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:10.630
MAN AS JOHN MUIR:
The tendency nowadays to wander

01:49:10.630 --> 01:49:15.500
in wilderness is
delightful to see.

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.200
Thousands of tired,
nerve-shaken,

01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:21.500
overcivilized people
are beginning to find out

01:49:21.500 --> 01:49:23.760
that going to the mountains is

01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:33.760
going home, that wildness is
a necessity, and that mountain

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:38.030
parks and reservations are
useful, not only as fountains

01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:45.900
of timber and irrigating rivers
but as fountains of life.

01:49:45.900 --> 01:49:47.460
John Muir.
