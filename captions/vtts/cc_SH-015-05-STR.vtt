00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.630


2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.700
Go to him, Dolabella; bid himyield.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.130
Being so frustrate,

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.330
tell him he mocks the pausesthat he makes.

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
Caesar, I shall.

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.830
Wherefore is that?

7
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.570
And what art thou that darestappear thus to us?

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.370
I am called Dercetas.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.330
Mark Antony I served,

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.530
who best was worthy, best to beserved.

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.670
Whilst he stood up and spoke, hewas my master.

12
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.130
And I wore my life to spend uponhis haters.

13
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.100
If thou please to take me tothee,

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.770
as I was to him I'll be toCaesar.

15
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.500
If thou pleasest not, I yieldthee up my life.

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.130
What is it thou say'st?

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.500
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

18
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:14.830
The breaking of so great a thingshould make a greater crack.

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.530
The round world should haveshook lions into civil streets

20
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.700
and citizens to their dens.

21
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.270
The death of Antony is not asingle doom.

22
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.130
In the name lay a moiety of theworld.

23
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.730
He is dead, Caesar.

24
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.070
Not by a public minister ofjustice

25
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.770
nor by a hired knife

26
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.470
but that self hand,

27
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.200
which writ his honor in the actsit did,

28
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.100
hath, with the courage which theheart did lend it,

29
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.370
splitted the heart.

30
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.630
This is his sword; I robbed hiswound of it.

31
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.630
Behold it stained with his mostnoble blood.

32
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.270
Look you sad, friends?

33
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.400
The gods rebuke me,

34
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.230
but it is tidings to wash theeyes of kings.

35
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.500
And strange it is that naturemust compel us

36
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.530
to lament our most persisteddeeds.

37
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.530
His taints and honors wagedequal with him.

38
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.530
A rarer spirit never did steerhumanity.

39
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.870
But you, gods, will give us somefaults to make us men.

40
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.200
Caesar is touched.

41
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.230
When such a spacious mirror'sset before him,

42
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.470
he needs must see himself.

43
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.800
O Antony!

44
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.300
I have followed thee to this.

45
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.270
But we do lance diseases in ourbodies.

46
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.900
I must perforce have shown tothee such a declining day

47
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.170
or looked on thine.

48
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:20.170
We could not stall together inthe whole world,

49
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.500
but yet let me lament

50
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.570
with tears as sovereign as theblood of hearts

51
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.770
that thou, my brother,

52
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.030
my competitor in top of alldesign,

53
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.730
my mate in empire,

54
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.200
friend and companion in thefront of war,

55
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.830
the arm of mine own body

56
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.630
and the heart where mine histhoughts did kindle.

57
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.900
That our stars, unreconcilable,

58
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.770
should divide our equalness tothis.

59
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.170
Hear me, good friends.

60
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.600
But I will tell you at somemeeter season.

61
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.830
The business of this man looksout of him.

62
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.700
We'll hear him what he says.

63
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.430
Whence are you?

64
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.570
A poor Egyptian yet.

65
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.070
The queen, my mistress,

66
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.430
confined in all she has, hermonument,

67
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.770
of thy intents desiresinstruction

68
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.570
that she preparedly may frameherself

69
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.400
to the way she's forced to.

70
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.600
Bid her have good heart.

71
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.830
She soon shall know of us, bysome of ours,

72
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.000
wow honorable and how kindly wedetermine for her.

73
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
For Caesar cannot learn to beungentle.

74
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.870
So the gods preserve thee!

75
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.570
Come hither, Proculeius.

76
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:32.130
Go and say, we purpose her noshame.

77
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.830
Give her what comforts

78
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.770
the quality of her passion shallrequire.

79
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:36.900
Lest, in her greatness,

80
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.070
by some mortal stroke she dodefeat us.

81
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.330
For her life in Rome would beeternal in our triumph.

82
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.000
Go, and with your speediestbring us what she saysó

83
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.100
How you find of her.

84
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.670
Caesar, I shall.

85
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.400
Where's Dolabella to secondProculeius?

86
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.530
Dolabella!

87
00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.430
Let him alone, for I remembernow how he's employed.

88
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.630
He shall in time be ready.

89
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.830
Go with me to my tent

90
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.530
where you shall see how hardly Iwas drawn into this war,

91
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:23.370
how calm and gentle I proceededstill in all my writings.

92
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.700
Go with me and see what I canshow in this.

93
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.300
My desolation does begin to makea better life.

94
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.870
'Tis paltry to be Caesar.

95
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:43.830
Not being Fortune, he's butFortune's knave,

96
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.400
a minister of her will.

97
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.630
And it is great to do that thingthat ends all other deeds

98
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:57.800
which shackles accidents andbolts up change,

99
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.800
which sleeps and never palatesmore the dug.

100
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.970
The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.

101
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.270
Caesar sends greeting to theQueen of Egypt

102
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.800
and bids thee study on what fairdemands

103
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.570
thou means to have him grantthee.

104
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.000
What's thy name?

105
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.170
My name is Proculeius.

106
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.100
Antony did tell me of you;

107
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.570
bade me trust you.

108
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.730
But I do not greatly care to bedeceived

109
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.730
that have no use for trusting.

110
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.130
If your master would have aqueen his beggar,

111
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.900
you must tell him

112
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.770
that majesty, to keep decorum,must no less beg than a kingdom.

113
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.970
If he please to give meconquered Egypt for my son,

114
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:57.530
he gives me so much of mine own

115
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.830
as I will kneel to him withthanks.

116
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.000
Be of good cheer.

117
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.170
You're fallen into a princelyhand.

118
00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.470
Fear nothing.

119
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.870
Make your full reference freelyto my lord,

120
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:13.900
who is so full of grace that itflows over on all that need.

121
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.400
Let me report to him your sweetdependency,

122
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.170
and you shall find a conqueror

123
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.230
that will pray in aid forkindness,

124
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.800
where he for grace is kneeledto.

125
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.370
Pray you, tell him I am hisfortune's vassal,

126
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:36.270
and I send him the greatness hehas got.

127
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:41.430
I hourly learn a doctrine ofobedience

128
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:46.300
and would gladly look him im theface.

129
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.530
This I'll report, dear lady.

130
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.930
Have comfort,

131
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.870
for I know your plight is pitiedof him that caused it.

132
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.870
O Cleopatra!

133
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:55.870
Thou art taken, queen!

134
00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:56.970
Quick, quick, good hands.

135
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.170
Hold, worthy lady, hold.

136
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.430
Do not yourself such wrong,

137
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.970
who are in this relieved but notbetrayed.

138
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.130
What of death, too, that ridsour dogs of languish?

139
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.600
Cleopatra!

140
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.070
Do not abuse my master's bountyby the undoing of yourself.

141
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.870
Let the world see his noblenesswell acted,

142
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.270
which your death will never letcome forth.

143
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.770
Where art thou, death?

144
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.600
Come hither, come!

145
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:24.170
Come, come, and take a queenworth many babes and beggars!

146
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.630
O, temperance, lady!

147
00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.270
Sir, I will eat no meat.

148
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:30.230
I'll not drink, sir.

149
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.870
If idle talk will once benecessary,

150
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:34.330
I'll not sleep neither.

151
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.670
This mortal house I'll ruin!

152
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:38.830
Do Caesar what he can.

153
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.270
Know, sir,

154
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.870
that I will not wait pinioned atyour master's court

155
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.870
nor once be chastised with thesober eye of dull Octavia.

156
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.400
Shall they hoist me up

157
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.470
and show me to the shoutingvarletry of censuring Rome?

158
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.470
Rather a ditch in Egypt begentle grave unto me!

159
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.430
Rather on Nilus' mud lay mestark naked

160
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.230
and let the water flies blow meinto abhorring!

161
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.930
Rather make my country's highpyramides my gibbet

162
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.500
and hang me up in chains!

163
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.470
You do extend these thoughts ofhorror

164
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.330
further than you shall findcause in Caesar.

165
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:21.470
Proculeius,

166
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.970
what thou hast done thy masterCaesar knows,

167
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:26.770
and he hath sent for thee.

168
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:29.570
For the queen, I'll take her tomy guard.

169
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.770
So, Dolabella.

170
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.170
It shall content me best; begentle to her.

171
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.130
To Caesar I will speak what youshall please,

172
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.570
if you'll employ me to him.

173
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.570
Say, I would die.

174
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.870
Most noble empress, you haveheard of me?

175
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:57.230
I cannot tell.

176
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.130
Assuredly you know me.

177
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.900
No matter, sir, what I haveheard or known,

178
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.530
you laugh when boys or womentell their dreams.

179
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.070
Is it not your trick?

180
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:20.000
I understand not, madam.

181
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.330
I dreamt there was an EmperorAntony.

182
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.630
O, such another sleep,

183
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.400
that I might see but suchanother man!

184
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.170
If it might please yeó

185
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:35.930
His face was as the heavens

186
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.070
and therein stuck a sun andmoon,

187
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.400
which kept their course

188
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.800
and lighted the little O of theearth.

189
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.300
Most sovereign creatureó

190
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.600
His legs bestrid the ocean.

191
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.030
His reared arm crested theworld.

192
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.330
His voice was propertied as allthe tuned spheres,

193
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.500
and that to friends.

194
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.970
But when he meant to quail andshake the orb,

195
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.800
he was as rattling thunder.

196
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.170
For his bounty, there was nowinter in it.

197
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:13.700
An autumn 'twas that grew themore by reaping.

198
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.200
His delights were dolphin-like.

199
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.830
They showed his back above theelement they lived in.

200
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.930
In his livery walked crowns andcrownets.

201
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:31.570
Realms and islands were asplates dropped from his pocket.

202
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.830
Cleopatra!

203
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:40.830
Think you there was or might besuch a man

204
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.070
as this I dreamt of?

205
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.400
Gentle madam, no.

206
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.470
You lie up to the hearing of thegods.

207
00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.300
But if there be or ever were onesuch,

208
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.830
it's past the size of dreaming.

209
00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:11.170
Nature wants stuff to viestrange forms with fancy,

210
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:16.630
yet to imagine an Antony werenature's piece against fancy,

211
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.000
condemning shadows quite.

212
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.770
Hear me, good madam.

213
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.730
Your loss is as yourself great.

214
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.130
And you bear it as answering tothe weight.

215
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.170
Would I might never o'ertakepursued success,

216
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.800
but I do feel by the rebound ofyours

217
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.470
a grief that smites my veryheart at root.

218
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.970
I thank you, sir,

219
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.500
Know you what Caesar means to dowith me?

220
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.670
I am loath to tell you what Iwould you knew.

221
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.400
Nay, pray you, siró

222
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.530
Though he be honorableó

223
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:59.270
He'll lead me then in triumph?

224
00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:01.670
Madam, he will; I know it.

225
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.100
Arise, you shall not kneel.

226
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:42.130
I pray you, rise.

227
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.030
Rise, Egypt.

228
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:46.900
Sir, the gods will have it thus.

229
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.730
My master and my lord I mustobey.

230
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.930
Take to you no hard thoughts.

231
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.030
The record of what injuries youdid us,

232
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.330
though written in our flesh,

233
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.530
we shall remember as things butdone by chance.

234
00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.600
Sole sir of the world,

235
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.630
I cannot project mine own causeso well to make it clear,

236
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.600
but do confess I have been ladenwith like frailties

237
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.130
which before have often shamedour sex.

238
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:23.300
Cleopatra, know we willextenuate rather than enforce.

239
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.500
If you apply yourself to ourintents,

240
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.400
which towards you are mostgentle,

241
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.600
you shall find a benefit in thischange.

242
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.770
But if you seek to lay on me acruelty,

243
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.300
by taking Antony's course,

244
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.700
you shall bereave yourself of mygood purposes

245
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.570
and put your children to thatdestruction

246
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:49.700
which I'll guard them from ifthereon you rely.

247
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.200
I'll take my leave.

248
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.330
And may, through all the world;'tis yours.

249
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:59.100
And we, your scutcheons and yoursigns of conquest,

250
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:03.730
shall hang in what place youplease.

251
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.230
Here, my good lord.

252
00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.800
You shall advise me in all forCleopatra.

253
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.400
This is the brief of money,plate, and jewels,

254
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.730
I am possessed of.

255
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.400
'Tis exactly valued, not pettythings admitted.

256
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.730
Still be it yours.

257
00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.000
Bestow it at your pleasure.

258
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.600
And believe Caesar's no merchant

259
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.900
to make prize with you of thingsthat merchants sold.

260
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.830
Therefore, be cheered.

261
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.030
Make not your thoughts yourprisons.

262
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.070
No, dear queen.

263
00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.170
For we intend so to dispose you

264
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.570
as yourself shall give uscounsel.

265
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.630
Feed and sleep.

266
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.600
Our care and pity is so muchupon you

267
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:02.630
that we remain your friend.

268
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:03.670
And so adieu.

269
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.870
My master and my lord.

270
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:11.500
Not so. Adieu.

271
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:29.600
He words me, girls; he words me.

272
00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:34.900
That I should not be noble tomyself.

273
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.870
But, hark thee, Charmian.

274
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.600
Finish, good lady.

275
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.500
The bright day is done, and weare for the dark.

276
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.230
Hie thee again.

277
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.170
I have spoke already, and it isprovided.

278
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.730
Go put it to the haste.

279
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.800
Madam, I will.

280
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.000
Where is the queen?

281
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.730
Behold, sir.

282
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.000
Dolabella!

283
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.700
Madam, as thereto sworn by yourcommand,

284
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.470
which my love makes religion toobey,

285
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.630
I tell you this:

286
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:07.900
Caesar through Syria intends hisjourney.

287
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.130
And within three days,

288
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.270
you with your children will hesend before.

289
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.830
Make your best use of this.

290
00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.130
I have performed your pleasureand my promise.

291
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.030
Dolabella, I shall remain yourdebtor.

292
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:26.830
I, your servant.

293
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.030
Adieu, good queen.

294
00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.370
I must attend on Caesar.

295
00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.500
Farewell and thanks.

296
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.770
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?

297
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.400
Thou, an Egyptian puppet,

298
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.400
shall be shown in Rome as wellas Ió

299
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.230
mechanic slaves with greasyaprons,

300
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:56.030
rules and hammers shall upliftus to the view.

301
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.930
In their thick breaths,.rank ofgross diet

302
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.030
shall be enclouded and forced todrink their vapour.

303
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.170
O the good gods.

304
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.800
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras.

305
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.530
Saucy lictors will catch at uslike strumpets

306
00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:17.270
and scald rhymers ballad us outof tune.

307
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.730
The quick comedians extemporallywill stage us

308
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.370
and present our Alexandrianrevels.

309
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.730
Antony shall be brought drunkenforth,

310
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:36.400
and I shall see some squeakingCleopatra boy my greatness

311
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.730
in the posture of a whore.

312
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.600
O the good gods!

313
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.500
Nay, that's certain.

314
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.970
I'll never see it.

315
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.430
For I am sure my nails arestronger than mine eyes.

316
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.300
Why, that's the way to fooltheir preparation

317
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.130
and to conquer their most absurdintents.

318
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.500
Now, Charmian!

319
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.830
Show me, my women, like a queen.

320
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.700
Go fetch my best attires.

321
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:17.530
I am again for Cydnus to meetMark Antony.

322
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.970
Sirrah Iras, go.

323
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.670
Now, noble Charmian, we'lldispatch indeed.

324
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.300
And when thou hast done thischare,

325
00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.970
I'll give thee leave to playtill doomsday.

326
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.470
Bring our crown and all.

327
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.600
Wherefore's this noise?

328
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.470
Here is a rural fellow

329
00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.700
that will not be denied yourhighness presence.

330
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.030
He brings you figs.

331
00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.100
Let him come in.

332
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:56.200
What poor an instrument may do anoble deed.

333
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.030
He brings me liberty.

334
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.530
My resolution's placed,

335
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.770
and I have nothing of woman inme now.

336
00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:12.330
From head to foot I ammarble-constant.

337
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:17.600
Now the fleeting moon; no planetis of mine.

338
00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.600
This is the man.

339
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.570
Avoid and leave him.

340
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.430
Hast thou the pretty worm ofNilus there

341
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.830
that kills and pains not?

342
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.730
Truly, I have him,

343
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:37.300
but I would not be the party

344
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.070
that should desire you to touchhim,

345
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:41.970
for his biting is immortal.

346
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.630
Those that do die of it doseldom or never recover.

347
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:48.670
Rememberest thou any that havedied on it?

348
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:52.130
Very manyó men and women too.

349
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.570
I heard of one of them onlyyesterday.

350
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:57.930
A very honest woman, butsomething given to lie

351
00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:02.130
as a woman should not do but inthe way of honesty.

352
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.570
How she died of the biting ofit,

353
00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:05.770
what pain she felt,

354
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.100
truly, she made very good reportof the worm.

355
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.200
But this is most fallible.

356
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.570
The worm's an odd worm.

357
00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.430
Get thee hence; farewell.

358
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.470
I wish you joy of the worm.

359
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.770
Farewell.

360
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.270
You must think this, look you,

361
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.400
that the worm will do his kind.

362
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.930
Ay, ay; farewell.

363
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:36.130
Look you, the worm is not to betrusted

364
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.870
but in the keeping of wisepeople,

365
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:42.200
for, indeed, there is nogoodness in the worm.

366
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.800
Take thou no care; it shall beheeded.

367
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.470
Very good.

368
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.800
Give it nothing, I pray you,

369
00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.130
for it's not worth the feeding.

370
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.900
Will it eat me?

371
00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.100
You must not think I am sosimple,

372
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.230
but I know the devil himselfwill not eat a woman.

373
00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.570
I know that a woman is a dishfor the gods

374
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:03.830
if the devil dresses her not.

375
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.970
But, truly, these same whoresondevils

376
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.230
do the gods great harm in theirwomen,

377
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:13.170
for in every ten that they make,the devils mar five.

378
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.030
Well, get thee gone; farewell.

379
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.030
Yes, forsooth.

380
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:30.670
I wish you joy of the worm.

381
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.130
Give me my robe.

382
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.600
Put on my crown.

383
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.000
I have immortal longings in me.

384
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.070
Now no more the juice of Egypt'sgrape shall moist this lip.

385
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.200
Yare, yare, good Iras.

386
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.770
Quick.

387
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:27.500
Methinks I hear Antony call.

388
00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.570
I see him rouse himself topraise my noble act.

389
00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.270
I hear him mock the luck ofCaesar,

390
00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:39.330
which the gods give men toexcuse their after wrath.

391
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:44.930
Husband, I come.

392
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.600
Now to that name my courageprove my title.

393
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.670
I am fire and air.

394
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.270
My other elements I give tobaser life.

395
00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:01.500
So; have you done?

396
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:08.170
Come then and take the lastwarmth of my lips.

397
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:16.200
Farewell, kind Charmian.

398
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.700
Iras, long farewell.

399
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.570
Have I the aspic in my lips?

400
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.370
Dost fall?

401
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:39.430
If thou and nature can so gentlypart,

402
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.030
the stroke of death is as alover's pinch,

403
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:46.770
which hurts and is desired.

404
00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:49.500
Dost thou lie still?

405
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.970
If thus thou vanishest,

406
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:59.570
thou tell'st the world it is notworth leave-taking.

407
00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:02.230
Dissolve thick cloud and rain,

408
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.500
that I may say the godsthemselves do weep.

409
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.630
This proves me base.

410
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.230
If she first meet the curledAntony,

411
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.970
he'll make demand of her andspend that kiss

412
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.970
which is my heaven to have.

413
00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:25.470
Come, thou mortal wretch.

414
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.330
With thy sharp teeth

415
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:50.100
this knot intrinsicate of lifeat once untie.

416
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:58.600
Poor venomous fool, be angry anddispatch.

417
00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:06.030
Peace, peace.

418
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:09.500
Dost thou not see my baby at mybreast

419
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.430
that sucks the nurse asleep?

420
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.930
O, break!

421
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:15.770
O, break!

422
00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.500
As sweet as balm,

423
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.830
as soft as air,

424
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:29.400
as gentleó

425
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.670
O Antony!

426
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:42.930
Nay, I will take thee too.

427
00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.630
What should I stayó

428
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:49.530
In this vile world?

429
00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.930
So fare thee well.

430
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:56.400
Now boast thee, death,

431
00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:02.670
in thy possession lies a lassunparalleled.

432
00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.070
Downy windows close,

433
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:11.230
and golden Phoebus never bebeheld of eyes again so royal.

434
00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:16.870
Your crown's awry.

435
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:23.200
I'll mend it and then play.

436
00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.000
Where is the queen?

437
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.070
Speak softly, wake her not.

438
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.630
Caesar hath sentó

439
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.200
Too slow a messenger.

440
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:50.570
O, come apace, dispatch!

441
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.430
I partly feel thee.

442
00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.700
What work is here?

443
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:05.170
Charmian, is this well done?

444
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:14.100
It is well done and fitting fora princess

445
00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.530
descended of so many royalkings.

446
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.530
How goes it here?

447
00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.030
All dead.

448
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:35.070
Caesar, thy thoughts touch theireffects in this.

449
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:39.900
Thyself art coming to seeperformed the dreaded act

450
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.870
which thou so sought'st tohinder.

451
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:56.530
O sir, you are too sure anaugurer.

452
00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.600
That you did fear is done.

453
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:12.270
Bravest at the last, she leveledat our purposes,

454
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.700
and, being royal, took her ownway.

455
00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:24.730
The manner of their deaths?

456
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.470
I do not see them bleed.

457
00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.630
Who was last with them?

458
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.630
A simple countryman that broughther figs.

459
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:37.200
This was his basket.

460
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.770
If she had swallowed poison,

461
00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.470
'twould appear by externalswelling,

462
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:47.500
but she looks like sleep

463
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:54.070
as she would catch anotherAntony

464
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.570
in her strong toil of grace.

465
00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.370
Here, on her breast.

466
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:02.730
There is a vent of blood andsomething blown.

467
00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.830
The like is on her arm.

468
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.400
This is an aspic's trail,

469
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.700
and these fig leaves have slimeupon them,

470
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.700
such as the aspic leaves uponthe caves of Nile.

471
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.170
Most probable that so she died.

472
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.730
For her physician tells me

473
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:23.900
she hath pursued conclusionsinfinite of easy ways to die.

474
00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:27.900
Take up her bed

475
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:32.600
and bear her women from themonument.

476
00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.230
She shall be buried by herAntony.

477
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:41.930
No grave upon the earth shallclip in it a pair so famous.

478
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:45.900
High events as these strikethose that make them,

479
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.370
and their story is no less inpity than his glory

480
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.800
which brought them to belamented.

481
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:58.530
Our army shall in solemn showattend this funeral

482
00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:02.000
and then to Rome.

483
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.070
Come, Dolabella,

484
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:08.370
see high order in this greatsolemnity.

485
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.200
