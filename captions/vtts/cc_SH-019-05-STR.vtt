00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.070


2
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.900
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:

3
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.170
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:

4
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.970
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:

5
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.070
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,

6
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.400
And fix most firm thy resolution.

7
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.070
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

8
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.970
Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.

9
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.070
I have no great devotion to the deed;

10
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.500
Yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:

11
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.970
'Tis but a man gone.

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.800
Forth, my sword: he dies.

13
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.000
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,

14
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330
And he grows angry.

15
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.030
Now, whether he kill Cassio,

16
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.770
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,

17
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.370
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,

18
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.900
He calls me to a restitution large

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.130
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,

20
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.430
As gifts to Desdemona;

21
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.130
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,

22
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.670
He has a daily beauty in his life

23
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.770
That makes me ugly; besides, the Moor

24
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.500
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:

25
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.800
No, he must die.

26
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.800
Be it so: I hear him coming.

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.000
I know his gait, 'tis he--

28
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.770
Villain, thou diest!

29
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.070
Thrust had been mine enemy indeed,

30
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.530
But that my coat is better than thou know'st

31
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.930
I will make proof of thine.

32
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.570
Ahh.

33
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.200
Ahh!

34
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.870
Ohh. Ahh.

35
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.030
Iago keeps his word.

36
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.600
'Tis he--

37
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.530
O brave Iago, honest and just.

38
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.700
O, murder.

39
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.570
Minion, your dear lies dead,

40
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.230
And my unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.

41
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.630
Forth of mine heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;

42
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.100
Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.

43
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.830
'Tis some mischance; which is very direful.

44
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.970
Hark! two or three groan: it is a heavy night:

45
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.700
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe

46
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.300
To come in to the cry without more help.

47
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.330
Hark!

48
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.670
Here's one comes in his shirt, with weapons.

49
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.770
Who's there?

50
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.200
Whose noise is this that cries on murder?

51
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.300
We do not know.

52
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.400
Did not you hear a cry?

53
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.500
Here, here!

54
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.700
For heaven's sake, help me!

55
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.870
What's the matter?

56
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.000
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

57
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.300
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

58
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.430
What are you here that cry so grievously?

59
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.730
Iago?

60
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.470
O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!

61
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.830
Give me some help.

62
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.470
O me, lieutenant!

63
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.170
What villains have done this?

64
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.530
I think that one of them is hereabout,

65
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.700
And cannot make away.

66
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.800
O treacherous villains!

67
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.900
What are you there?

68
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.170
Come in, and give some help.

69
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.130
O, help me here!

70
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.830
That's one of them.

71
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.600
O murderous slave!

72
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.370
O villain!

73
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.770
Damn'd Iago!

74
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.230
Kill men i' the dark!

75
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.470
Where be these bloody thieves?

76
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.700
How silent is this town!

77
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.970
Ho!

78
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.130
Murder!

79
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.270
Murder!

80
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.370
What may you be?

81
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.500
Are you good or evil?

82
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.000
As you shall prove us, praise us.

83
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.100
Signior Lodovico?

84
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.270
He, sir.

85
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.530
I cry you pardon.

86
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.770
Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

87
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.000
How is't, brother!

88
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.570
My leg's cut in two.

89
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.530
Marry, heaven forbid!

90
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.030
Light; I'll bind it with my shirt.

91
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.970
What is the matter?

92
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.170
Who is't that cried?

93
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.370
Who is't that cried!

94
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.470
O my dear Cassio!

95
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.630
My sweet Cassio!

96
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.670
O notable strumpet!

97
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.270
Cassio, may you suspect

98
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.800
Who they should be that have thus have many led you?

99
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.130
No.

100
00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.600
I am sorry to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

101
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.700
O, for a chair,

102
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.070
To bear him easily hence!

103
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.170
Alas, he faints!

104
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.370
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

105
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.030
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash

106
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.270
To be a party in this injury.

107
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.830
Patience awhile, good Cassio.

108
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:42.930
Come, come;

109
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:43.930
Lend me the torch.

110
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.170
Know we this face or no?

111
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.930
Alas my friend, my dear countryman Roderigo!

112
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.530
No--yes, sure: O heaven!

113
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.070
Roderigo.

114
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.330
What, of Venice?

115
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.700
Even he, sir; did you know him?

116
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:07.800
Know him!

117
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.970
Ay.

118
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.300
Signior Gratiano?

119
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.400
I cry your gentle pardon;

120
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.970
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,

121
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.170
That so neglected you.

122
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.300
I am glad to see you.

123
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.300
How do you, Cassio?

124
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.670
A chair, a chair!

125
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.400
Roderigo!

126
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.570
He, he 'tis he.

127
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.270
O, the chair!

128
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.170
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.

129
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.370
For you, mistress,

130
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.500
Save you your labours.

131
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.270
He that lies slain here, Cassio,

132
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.670
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

133
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.300
None in the world; nor do I know the man.

134
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.100
What, look you pale?

135
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.130
O, bear him out o' the air.

136
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.230
Stay you, good gentlemen.

137
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.170
Look you pale, mistress?

138
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.700
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?

139
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.070
Nay, if you shall stare, we shall hear more anon.

140
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.330
Behold her well;

141
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.700
I pray you, look at her:

142
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.070
Do you see, gentlemen?

143
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.270
Nay, guiltiness will speak,

144
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.800
Even though tongues were out of use.

145
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.000
'Las, what's the matter?

146
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.030
What's the matter, husband?

147
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.370
Cassio hath been here set on in the dark

148
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.300
By Roderigo and others who are scaped:

149
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:31.030
He's almost slain, and Roderigo quite dead.

150
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.700
Alas, good gentleman!

151
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.070
Alas, good Cassio!

152
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.930
This is the fruit of whoring.

153
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.200
Prithee, Emilia,

154
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.600
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.

155
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.500
What, do you shake at that?

156
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.500
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

157
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.670
O, did he so?

158
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.500
I charge you, go with me.

159
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.300
Fie upon thee, strumpet!

160
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.770
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest

161
00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.600
As you that thus abuse me.

162
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.700
As I!

163
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.100
Foh!

164
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.100
Fie upon thee, strumpet!

165
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.570
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.

166
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.100
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.

167
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:08.730
Emilia run you to the citadel,

168
00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.930
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.

169
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.270
Will you go on afore?

170
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.230
This is the night

171
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:31.100
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

172
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.170
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul--

173
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.830
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!

174
00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.230
It is the cause.

175
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:10.330
Yet I'll not shed her blood;

176
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:14.230
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,

177
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.530
And smooth as monumental alabaster.

178
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:26.630
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.

179
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:41.930
Put out the light, and then put out the light:

180
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.770
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,

181
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.430
I can again thy former light restore,

182
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:57.970
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,

183
00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:04.030
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,

184
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.830
I know not where is that Promethean heat

185
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.630
That can thy light relume.

186
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.570
When I have pluck'd thy rose,

187
00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.730
I cannot give it vital growth again.

188
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.630
It needs must wither:

189
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.270
I'll smell it on the tree.

190
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.900
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade

191
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.730
Justice to break her sword!

192
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.600
One more, one more.

193
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.030
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,

194
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.400
And love thee after.

195
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:36.470
One more, and this the last:

196
00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.330
So sweet was ne'er so fatal.

197
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:55.170
I must weep, But they are cruel tears:

198
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.300
this sorrow's heavenly;

199
00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.730
It strikes where it doth love.

200
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:01.130
She wakes.

201
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.230
Who's there?

202
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.100
Othello.

203
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.200
Ay. Desdemona.

204
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.030
Will you come to bed, my lord?

205
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.670
Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

206
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.930
Ay, my lord.

207
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.770
If you bethink yourself of any crime

208
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.500
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,

209
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.870
Solicit for it straight.

210
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.670
Alack, what may you mean by that?

211
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:59.830
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:

212
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.700
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;

213
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.470
No; heaven forfend!

214
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.100
I would not kill thy soul.

215
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.630
Talk you of killing?

216
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.570
Ay, I do.

217
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.270
Then heaven have mercy on me!

218
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.330
Amen, with all my heart!

219
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.330
If you say so,

220
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:34.430
I hope you will not kill me.

221
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:43.330
And yet I fear you; for you are fearful then

222
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.200
When your eyes roll so:

223
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.730
I know not why I fear,

224
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.900
Since guiltiness I know not; and yet I feel I fear.

225
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.570
Think on thy sins.

226
00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.170
They are loves I bear to thee.

227
00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.530
Ay, and for that thou diest.

228
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:07.170
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.

229
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.570
Why gnaw you so your nether lip?

230
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:14.900
The bloody passion shakes your very frame:

231
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.600
These are portents; and yet I hope, I hope,

232
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.100
They do not point at me.

233
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.200
Peace, and be still!

234
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200
I will so.

235
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.800
What's the matter?

236
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:44.330
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee

237
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.630
Thou gavest to Cassio.

238
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:49.770
No, by my life and soul!

239
00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.100
Send for the man, and ask him.

240
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:54.870
Sweet soul, take heed,

241
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.300
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

242
00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.400
Ay, but not yet to die.

243
00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.630
Yes, presently:

244
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.400
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;

245
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.900
For to deny each article with oath

246
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.430
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception

247
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.400
That I do groan withal.

248
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.470
Thou art to die!

249
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:14.330
Then Lord have mercy on me!

250
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.430
I say, amen.

251
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:16.630
And have you mercy too!

252
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.930
I never did

253
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.100
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio

254
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.300
But by such general warranty of heaven

255
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.670
As I might love: I never gave him token.

256
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.970
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.

257
00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.670
O perjured woman!

258
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.270
Thou dost stone my heart,

259
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.670
And makest me call what I intend to do

260
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.930
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:

261
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.830
I saw the handkerchief.

262
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.000
He found it then;

263
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.370
I never gave it him: send for him hither;

264
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:48.830
Let him confess the truth.

265
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:49.830
He hath confess'd.

266
00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.800
What, my lord?

267
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.330
That he hath used thee.

268
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.730
How?

269
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.830
Unlawfully?

270
00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:02.930
Ay.

271
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.000
He will not say so.

272
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.370
No, his mouth is stopp'd;

273
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:09.230
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

274
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.530
My fear interprets: what, is he dead?

275
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.970
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge

276
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.470
Had stomach for them all.

277
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.130
Alas!

278
00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:27.330
He is betray'd and I undone.

279
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.470
Out, strumpet!

280
00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.000
Weep'st thou for him to my face?

281
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.470
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

282
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.570
Down, strumpet!

283
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.000
Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

284
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.100
Nay, if you strive--

285
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.200
But half an hour!

286
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.300
It is too late.

287
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.400
I say one prayer!

288
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400
It is too late.

289
00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.330
My lord, my lord!

290
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.100
What, ho!

291
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.370
My lord, my lord!

292
00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:14.400
What noise is this?

293
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.430
Not dead?

294
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.070
Not yet quite dead?

295
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.800
I that am cruel am yet merciful;

296
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.200
I would not have thee linger in thy pain:

297
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.530
So, so.

298
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.500
Who's there?

299
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.100
Yes: 'tis Emilia.

300
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.830
By and by.

301
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.700
She's dead.

302
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.930
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.

303
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.170
The noise was here.

304
00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.900
Ha! Ha! Ha!

305
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.270
No more moving?

306
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.330
Still as the grave.

307
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.070
Should she come in?

308
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.170
Were't good?

309
00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:31.500
I think she stirs again: no.

310
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.700
What's the best?

311
00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:39.130
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:

312
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.730
My wife!

313
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.130
My wife!

314
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.200
What wife?

315
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.700
I have no wife.

316
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.900
O insupportable!

317
00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.470
O heavy hour!

318
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.600
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse

319
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.270
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe

320
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.900
Did yawn at alteration.

321
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.670
O, good my lord!

322
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.530
I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;

323
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.900
Soft you; by and by.

324
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.870
Let me the curtain draw.

325
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.000
Where art thou?

326
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.170
What's the matter with thee now?

327
00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.000
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

328
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.100
What, now?

329
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.200
But now.

330
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.630
It is the very error of the moon;

331
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:06.970
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,

332
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.370
And makes men mad.

333
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:10.770
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian call'd Roderigo.

334
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.970
Roderigo kill'd! And Cassio kill'd!

335
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.370
No, Cassio is not kill'd.

336
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.700
Not Cassio kill'd!

337
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.970
Then murder's out of tune,

338
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:18.900
And sweet revenge grows harsh.

339
00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:26.670
What cry is that?

340
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.670
That! What?

341
00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.700
Out, and alas!

342
00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:32.200
That was my mistress' voice.

343
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:39.100
Help!

344
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.230
Help, ho!

345
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:46.370
O lady, lady speak again!

346
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.670
Sweet Desdemona!

347
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.530
O sweet mistress, speak!

348
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:03.730
A guiltless death I die.

349
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:11.230
O, who hath done this deed?

350
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.070
Nobody; I myself.

351
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:24.470
Farewell,

352
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.900
Commend me to my kind lord:

353
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.200
O, farewell!

354
00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500
Why, how should she be murder'd?

355
00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.630
Alas, who knows?

356
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:00.870
You heard her say herself, it was not I.

357
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.800
She said so: I must needs report the truth.

358
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.600
She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:

359
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.100
'Twas I that kill'd her.

360
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.130
O, the more angel she,

361
00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.630
And you the blacker devil!

362
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:16.500
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

363
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.070
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

364
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.430
She was false as water.

365
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.830
Thou art rash as fire, to say

366
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:27.530
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

367
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.300
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.

368
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:37.870
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,

369
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.900
But that I did proceed upon just grounds

370
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.400
To this extremity.

371
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.400
Thy husband knew it all.

372
00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:47.330
My husband?

373
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.600
Thy husband.

374
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.970
That she was false to wedlock?

375
00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:55.030
Ay, with Cassio.

376
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.100
Nay, had she been true,

377
00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.870
If heaven would make me such another world

378
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:05.200
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, I'd not have sold her for it.

379
00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:07.500
My husband!

380
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.100
Thy husband, ay, 'twas he that told me first:

381
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:16.100
An honest man he is, and hates the slime

382
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.500
That sticks on filthy deeds.

383
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.400
My husband!

384
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.730
What needs this iteration, woman?

385
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:24.770
I say thy husband.

386
00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.570
O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,

387
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:33.030
My husband say that she was false!

388
00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:37.100
He, woman; I say thy husband: dost understand the word?

389
00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.200
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

390
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.400
If he say so, may his pernicious soul

391
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.870
Rot half a grain a day!

392
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.270
He lies to the heart:

393
00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.070
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

394
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:57.270
Ha!

395
00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.670
Do thy worst:

396
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.030
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven

397
00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.530
Than thou wast worthy her.

398
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:03.800
Peace, you were best.

399
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.100
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm

400
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:08.170
As I have to be hurt.

401
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.800
O gull!

402
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.200
O dolt!

403
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.930
As ignorant as dirt!

404
00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:22.700
Thou hast done a deed-- I care not for thy sword;

405
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.700
I'll make thee known,

406
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.700
Though I lost twenty lives--Help!

407
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.930
Help, ho!

408
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:33.770
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress!

409
00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:35.330
Murder!

410
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:36.770
Murder!

411
00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:37.900
What is the matter?

412
00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.700
How now, general!

413
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.370
O, are you come, Iago?

414
00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:45.930
You have done well,

415
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.100
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

416
00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.600
What's the matter?

417
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.630
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:

418
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:59.530
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:

419
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.600
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:

420
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:07.100
Do speak, for my heart is full.

421
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:10.000
I told him what I thought, and told no more

422
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.930
Than what he found himself was apt and true.

423
00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:14.970
But did you ever tell him she was false?

424
00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.170
I did.

425
00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:20.370
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;

426
00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.000
Upon my soul, a wicked lie.

427
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.300
She false with Cassio did you say with Cassio?

428
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.930
With Cassio, mistress.

429
00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.370
Go to, charm your tongue.

430
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.030
I will not charm my tongue;

431
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.230
I am bound to speak:

432
00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:42.070
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed--

433
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.200
Heavens forfend!

434
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.270
And your reports have set the murder on.

435
00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:55.900
Villany, villany, villany!

436
00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.000
I think upon't, I think:

437
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.430
I smell't: villany!--

438
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:05.370
I thought so then-- O, I'll kill myself for grief--

439
00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.570
villany, villany!

440
00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:07.700
What, are you mad?

441
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.030
I charge you, get you home.

442
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.370
I pray you, give me leave to speak:

443
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:26.670
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.

444
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:33.500
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

445
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.770
O! O! O!

446
00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.870
Nay, lay thee down and roar;

447
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:45.270
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent

448
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.370
That e'er did lift up eye.

449
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.230
O, she was foul!

450
00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.300
I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,

451
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.270
Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:

452
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.830
I know this act shows horrible and grim.

453
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.700
Poor Desdemona!

454
00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.930
I am glad thy father's dead:

455
00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.600
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief

456
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.470
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,

457
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.370
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,

458
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.430
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,

459
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:24.470
And fall to reprobance.

460
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:28.200
'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows

461
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.830
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame

462
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.970
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:

463
00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.970
And she did gratify his amorous works

464
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.070
With that recognizance and pledge of love

465
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.870
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:

466
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:48.000
It was a handkerchief, an antique token

467
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.700
My father gave my mother.

468
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.530
O God.

469
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.430
O heavenly God!

470
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:58.000
Come, hold your peace.

471
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:04.000
'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!

472
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:10.600
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:

473
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.630
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,

474
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:18.730
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

475
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:20.200
Be wise, and get you home.

476
00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.430
I will not.

477
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.530
Fie!

478
00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.600
Your sword upon a woman?

479
00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.670
O thou dull Moor!

480
00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:32.000
That handkerchief thou speak'st of

481
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.530
I found by fortune and did give my husband;

482
00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.870
For often, with a solemn earnestness,

483
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.930
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,

484
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.570
He begg'd of me to steal it.

485
00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.630
Villanous whore!

486
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:49.500
She give it Cassio!

487
00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:50.500
No!

488
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.700
I found it,

489
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:57.100
And I did give't my husband.

490
00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.130
Filth, thou liest!

491
00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:02.900
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.

492
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.800
O murderous coxcomb!

493
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.800
What would such a fool do with so good a wife?

494
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.600
Are there no stones in heaven

495
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.700
But what serve as for the thunder?

496
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.370
Precious villain!

497
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:38.800
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.

498
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.870
Ay: O, O lay me by my mistress' side.

499
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.170
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

500
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.270
'Tis a notorious villain.

501
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.370
Take you this weapon,

502
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:49.630
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:

503
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.500
Guard the door without; let him not pass,

504
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:52.730
But kill him rather.

505
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.170
I'll after that same villain, for 'tis a damned slave.

506
00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.030
I am not valiant neither,

507
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:04.900
But every puny whipster gets my sword:

508
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.070
But why should honour outlive honesty?

509
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.930
Let it go all.

510
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.700
What did thy song bode, lady?

511
00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:23.470
Hark, canst thou hear me?

512
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:31.130
I will play the swan.

513
00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.100
And die in music.

514
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.800
Willow, willow, willow--

515
00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:49.930
O Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;

516
00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:56.670
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;

517
00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:05.270
And speaking as I think, alas, I die.

518
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.100
I have another weapon in this chamber;

519
00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:22.600
It was a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper--

520
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:26.100
O, here it is.

521
00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.800
Uncle, I must come forth.

522
00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.200
If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:

523
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.030
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

524
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.000
Look in upon me then and speak with me,

525
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.600
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

526
00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.600
What's the matter?

527
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:48.200
Behold, I have a weapon;

528
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.270
A better never did sustain itself

529
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.970
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,

530
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:56.770
That, with this little arm and this good sword,

531
00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.370
I have made my way through more impediments

532
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:05.930
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!

533
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:10.570
Who can control his fate?

534
00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.200
'Tis not so now.

535
00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.870
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;

536
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:20.970
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,

537
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:24.870
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.

538
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.500
Do you go back dismay'd?

539
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.470
'Tis a lost fear;

540
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:39.100
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,

541
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.370
And he retires.

542
00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.530
Where should Othello go?

543
00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:01.830
Now, how dost thou look now?

544
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.930
O ill-starr'd wench!

545
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.370
Pale as thy smock!

546
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:14.670
When we shall meet at compt,

547
00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:19.130
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,

548
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.670
And fiends will snatch at it.

549
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:30.630
Cold, cold, my girl!

550
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.970
Even like thy chastity.

551
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.530
O cursed, cursed slave!

552
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:48.300
Whip me, ye devils,

553
00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.670
From the possession of this heavenly sight!

554
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.370
Blow me about in winds!

555
00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:57.400
Roast me in sulphur!

556
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:05.100
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!

557
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.030
O Desdemona!

558
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.030
Dead!

559
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:15.100
O Desdemona!

560
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:24.230
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

561
00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.070
That's he that was Othello: here I am.

562
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:32.270
Where is that viper?

563
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.630
Bring the villain forth.

564
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.070
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.

565
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.100
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.

566
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.230
Wrench his sword from him.

567
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.930
I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

568
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:58.470
I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;

569
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:01.430
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

570
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.430
O thou Othello, that wert once so good,

571
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.670
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,

572
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.900
What shall be said to thee?

573
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.170
Why, any thing:

574
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:12.170
An honourable murderer, if you will;

575
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.700
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

576
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.000
This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:

577
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.470
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

578
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.700
Ay.

579
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:23.170
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

580
00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:26.330
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.

581
00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:33.000
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil

582
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.230
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

583
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:42.070
Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:

584
00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:44.700
From this time forth I never will speak word.

585
00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.870
What, not to pray?

586
00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:47.700
Torment will open your lips.

587
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.400
Well, thou dost best.

588
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.230
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,

589
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.570
Which, as I think, you know not.

590
00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.770
Here is a letter

591
00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.800
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;

592
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.930
And here another: the one of them imports

593
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.100
The death of Cassio to be undertook by Roderigo.

594
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.200
O villain!

595
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.430
Most heathenish and most gross!

596
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:03.770
Now here's another discontented paper,

597
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.830
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,

598
00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:08.470
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;

599
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.700
But that belike Iago in the nick

600
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:11.800
Came in and satisfied him.

601
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.400
O thou pernicious caitiff!

602
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.100
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief

603
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.600
That was my wife's?

604
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.800
I found it in my chamber:

605
00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.970
And he himself confess'd it even now

606
00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:24.370
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose

607
00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:26.970
Which wrought to his desire.

608
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:30.630
Fool! Fool! Fool!

609
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:32.230
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,

610
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.030
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him

611
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.600
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came

612
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.500
I was cast: and even but now he spake,

613
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.230
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,

614
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:42.600
Iago set him on.

615
00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.670
You must forsake this room, and go with us:

616
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.270
Your power and your command is taken off,

617
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:48.230
And Cassio rules in Cyprus.

618
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.670
For this slave,

619
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.000
If there be any cunning cruelty

620
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.430
That can torment him much and hold him long,

621
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.200
It shall be his.

622
00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.830
You shall close prisoner rest,

623
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.730
Till that the nature of your fault be known

624
00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.170
To the Venetian state.

625
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:03.970
Come, bring him away.

626
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.930
Soft you; a word or two before you go.

627
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:20.500
I have done the state some service, and they know't.

628
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.570
No more of that.

629
00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.470
I pray you, in your letters,

630
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.630
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,

631
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:36.970
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,

632
00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:41.530
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak

633
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:49.330
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;

634
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:57.000
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought

635
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.800
Perplex'd in the extreme;

636
00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.800
of one whose hand,

637
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:18.930
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away

638
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:25.030
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,

639
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.800
Albeit unused to the melting mood,

640
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.770
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees

641
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:35.400
Their medicinal gum.

642
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.200
Set you down this;

643
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.630
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,

644
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:48.370
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk

645
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:50.900
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,

646
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:57.130
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,

647
00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.200
And smote him, thus.

648
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.430
O bloody period!

649
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.970
All that's spoke is marr'd.

650
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:18.470
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;

651
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:23.930
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

652
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:36.100
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;

653
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.370
For he was great of heart.

654
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.000
O Spartan dog,

655
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.900
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!

656
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.430
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;

657
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:53.030
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;

658
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.100
Let it be hid.

659
00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.800
Gratiano, keep the house,

660
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.130
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,

661
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.630
For they succeed on you.

662
00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.930
To you, lord governor,

663
00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.300
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;

664
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:07.570
The time, the place, the torture:

665
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:09.330
O, enforce it!

666
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.730
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state

667
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:19.230
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

668
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:41.470
