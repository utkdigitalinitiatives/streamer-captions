NARRATOR: FIRST

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.630
IT'S COOL AND WET, AN ORDINARY
SEPTEMBER MORNING. BUT TODAY,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.160
NOTHING WILL BE ORDINARY FOR
SCULPTOR ALBERT PALEY. TODAY

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.800
IS INSTALLATION DAY FOR
GENESEE PASSAGE, THE MOST

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:22.830
AMBITIOUS CREATION OF PALEY'S
CAREER. ALBERT PALEY, HIS

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.360
STUDIO STAFF AND A DOZEN SUB
CONTRACTORS HAVE LABORED FOR

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.960
MORE THAN FOUR YEARS TO BRING
GENESEE PASSAGE TO THIS POINT.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.000
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW MORE
MILES IN THE JOURNEY AND A FEW

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.630
FINAL HOURS TO RAISE THE
SCULPTURE INTO PLACE AND THEY

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:49.060
WON'T BE EASY. GENESEE PASSAGE
IS THE CULMINATION OF HUNDREDS

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.160
OF DRAWINGS AND DESIGNS,
MEETINGS WITH CORPORATE

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.460

ENGINEERS AND CUTTING,
BENDING, WELDING AND GRINDING

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.300
MASSIVE STEEL PLATES. NOW THE
SCULPTURE TRAVELS IN A FLATBED

DESTINATION. THE ENTRANCE TO

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.760
TRUCK CROSSES THE GENESEE
RIVER, WHICH CUTS THE CITY OF

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.530
ROCHESTER IN TWO, AND 40 TONS
OF STEEL, 65 FEET IN LENGTH

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.660
WILL SOON STAND IN CELEBRATION
OF THE CORPORATION THAT

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.700
COMMISSIONED IT, THE CITY THAT
WILL MARVEL AT IT, AND THE

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:33.260
SCULPTOR WHO CREATED IT.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.560
HAILED AS A VIRTUOSO OF DESIGN
AND TECHNIQUE, ALBERT PALEY'S

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.100
MEDIUM IS METAL. BEGINNING AS
A JEWELER WORKING WITH GOLD

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.460
AND SILVER AND NOW A MASTER OF
IRON AND STEEL. PALEY BLURS

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.260
THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN CRAFT AND
ART AND GENESEE PASSAGE MARKS

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.560
A MAJOR MILESTONE IN A BODY OF
WORK THAT CONTINUOUSLY

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.660
REINVENTS ITSELF. NEW SPEAKER:
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:24.560
IT UP. NEW SPEAKER: AND WHAT'S
YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION? (MUSIC)

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.130
NARRATOR: THE SECOND HALF OF
THE 20TH CENTURY HAS WITNESSED

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.230
THE RISE AND EBBING OF A MAJOR
MOVEMENT IN ART AND THAT IS

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.560
THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT. IT
SPRUNG UP IN AN ACADEMIC

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.400
CIRCUMSTANCE, IN OUR
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.900
EDUCATION AFTER WORLD WAR II
WHICH WERE BEING FED THROUGH

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.430
THE GI BILL OF RIGHTS. WITH
MATURE PEOPLE THIS MOVEMENT

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.060
FLOWERED, WAS INCREDIBLY
POTENT, THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.760
PEOPLE MAKING WONDERFUL
CERAMICS, GLASS, METAL WORK,

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.660
WOODWORK AND AS THE MOVEMENT
EBBED THOSE MAJOR TALENTS

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:26.030
CONTINUED STRONG AND ONE OF
THOSE IS ALBERT PALEY. THERE

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.430
HAVE BEEN A HANDFUL OF MASTERS
EMERGING FROM THE STUDIO CRAFT

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.160
MOVEMENT AND THAT'S HOW I SEE
ALBERT'S POSITION TODAY. HE IS

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.600
AN ARTIST IN HIS OWN RIGHT WHO
CAME TO THAT POSITION THROUGH

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.760
THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT. NEW
SPEAKER: HE DOES KNOW WHO HE

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.130
IS. LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPH OF
HIM SITTING ON THE BENCH. NOW

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.660
COME ON, IT'S AN AMAZING
INSIGHT, ISN'T IT? THERE IS

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.430
SUCH A KEEN AWARENESS OF THE
ARTIST IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.660
WORK, OF THE WORK IN
RELATIONSHIP TO THE

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.200
ENVIRONMENT, THE ENVIRONMENT
IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE NAME OF

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.060
THAT MUSEUM. IT'S ALL THERE IN
THAT PHOTOGRAPH. IT IS A

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.630
FABULOUS PORTRAIT. IT'S RIGHT
OUT OF HOLLYWOOD! IT'S JUST A

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.930
MARVELOUS PORTRAIT AND THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. IT

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.360
JUST ALLOWS YOU TO UNDERSTAND
HOW HE MAKES THIS TRANSITION

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.130
FROM NOT KNOWING, FROM
BEGINNING TO FIND HIMSELF

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.500
THROUGH THE EXPLORATIONS OF
HIS STUDENT YEARS TO THE FINAL

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.400
REALIZATIONS OF WHERE HIS
ARTISTIC BENT IS AND TO THE

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.730
KNOWLEDGE THAT THE MAN IS
INSEPARABLE FROM THE WORK AND

00:05:39.730 --> 00:06:03.860
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE UNIFIED
TOGETHER FOR HISTORY. (MUSIC)

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.260
NEW SPEAKER: IN 1990, BAUSCH  and
LOMB BEGAN PLANNING A NEW

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.860
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS. BAUSCH
and  LOMB WANTED A BUILDING THAT

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.560
WOULD HONOR ITS 150-YEAR
PRESENCE IN THE CITY OF

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.630
ROCHESTER. NEW SPEAKER: IN
1992 THEY CALLED US UP AND

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.660
SAID THEY WERE READY TO GO AND
WANTED US TO MAKE A

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.000
PRESENTATION WHICH WE DID IN
ROCHESTER TO ALL THE

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.930
EXECUTIVES COMPETING WITH MOST
OF THE TOP FIRMS HERE IN THE

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:35.500
NORTHEAST AND THEY SELECTED
US. NARRATOR: CORPORATE

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.960
OFFICIALS CHALLENGED
ARCHITECTS TO CREATE A

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.800
WORLD-CLASS STRUCTURE; AN
URBAN PLACE WITH A SENSE OF

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.660
HISTORY AND PURPOSE FOR THE
FUTURE. THE SOLUTION WAS A

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.960
EUROPEAN STYLE COURTYARD WITH
A TRAFFIC CIRCLE SHOWCASING AN

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.660
IMPOSING ENTRANCE TO AN
IMPRESSIVE STONE TOWER. NEW

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.230
SPEAKER: SO WITHIN THIS
COURTYARD WE THEN HAD A WHOLE

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.630
PERFECT SETTING FOR A
BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ARTWORK.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.600
NEW SPEAKER: THE ART COMMITTEE
INTERVIEWED OVER A DOZEN

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.500
ARTISTS JUST FOR THAT SPACE,
FOR THE ELLIPSE OUTSIDE THE

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.600
BUILDING. WHAT WE REALLY
WANTED TO HAVE IN THAT SPACE

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.360
WAS SOMETHING THAT REALLY
SPOKE ABOUT BAUSCH  and  LOMB'S

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.630
BEGINNINGS AND WE FELT THAT
ALBERT PALEY WAS THE RIGHT

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.330
ARTIST BECAUSE HE'S A
WONDERFUL ARTIST BUT HE ALSO

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.660
UNDERSTANDS THE COMMUNITY AND
BAUSCH  and  LOMB. NEW SPEAKER:

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.560
OUR FIRST MEETING WITH ALBERT
WAS VERY EXCITING. HE HAS THIS

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.900
INSATIABLE APPETITE TO DESIGN
AS WE DO AS ARCHITECTS AND YOU

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.600
COULD SEE HE WAS JUST CHOMPING
AT THE BIT TO GET STARTED AND

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.400
REALLY GET INTO THIS PIECE.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.330
NEW SPEAKER: IN ORDER FOR THE
SCULPTURE TO REALLY WORK IT

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.130
HAS TO BE APPROPRIATE TO THE
SITE: THE SCALE, THE

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:55.060
PROPORTION, THE AMBIANCE OF
THE WORK, ANY TYPE OF SPECIFIC

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.860
SYMBOLISM ADDRESSING THE SITE.

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.400
NEW SPEAKER: WE TALKED A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW IT SHOULD

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.800
SOMEHOW REPRESENT THE HISTORY
OF BAUSCH  and  LOMB'S PRESENCE IN

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.430
THE CITY, IT SHOULD CONVEY THE
HERITAGE OF THE CITY IN SOME

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.330
FORM, IT SHOULD ALSO HAVE A
CELEBRATORY CHARACTER,

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.660
SOMETHING THAT IS REALLY
BURSTING WITH ENERGY AND

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.760
EXCITEMENT AND SOMETHING WHICH
SHOULD BE AT LEAST 40 FEET

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.030
HIGH. NEW SPEAKER: IN THINKING
ABOUT THE TIMELESS NATURE THAT

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.600
BAUSCH  and  LOMB WAS SEEKING FOR
IDENTITY WITH THE BUILDING, I

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.130
STARTED THINKING OF SYMBOLS OR
IMAGES THAT MIGHT CONVEY THAT

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.560
SENSE. NEW SPEAKER: THE
SYMBOLISM THAT HE HAD THOUGHT

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.300
THROUGH WAS WONDERFUL, THE
IDEA OF THE CEREMONIAL COLUMN,

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:52.030
WHICH WAS KIND OF FRAGMENTED,
DISJOINTED, AND THEN THE IDEA

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:57.300
OF THE RIVER SNEAKING THROUGH
AND FORMING A GATEWAY AND THEN

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.000
HE THREW THE RINGS AROUND THE
TOP THAT CONVEYED THE

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.600
CONTINUUM OF THE CORPORATION
AND ITS CONNECTION WITH THE

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.400
CITY AND THEN ULTIMATELY THIS
BURST OF RIBBONS WHICH OF

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:14.930
COURSE HE'S SO FAMOUS FOR AND
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT SO

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:27.630
EXCITING. NEW SPEAKER: ALBERT
PALEY MANAGES ONE OF THE

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.730
LARGEST STUDIOS IN AMERICA,
PERHAPS IN THE WORLD. SPREAD

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.630
OUT OVER 22,000 SQUARE FEET,
IT'S MORE LIKE A FACTORY THAN

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.360
ARTIST'S STUDIO. AT ANY GIVEN
TIME THE PALEY STUDIO EMPLOYS

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.330
UP TO 10 HIGHLY TRAINED
ARTISANS. BUT UNLIKE A FACTORY

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:49.300
WITH ASSEMBLY LINE PRODUCTS,
PALEY MAKES ART. NEW SPEAKER:

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.030
WE DO CLOSE TO 100 ART
PROPOSALS A YEAR, BUT IT'S NOT

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:58.360
JUST THE PROPOSALS THAT
HAPPEN. THERE'S CONTRACTED

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.630
WORK FOR PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS,
THERE'S CONTRACTED WORK FOR

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.360
MAJOR CORPORATIONS, THERE ARE
EXHIBITIONS, THERE ARE

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.660
PUBLICATIONS. ALBERT HAS HIS
FINGER IN SO MANY PIES AND

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.530
HE'S ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY
TRYING TO PRODUCE DECORATIVE

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:17.260
ARTS, ARCHITECTURAL METALWORK
AND SCULPTURE. HERE AT THE

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.900
STUDIO WE HAVE THOSE WHO WORK
IN THE OFFICE, THERE'S A

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.660
MANAGING DIRECTOR, AN
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT AND

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.830
AN ARCHIVIST. THEN ON THE
FLOOR WE HAVE THE SHOP MANAGER

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.760
AND THEN THE FOLKS WHO WORK ON
THE FLOOR WHO ACTUALLY MAKE

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.000
THE PIECES WITH ALBERT. ALBERT
KIND OF INTERACTS BETWEEN BOTH

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.200
THE OFFICE AND THE STUDIO BUT
THE THING THAT'S NEAT ABOUT

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.600
THIS PLACE IS THAT EVERYONE
CAN CROSS OVER INTO OTHER

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.500
JOBS. MOST PEOPLE HERE HAVE A
SPECIALTY THAT THEY'RE

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.900
PARTICULARLY GOOD AT BUT THEY
DON'T JUST TIE THEM TO THAT

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:57.300
PARTICULAR JOB AND IN A CRUNCH
SITUATION WHEN WE'RE SORT OF

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.760
BEHIND A DEADLINE, THE OFFICE
STAFF HAS BEEN KNOWN TO GO

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.960
DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND ASSIST
HELP FINISH A PIECE AND PACK

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.130
IT AND WRAP IT. NEW SPEAKER:
ONE OF THE BIG SUPPORT

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.660
FUNCTIONS HERE FOR ME AND
ALBERT AND FOR ALL OF US, WITH

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.000
THE SUBCONTRACTORS, THE CREW
ON THE FLOOR AND IN THE

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.330
OFFICE, WE ALL WORK AS A TEAM,
EVERYBODY. WE ALL DEPEND ON

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:23.830
EACH OTHER SO MANY TIMES
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WE'RE A

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.730
SMALL CREW; WE WORK WITH VERY
HEAVY, DANGEROUS THINGS AND WE

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.060
NEED THE SUPPORT OF ONE
ANOTHER IN ORDER TO JUST GET

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.130
THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT
GETTING HURT. I CAN'T SAY

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:42.730
ENOUGH ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT
WORK HERE AT THE STUDIO.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.660
NARRATOR: THE ARCHIVIST'S MANY
DUTIES INCLUDE UPDATING THE

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.930
GROWING PALEY RESUME,
CURRENTLY RUNNING AT 75 PAGES,

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.830
AND TRACKING THE PALEY
CATALOGUE, NOW NUMBERING MORE

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.330
THAN 10,000 OBJECTS. DAY IN
AND DAY OUT, PALEY IS

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:59.960
ENGROSSED IN THE ENTERPRISE
AND THE BUSINESS OF ART. IF

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.160
HE'S NOT PHYSICALLY ON THE
STUDIO FLOOR MAKING ART OR IN

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.300
THE OFFICE ON THE PHONE OR
ENGAGED IN A MEETING, HE'S ON

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.430
THE ROAD AND WHEN HE'S ON THE
ROAD, PALEY IS PLANNING,

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:14.000
SELLING AND INSTALLING HIS
ART. SOMETIMES HE RETURNS TO

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
VISIT AN INSTALLED WORK.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.630
PASSAGE IS IN ASHEVILLE, NORTH
CAROLINA. THE PIECE IS 37 FEET

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:27.500
HIGH, WEIGHS 20 TONS, AND
UNTIL THE BAUSCH  and  LOMB

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:33.260
COMMISSION, WAS PALEY'S
LARGEST STEEL SCULPTURE. PALEY

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.160
HAS RECEIVED MANY AWARDS FOR
HIS WORK AND LECTURES IN

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:45.660
AMERICA AND ABROAD. (APPLAUSE)
PALEY: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.730
WENT A LITTLE BIT OVER BUT
WITH SUCH A GREAT RESPONSE AND

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.100
A GREAT AUDIENCE, I'D LIKE TO
BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.100
QUESTIONS THAT ANY OF YOU
MIGHT HAVE. NEW SPEAKER: HOW

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.630
IS THE BAUSCH  and  LOMB PIECE
DOING AND ARE YOU HAPPY WITH

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.230
IT? PALEY: IT'S THE BEST THING
I EVER DID! (LAUGHTER AND

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:30.760
APPLAUSE)
(MUSIC) NARRATOR: ALBERT

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.060
RAYMOND PALEY, JUNIOR WAS BORN
IN PHILADELPHIA TO A WORKING

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.060
CLASS FAMILY WITH NO FORMAL
ART BACKGROUND, YET ART WAS

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.730
THE ONE THING THAT INTERESTED
HIM IN SCHOOL. TAKING A CHANCE

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.130
ON THE FUTURE, PALEY ENROLLED
AT THE TYLER SCHOOL OF ART OF

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:49.030
TEMPLE UNIVERSITY IN
PHILADELPHIA. NEW SPEAKER: HE

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.430
WAS JUST A NAME, JUST ANOTHER
YOUNG STUDENT AND ONLY AFTER

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:59.000
WORKING WITH HIM FOR A
SEMESTER DID I BECOME AWARE

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.030
THAT HE WAS UNIQUE AND HE HAS
DEMONSTRATED THAT UNIQUENESS

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:12.900
THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF HIS
CAREER. WHEN HE ENTERED MY

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:18.960
CLASS, I BELIEVE HE THOUGHT OF
HIMSELF AS A SCULPTOR AND HE

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.600
SURPRISED HIMSELF I THINK
ABOUT HOW EXCITED HE BECAME TO

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.660
MAKE JEWELRY AND HOW REWARDING
THAT WAS TO HIM AT THAT POINT

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:36.200
IN HIS LIFE. NARRATOR: AFTER
GRADATION, PALEY WAS TORN

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.330
BETWEEN SCULPTURE AND
GOLDSMITHING. HE YIELDED TO

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.200
THE PASSION OF METALWORKING
AND STAYED AT TYLER. NEW

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.760
SPEAKER: HE HAD NO INTEREST IN
JEWELRY PRIOR TO PICKING UP

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.760
THOSE TOOLS IN MY CLASSROOM
AND THEREFORE HE APPROACHED IT

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.130
IN A VERY FRESH AND INVENTIVE
MANNER. THE CONCEPTS WERE

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:01.300
FRESH; THE SCALE WAS
UNINHIBITED, THE

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:07.430
DIMENSIONALITY WAS IMPORTANT,
ALL OF THE SKILLS THAT HE

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:13.030
BROUGHT TO BEAR AS AN
EXCEPTIONAL YOUNG ARTIST WERE

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.930
BROUGHT TO BEAR WITHOUT HIS
BEING CONDITIONED BY THE

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.530
HISTORY OF BODY ADORNMENT.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.300
NARRATOR: IN THE LATE 1960'S,
PALEY'S WORK WAS AS

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:30.860
REVOLUTIONARY AS THE ERA IN
WHICH IT WAS MADE. HIS

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.960
JEWELRY, WITH A SENSE OF
SCULPTURE FOR THE FEMALE BODY,

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.600
WAS BOLD AND FRESH AND
RESONATED WITH THE SOCIAL

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.330
MOVEMENTS OF THE TIME. NEW
SPEAKER: MY WORK WAS

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.100
DEVELOPING AT THE SAME TIME
THAT HIS WAS AND I THINK WE

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.630
BOTH FOUND THAT TO BE VERY
STIMULATING. IT WAS A VERY

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.630
STIMULATING TIME IN
PHILADELPHIA, BESIDES. IT

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:56.800
AFFECTED ALBERT, IT AFFECTED
ME, AND IT AFFECTED EVERYONE

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.730
IN THE CRAFTS AT THAT TIME.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.460
NEW PEOPLE WERE COMING INTO
THE AREA AND THE CRAFTS

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:06.530
COMMUNITY WAS FORMING IN
PHILADELPHIA AND IT WAS A VERY

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.300
EXCITING TIME FOR ALL OF US.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.000
NEW SPEAKER: THE CRAFT WORLD
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY SPECIAL

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.700
SUBSET OF THE ART WORLD AND IT
HAS A VERY STRONG AFFECTION

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.260
FOR ITS OWN TRADITIONS SO WHEN
ALBERT PALEY BEGAN TO EXHIBIT

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.760
THESE PIECES OF JEWELRY, THERE
WAS A PRETTY STRONG REACTION

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.360
AGAINST THEM. THEY SEEMED
ALMOST TO BETRAY SOME OF THE

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.600
ACCEPTED CONVENTIONS OF THE
PAST. IT WAS AS IF HE WERE

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.360
SOMEHOW PROMOTING HIMSELF IN
TOO LARGE A WAY FOR THE FORMAT

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.760
HE HAD CHOSEN. I THINK IT WAS
NOT TERRIBLY POPULAR WITH A

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.330
LOT OF JEWELRY
TRADITIONALISTS. ON THE OTHER

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.760
HAND, THERE WAS AN EMERGING
NEW ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.330
CRAFTS. SOME OF THE IMPORTANT
DEALERS AT THE TIME RECOGNIZED

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.230
HIS GENIUS. I THINK OF SOMEONE
LIKE HELEN DRUTT IN

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.460
PHILADELPHIA WHO SAW VERY
CLEARLY THAT THIS WAS THE

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.300
BEGINNING OF A NEW DYNAMIC.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.900
NEW SPEAKER: THE REAL MOMENT
THAT I REMEMBER WAS WHEN I SAW

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.560
THE DOUBLE FIBULA DURING HIS
MFA EXHIBITION AT THE

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:10.130
PHILADELPHIA ART ALLIANCE. I
SEE IT TODAY AS VIVIDLY AS I

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:15.300
SAW IT THEN AND I REMEMBER
THAT PIECE AND WANTING THAT

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.330
PIECE AND EVENTUALLY I
ACQUIRED THAT PIECE. PALEY:

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.130
WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS
SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT;

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:27.160
SOMETHING THAT MADE A
STATEMENT AT A GIVEN POINT IN

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.430
TIME, THAT CREATED A
PERCEPTION OR AN UNDERSTANDING

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.830
ABOUT A REALITY THAT HADN'T
BEEN THERE BEFORE. SO ALL OF

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.900
THE WORK KIND OF POSTURED
ITSELF TOWARDS MORE OF A

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.730
SYMBOLIC CONTEXT AND BECAUSE
OF THAT THE PIECES HAD A

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:47.400
TENDENCY TO BE QUITE
ELABORATE, KIND OF

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.460
OVERSTATEMENTS, AND REALLY
TAKING ON THE PROBLEMS THAT

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.830
WERE BEING DEALT WITH AT THE
TIME. SO I TRIED TO TAKE THAT

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.060
TO THE EXTREME AND MAKE THE
MOST DRAMATIC STATEMENT AS

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:04.000
POSSIBLE. I'VE ALWAYS
GRAVITATED TOWARDS CHALLENGES

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:36.400
LIKE THAT. (MUSIC)
NEW SPEAKER: HOPE MACHLER, WHO

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.730
REPRESENTED LOUISE NEVELSON IN
PHILADELPHIA, CALLED ME ONE

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.500
DAY AND SAID THAT LOUISE WAS
GOING TO BE IN THE CITY AND

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.600
THEY WERE GOING TO BE HAVING
LUNCH AT THE BARCLAY AND WOULD

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.430
I LIKE TO COME AND JOIN THEM
AND WEAR AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.830
JEWELRY; "WHY DON'T YOU WEAR A
PALEY?" AND I SELECTED THE

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.060
DELRIN NECKLACE, WHICH HAS THE
DELRIN BEADS AND THE LARGE,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:02.930
ROUND DELRIN DISK WITH THIS
HUGE COPPER FORGED ELEMENT

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.600
THAT COMES OUT OF IT, ALMOST
LIKE AN ELEPHANT TRUNK. I

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:10.230
REMEMBER WALKING INTO THE
BARCLAY, BEING INTRODUCED TO

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:16.260
LOUISE NEVELSON AND SHE JUST
BECAME TOTALLY SILENT. I MEAN

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.030
SHE WAS REALLY UPSET THAT THE
WORK THAT I HAD ON WAS A

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:26.960
CHALLENGING WORK OF ART AND
THERE COULD NOT BE ANY OTHER

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:34.130
OBJECT THAT COULD HAVE THAT
KIND OF DOMINANT VISIBILITY.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.300
NARRATOR: IN 1969, PALEY AND
LECHTZIN BUILT A BLACKSMITH'S

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.460
SHOP IN LECHTZIN'S GARAGE TO
INVESTIGATE THE PLASTIC NATURE

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.760
OF METAL. UNLIKE COLD FORGING,
WHICH IS USED IN THE PRECIOUS

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.260
METALS OF JEWELRY, THE HOT
FORGING PROCESS OF IRON

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.060
FASCINATED PALEY. NEW SPEAKER:
AS I HAVE THE STORY ABOUT

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.700
ALBERT AND THE BOOKS ON
IRONWORK IN THE LIBRARY, AT

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.760
TYLER WHEN HE WAS STARTING
THERE, HE AND HIS PROFESSOR -

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.330
AS HE BECAME INCREASINGLY
INTERESTED IN WORKING ON A

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:04.530
LARGE SCALE - WENT TO CHECK
OUT WHAT MATERIAL THERE WAS

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:08.100
AND THEY FOUND SOME EXTREMELY
ANCIENT BOOKS WHICH WENT BACK

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.900
TO THE ARTS AND CRAFTS
REVIVAL, NONE OF WHICH HAD

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:16.100
ACTUALLY BEEN BORROWED SINCE
1912. NEW SPEAKER: THERE WAS A

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.700
WHOLE TIME WARP THAT HAPPENED
THERE BUT ALSO WE WERE BOTH

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.960
VERY, VERY DRAWN TO IT BECAUSE
OF THIS WHOLE THING OF

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.830
INVESTIGATION IN PLASTICITY,
YET THE VALUE CONSTRUCT OR THE

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.030
SOCIAL CONTEXT WAS TOTALLY
DIFFERENT. SO THE QUESTION WAS

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:36.860
HOW CAN YOU BRING THIS KIND OF
ARCHAIC FORM VOCABULARY AND

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.930
PROCESS INTO A CONTEMPORARY
SENSIBILITY. NEW SPEAKER:

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.560
ALBERT HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF
COMING ALONG AT A POINT WHERE

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:51.130
HIS DISCIPLINE WAS EVOLVING
AND WAS BEING DEFINED AND HE

00:20:51.130 --> 00:21:04.330
IS ONE MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO
COMPLETING THAT DEFINITION.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.860
NEW SPEAKER: HE DID BELONG TO
PRECISELY THE RIGHT

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:14.430
GENERATION. TO SEIZE UPON, TO
RE-KNIT THE LINK BETWEEN THE

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:21.100
VERNACULAR AND THE ELITIST AND
TO MAKE SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:40.630
OUT OF IT. (MUSIC) NARRATOR:
GENESEE PASSAGE IS MADE

00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.900
ENTIRELY FROM STEEL PLATES,
FLAME CUT TO PALEY'S

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.760
SPECIFICATIONS WHEN FED INTO
THE TORCH CUTTING TABLE'S

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:54.260
COMPUTER. EACH PIECE IS COLD
FORMED BY STAFF OR

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.030
SUBCONTRACTORS, WELDED
TOGETHER AND GROUND TO A

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.900
SMOOTH FINISH. THE PLATES, IN
VARYING THICKNESS, ARE MADE

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.200
FROM WHAT'S CALLED "WEATHERING
STEEL" OR "CORE TEN", A COMMON

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:12.660
TRADE NAME AND ONE OF PALEY'S
FAVORITE METALS. NEW SPEAKER:

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.460
WITH WEATHERING STEEL IN THE
ALLOY, YOU HAVE COPPER AND

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.100
NICKEL SO WHAT HAPPENS IN THE
EARLIER PHASES, THE FIRST

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:24.260
COUPLE OF YEARS, YOU WILL HAVE
THE RUNOFF OF THE IRON OXIDE.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:28.260
THEN WHAT IS LEFT THEN IS A
VERY THIN RESIDUE OF COPPER

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:32.160
AND NICKEL, WHICH IS A
SELF-HEALING STEEL. NEW

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.630
SPEAKER: ONCE HE CAME UP WITH
THAT IDEA, ABSOLUTELY THE WAY

00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:41.330
TO GO AND OF COURSE WE THINK
OF ALBERT AS BEING AN ARTIST

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.700
BUT HE IS ALSO A PHENOMENAL
TECHNICIAN AND THE WORK THAT

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:50.860
WENT INTO FIRST OF ALL THE
STRUCTURE OF THIS PIECE, WHICH

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:55.700
IS NOT 40 FEET HIGH BUT 65
FEET HIGH, IS IN ITSELF A WORK

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.400
OF ART AND THERE'S A LOT OF
HIDDEN PLATES AND THINGS WHICH

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.330
YOU DON'T SEE IN THE ULTIMATE
SCULPTURE BUT ARE INTERNAL

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:07.230
WHICH KEEP THIS FROM BLOWING
OVER, BUT ALL OF THIS HAS TO

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:10.560
BE DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT
WATER CAN DRAIN THROUGH IT

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.130
BECAUSE CORE TEN STEEL WILL
CONTINUE TO RUST AND OXIDIZE

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.130
IF IT TRAPS WATER. NEW
SPEAKER: SO EVERY PLACE

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:20.700
THERE'S A SEAM IN THE METAL,
IT IS TOTALLY WELDED AND

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.800
TOTALLY GROUND. ANYPLACE THAT
MIGHT PUDDLE WATER IS ANGLED

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.530
SO THAT THE WATER WILL WASH
OFF. ALSO, IT HAS TO BE ABLE

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:33.030
TO BREATHE, SO THESE WHICH
APPEAR TO BE SOLID FORMS ARE

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.660
IN FACT HOLLOW AND THERE ARE
VENTS AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM SO

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.800
THAT THE AIR WITH THE HEATING
OF THE STEEL ON THE SURFACE

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.600
CREATES AN UPDRAFT SO THESE
BECOME ACTUALLY LIKE LARGE

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.730
CHIMNEYS THAT TOTALLY
VENTILATE THE PIECE TO TAKE

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:52.760
OUT WATER VAPOR. NEW SPEAKER:
ALBERT'S RECURRING NIGHTMARE

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.560
IS THAT A WELD BREAKS AND
SOMEBODY GETS HURT. USUALLY MY

00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.630
RECURRING NIGHTMARE IS THAT
THROUGH RIGGING, SOMETHING

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.830
TOPPLES OVER AND DURING TIMES
OF STRESS THAT DREAM POPS UP.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:09.660
ACCORDING TO MY WIFE, THAT
DREAM HAPPENS. WHEN SHE FINDS

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.660
ME UNDER THE BED PUSHING ON IT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:21.260
SHE KNOWS THAT I'M HAVING A
WORK DREAM. NARRATOR: PALEY

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.400
LEFT PHILADELPHIA IN 1969 TO
TAKE A TEACHING POSITION AT

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.030
THE ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF
TECHNOLOGY. HE CONTINUED TO

00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:29.430
MAKE JEWELRY AND IRONWORK.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.900
THREE YEARS LATER THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.060
INVITED HIM TO COMPETE FOR A
COMMISSION TO CREATE A PAIR OF

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.060
GATES FOR THE NEW RENWICK
MUSEUM. THE SMITHSONIAN WANTED

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.930
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO CRAFTS
AND THE DECORATIVE ARTS WITH

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:47.330
ITS FIRST MAJOR COMMISSION,
THE RENWICK GATES. NEW

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.730
SPEAKER: IN SELECTING ALBERT
PALEY, WHO DID NOT HAVE A

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:54.460
TRACK RECORD IN ARCHITECTURAL
WORK, WHO HAD A FINE TRADITION

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.360
AS A JEWELER BUT NOT IN THIS
LARGER FORMAT, IT CERTAINLY

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.700
WAS A BOLD DECISION. ON THE
OTHER HAND IT WAS BASED ON

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.460
DRAWINGS AND DESIGNS, IT WAS
BASED ON ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.800
HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT HE WOULD
DO A WONDERFUL PIECE. I GUESS

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.500
I LIKEN IT A LITTLE BIT TO THE
DECISION THAT WAS MADE TO GIVE

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.460
THE COMPETITION FOR THE
VIETNAM MEMORIAL TO MIA LIN,

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.300
WHO AGAIN HAD NO TRACK RECORD,
NO REAL EXPERIENCE, BUT ENOUGH

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.960
IN HER SUBMISSION TO SHOW THAT
SHE WAS READY FOR THE

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.460
CHALLENGE. NEW SPEAKER: SO I
DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF A RISK

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:34.300
THE PEOPLE WHO GRANTED THE
COMMISSION BUT THEY CERTAINLY

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.130
DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET THE
POWERHOUSE THAT THEY GOT. THE

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:45.260
PORTAL GATES FOR THE RENWICK
ARE A DEFINITE STAGE OF THE

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:50.060
DEVELOPMENT OF ARCHITECTURAL
IRONWORK IN THE WESTERN

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:57.560
TRADITION. THEY SUM UP A LOT
OF THE IDEAS THAT WERE

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.430
EXPRESSED IN EARLIER WORKS AND
WHICH ALBERT KNOWS, EITHER

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.630
FROM REPRODUCTION OR FIRST
HAND BECAUSE THESE PIECES ARE

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.960
QUITE FAMOUS. ALBERT TRIES IN
THE PORTAL GATES TO NOT ONLY

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:15.830
ADAPT IDEAS - THE DECORATIVE
SCROLLS, THE SENSE OF VARYING

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.130
THE SIZE OF THE SCROLLS, THE
ENERGY AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:25.200
SCROLLS, THIS LACINESS WHICH
IS TRANSFORMED INTO A MORE

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:32.100
MUSCULAR KIND OF DECORATION -
TO MOVE BEYOND THE IDEAS THAT

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:35.660
WERE EMBODIEDIN SOME OF THESE
EARLIER WORKS, SUCH AS THE

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.260
DOORS FOR THE CHATEAU DE
MAISON IN THE 17TH CENTURY,

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.230
WHICH ARE IN THE LOUVRE. SO IT
REPRESENTS A POINT OF

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.800
DEPARTURE A STAGE FOR HIM TO
THEN DEPART FOR HIS LATER

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.900
WORK. I THINK IT'S MORE
IMPORTANT TO SEE IT THAT WAY

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.200
THAN AS AN ENDING; IT'S REALLY
A BEGINNING FOR HIM, EVEN

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.830
THOUGH IT'S A FINISHED
STATEMENT AND IT'S A VERY

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.500
ELABORATE FINISHED STATEMENT -
IT INCORPORATES SEVERAL

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.630
METALS, IT'S WAVY, IT'S WILD
BUT IT'S A CONTROLLED ENERGY,

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.900
IT'S A CONTROLLED WILDNESS OF
SOMETHING WHICH ALL THE

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.930
BLACKSMITHS HAD TO DEAL WITH,
WHETHER THEY WERE WORKING IN

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:14.860
THE 12TH CENTURY OR THE EARLY
20TH CENTURY. NEW SPEAKER: IT

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.260
DEMONSTRATED THAT HE WAS
CAPABLE OF MAKING WORK ON A

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.900
LARGE SCALE OF THE HIGHEST
QUALITY AND IT DEMONSTRATED

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.200
THIS IN A PARTICULARLY
SENSITIVE SITE, THAT IS IN A

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.260
WELL ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT
INSTITUTION EASILY AVAILABLE

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:34.430
TO THE PUBLIC IN THE NATION'S
CAPITAL. SUDDENLY HERE WAS

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:39.730
THIS GUY, HARDLY KNOWN, WHO
GETS UP THIS MONUMENTAL THING

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:48.500
AND EVERYBODY IS FORCED TO
AGREE THAT EVEN IF YOU LOOK

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.130
AROUND YOU, WHETHER YOU LIKED
IT OR NOT, THE QUALITY OF THE

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.860
WORKMANSHIP IS FULLY EQUAL TO
ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.860
PRODUCED IN AMERICA IN THE
PAST AND IN MANY WAYS SHOWS A

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:07.060
MORE INVENTIVE APPROACH TO A
TRADITIONAL MATERIAL. BUT IT

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:15.060
WAS SO FULL OF ENERGY, SO FULL
OF LIFE, SO TO SPEAK, THAT

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.130
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN VIOLENTLY
OPPOSED TO ORNAMENT SUDDENLY

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.400
FOUND THEIR RESISTANCE
CRUMBLING, THAT IT SUDDENLY

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.160
SEEMED THAT IT WOULD BE
POSSIBLE TO INVENT A

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.160
VOCABULARY OF ORNAMENT FOR THE
SECOND HALF OF THE 20TH

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.600
CENTURY. NARRATOR: THE RENWICK
GATES TOOK PALEY A YEAR TO

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.860
CREATE. FABRICATING THE GATES
MEANT EXPANDING HIS STUDIO,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.200
PURCHASING NEW EQUIPMENT AND
HIRING HIS FIRST EMPLOYEE.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:43.960
SHORTLY BEFORE THE GATES WERE
COMPLETED, WHILE MOTORCYCLING

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.830
HOME FOR THE EVENING, PALEY
HAD A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. PALEY:

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:51.760
I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE OF THE
INTERNAL INJURIES I WAS GOING

00:28:51.760 --> 00:29:00.360
TO DIE. AND UH, RIGHT AFTER I
WAS TOLD THAT MY APPRENTICE

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:07.530
WAS THERE AND IT WAS QUITE AN
EMOTIONAL TIME AND THE REALITY

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:11.560
THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING, THAT
LIFE AS I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.900
BE GONE, AND I HAD X AMOUNT OF
TIME AND WHAT WAS I GOING TO

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.630
DO WITH IT? THE THING THAT WAS
CONSTANTLY ON MY MIND WAS TO

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:22.400
FINISH THE GATES. SO I HAD
RICHARD PALMER, WHO WAS MY

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:30.260
ASSISTANT AT THE TIME, GET ME
A SKETCHBOOK AND I JUST

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.230
CONTINUED TO DRAW DETAILS OF
THE RESOLUTION OF THE GATES

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:37.600
AND SO IF I WERE TO DIE THIS
WOULD BE THE RESOLUTION OF

00:29:37.600 --> 00:30:03.930
THAT. (MUSIC) NARRATOR: DURING
THE AMERICAN CRAFT REVIVAL OF

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.260
THE 1970'S AND 80'S, ALBERT
PALEY BECAME THE LEADING

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.160
SCULPTOR OF METAL. WITH A
CONSTANT NEED FOR NEW

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.560
CHALLENGES, PALEY TURNED TO
THE DECORATIVE ARTS. LIKE HIS

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.400
EARLIER WORK, PALEY'S
FURNITURE IS IN AN EMOTIONAL

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:24.660
RESPONSE TO ORGANIC FORM. NEW
SPEAKER: I FIRST KNEW ALBERT

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:28.200
PALEY'S WORK WHEN I WAS A
CURATOR OF DECORATIVE ARTS AT

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:32.560
THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM AND I
WAS DEALING WITH THE FORMULAS

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:40.160
OF CHAIRS, TABLES, HARDWARE AS
THEY HAD BEEN EXPRESSED

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.330
THROUGH THE CENTURIES. WELL I
FOUND ALBERT'S WORK IN THE

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:48.830
SO-CALLED "DECORATIVE ARTS",
TO BE THE PERFECT COUNTERPART

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:53.160
TO THESE PREDECESSORS. WORK OF
INCREDIBLE AESTHETIC POWER

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:58.300
THAT ALSO FUNCTIONS. A TABLE
YOU CAN USE BUT WHICH ALSO

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:03.830
MAKES A VISUAL AND TACTILE
IMPRESSION ON YOU THAT YOU

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:09.660
NEVER FORGET. SO YOU HAVE USED
IT BUT IT HAS IMPRESSED ITSELF

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:21.530
ON YOU AS AN ENTITY. THAT IS A
WORK OF DECORATIVE ARTS.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:25.430
ALBERT'S WORK IN SUCH
FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS CAN BE

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:31.130
SENSATIONAL. HE CREATED A
CONFERENCE TABLE THAT IF YOU

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:35.530
EVER SAT AT IN THE CONFERENCE
CIRCUMSTANCE, YOU WOULD BE

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:41.900
FOREVER CARRYING THE IMAGE AND
THE MOMENT WITH YOU. IT WAS A

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:47.260
HUGE CIRCLE OF GLASS, SLICED
BY JAGGED STEEL. IF YOU COULD

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:52.560
WORK IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, IF
YOU COULD HOLD YOUR OWN IN

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:56.860
THAT CONFERENCE, YOU WERE MADE
OF SOMETHING, SOMETHING

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:01.260
SPECIAL - THE "RIGHT STUFF"
AND THE CONFERENCE WOULD HAVE

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.100
BEEN DEFINED BY THAT TABLE.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.200
THE CALIBER OF WHAT WENT ON IN
THE ENVIRONMENT WOULD HAVE

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.060
CORRESPONDED, WOULD HAVE HAD
TO CORRESPOND, TO THIS WORK OF

00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:15.860
ART. THAT TO ME IS MAJOR
ACCOMPLISHMENT. NEW SPEAKER: I

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.760
THINK WHEN WE SIT DOWN AND
TALK ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.560
EXHIBITION AND THE THEME OF
THE EXHIBITION, THIS WILL ALL

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.330
FALL INTO PLACE. NARRATOR:
CRITICS AND CONNOISSEURS OFTEN

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:27.100
COMPARE PALEY'S WORK TO THE
ART NOUVEAU PERIOD OF THE

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.760
1920'S. REFUSING TO ENGAGE IN
THE DIALOGUE, PALEY HIMSELF

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:34.330
AVOIDS QUESTIONS ABOUT
CATEGORIZATION, INCLUDING THE

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.860
OLD ARGUMENT OF ART VERSUS
CRAFT. PALEY: IT JUST

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.200
REINFORCES ALL THAT
CATEGORIZATION. I THINK IT

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:45.600
OBSCURES WHAT THE REAL ISSUES
ARE. NEW SPEAKER: SAN

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.400
FRANCISCO, A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AGO, ARTISTS DESIGNING

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.460
MENORAHS, SO THIS IS THE
MENORAH I DESIGNED. NEW

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.630
SPEAKER: THIS IS THE DRAWING
OF IT THERE AS WELL. NEW

00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.430
SPEAKER: IF YOU LOOK AT HIS
WORK, THE THING THAT IS SO

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:04.130
AMAZING ABOUT IT IS THAT THERE
IS THIS THREAD; YOU KNOW IT'S

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:07.200
HIS WORK. ONE PIECE LEADS TO
ANOTHER. YOU CAN SEE - YOU

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:12.200
LOOK AT A PIECE AND YOU KNOW
THAT IT'S HIS. PALEY: THESE

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.100
ARE SOME WRITING TABLES THAT
I'M DESIGNING. THIS IS GOING

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:24.900
TO BE ALL STAINED AND METALLIC
DUST RUBBED INTO THE GRAIN AND

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.530
THEN VARNISHED. NEW SPEAKER:
HIS WORK IS INTIMATELY

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:32.500
ORIGINAL. IT'S ORIGINAL IN
THAT IT IS SO INTIMATELY HIM.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:35.130
PALEY: I PHYSICALLY WORK DOWN
HERE WITH THE GUYS ALL THE

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:39.530
TIME; I'M JUST DRESSED UP FOR
YOU. NEW SPEAKER: WE

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:40.730
APPRECIATE THAT (LAUGHING).

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.330
NEW SPEAKER: HE'S ALWAYS
WORKED ON THINGS THAT HAVE AN

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:46.030
INTIMATE INTEREST TO HIM SO IN
THAT THEY ARE ORIGINAL BECAUSE

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.930
HE ISN'T AFFECTED BY CURRENT
THINGS. IT JUST DOESN'T

00:33:49.930 --> 00:34:00.500
HAPPEN. HE'S ON HIS OWN
WAVELENGTH AND HE STAYS ON IT.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.030
NEW SPEAKER: WHAT IS
PARTICULAR TO ALBERT PALEY'S

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:07.330
ARTISTRY IS A LYRICISM THAT
COMES OUT OF THE MAN HIMSELF.

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:16.030
HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING
CONCEIVABLE TO COUNTERACT THAT

00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:22.160
LYRICISM, SEEKING A CHALLENGE,
HARDER AND HARDER EACH TIME,

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:28.900
IN THE FORM OF MATERIALS,
TECHNIQUES, SILVER IS PLAINT,

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:36.560
GOLD MORE SO, WAS ALL TOO EASY
TO CREATE HIS WORKS OF ART. SO

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.360
HE TURNED TO THE MOST
RESISTANT METAL THERE IS -

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.760
CORE TEN STEEL AND THE STEEL
FOUGHT HIM AND HE FOUGHT BACK

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.760
AND OF COURSE THE LYRICISM
WON. HE ENDED UP TURNING STEEL

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.300
INTO WAVES AND WATERY EDDIES.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.630
SO THEN HE GOT HIMSELF AN
ELEVATOR MOTOR AND STARTED

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:01.660
TWISTING THE STEEL SO IT
COULDN'T FLOW, TYING IT,

00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:06.400
BALLING IT UP - AND WHAT
HAPPENED? HIS LYRICISM MADE

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.330
THAT BALLED UP TWISTED STEEL
TURN INTO ORGANIC VINES

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:16.560
TRIUMPHING OVER EACH OBSTACLE,
WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH IN A

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.300
KIND OF INNER LIFE TO COME
BACK TO LYRICISM. HE CAN'T

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:31.760
DEFEAT IT; HE GOES AFTER SIZE,
HE GOES AFTER RESISTANCE, BUT

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:36.330
IT'S THE STRUGGLE THAT MAKES
THE GREATNESS. THAT'S THE

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:42.100
POWER OF PALEY'S WORK IS THE
CHALLENGES HE CHOOSES, THE

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:46.500
BATTLES THAT HE SETS OUT FOR
HIMSELF AND IT'S ALWAYS HIS

00:35:46.500 --> 00:36:07.060
POETRY THAT WINS. (MUSIC)
NARRATOR: WHEN BAUSCH  and  LOMB

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.500
ASKED PALEY TO SUBMIT A
PROPOSAL FOR A WORK OF

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.430
SCULPTURE TO ENHANCE ITS NEW
BUILDING, GENESEE PASSAGE WAS

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.000
HIS SECOND DESIGN, NOT THE
FIRST. THE FIRST CONCEPT,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.700
MIRAGE, WAS REJECTED. NEW
SPEAKER: THE FIRST PROPOSAL

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.400
WAS A SATIN STAINLESS STEEL
SCULPTURE THAT WAS GOING TO BE

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:28.500
ABOUT 75 FEET TALL THAT DEALT
WITH A VERY KIND OF RORSCHACH

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.400
SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY AND
THE SURFACES WERE DESIGNED AS

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.630
SUCH THAT LIGHT WOULD REFLECT
OFF OF THE SURFACE. FOR MANY

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:46.500
REASONS THEY FELT THAT THAT
SCULPTURE WAS NOT APPROPRIATE

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:52.230
TO THE CORPORATE AMBIANCE OF
BAUSCH  and  LOMB. NEW SPEAKER: WE

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.700
DIDN'T LIKE THAT ONE AT ALL.

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:59.360
IT WAS TOO COLD AND STERILE
AND IT JUST DIDN'T APPEAL TO

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.500
ANYONE. PALEY: THEY WANTED
SOMETHING THAT HAD MORE OF A

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.800
TIMELESS QUALITY ABOUT IT;
SOMETHING THAT SPOKE OF THE

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.100
CONTINUANCE OF BAUSCH  and  LOMB
IN TIME AND THEY FELT THAT

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:16.300
THIS STATEMENT WAS FOR A
BETTER WAY TO SAY IT, KIND OF

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:21.600
TOO CONTEMPORARY FOR THE IMAGE
THAT THEY SOUGHT. NEW SPEAKER:

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.200
IT HAPPENS, BUT IT'S STILL
GOING TO LOOK LIKE A PALEY.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:31.800
NEW SPEAKER: THE ACTUAL PIECE
IN THE SENSE OF THE PROGRESS

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.130
OF ALBERT'S WORK IS MORE
ADVANCED THAN THE BAUSCH  and

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:39.330
LOMB PIECE. IT'S MUCH MORE
CLEARLY THE DIRECTION HE'S

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:44.030
MOVING TOWARDS RATHER THAN THE
THING HE'S MOVING AWAY FROM.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.900
NARRATOR: NEVER A STRANGER TO
CONTROVERSY, PALEY'S PREVIOUS

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.360
WORK PASSAGE, IN ASHEVILLE,
NORTH CAROLINA, GENERATED

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.860
CRITICISM, CONTENTION AND
CONFLICT. PASSAGE WAS A

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.600
FEDERAL COMMISSION AND ITS
INSTALLATION AROUSED THE

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.900
AESTHETIC LIONS. NEW SPEAKER:
THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:06.160
THE PIECE WAS BASED MOSTLY IN
MISUNDERSTANDING. MOST PEOPLE

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:11.400
DID NOT KNOW WHAT SCULPTURE
WAS FOR AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.360
PUBLIC SCULPTURE WAS FOR.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:15.730
THERE WAS A LOT OF TO-DO ABOUT
HOW MUCH IT COST AND WHY IT

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:18.200
DIDN'T LOOK MORE LIKE A GUY ON
A HORSE. NEW SPEAKER: I THINK

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.260
IT'S GOOD FOR ASHEVILLE TO
HAVE A CONTROVERSY BECAUSE IT

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.800
RAISES THE AWARENESS OF ART.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:39:16.460
(MUSIC)
NARRATOR: IN THE FALL

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:19.700
OF 1995, BAUSCH  and  LOMB
OFFICIALLY OPENED THE DOORS TO

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:23.130
ITS NEW HEADQUARTERS. THE
MEDIA AND THE PUBLIC WERE

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.260
INVITED TO VIEW THE BUILDING
AND THE MANY WORKS OF ART

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:34.360
PURCHASED OR COMMISSIONED BY
THE COMPANY. (APPLAUSE) ABSENT

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.230
FROM THE BUILDING EXTERIOR
HOWEVER, WAS GENESEE PASSAGE.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.130
NEW SPEAKER: COMING THIS
SPRING, ALBERT PALEY WILL BE

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.860
INSTALLING HIS PUBLIC
SCULPTURE IN THE CIRCULAR

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:50.660
DRIVEWAY ADDING ARCHITECTURAL
VITALITY TO ROCHESTER'S URBAN

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:55.430
LANDSCAPE. ALBERT? NARRATOR:
NEARLY THREE YEARS INTO THE

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.530
PROCESS, THE SCULPTURE WAS
SERIOUSLY BEHIND SCHEDULE. IT

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:03.100
WOULD BE ANOTHER YEAR BEFORE
PALEY COMPLETED AND INSTALLED

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:12.000
GENESEE PASSAGE. IT WAS THE
FABRICATION OF THE SCULPTURE'S

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.430
MASSIVE ELEMENTS THAT TOOK SO
LONG TO COMPLETE. THESE WERE

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:19.830
THE SPLIT COLUMN PIECES, THE
RINGS AND THE LONG, WAVE-LIKE

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:26.530
FORMS CALLED "THE BACON
STRIPS" BY PALEY'S STAFF. THE

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.460
SQUAT, COUNTERPOINT PIECE TO
THE SOARING VERTICAL FORMS

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:33.960
KNOWN AS "THE DEBR", ALSO
REQUIRED METICULOUS WORK.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:44.930
(FACTORY SOUNDS-LOUDSPEAKER)
PALEY: THE FINAL RESOLUTION

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:48.500
WAS THAT WE WOULD DO THE
SCULPTURE IN MODULAR SECTIONS;

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.460
DO WHAT WE COULD IN HOUSE HERE
AND THEN THOSE SECTIONS WERE

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.730
THEN SHIPPED TO ANOTHER SITE
WHERE WE LEASED INDUSTRIAL

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:00.100
SPACE AND THEN FABRICATED THE
TOTAL UNIT. THIS IS PRETTY

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.230
MUCH THE ORIENTATION WE HAVE
NOW, IT'S JUST LYING DOWN.

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:07.430
NARRATOR: THE FINAL DIFFICULT
ASSEMBLY OF THE SCULPTURE WAS

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.430
OVERSEEN BY PALEY'S ENGINEER
TO INSURE ITS STRUCTURAL

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:15.000
INTEGRITY. PALEY: THE HOOPS,
AS YOU'LL RECALL, ARE GOING TO

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.100
NESTLE IN LIKE THAT SO YOU'LL
HAVE A TWO-POINT CONTACT.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.730
NARRATOR: THE TASK BECAME
CRITICAL WHEN PALEY DISCOVERED

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.130
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSEMBLE
THE SCULPTURE IN A VERTICAL

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:28.000
POSITION. HE WAS FORCED TO
CREATE THE 40-TON,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.360
THREE-DIMENSIONAL VERTICAL
STEEL SCULPTURE WHILE IT WAS

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:36.230
LYING DOWN. PALEY DIDN'T KNOW
IF HIS AESTHETIC VISION WOULD

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.830
BE REALIZED UNTIL THE
SCULPTURE WAS ACTUALLY

00:41:39.830 --> 00:42:00.960
INSTALLED. AS THE AMERICAN
ECONOMY BOOMED IN THE 1980'S,

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.460
ARCHITECTS OF MEANS TURNED TO
ORNAMENT. LONG OUT OF FASHION,

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:08.100
THE DECORATIVE ELEMENT WAS
ONCE AGAIN IN VOGUE AND

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.800
ARTIST/CRAFTSMAN ALBERT PALEY
WAS ONCE AGAIN IN THE RIGHT

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:16.230
PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. AS
WITH HIS FURNITURE, DEMAND FOR

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:38.860
HIS ARCHITECTURAL METALWORK
INCREASED. BY 1995, PALEY HAD

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.030
BECOME THE FIRST METAL
SCULPTOR IN THE HISTORY OF THE

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.530
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF
ARCHITECTS TO RECEIVE

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.830
INSTITUTE HONORS. NEW SPEAKER:
THE PLEASURE IN WORKING WITH

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:52.630
ALBERT IS THROUGH HIS
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:55.760
RELATIONSHIP OF ART AND
ARCHITECTURE. ALBERT HAS THE

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.730
ABILITY TO MAKE SOMETHING THAT
IS IN FACT INTEGRAL; IT LOOKS

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:05.030
LIKE IT BELONGS THERE. HOW
DOES HE DO THAT? HE DOES THAT

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.730
BECAUSE HE HAS A SENSE OF WHAT
THE ARCHITECT IS DOING SO HE

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.860
HAS A GREAT UNDERSTANDING OF
WHAT ARCHITECTURE IS ABOUT AND

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.100
IT'S SPACE, IT'S FORM, IT'S
MATERIALS, IT'S ALL OF THOSE

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:18.060
THINGS COMBINED. HE'S LOOKED
AT ENOUGH BUILDINGS TO KNOW

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.130
HOW YOU MAKE THEM - WHAT'S
GENUINE OR AUTHENTIC ABOUT

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:25.230
THEM. I MET ALBERT BECAUSE OF
HIS PATIENCE AND MINE. WE WERE

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.860
BOTH SITTING ON THE SAME BENCH
WAITING TO GO SEE THE SAME

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.460
GROUP OF PEOPLE. IT WAS THE
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.160
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.930
ALBERT HAD WON A COMPETITION
TO DESIGN SOME TREE GRATES

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:42.130
THAT WERE GOING TO BE USED
ALONG PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE. I

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:44.700
HAD WON THE COMPETITION FOR
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.860
WILLARD HOTEL SO SITTING NEXT
TO ALBERT I COULDN'T HELP BUT

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:51.800
SAY HELLO AND I SAID, "WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?" HE SHOWED

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.960
ME HIS TREE GRATES AND I
SHOWED HIM MY WILLARD HOTEL

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:58.130
AND THAT'S HOW OUR
CONVERSATIONS BEGAN. THIS WAS

00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:04.130
PROBABLY 20 YEARS AGO. I THINK
ARTISTS TODAY ARE IN A

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:07.660
DIFFICULT POSITION. THEY ARE
THE LAST TO BE INVITED TO THE

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.760
TABLE AND YOU NEED TO BE OF A
SPECIAL TEMPERAMENT AND

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.400
INTELLIGENCE TO BE ABLE TO
COME IN AT THAT LATE STAGE,

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.200
UNDERSTAND THE GIVENS OF THE
SITUATION AND THEN PRODUCE

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.830
SOMETHING THAT IS MEANINGFUL.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:23.900
I THINK TOO FREQUENTLY WE SEE
THE RESULTS OF THAT AND

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:28.600
SOMETIMES THEY AREN'T
SATISFACTORY BUT IT'S ALBERT'S

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.100
DISPOSITION AND INTELLIGENCE
THAT ALLOW HIM TO COME IN LATE

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.560
IN THE PROJECT, STILL GET THE
SPIRIT OF IT AND BRING HIS OWN

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:48.460
ART AND CRAFT IN MAKING A
MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTION.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:50.930
NARRATOR: PALEY'S MOST
IMPRESSIVE COMMISSION OF THE

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.960
LATE 1980'S ARE HIS EIGHT
SCULPTURES FOR THE WORTHAM

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.500
THEATER CENTER IN HOUSTON,
TEXAS. HIS OBJECTIVE WAS TO

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.630
MAKE A CEREMONIAL STATEMENT
THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT THE

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.160
CENTER'S GRAND STAIRCASE.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:05.430
PALEY'S SOLUTION BECAME FOUR
PAIRS OF SCULPTURES, EACH

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:08.700
RISING HIGHER IN STATURE AND
ELABORATION AS PATRONS ASCEND

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:13.600
A LONG ESCALATOR. NEW SPEAKER:
THE WORTHAM SCULPTURES ARE A

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.630
MAJOR WORK IN PALEY'S CAREER.

00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:21.600
MY FEELING FROM THE PICTURES
I'VE SEEN IS THAT QUITE SIMPLY

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.900
HE DOES WHAT YOU WANT A
THEATER TO DO. THAT GOING TO A

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.860
THEATER IS BOTH A FESTIVE AND
IN A WAY A CEREMONIAL OCCASION

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:33.800
AND THESE OBJECTS GOING UP
ACTUALLY ARE CEREMONIOUS AS

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:44.960
WELL AS FESTIVE, THAT THEY
MAKE ENTERING INTO THE THEATER

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.530
A MATTER OF EVERYBODY TURNS
INTO HIS OR HER OWN

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:55.160
PROCESSION, SO TO SPEAK. THAT
SURELY IS A WONDERFUL TROPE;

00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:01.300
IT'S A VERY CLEVER
METAPHORICAL IDEA. I DON'T

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:04.130
THINK THAT THESE FLAMBEAUS
EXIST AS INDIVIDUAL BITS OF

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:06.760
SCULPTURE. I THINK THAT THEY
HAVE TO BE SEEN AS A SERIES

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.300
AND THEY HAVE TO BE SEEN IN
CONJUNCTION WITH THE

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:28.200
ARCHITECTURE. (MUSIC) THE ROAD
OF A PUBLIC SCULPTOR, WHICH IS

00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.300
WHAT PALEY HAS BECOME, IS A
PECULIARLY THORNY ONE. I THINK

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.630
THE HISTORY OF HIS COMMISSIONS
IS A VERY INTERESTING HISTORY

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:40.730
OF THE DEBATE WITHIN THE
UNITED STATES ABOUT WHAT THE

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.700
NATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE AND
THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:50.130
IN THE MANNER OF OUR TIMES,
THESE MONUMENTS ARE

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:54.200
NON-SPECIFIC. NEW SPEAKER:
ALBERT'S INTENT I DON'T THINK

00:46:54.200 --> 00:47:03.460
IS TO CHALLENGE, THROUGH HUMOR
OR THROUGH AGGRESSION. ALBERT

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:08.000
COMES OUT OF A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT DESIGN WORLD. HE'S

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:17.230
MORE I THINK INVOLVED IN
CREATING SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:24.160
FOR A SPACE. THE PUBLIC IS NOT
JARRED BY IT; MOST COMMENTS

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:28.260
ARE THAT IT'S QUITE BEAUTIFUL.

00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:37.300
HE HAS A TREMENDOUS SENSE OF
SCALE, OF MATERIAL, OF

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:46.000
APPROPRIATENESS, HIS WORK IS
METICULOUS AND THAT GOES BACK

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.330
I THINK TO HIS JEWELRY MAKING.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:55.000
NO MATTER WHAT SCALE IT'S IN,
IT IS METICULOUSLY CONCEIVED

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.530
AND METICULOUSLY EXECUTED. HE
IS TOTALLY INVOLVED IN ITS

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:03.200
PLACEMENT, ITS SITING, ITS
LIGHTING, EVERYTHING TO DO

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:11.830
WITH THE WORK. IT IS A LARGE
JEWEL. NEW SPEAKER: PRAY TO

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:24.500
THE PHOTON GODS. ALBERT LIKES
TO STIR THINGS UP. I THINK

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.230
ALBERT WOULD LIKE YOU TO HATE
A PIECE OR DISLIKE A PIECE

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.130
INTENSELY THAN TO BE
INDIFFERENT TO IT AND I THINK

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:39.800
HE LIKES TO CHALLENGE PEOPLE'S
THINKING. IF IT'S A FUNCTIONAL

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:46.300
PIECE OF FURNITURE, FOR
EXAMPLE, THEN IT CAN ALSO BE A

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.360
BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART AT THE
SAME TIME. I THINK HE LIKES

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:57.230
CHALLENGING PEOPLE AS PART OF
WHAT HE CREATES FOR THE LARGE

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.860
PUBLIC SPACES. I THINK HE
WANTS PEOPLE TO REACT TO IT,

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.730
TO RESPOND TO IT, TO STOP AND
LOOK AT IT AND TO THINK ABOUT

00:49:05.730 --> 00:49:10.230
IT. I THINK HE LIKES TO STIR
THINGS UP AND HIMSELF ALSO. I

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:14.530
THINK WHEN THINGS GET
COMPLACENT, I THINK HE LIKES

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.860
TO CHALLENGE IT AND BREAK THE
MOLD A LITTLE BIT. I'VE SEEN

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:34.700
HIM DO IT A NUMBER OF TIMES
AND HE'S DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.260
NARRATOR: THE MOST RECENT OF
PALEY'S PUBLIC SCULPTURES ARE

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.430
A SERIES OF MUSEUM PIECES
FIRST CREATED FOR THE TOLEDO

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:43.260
MUSEUM OF ART, FOLLOWED BY A
ONE-MAN EXHIBITION FOR THE

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:47.600
MUSEUM OF ART AT BRIGHAM YOUNG
UNIVERSITY. UNLIKE PALEY'S

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.960
EARLIER SCULPTURE WORK, THESE
PIECES CELEBRATE ASPECTS OF

00:49:50.960 --> 00:50:02.760
CLASSICAL IMAGES. THE MOST
DIRECT INFLUENCE IS THE TOLEDO

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:35.200
MUSEUM'S 1954 MURAL BY
MATISSE, "APOLLO". (MUSIC) NEW

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:39.600
SPEAKER: THERE'S A SLY LOOK ON
ALBERT'S FACE AND I KNOW THE

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:43.330
LOOK, I KNOW WHAT HE'S SAYING
AND IT'S "WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:46.800
THIS ONE" OR "WAIT UNTIL I
ATTEMPT TO DO THIS ONE" OR "I

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.530
DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, BUT I'M

00:50:49.530 --> 00:51:11.060
GOING TO DO IT" AND HE LOVES
HAVING THAT CHALLENGE. (MUSIC)

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:27.300
NEW SPEAKER: THAT'S GOOD,
THAT'S GOOD. GET A GOOD WELD

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:32.330
UP HERE, AND THEN WE'LL PICK
UP ON THAT. IT SHOULD FLEX

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:38.330
ENOUGH. NEW SPEAKER: THE ONE
COMMON THING THAT NO ONE EVER

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:41.930
WANTED TO THINK ABOUT THROUGH
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS AND I

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:45.760
FOUGHT IT AS MUCH AS I TRIED
TO THINK ABOUT IT, I COULDN'T

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:49.800
WASTE TOO MUCH TIME ON IT
BECAUSE I KNEW ALBERT WASN'T

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.530
THINKING ABOUT IT, WAS THE
RIBBONS. THROUGH ALL THIS

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:55.560
PROCESS, THIS VERY
STRAIGHTFORWARD FABRICATION,

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:58.100
HOLLOW FORM FABRICATION OF THE
COLUMNS, THE RINGS, THE BACON

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.660
STRIPS, EVERYTHING'S HOLLOW.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:04.500
THE THING THAT WASN'T THE SAME
WERE THE RIBBONS. AS MUCH AS I

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.400
WANTED TO KNOW HOW WE WERE
GOING TO MAKE THEM, WE DIDN'T

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.060
KNOW AND I'D LOOK AT ALBERT
AND SAY, "HOW ARE WE GOING TO

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.500
DO THIS?" AND HE SAID, "I
DON'T KNOW - WHAT DO YOU

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:15.200
THINK?" AND I SAID, "I DON'T
KNOW EITHER!" BUT IT'S

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:18.930
INTERESTING THAT ALL THIS
STRAIGHTFORWARD FABRICATION IS

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.430
GOING ON AND THERE WAS ONE
COMMON THING THAT NEITHER OF

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:28.960
US WANTED TO THINK ABOUT WERE
THESE RIBBONS. NARRATOR: THE

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.030
SOLUTION FOR CREATING SINUOUS
RIBBONS FROM RIGID STEEL WAS

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:37.060
INGENIOUS. PALEY MADE SMALL TO
SCALE BRASS MODELS, DRAWING

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.900
HASH MARKS ON THEM FROM ONE
END TO THE OTHER. HIS

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.530
SUBCONTRACTOR THEN USED
REFLECTED LIGHT ON THE HASH

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:46.030
MARKS TO REFERENCE THE BEND
POINTS ON THE STEEL PLATES.

00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:50.030
THE RESULTS WERE EXACT
DUPLICATES OF THE SMALL

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:53.900
MODELS, BUT 20 FEET IN LENGTH
AND A HALF-INCH THICK. EACH

00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:04.730
STEEL RIBBON WEIGHS ABOUT
THREE QUARTERS OF A TON. THE

00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:16.600
NEXT TASK WAS TO LIFT AND WELD
THE RIBBONS INTO PLACE. TO

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.500
COMPLETE HIS VISION, PALEY
BENT AND TWISTED SECTIONS OF

00:53:19.500 --> 00:54:12.030
THE RIBBONS INTO THEIR FINAL
FORM. (SOUNDS OF WORKING)

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:16.360
(MUSIC) PALEY: IT'S THE FIRST
TIME I'VE SEEN IT UP! NEW

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.300
SPEAKER: AND WHAT'S YOUR FIRST
IMPRESSION? PALEY: THAT'S THE

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:33.860
WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE; IT
LOOKS GOOD. GENESEE PASSAGE I

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:41.160
FEEL IS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL
IN THAT IT BRINGS ALL THOSE

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.800
FORMAL RELATIONSHIPS I'VE BEEN
WORKING WITH ALL THE TIME INTO

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.930
PLAY; IT DEALS WITH DYNAMISM
AND CHANGE, IT DEALS WITH

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:52.660
GEOMETRIC FORM AND ORGANIC
FORM, THERE'S KIND OF AN

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:58.730
EQUILIBRIUM STRUCK BETWEEN THE
VOLUMES SO IT'S KIND OF FROZEN

00:54:58.730 --> 00:55:05.160
IN SPACE AS IT WERE. I THINK
IT DOES THE JOB.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:56:47.900
