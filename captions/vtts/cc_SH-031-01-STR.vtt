00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.130
(♪song)

3
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.000
Cease to persuade, myloving Proteus:

4
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.600
Home-keeping youth haveever homely wits.

5
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.730
Were't not affectionchains thy tender days

6
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.630
To the sweet glances ofthy honour'd love,

7
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.670
I rather would entreat thycompany

8
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.870
To see the wonders of theworld abroad,

9
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.100
Than, living dullysluggardized at home,

10
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.330
Wear out thy youth withshapeless idleness.

11
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.430
But since thou lovest, lovestill and thrive therein,

12
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.770
Even as I would whenI to love begin.

13
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.900
Wilt thou be gone? SweetValentine, adieu!

14
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.270
Think on thy Proteus, whenthou haply seest

15
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.000
Some rare note-worthyobject in thy travel:

16
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.070
Wish me partaker in thyhappiness

17
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.270
When thou dost meet goodhap; and in thy danger,

18
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.270
If ever danger do environthee,

19
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.730
Commend thy grievance tomy holy prayers,

20
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.100
For I will be thybeadsman, Valentine.

21
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.870
And on a love-book prayfor my success?

22
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.470
Upon some book I loveI'll pray for thee.

23
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.030
That's on some shallowstory of deep love:

24
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.730
How young Leander cross'dthe Hellespont.

25
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.900
That's a deep story of adeeper love:

26
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.400
For he was more than overshoes in love.

27
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.330
'Tis true; for you areover boots in love,

28
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.930
And yet you never swum theHellespont.

29
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.570
Over the boots? nay, giveme not the boots.

30
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.930
No, I will not, for itboots thee not.

31
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.000
What?

32
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
To be in love, where scornis bought with groans;

33
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.200
Coy looks withheart-sore sighs;

34
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530
one fading moment's mirth

35
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.670
With twenty watchful,weary, tedious nights:

36
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.670
If haply won, perhaps ahapless gain;

37
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.230
If lost, why then agrievous labour won;

38
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.700
However, but a follybought with wit,

39
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.330
Or else a wit by follyvanquished.

40
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.230
So, by your circumstance,you call me fool.

41
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.230
So, by your circumstance,I fear you'll prove.

42
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.300
'Tis love you cavil at: Iam not Love.

43
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300
Love is your master, forhe masters you:

44
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.170
And he that is so yoked bya fool,

45
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.200
Methinks, should not bechronicled for wise.

46
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.670
Yet writers say, as inthe sweetest bud

47
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.030
The eating canker dwells,so eating love

48
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000
Inhabits in the finestwits of all.

49
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And writers say, as themost forward bud

50
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.930
Is eaten by the canker ereit blow,

51
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.330
Even so by love the youngand tender wit

52
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.730
Is turn'd to folly,blasting in the bud,

53
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.800
Losing his verdure even inthe prime

54
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.900
And all the fair effectsof future hopes.

55
00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.400
But wherefore waste I timeto counsel thee,

56
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.570
That art a votary to fonddesire?

57
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.870
Once more adieu! my fatherat the road

58
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.030
Expects my coming, thereto see me shipp'd.

59
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.100
And thither will I bringthee, Valentine.

60
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.100
Sweet Proteus, no; nowlet us take our leave.

61
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.670
To Milan let me hear fromthee by letters

62
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.330
Of thy success in love,and what news else

63
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.730
Betideth here in absenceof thy friend;

64
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.400
And likewise will visitthee with mine.

65
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.570
All happiness bechance tothee in Milan!

66
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.400
As much to you at home!and so, farewell.

67
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.130
He after honour hunts, Iafter love:

68
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.670
He leaves his friends todignify them more,

69
00:04:50.670 --> 00:05:01.070
I leave myself, my friendsand all, for love.

70
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.530
Thou, Julia, thou hastmetamorphosed me,

71
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.600
Made me neglect mystudies, lose my time,

72
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.700
War with good counsel, setthe world at nought;

73
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.130
Made wit with musing weak,heart sick with thought.

74
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.030
Sir Proteus, save you! Sawyou my master?

75
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.100
But now he parted hence,to embark for Milan.

76
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.570
Twenty to one then he isshipp'd already,

77
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.830
And I have play'd thesheep in losing him.

78
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.470
Indeed, a sheep doth veryoften stray,

79
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.530
An if the shepherd be awhile away.

80
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.330
You conclude that my master is ashepherd, then, and I a sheep?

81
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.530
I do.

82
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.430
Why then, my horns are hishorns, whether I wake or sleep.

83
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.470
A silly answer andfitting well a sheep.

84
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.600
This proves me still asheep.

85
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000
True; and thy master ashepherd.

86
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.200
Nay, that I can deny by acircumstance.

87
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.970
It shall go hard but I'llprove it by another.

88
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.170
The shepherd seeks the sheep,

89
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.300
and not the sheep the Shepherd;

90
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.370
but I seek my master, andmy master seeks not me:

91
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.970
therefore I am no sheep.

92
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.370
The sheep for fodderfollow the shepherd;

93
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:53.830
the shepherd for foodfollows not the sheep:

94
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.100
thou for wagesfollowest thy master;

95
00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.230
thy master for wagesfollows not thee:

96
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.400
therefore thou art a sheep.

97
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.330
Such another proof willmake me cry 'baa.'

98
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.900
But, dost thou hear? gavestthou my letter to Julia?

99
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.530
Ay sir: I, a lost mutton,gave your letter to her,

100
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.100
a laced mutton, and she,a laced mutton, gave me,

101
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.470
a lost mutton, nothingfor my labour.

102
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.970
Here's too small a pasturefor such store of muttons.

103
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.800
If the ground be overcharged,you were best stick her.

104
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.800
Nay: in that you are astray,'twere best pound you.

105
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.030
Nay, sir,

106
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.570
less than a pound shall serveme for carrying your letter.

107
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.770
You mistake; I mean thepound,--a pinfold.

108
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.500
From a pound to a pin?fold it over and over,

109
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.800
'Tis threefold too little

110
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.100
for carrying a letterto your lover.

111
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.900
But what said she?

112
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.400
Mmm.

113
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400
Mmm?

114
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.830
Ay.

115
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.870
Nod--Ay--why, that'snoddy.

116
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.230
You mistook, sir; Isay, she did nod:

117
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.700
and you ask me if she didnod; and I say, 'Ay.'

118
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.070
And that set together isnoddy.

119
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.170
Now you have taken thepains to set it together,

120
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.400
take it for your pains.

121
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.070
No, no; you shall have itfor bearing the letter.

122
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.630
Well, I perceive I must befain to bear with you.

123
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.700
Why sir, how do you bearwith me?

124
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.930
Marry, sir, theletter, very orderly;

125
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.700
having nothing but the word'noddy' for my pains.

126
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.070
Beshrew me, but you have aquick wit.

127
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.300
And yet it cannot overtakeyour slow purse.

128
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.570
Come come, open the matterin brief: what said she?

129
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.730
Open your purse,that the money

130
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.430
and the matter may beboth at once delivered.

131
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.630
Well, sir, here is foryour pains. What said she?

132
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.070
Truly, sir, I think you'llhardly win her.

133
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.570
Why, couldst thou perceiveso much from her?

134
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.470
Sir, I could perceivenothing at all from her;

135
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.630
no, not so much as a ducatfor delivering your letter:

136
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.800
and being so hard to methat brought your mind,

137
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.430
I fear she'll prove as hardto you in telling your mind.

138
00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.000
Give her no token but stones;for she's as hard as steel.

139
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.170
What said she? nothing?

140
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.130
No, not so much as 'Takethis for thy pains.'

141
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.930
To testify your bounty, I thankyou, you have testerned me;

142
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.330
in requital whereof, henceforthcarry your letters yourself:

143
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.130
and so, sir, I'll commendyou to my master.

144
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.500
Go, go, be gone, to saveyour ship from wreck,

145
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:46.800
Which cannot perish havingthee aboard,

146
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.600
Being destined to a drierdeath on shore.

147
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.970
I must go send some bettermessenger:

148
00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:59.730
I fear my Julia would notdeign my lines,

149
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.200
Receiving them from such aworthless post.

150
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.200
But say, Lucetta, now weare alone,

151
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.230
Wouldst thou then counselme to fall in love?

152
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.630
Ay, madam, so you stumblenot unheedfully.

153
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.300
Of all the fair resort ofgentlemen

154
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.930
That every day with parleencounter me,

155
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.470
In thy opinion which isworthiest love?

156
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:35.270
Please you repeat theirnames, I'll show my mind

157
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.600
According to my shallowsimple skill.

158
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.900
What think'st thou of thefair Sir Eglamour?

159
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.800
As of a knight well-spoken,neat and fine;

160
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.230
But, were I you, he nevershould be mine.

161
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:49.930
What think'st thou of therich Mercatio?

162
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.230
Well of his wealth; but ofhimself, so so.

163
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:59.530
What think'st thou of thegentle Proteus?

164
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.870
Lord, Lord! to see whatfolly reigns in us!

165
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.170
How now! what means thispassion at his name?

166
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.700
Pardon, dear madam: 'tis apassing shame

167
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.700
That I, unworthy body as Iam,

168
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.200
Should censure thus onlovely gentlemen.

169
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.530
Why not on Proteus, as ofall the rest?

170
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.770
Then thus: of many good Ithink him best.

171
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.700
Your reason?

172
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.600
I have no other, but awoman's reason;

173
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.270
I think him so because Ithink him so.

174
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.830
And wouldst thou have mecast my love on him?

175
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.170
Ay, if you thought yourlove not cast away.

176
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.800
Why he, of all the rest,hath never moved me.

177
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.570
Yet he, of all the rest, Ithink, best loves ye.

178
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.600
His little speaking showshis love but small.

179
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.870
Fire that's closest keptburns most of all.

180
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.730
They do not love that donot show their love.

181
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.430
O, they love least thatlet men know their love.

182
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.000
I would I knew his mind.

183
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:52.270
Peruse this paper, madam.

184
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.400
'To Julia.' Say, fromwhom?

185
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.730
That the contents willshow.

186
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.870
Say, say, who gave itthee?

187
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.530
Valentine's page; and sent,I think, from Proteus.

188
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.870
He would have given it you;but I, being in the way,

189
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.330
Did in your name receive it:pardon the fault I pray.

190
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:15.100
Now, by my modesty, agoodly broker!

191
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.830
Dare you presume toharbour wanton lines?

192
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.870
To whisper and conspireagainst my youth?

193
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.330
Now, trust me, 'tis anoffice of great worth

194
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.930
And you an officer fit forthe place.

195
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.300
There, take the paper. See it bereturned.

196
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.970
Or else return no moreinto my sight.

197
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:40.730
To plead for love deservesmore fee than hate.

198
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.130
Will ye be gone?

199
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:48.630
That you may ruminate.

200
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.870
And yet I would I hado'erlooked the letter:

201
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.370
It were a shame to callher back again

202
00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:08.170
And pray her to a faultfor which I chid her.

203
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.300
What a fool is she, thatknows I am a maid,

204
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.200
And would not force theletter to my view!

205
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.770
Since maids, in modesty,say 'no' to that

206
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:22.370
Which they would have theprofferer construe 'ay.'

207
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:44.300
Fie, fie, how wayward isthis foolish love

208
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.300
That, like a testy babe,will scratch the nurse

209
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:52.100
And presently all humbledkiss the rod!

210
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.130
How churlishly I chidLucetta hence,

211
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.170
When willingly I wouldhave had her here!

212
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.670
How angerly I taught mybrow to frown,

213
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.530
When inward joy enforcedmy heart to smile!

214
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:09.900
My penance is to callLucetta back

215
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.130
And ask remission for myfolly past.

216
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.830
What ho! Lucetta!

217
00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.070
What would your ladyship?

218
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.030
Is't near dinner-time?

219
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.000
I would it were,

220
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.830
That you might kill yourstomach on your meat

221
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.300
And not upon your maid.

222
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.930
What is't that you took upso gingerly?

223
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:29.970
Nothing.

224
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.430
Why didst thou stoop,then?

225
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.330
To take a paper up that Ilet fall.

226
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.700
And is that paper nothing?

227
00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.130
Nothing concerning me.

228
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.230
Then let it lie for thosethat it concerns.

229
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.800
Madam, it will not liewhere it concerns

230
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.530
Unless it have a falseinterpeter.

231
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:48.200
Some love of yours hathwrit to you in rhyme.

232
00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.770
That I might sing it,madam, to a tune.

233
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.470
Give me a note: yourladyship can set.

234
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.370
As little by such toys asmay be possible.

235
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.430
Best sing it to the tuneof 'Light o' love.'

236
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.630
It is too heavy for solight a tune.

237
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:05.630
Heavy! belike it hath someburden then?

238
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.700
Ay, and melodious were it,would you sing it.

239
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.000
And why not you?

240
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.200
I cannot reach so high.

241
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:23.100
Let's see your song. Hownow, minion!

242
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:30.370
Keep tune there still, soyou will sing it out:

243
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.900
And yet methinks I do notlike this tune.

244
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.600
You do not?

245
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.800
No, madam; it is toosharp.

246
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.230
You, minion, are toosaucy.

247
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:36.530
Nay, now you are too flat

248
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:39.500
And mar the concord withtoo harsh a descant:

249
00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.270
There wanteth but a meanto fill your song.

250
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.700
The mean is drown'd withyour unruly bass.

251
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.230
Indeed, I bid the base forProteus.

252
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.830
This babble shall nothenceforth trouble me.

253
00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.100
Here is a coil withprotestation!

254
00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.330
Go get you gone, and letthe papers lie:

255
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.330
You would be fingeringthem, to anger me.

256
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.700
She makes it strange; butshe would be best pleased

257
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.370
To be so anger'd withanother letter.

258
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:14.700
Nay, would I were soanger'd with the same!

259
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:23.570
O hateful hands, to tearsuch loving words!

260
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:28.070
Injurious wasps, to feedon such sweet honey

261
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:34.970
And kill the bees thatyield it with your stings!

262
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.130
I'll kiss each severalpaper for amends.

263
00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:46.870
Look, here is writ 'kindJulia.' Unkind Julia!

264
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.400
As in revenge of thyingratitude,

265
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.930
I throw thy name againstthe bruising stones,

266
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.830
Trampling contemptuouslyon thy disdain.

267
00:14:55.830 --> 00:15:02.400
And here is writ'love-wounded Proteus.'

268
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.400
Poor wounded name! mybosom as a bed

269
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.870
Shall lodge thee till thywound be thoroughly heal'd;

270
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:17.230
And thus I search it witha sovereign kiss.

271
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.500
But twice or thrice was'Proteus' written down.

272
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.830
Be calm, good wind, blownot a word away

273
00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.100
Till I have found eachletter in the letter,

274
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.430
Except mine own name: thatsome whirlwind bear

275
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.800
Unto a raggedfearful-hanging rock

276
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.070
And throw it thence intothe raging sea!

277
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:39.500
Lo, here in one line ishis name twice writ,

278
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:45.600
'Poor forlorn Proteus,passionate Proteus,

279
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.400
To the sweet Julia:' thatI'll tear away.

280
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.770
And yet I will not, sithso prettily

281
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:01.700
He couples it to hiscomplaining names.

282
00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:08.470
Thus will I fold them oneon another:

283
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:17.800
Now kiss, embrace,contend, do what you will.

284
00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.570
Madam,

285
00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.300
Dinner is ready, and yourfather stays.

286
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.930
Well, let us go.

287
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.770
What, shall these paperslie like tell-tales here?

288
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.900
If you respect them, bestto take them up.

289
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.100
Nay, I was taken up forlaying them down:

290
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.200
Yet here they shall notlie, for catching cold.

291
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.730
I see you have a month'smind to them.

292
00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:50.830
Ay, madam, you may saywhat sights you see;

293
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:54.430
I see things too, althoughyou judge I wink.

294
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.970
Come, come; will't pleaseyou go?

295
00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:48.330
Tell me, Panthino, whatsad talk was that

296
00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.100
Wherewith my brother heldyou in the cloister?

297
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.400
'Twas of his nephewProteus, your son.

298
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.170
Why, what of him?

299
00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.230
He wonder'd that yourlordship

300
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.830
Would suffer him to spendhis youth at home,

301
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.730
While other men, ofslender reputation,

302
00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:03.800
Put forth their sons toseek preferment out:

303
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.600
Some to the wars, to trytheir fortune there;

304
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.230
Some to discover islandsfar away;

305
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.330
Some to the studiousuniversities.

306
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.430
For any or for all theseexercises,

307
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.100
He said that Proteus yourson was meet,

308
00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.630
And did request me toimportune you

309
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:21.400
To let him spend his timeno more at home,

310
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.730
Which would be greatimpeachment to his age,

311
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.330
In having known no travelin his youth.

312
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.970
Nor need'st thou muchimportune me to that

313
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:31.300
Whereon this month I havebeen hammering.

314
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.530
I have consider'd well hisloss of time

315
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.030
And how he cannot be aperfect man,

316
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.400
Not being tried andtutor'd in the world:

317
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.400
Experience is by industryachieved

318
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.300
And perfected by the swiftcourse of time.

319
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.200
Then tell me, whither wereI best to send him?

320
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.870
I think your lordship isnot ignorant

321
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.170
How his companion,youthful Valentine,

322
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.600
Attends the emperor in hisroyal court.

323
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.800
I know it well.

324
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.930
'Twere good, I think, yourlordship sent him thither:

325
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.970
There shall he practisetilts and tournaments,

326
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:01.070
Hear sweet discourse,converse with noblemen.

327
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.730
And be in eye of everyexercise

328
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:08.330
Worthy his youth andnobleness of birth.

329
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.700
I like thy counsel; wellhast thou advised:

330
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.800
And that thou mayst perceivehow well I like it,

331
00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.870
The execution of it shallmake known.

332
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.130
Even with the speediestexpedition

333
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.330
I will dispatch him to theemperor's court.

334
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:20.300
To-morrow, may it pleaseyou, Don Alphonso,

335
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.700
With other gentlemen ofgood esteem,

336
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.600
Are journeying to salutethe emperor

337
00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.530
And to commend theirservice to his will.

338
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.630
Good company; with themshall Proteus go:

339
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.270
And, in good time! nowwill we break with him.

340
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:37.870
Sweet love! sweet lines!sweet life!

341
00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.370
Here is her hand, theagent of her heart;

342
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:46.270
Here is her oath for love,her honour's pawn.

343
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.230
O, that our fathers wouldapplaud our loves,

344
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:51.900
To seal our happiness withtheir consents!

345
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.170
O heavenly Julia!

346
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.770
How now! what letter areyou reading there?

347
00:19:55.770 --> 00:20:05.630
May't please your lordship,'tis a word or two

348
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.970
Of commendations sent fromValentine,

349
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.400
Deliver'd by a friend thatcame from him.

How happily he lives, howwell beloved

353

And daily graced by theemperor;

Wishing me with him,partner of his fortune.

355

And how stand you affectedto his wish?

356
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.800
As one relying on yourlordship's will

357
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.000
And not depending on hisfriendly wish.

358
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
My will is somethingsorted with his wish.

359
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.500
Muse not that I thussuddenly proceed;

360

For what I will, I will,and there an end.

361

With Valentinus in theemperor's court:

363
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:43.400
What maintenance he fromhis friends receives,

364
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.130
Like exhibition thou shalthave from me.

365
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.370
To-morrow be in readinessto go:

366
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.130

Come on, Panthino: youshall be employ'd

372
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:12.700
To hasten on hisexpedition.

373
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.830
Thus have I shunn'd thefire for fear of burning,

374
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:32.800
And drench'd me in thesea, where I am drown'd.

375
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.670
I fear'd to show my fatherJulia's letter,

376
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.570
Lest he should takeexceptions to my love;

377
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.730
And with the vantage ofmine own excuse

378
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:49.070
Hath he excepted mostagainst my love.

379
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.600
O, how this spring of loveresembleth

380
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.470
The uncertain glory of anApril day,

381
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.230
Which now shows all thebeauty of the sun,

382
00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:03.800
And by and by a cloudtakes all away!

383
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.300
Sir Proteus, your fathercalls for you:

384
00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.100
He is in haste; therefore,I pray you to go.

385
00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.600
Why, this it is: my heartaccords thereto,

386
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:23.500
And yet a thousand timesit answers 'no.'

387
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:36.730
(♪song)
