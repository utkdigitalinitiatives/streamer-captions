00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630


2
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.070
Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.330
When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.400
Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.330
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.800
And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--

7
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.830
Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.770
Than in his feats deserving it--for him

9
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.870
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,

10
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.870
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.170
Is left untender'd.

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.530
And, to kill the marvel,

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.100
Shall be so ever.

14
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.900
There be many Caesars,

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.500
Ere such another Julius. Britain is

16
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.370
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay

17
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.300
For wearing our own noses.

18
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.370
That opportunity

19
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.770
Which then they had to take from 's, to resume

20
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.070
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.200
The kings your ancestors, together with

22
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.630
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands

23
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.930
As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in

24
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.570
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,

25
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.070
With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,

26
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.370
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest

27
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.970
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag

28
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.030
Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--

29
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.730
That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried

30
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.230
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--

31
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.130
Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,

32
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd

33
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.370
As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof

34
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.500
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--

35
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.970
O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,

36
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.000
Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright

37
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.630
And Britons strut with courage.

38
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.670
Come, there's no more tribute to be paid:

39
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.200
our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,

40
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.730
as I said, there is no moe such Caesars:

41
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.270
other of them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such

42
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.130
straight arms, none.

43
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.030
Son, let your mother end.

44
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.770
We have yet many among us can gripe as hard

45
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.530
as Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a hand.

46
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.570
Why tribute? why should we pay tribute?

47
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.900
If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket,

48
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.900
or put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute

49
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.230
for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

50
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.430
You must know,

51
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.530
Till the injurious Romans did extort

52
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.900
This tribute from us, we were free:

53
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.000
Caesar's ambition,

54
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.430
Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch

55
00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.470
The sides o' the world, against all colour here

56
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.030
Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off

57
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.400
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon

58
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.230
Ourselves to be.

59
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.700
I am sorry, Cymbeline,

60
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.500
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--

61
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.170
Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than

62
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.570
Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:

63
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.870
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion

64
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.100
In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee:

65
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.200
look for fury not to be resisted.

66
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.530
Thus defied, I thank thee for myself.

67
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.470
How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not

68
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.870
What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,

69
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.930
O master! what a strange infection

70
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.670
Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,

71
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.700
As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd

72
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.230
On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:

73
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.700
She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,

74
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.730
More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults

75
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.070
As would take in some virtue. O my master!

76
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.400
Thy mind to her is now as low as were

77
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:33.800
Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?

78
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.230
Upon the love and truth and vows which I

79
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:46.470
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?

80
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.270
If it be so to do good service, never

81
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.500
Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,

82
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.030
That I should seem to lack humanity

83
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.370
so much as this fact comes to?

84
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.400
'Do't: the letter

85
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.630
that I have sent her, by her own command

86
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:16.330
Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!

87
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.670
Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,

88
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.570
Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st

89
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.600
So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.

90
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.400
I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

91
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.670
How now, Pisanio!

92
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.900
Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

93
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.900
'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me

94
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.870
in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me,

95
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.570
as you, O the dearest of creatures,

96
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.970
would even renew me with your eyes.

97
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:01.800
Take notice that I am in Cambria,

98
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.130
at Milford-Haven: what your own love

99
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.670
will out of this advise you, follow.

100
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.500
So he wishes you all happiness,

101
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.700
that remains loyal to his vow, and your,

102
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.070
increasing in love,

103
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.770
LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'

104
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.200
O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?

105
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.030
He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me

106
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.070
How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs

107
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.900
May plod it in a week, why may not I

108
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.500
Glide thither in a day?

109
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.570
Prithee, speak,

110
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.470
How many score of miles may we well ride

111
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.830
'Twixt hour and hour?

112
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.500
One score 'twixt sun and sun,

113
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.530
Madam, 's enough for you:

114
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.200
and too much too.

115
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.630
Why, one that rode to's execution, man,

116
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.270
Could never go so slow:

117
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.170
But this is foolery:

118
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.400
Go bid my woman feign a sickness;

119
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.930
say she'll home to her father: and provide me presently

120
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.670
A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit

121
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:01.300
A franklin's housewife.

122
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.870
Madam, you're best consider.

123
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:08.230
I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,

124
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.770
Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,

125
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.670
That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;

126
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.730
Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,

127
00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.530
Accessible is none but Milford way.

128
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.300
A goodly day not to keep house, with such

129
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.900
Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate

130
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.830
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you

131
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.630
To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs

132
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.230
Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through

133
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.700
And keep their impious turbans on, without

134
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.700
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!

135
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.130
Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;

136
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.230
Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats.

137
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.670
Consider, when you above perceive me like a crow,

138
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.470
That it is place which lessens and sets off;

139
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:12.470
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you

140
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.570
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:

141
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.770
Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,

142
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.670
Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not

143
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.130
What air's from home. Haply this life is best,

144
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.100
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you

145
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.670
That have a sharper known; well corresponding

146
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.930
With your stiff age: but unto us it is

147
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:39.930
A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;

148
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:41.830
A prison for a debtor, that not dares

149
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.500
To stride a limit.

150
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.430
What should we speak of

151
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.270
When we are old as you? when we shall hear

152
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.300
The rain and wind beat dark December, how,

153
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.630
In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse

154
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.970
The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;

155
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.770
We are beastly.

156
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.300
How you speak!

157
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.570
Did you but know the city's usuries

158
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:08.430
And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court

159
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.200
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb

160
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.670
Is certain falling, or so slippery that

161
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:21.230
The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,

162
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:24.200
O boys, this story

163
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.830
The world may read in me: my body's mark'd

164
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.100
With Roman swords, and my report was once

165
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.370
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,

166
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.170
And when a soldier was the theme, my name

167
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.770
Was not far off: then was I as a tree

168
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.630
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,

169
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.330
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,

170
00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.470
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,

171
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.470
And left me bare to weather.

172
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.530
Uncertain favour!

173
00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.170
My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--

174
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.200
But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd

175
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.670
Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline

176
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:11.130
I was confederate with the Romans: so

177
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.100
Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years

178
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.770
This rock and these demesnes have been my world;

179
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.800
But up to the mountains!

180
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.630
This is not hunters' language:

181
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.400
How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!

182
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.330
These boys know little they are sons to the king;

183
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:47.170
Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.

184
00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.870
They think they are mine;

185
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:56.570
This Polydore,

186
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.370
The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who

187
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.770
The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!

188
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.570
When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell

189
00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:11.430
The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out

190
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.970
Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,

191
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.770
And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then

192
00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.830
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,

193
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.370
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture

194
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:34.130
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,

195
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.430
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,

196
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.600
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more

197
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:52.800
His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!

198
00:11:55.630 --> 00:12:02.230
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows

199
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.800
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,

200
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.570
At three and two years old, I stole these babes;

201
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.730
Thinking to bar thee of succession,

202
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.370
as Thou reft'st me of my lands.

203
00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.700
Euriphile, Thou wast their nurse;

204
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.470
they took thee for their mother,

205
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:29.700
And every day do honour to her grave:

206
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:39.270
Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,

207
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.670
They take for natural father.

208
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.200
The game is up.

209
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.870
Where is Posthumus?

210
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.000
What is in thy mind,

211
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.830
That makes thee stare thus?

212
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:05.930
One, but painted thus,

213
00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:07.300
Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd

214
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.170
Beyond self-explication:

215
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.570
What's the matter. man?

216
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.400
Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with

217
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.630
A look untender?

218
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.330
My husband's hand!

219
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.100
That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,

220
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.570
And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue

221
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.270
May take off some extremity, which to read

222
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.930
Would be even mortal to me.

223
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.170
Please you, read;

224
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.330
And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing

225
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.670
The most disdain'd of fortune.

226
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.430
'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played

227
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:51.670
the strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof

228
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:57.070
lie bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,

229
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.170
but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain

230
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:05.070
as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,

231
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.000
must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with

232
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away

233
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
her life:

234
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.230
I shall give thee opportunity

235
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.630
at Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose

236
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.800
where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain

237
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.670
it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour

238
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.830
and equally to me disloyal.'

239
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.830
What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper

240
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.930
Hath cut her throat already.

241
00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:49.630
False to his bed! What is it to be false?

242
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.500
To lie in watch there and to think on him?

243
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.800
To weep 'twixt clock and clock?

244
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:00.700
if sleep charge nature,

245
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:03.400
To break it with a fearful dream of him

246
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.830
And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?

247
00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:06.770
Alas, good lady!

248
00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:14.870
I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,

249
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:18.800
Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;

250
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.430
Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks

251
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.270
Thy favour's good enough.

252
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.970
Some jay of Italy

253
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.630
Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:

254
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.930
Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;

255
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:44.870
And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,

256
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.870
I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,

257
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:54.370
Men's vows are women's traitors!

258
00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.700
All good seeming,

259
00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.500
By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought

260
00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.930
Put on for villany; not born where't grows,

261
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.630
But worn a bait for ladies.

262
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:06.370
Good madam, hear me.

263
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.500
Come, fellow, be thou honest:

264
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.530
Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,

265
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.370
A little witness my obedience: look!

266
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.030
I draw the sword myself: take it,

267
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.830
and hit the innocent mansion of my love, my heart;

268
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:22.630
Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;

269
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.170
Thy master is not there, who was indeed

270
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.170
The riches of it:

271
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.170
do his bidding; strike!

272
00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.070
Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;

273
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.770
But now thou seem'st a coward.

274
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:39.530
Hence, vile instrument!

275
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.970
Thou shalt not damn my hand.

276
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:47.730
Why, I must die;

277
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.130
And if I do not by thy hand, thou art

278
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.170
No servant of thy master's.

279
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.770
Come, here's my heart.

280
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:04.570
Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;

281
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:08.000
Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?

282
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.900
The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,

283
00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:23.870
All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,

284
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.400
Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more

285
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:34.030
Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools

286
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.130
Believe false teachers:

287
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.630
though those that are betray'd

288
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.030
Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor

289
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.300
Stands in worse case of woe.

290
00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.170
And thou, Posthumus,

291
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:58.330
Come, strike!

292
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.530
The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?

293
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.470
Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,

294
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:13.270
When I desire it too.

295
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:17.200
O gracious lady,

296
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.870
Since I received command to do this business

297
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.270
I have not slept one wink.

298
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.530
Do't, and to bed then.

299
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.230
I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.

300
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.630
Wherefore then didst undertake it?

301
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.600
Why hast thou abused

302
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.170
So many miles with a pretence?

303
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.130
But to win time

304
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:50.000
To lose so bad employment; in the which

305
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.570
I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,

306
00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:53.800
Hear me with patience.

307
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.300
Talk thy tongue weary;

308
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.830
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear

309
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.070
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,

310
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:05.930
Nor tent to bottom that.

311
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.500
But speak.

312
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.130
It cannot be

313
00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.830
But that my master is abused:

314
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.900
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.

315
00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.330
Hath done you both this cursed injury.

316
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:19.830
Some Roman courtezan.

317
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.130
No, on my life.

318
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.430
I'll give but notice you are dead and send him

319
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.600
Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded

320
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.670
I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,

321
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.270
And that will well confirm it.

322
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:39.170
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?

323
00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.100
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven

324
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.570
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind

325
00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.770
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise

326
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:51.800
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be

327
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:56.670
But by self-danger, you should tread a course

328
00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:01.570
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near

329
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.800
The residence of Posthumus;

330
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.970
O, for such means! I would adventure.

331
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.070
Well, then, here's the point:

332
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.870
You must forget to be a woman;

333
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:17.830
change command into obedience: fear and niceness

334
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.170
into a waggish courage:

335
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:24.430
I see into thy end, and am almost

336
00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.270
A man already.

337
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.370
First, make yourself but like one.

338
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.470
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--

339
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.070
'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all

340
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.670
That answer to them:

341
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.470
'fore noble Lucius

342
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.300
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him

343
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.300
wherein you're happy,

344
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.900
With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable

345
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.900
Thou art all the comfort

346
00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.100
The gods will diet me with.

347
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.930
This attempt I am soldier to, and will abide it

348
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:03.930
with a prince's courage. Away, I prithee.

349
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.670
Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,

350
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:13.130
Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected

351
00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.670
of your carriage from the court.

352
00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.000
My noble mistress,

353
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.700
Here is a box; I had it from the queen:

354
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.970
What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,

355
00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.730
Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this

356
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.270
Will drive away distemper.

357
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:34.930
To some shade,

358
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.270
And fit you to your manhood.

359
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.200
May the gods direct you to the best!

360
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.770
Amen: I thank thee.

361
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:22.330
Thanks, royal sir.

362
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.270
My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;

363
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.070
And am right sorry that I must report ye

364
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:29.570
My master's enemy.

365
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.230
Our subjects, sir,

366
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:35.030
Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself

367
00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.130
To show less sovereignty than they, must needs

368
00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:41.000
Appear unkinglike.

369
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.970
So, sir: I desire of you

370
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.300
A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.

371
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.130
Madam, all joy befal your grace!

372
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:51.330
And you!

373
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.930
My lords, you are appointed for that office;

374
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.270
The due of honour in no point omit.

375
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.770
So farewell, noble Lucius.

376
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.130
Your hand, my lord.

377
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:09.930
Receive it friendly; but from this time forth

378
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.630
I wear it as your enemy.

379
00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:12.800
Sir, the event

380
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.370
Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.

381
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.570
Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,

382
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:26.100
Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!

383
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.100
He goes hence frowning: but it honours us

384
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:39.830
That we have given him cause.

385
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.770
'Tis all the better;

386
00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.100
Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

387
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:46.930
Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor

388
00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:49.470
How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely

389
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.330
Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:

390
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.400
The powers that he already hath in Gallia

391
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.730
Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves

392
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.830
His war for Britain.

393
00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.070
'Tis not sleepy business;

394
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.430
But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.

395
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.800
Our expectation that it would be thus

396
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.830
Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,

397
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.300
Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd

398
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.930
Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd

399
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.270
The duty of the day: she looks us like

400
00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.230
A thing more made of malice than of duty:

401
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.900
We have noted it. Call her before us; for

402
00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.630
We have been too slight in sufferance.

403
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.570
Royal sir,

404
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.200
Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired

405
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.530
Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,

406
00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.170
'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,

407
00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.270
Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady

408
00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.700
So tender of rebukes that words are strokes

409
00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.270
And strokes death to her.

410
00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.070
Where is she, sir?

411
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:41.600
How can her contempt be answer'd?

412
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.700
Please you, sir,

413
00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.630
Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer

414
00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:48.230
That will be given to the loudest noise we make.

415
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:49.970
My lord, when last I went to visit her,

416
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.170
She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,

417
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.130
Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,

418
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.330
She should that duty leave unpaid to you,

419
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.600
Which daily she was bound to proffer:

420
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.970
This she wish'd me to make known; but our great court

421
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.800
Made me to blame in memory.

422
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.400
Her doors lock'd?

423
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.100
Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear

424
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.370
Prove false!

425
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.300
Son, I say, follow the king.

426
00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.300
That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,

427
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.430
have not seen these two days.

428
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.530
Go, look after.

429
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.000
Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!

430
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.400
He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence

431
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.300
Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes

432
00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.430
It is a thing most precious.

433
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:53.170
But for her, where is she gone?

434
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.300
Haply, despair hath seized her,

435
00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.670
Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown

436
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:06.470
To her desired Posthumus: gone she is

437
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:11.030
To death or to dishonour; and my end

438
00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.600
Can make good use of either:

439
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:24.330
She being down, I have the placing of the British crown.

440
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.630
How now, my son!

441
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:29.470
'Tis certain she is fled.

442
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.330
Go in and cheer the king: he rages;

443
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.330
none dare come about him.

444
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:37.770
All the better: may this night forestall him

445
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.500
of the coming day!

446
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:48.030
I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,

447
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:51.070
And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite

448
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:57.170
Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one

449
00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:02.470
The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,

450
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:08.400
Outsells them all; I love her therefore:

451
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.200
but disdaining me and throwing favours on

452
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.400
The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment

453
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.430
That what's else rare is choked; and in that point

454
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.400
I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,

455
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.000
To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--

456
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.270
Who is here?

457
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.970
What, are you packing, sirrah?

458
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:38.570
Come hither:

459
00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:50.200
ah, you precious pander!

460
00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:54.930
Villain, Where is thy lady? In a word; or else

461
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:56.800
Thou art straightway with the fiends.

462
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800
O, good my lord!

463
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.930
Where is thy lady? Is she with Posthumus?

464
00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.830
From whose so many weights of baseness cannot

465
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.600
A dram of worth be drawn.

466
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.870
O, my all-worthy lord!

467
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.670
All-worthy villain!

468
00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.530
Discover where thy mistress is at once,

469
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.300
At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'

470
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.600
Speak, or thy silence on the instant is

471
00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:22.330
Thy condemnation and thy death.

472
00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.400
Then, sir,

473
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:29.630
This paper is the history of my knowledge

474
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.900
Touching her flight.

475
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.630
Let's see't. I will pursue her

476
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.500
Even to Augustus' throne.

477
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:43.070
I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,

478
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.670
Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

479
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.670
Sirrah, is this letter true?

480
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.030
Sir, as I think.

481
00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.100
It is Posthumus' hand; I know't.

482
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:02.330
Sirrah, if thou wouldst not be a villain,

483
00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.830
but do me true service,

484
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.700
undergo those employments wherein I should have

485
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.270
cause to use thee with a serious industry,

486
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.930
that is, what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it

487
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:18.300
directly and truly, I would think thee an honest man:

488
00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.800
thou shouldst neither want my means

489
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.430
for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment.

490
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.270
Well, my good lord.

491
00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:27.930
Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently

492
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.670
and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune

493
00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:33.570
of that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not,

494
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:36.130
in the course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower

495
00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:39.800
of mine: wilt thou serve me?

496
00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.430
Sir, I will.

497
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:50.230
Give me thy hand; here's my purse.

498
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.700
Hast any of thy late master's garments in thy possession?

499
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.630
I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit

500
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.170
he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.

501
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.230
The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit hither:

502
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.970
let it be thy lint service; go.

503
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.900
I shall, my lord.

504
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.500
Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--

505
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.330
I forgot to ask him one thing;

506
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.770
I'll remember't anon:--

507
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.200
even there, thou villain Posthumus, will I kill thee.

508
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.700
I would these garments were come.

509
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.170
She said upon a time--the bitterness of it

510
00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.830
I now belch from my heart--that she

511
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.900
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect

512
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.930
than my noble and natural person together

513
00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:50.900
with the adornment of my qualities.

514
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.630
With that suit upon my back,

515
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.130
will I ravish her:

516
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.800
Be those the garments?

517
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.600
Ay, my noble lord.

518
00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.270
How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?

519
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.270
She can scarce be there yet.

520
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.930
Bring this apparel to my chamber;

521
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:20.530
that is the second thing that I have commanded thee:

522
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:27.100
the third is,

523
00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:31.400
that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design.

524
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.630
Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee

525
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.470
Were to prove false, which I will never be,

526
00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:09.730
How fit his garments serve me.

527
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.730
Why should his mistress

528
00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.400
who was made by him  that made the tailor

529
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.300
not be fit too?

530
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.730
I dare speak it to myself

531
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:19.930
where it is not vain glory

532
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.430
for a man and his glass to confer

533
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:24.530
in his own chambers.

534
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.100
The lines of my body are as well-drawn as his,

535
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.800
no less young, more strong,

536
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.830
not beneath him in fortunes,

537
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.530
beyond him in the advantage of the time

538
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.400
above him in birth

539
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.470
alike conversant in general services

540
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:44.070
and more remarkable in single oppositions.

541
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:48.730
Yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite.

542
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.030
What mortality is!

543
00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.400
Stay; come not in.

544
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.670
But that it eats our victuals, I should think

545
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:56.330
Here were a fairy.

546
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:57.600
What's the matter, sir?

547
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.430
By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,

548
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.970
An earthly paragon!

549
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.100
Good masters, harm me not:

550
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.070
I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found

551
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:18.900
Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:

552
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:23.900
I would have left it on the board so soon

553
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.330
As I had made my meal, and parted

554
00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:26.800
With prayers for the provider.

555
00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.870
Money, youth?

556
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.430
All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!

557
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:34.700
As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those

558
00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:36.300
Who worship dirty gods.

559
00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.070
I see you're angry:

560
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:42.100
Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should

561
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.970
Have died had I not made it.

562
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:45.770
Whither bound?

563
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:47.030
To Milford-Haven.

564
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.900
What's your name?

565
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.400
Fidele, sir.

566
00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:54.400
I have a kinsman who Is bound for Italy;

567
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.570
he embark'd at Milford;

568
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:58.830
To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,

569
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:00.800
I am fall'n in this offence.

570
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800
Prithee, fair youth,

571
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.000
Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds

572
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.070
By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!

573
00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.170
'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer

574
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:16.630
Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.

575
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:19.470
Boys, bid him welcome.

576
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.230
I'll love him as my brother:

577
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.830
And such a welcome as I'd give to him

578
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.170
After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!

579
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.500
The night to the owl and morn to the lark

580
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.330
less welcome.

581
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.830
