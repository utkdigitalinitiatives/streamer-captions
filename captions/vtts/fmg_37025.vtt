00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
(Schama)
She's in ecstasy, all right.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Her head is thrown back,
her mouth open.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Her heavy-lidded eyes
are half closed.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
An angelic hand is delicately
uncovering her breast.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You have to look.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You don't know
where to look.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
A century after
Bernini created this sculpture,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
a French art lover
doing the tour of Rome

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
came into this church,
peered at the spectacle,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and said,
"Well, if that's divine love,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I know all about it."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So what is this?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Surely not an erotic trance,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
not from the most
devout sculptor in Rome.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
No one who was
the bosom friend of popes,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
a pillar of
the Catholic establishment

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
could possibly want us to see
a nun in the throes of orgasm.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Could he?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata]

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
*

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's no good pretending
that ecstasy

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
isn't a physical as well
as a spiritual experience,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that passion doesn't
work through the body

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
as well as the soul.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Bernini knew all about passion.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's what his art was about.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It was this physical intensity
that would transform sculpture.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
No one before Bernini

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
had managed to make marble
so carnal.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
In his nimble hands,
it would flutter and stream,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
quiver and sweat.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
His figures weep and shout.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Their torsos twist and run
and arch themselves

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
in spasms
of intense sensation.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
He could,
like an alchemist,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
change one material
into another:

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
marble into trees,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
leaves, hair,
and of course, flesh.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The whole point
of classical sculpture

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
was to make humans less so,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
to give mortal flesh

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
the heavyweight smoothness
of immortality.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So many of them end up
looking divine but bloodless.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But then
along comes Bernini,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and suddenly,
even Michelangelo's David

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.000
looks immobile beside Bernini's
whirling, twisting tornado.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
If sculpture was supposed
to convey gravity,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Bernini would defy it.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
His figures break loose
from their plinths,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
flying away into space.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
[hurried string music]

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
For as long as anyone
could remember,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Gian Lorenzo Bernini
had startled

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
the people who mattered.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Brought before the pope
when he was just eight,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
he did a lightning sketch
of St. Paul's head

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
that prompted the astonished
pope to tip the little boy

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
as the next Michelangelo.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
His father, Pietro,
was a sculptor from Florence,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
seldom better than competent
and sometimes worse.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But in his son, he knew
a good thing when he saw it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
"Watch out, Signor Bernini,"
an admiring cardinal said.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
"The boy will surpass
his master."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
So fast
out of the starting blocks,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
our little prodigy.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Bernini arrived
in Rome in 1605...

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
[footsteps]

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
just at the time Caravaggio's
punchy street dramas

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
were electrifying
the church...

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
giving it a new vision
of how to move the flock.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
No more remote saints;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
instead, the shock theater
of the earthy passions,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
salvation in the guts.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So how do you top Caravaggio?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Answer: you can't,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but in sculpture.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This is Saint Lawrence
being barbecued alive

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
for his Christian beliefs.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Bernini was 16
when he did this.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
He's trying to catch
the moment of transcendent pain

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
when, if we believe
the legends,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Saint Lawrence turns
to his executioners and says,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
in a moment of macabre drollery,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
"Right, turn me over, boys.
This side's done."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
No wonder he became
the patron saint of cooks.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But there's something serious
going on here.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
As Lawrence's hand
touches the flame,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
a mysterious transformation
takes place.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
The chroniclers say it.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The smell of scorched flesh
turned fragrant.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Pain and sweetness
become one.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It was enough to make one bigwig
on the Roman scene,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Cardinal Scipione Borghese,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
want to adopt Gian Lorenzo
as his personal star property,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
someone who'd make
his fabulous new villa

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
up here on the Pincian Hill
 the place to see great art.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
How the other red hats would
gnash their teeth in envy.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.000
There was something larger than
life about Scipione Borghese.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The bull-like neck and head
sat atop a jumbo body.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Sly Bernini,
using a button

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that can't quite make it
through its hole

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to give us a feeling
for the flesh tight-packed

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
into the satin.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The holy man of the church is,
above all, a physical presence.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
He looks more like a chef
than His Eminence.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
What he was after, Bernini said,
was a speaking likeness,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
because he thought that people
gave themselves away,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
most characteristically,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
either just before
or after they spoke.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So he works his magic
on Scipione:

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the little fringe poking out
from the cardinal's hat,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the chipmunk cheeks,
the fleshy, blubbery lips.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Scipione's nose catching
the light in such a way

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
as to suggest
a film of sweat,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the natural effusion
of a big man in a hot city.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Rome: the holy metropolis
buzzing with worldly ambition.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
For the church aristocracy,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
it's not just the money
you've got that counts.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It's also the art.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Painters, sculptors,
and architects

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
are angling for patrons,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and the Rothschilds
and the Sachses of their day,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
the popes and cardinals,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
are gambling on the next
prized genius.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Bernini, of course,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
has everything
it takes to succeed.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
He's witty, charming,
extremely well-connected,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
frighteningly cultured,
ferociously disciplined,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
always delivers
when he says he will,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and he doesn't drink.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
In other words,
the opposite of Caravaggio.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And how do we know all this?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Well, someone had noted
Bernini's every move:

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Philipo Baldinuchi,
minor painter,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
gossip, and art critic,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
not that important
in himself

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
but someone who had collected
everything he could

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
from those who knew Bernini

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and turned it into
his first proper biography.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
[as Baldinuchi,
speaking in Italian]

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:33.000
(Schama)
This is Apollo and Daphne.
It's a story of sexual hunting.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Apollo wants the nymph Daphne.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
She definitely doesn't want him.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
He runs after her,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and just as he's
about to grab her,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.000
the gods answer her prayers by
turning her into a laurel tree.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
It's all action sculpture.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Apollo,
breaking his breathless run,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
his cape and his hair
still flying in the wind.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Daphne, who's cornered,
isn't rooted to the spot,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
except botanically,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and seems to be climbing
into the air,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
her mouth open wide
in a scream,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
hair and fingers
already metamorphosing

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
into leafy twigs.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
But the tease of the drama
is the silky nude

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
that Bernini's
made available to us

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
exactly as she disappears

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
inside her protective casing
of tree bark,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
a painfully thwarted
consummation.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
It's not just me.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
A French cardinal said
he wouldn't have it in his house

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
because such a beautiful nude

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
would be sure to arouse
anybody who saw it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Bernini is said to have been

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
really pleased
when he heard that.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Bernini is in his early 20s,
a superstar,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
someone on whom the mighty
and the powerful almost fawn.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
One pope, Gregory the XV,
makes him a knight.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So Bernini is known
ever after

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
as the cavaliere.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
The next pope, Urban VIII,
makes him his best friend.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
There's a story
that when Cardinal Barberini

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
became Pope Urban VIII,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
he called Bernini
into his apartment and said...

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Bernini is Rome's
supreme virtuoso,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
the emperor of the arts
and not just in sculpture.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
He's also a painter,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
a master builder,
and a playwright.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And he has everything:
charisma, swarthy good looks,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
money, status, and enemies.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
This is Francesco Borromini:
taciturn, neurotic,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
introverted, depressive,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
a man of absolutely
no social graces whatsoever.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
For good and for ill,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Borromini would play a
pivotal role in Bernini's life.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
The two of them would trip
over each other's ambitions,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
spur each other on
to ever greater heights,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
ever greater risks.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Borromini was
a brilliant architect.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
He made walls and balconies
curve and bulge

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
where they had no right to,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
ceilings that sing and throb.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
If two men were responsible

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
for creating the look
of baroque Rome,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
for making Rome, Rome,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
those two men
were Borromini and Bernini.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And they hated each other.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
At first, it was
a one-way rivalry.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Borromini resented
Bernini's popularity,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
his hogging
of the limelight.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
It's a bit like Mozart
and Salieri,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
only there's no Salieri here,
no weaker talent.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
They're both geniuses.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
The rivalry between Bernini
and Borromini

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
started in earnest
in 1624,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
when someone
had to be appointed

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
the new architect
for St. Peter's

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and get to build
the baldachino,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
the enormous canopy
over the tomb of St. Peter

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
located directly under
Michelangelo's great dome.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
It's the plummiest job in town.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Now, at this stage,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Borromini was far more qualified
than Bernini.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
He'd trained as an architect

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
and was the obvious candidate
for the job.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
But guess who got it.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Mr. Charming,
Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Of course,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
the engineering problems
of forging the great canopy,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
raising this twisty
gilt bronze monster,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
were a serious stretch
for Bernini's competence.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
So wisely, he gets help.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
He turns to Borromini,
who had no choice but to help.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
It was for the greater good
of the church, after all.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Architecture has always been
a collaborative exercise,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
so it's not surprising
to find

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
that virtually all the drawings
for the baldachino

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
are by Borromini.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Does he get the credit
he deserves?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Does he? Hell.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And that Francesco Borromini
neither forgives nor forgets.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
It's an unappealing trait,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
this ungenerous instinct
for monopolizing the glory,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and it will come back
to bite Bernini.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
It's not just Borromini
who feels it.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
The assistant who did that fine
leaf work on Daphne's leaves

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
was so angry
at not getting his due

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
that he walked out
of the project in a rage.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
But then the Cavaliere Bernini

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
always did have a cavalier way
with his assistants.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
[speaking Italian]

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
(Schama)
His own mother complained.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
So he took what he needed:
technical expertise,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
grinding toil,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
and in the case
of one of his assistants,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Matier Bonarelli,
his wife.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Her name is Costanza,
Constance.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Did she and Bernini have
a laugh in bed about that?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Here she is in 1637
at the height of their affair.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
You can see, he can't
get enough of her.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
And from the intensity
of all this brimming desire

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
comes an entirely new kind
of European sculpture.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
Before Costanza, busts had been
entirely respectable,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
and they were usually
reserved for tombs.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Only the Romans,
a long time before,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
had used sculpture
for informal portraits.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
But informal doesn't quite
do it for Costanza, does it?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
How about intimate?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
For this is a portrait
of a woman

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
whose passion is written
on her face and her body,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
whose flaring temper just
adds fuel to her lover's fire.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
This is what we mean
by lovingly carved.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
It's as though Bernini
was reliving his caresses

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
with his chisel,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
the falling away
of the blouse

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
perhaps the single
sexiest invitation

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
in all European sculpture.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
There's something else
unique about this sculpture.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
It's the celebration
of a spitfire.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Costanza Bonarelli

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
may have been the wife
of a lowly assistant sculptor,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
but she came
from a proud old family,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
the Piccolomini.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
So her jaw is firm,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
the rosebud mouth
is in the act of speaking,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
and not deferentially.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Everything that was
supposed to define womanhood,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
demure, chaste serenity,
is junked for Costanza.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
She's a wild thing,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
and the sculptor is hooked
on her temper.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
But it's not Costanza's temper

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
that would end up
undoing Bernini.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
It was his own.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Despite all the gentile charm,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Bernini was known
to have a low boiling point.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Underneath all those
social graces

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:17.000
was the bloodthirsty temper
of a Neapolitan gangster.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
And in one
unbelievably shocking episode,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
he lets it rip.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
It started with a rumor.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Costanza, it's whispered,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
was not so constant after all.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Seems she has a thing
about the Bernini boys,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
since she's sleeping
not just with Gian Lorenzo

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
but with his
younger brother, Luigi.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Oh, it's hard to believe,
I know,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000
that anyone would want
to get their hands

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
on anyone except
Mr. Fabulous himself,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
but could the rumors be true?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000
The trap is set
that evening.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Gian Lorenzo says breezily

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
how he has to go off
to the country the next day,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
so he won't be in town.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
But he doesn't go
into the country, does he?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Instead, early next morning,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
he goes to Costanza's house
and waits.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Luigi emerges.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
So does Costanza,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
that swelling breast
Bernini had lovingly carved

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:53.000
flattened against Luigi's chest
in a passionate embrace.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
There's a chase through
the streets, across the piazzas,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
over the bridges,
right into St. Peter's itself,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
where its official architect
does his best

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
to murder his own brother.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Gian Lorenzo grabs an iron bar

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
and smashes it
against Luigi's body,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
breaking two ribs.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
He's famous
as a miracle worker.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
This time the miracle is that he
hasn't killed his own brother.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
It takes a message
from their mother

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
to the papal cops
to separate them.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
[woman speaking Italian]

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
(Schama)
And that's
not the end of it.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
That afternoon,

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Gian Lorenzo sends a servant
to Costanza's house.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000
He doesn't cut her throat.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Instead, he slashes
her perfect face to ribbons.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
So the man who has cut stone
to create beauty

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
has cut flesh
to destroy it.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And what do you suppose
is Bernini's punishment

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
for grievous bodily harm
and attempted murder?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Oh, a really stiff sentence:
a 3,000 scudi fine,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
except that his pal
the pope waives it.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
"Naughty, naughty,"
says the pope.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
"This mustn't happen again,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
"so I sentence you
to be married.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000
"And by the way,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
"she just happens to be
the most beautiful girl in Rome.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
That should keep you
out of mischief."

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Papal wink, papal nudge.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
So Bernini is married off
to Caterina Tezio,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
daughter of a Roman lawyer.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
For his part in the fight,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
brother Luigi is banished
to Bologna.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Everyone else goes to jail:

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
the servant who did
the razor job,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
and insult added to injury,
Costanza herself,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
convicted of fornication
and adultery.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
And what happened to the bust?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Well, Bernini's new wife
wouldn't have it in the house,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000
which is just as well,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
since Gian Lorenzo couldn't
bear to look at it either.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
He might, I suppose,
have smashed it.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:05.000
But luckily, a Medici buyer
from Florence snapped it up,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
which is why
we're looking at it here

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
in the Bargello Museum
in Florence:

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
the Costanza that once was
and for us, always will be.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000
And you're thinking,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
"I don't care
how good his sculpture is.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
"I don't care
how important his art is.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
"What an absolute bastard.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Please tell me
he doesn't get off scot-free."

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Well, strangely enough,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
it's exactly from this moment
of the crime against Costanza

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:01.000
that things go swiftly downhill
for the cavaliere untouchable.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And it all went wrong

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
in the place
that mattered most for Bernini,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
the place that made
or broke artists and architects:

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
the Cathedral of St. Peter's.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
This is the facade
of St. Peter's we all know,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
but the aggressively confident
17th-century popes

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000
didn't want to stop
with this.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000
They wanted two great
bell towers at each corner

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
above where we now
see the clocks.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
It was those bells, after all,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
that would summon the faithful
for papal blessings

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.000
and make
the Christian dream real.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
But in the middle, of course,
was Michelangelo's great dome.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
So the first designs
for the towers

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
made them respectfully low,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
safe, squat,
one-story affairs.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Then along comes Bernini,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
constitutionally incapable
of deference.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
"My towers are going to be
taller than your dome," he says,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
three stories tall, in fact,

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
almost 70 meters
above the original pedestals,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
six times heavier
than the original towers.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Problem was, though,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Bernini's towers were about
to be built on swampy ground.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
It's not that Bernini
didn't know about this

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
before he got started.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
It's just that he's
surrounded by yes-men

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
who tell him
what he wants to hear:

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
that building tall towers on
dodgy ground is no real problem.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
What he needs
are brutally honest advisors

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
who aren't afraid of spelling
out the risks he's taking.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
There was one person
who knew

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
that building a tall, heavy
tower on unstable foundations

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
was asking for trouble.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
That person was Borromini.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
But it seemed to be
beneath Bernini's dignity

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
to ask his rival
for advice.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
So without the benefit
of Borromini's criticism,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Bernini sailed
straight into disaster.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:01.000
In July 1641, Bernini unveiled
his first tower to the public.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Two months later,
cracks start to appear.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Bernini takes to his bed,
won't eat, gets so ill,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
he's reported near death.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
It gets worse.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
The cracks aren't just in the
foundation of the bell tower.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
They've spread to the facade
of the main church itself.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Then, in 1644, disaster.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Pope Urban VIII,
Bernini's friend

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000
and the staunchest supporter
of the bell tower, dies.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000
There's a new pope,
Innocent X,

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000
and he sees it as his job

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
to get rid of all
the old favorites like Bernini.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
After all, he has a new
favorite, Francesco Borromini.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
So after 15 years
in Bernini's shadow,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Borromini's moment for revenge
has at last arrived.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
An inquiry is set up
to deal with Bernini's towers.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Borromini submits
detailed evidence,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:03.000
a lovingly rendered drawing
of Bernini's disaster.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
"Well, what do you expect?"
says Borromini.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
"The tower's too tall.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
"It's too heavy
for its base supports.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
"It's too unwieldy.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
"It's built recklessly
on swampy ground.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
"It's amazing, actually,
it hasn't collapsed already.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000
"It's all very well
going digging beneath the tower

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
"after the event to see
how serious the damage is.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
"If he'd have asked me,

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
"since I know
a bit about building,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I would have told him,
but he didn't."

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
On the 23rd of February, 1646,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
a meeting was held
at the Vatican

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000
to discuss the fate
of Bernini's south tower,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
but the pope had already
made his decision.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Demolish it.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
The demolition
takes 11 months.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
If Bernini had been
anywhere near St. Peter's,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
he would have seen it
and heard it:

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
the winches, the pulleys,
the columns stacked on the roof.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Down came the bell tower,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
and down with it
came Gian Lorenzo Bernini

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
from the height of fame
and reputation

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
to something like
a laughingstock.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
It's 1648.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Bernini is 50, old by
the standards of the time.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
So how did he survive
the humiliation?

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
One visiting English student
has him collapsing into despair.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
He still does get commissions,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
but not from
the biggest hitters in Rome.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
It would take a miracle now
for him to redeem himself.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.000
And then
that miracle arrived.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
A moment
of mind-boggling drama,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
a moment that wavers
between mystery and indecency.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
The body of a saint penetrated.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
The arrow,
withdrawn from its passage,

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
poised to strike again,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
her pain indistinguishable
from pleasure.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000
The gasping woman levitating,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
defying gravity
on rippling cushions of stone.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000
So who was it then
that gave Bernini the chance

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.000
to portray a saint in a way
no one else had ever dared?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
You can't imagine
a more respectable patron

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
than Cardinal Federico Cornaro,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
who came from
an old aristocratic clan

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
that wanted to build
a family chapel

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
in the church
of Santa Maria de la Victoria.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
He would have known
about Saint Teresa of Avila.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Everyone did.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
She died in her native Spain
in 1582.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
But there was something--
many things, actually--

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
which made Teresa an awkward fit
for sainthood,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
not least her levitations.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
[woman, as Teresa]
A rapture came over me
so suddenly,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
it almost lifted me
out of myself.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
I heard these words:

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
"Now I want you
to speak with angels."

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
It's not surprising, then,
that of all the modern saints,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
it was Teresa who still
had no chapel devoted to her.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
The Cornaro dynasty,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
who were patrons
of her austere order of nuns,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
the barefoot Carmelites,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
jumped in and presented Bernini

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
with the biggest challenge
of his career

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.000
but also the chance
for a spectacular comeback.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
It was the most daring drama
of the body

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
that he or any other sculptor
in the history of art

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
had ever conceived,
much less executed.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Bernini would certainly
have known about Saint Teresa.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Her autobiography was
a best-seller in Catholic Rome.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Like everyone else,
he would have been startled

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
by the earthy directness
of her story.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
[woman, as Teresa]
"Very close to me,
an angel appeared in human form.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
"In his hands,
I saw a large golden spear.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
"I felt as if he plunged this
into my heart several times,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
"so that it penetrated
all the way to my entrails.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
"When he drew it out,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
"he seemed to draw them
out with it,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
"and it left me totally inflamed
with a great love for God.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:12.000
The pain was so severe that
it made me moan several times."

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Now, if there was one thing
that Bernini was not,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
it was crude.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
He understood perfectly well

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000
that when Teresa wrote
of her raptures,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
she meant the longing
of her soul

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
for a consummated union
with God.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
It was the way
she wrote about it

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
that made it seem
as if her soul and her body

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
were the same thing.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
All of Bernini's
greatest body dramas

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
had featured figures
twisting in ascent:

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Persephone's flight
from Pluto,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Daphne rising to the sky
as if to escape stony doom.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Now it was time for him
to make Teresa levitate--

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
this time,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
not in escape from penetration
but in craving for it.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
It was time to forget
about euphemisms.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.000
The only way that Bernini

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
could possibly communicate
the flood of her sensation

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000
was to make visible
what he knew of bodily ecstasy:

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
the face of a woman at
the height of sexual euphoria.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
It's as if he's turning his own
intimate knowledge of carnal sin

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
into carnal blessing.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
So of course, this isn't
the real Teresa,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
a middle-aged nun rising up
her cell wall

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
with sisters hanging
on to her habit.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
No, this woman
is unforgettably beautiful,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
a match for the exquisite
seraph angel lover.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
They are, in their way,
a couple.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Smily face is pointing his arrow
not at her breast at all

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:23.000
but rather
lower down the torso.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
But how to make visible
both their union

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
and the tide of engulfing
feeling washing through Teresa?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000
And here Bernini has the crucial
insight of the whole piece.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:45.000
He turns her body inside out
so that her covering, her habit,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
the symbol of chastity
and containment,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.000
becomes a representation
of what's going on inside her.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
It's the accomplice
of her helpless dissolution

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:13.000
into liquid bliss.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
It is, in fact,
the climax itself,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
a storm surge
of churning sensation

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
cresting and falling as
if the marble had been molten.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
And these billows
pour themselves

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
from the smiling angel
directly into Teresa's robe,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
where they join
an ocean of heaving waves

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
that folds into
hollows and crevices

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000
like surf
breaking on a shore.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
There's nothing furtive
about any of this.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Bernini wants us to look
and look hard,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
so much that he surrounds the
performance with an audience,

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
members of the Cornaro family:
some watching the show,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000
some chatting
about what it might mean.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
There's every kind
of show lighting:

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
fake sunbeams,
hidden lights at the back.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
And as Teresa climbs
to her heights,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
the Earth really does move.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Look down here.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:46.000
The ground is opening,
and out pop the dead.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Everything is shaking
and quaking,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
even the columns
of the little chapel.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
And here, Bernini adds
the coup de grace

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
to all those critics who said
he couldn't do architecture--

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
or at least Borromini,
who specialized

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
in weird, counterintuitive
bulges and curves.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000
The most ambitious thing
he'd ever attempted,

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
the bell tower of St. Peter's,

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.000
had come crashing down
in ignominious failure.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Now it was time for Teresa
to rise up and carry with her

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.000
the resurrected reputation of
the disgraced Cavaliere Bernini.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
And you feel him,
when he's done,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
standing back and saying,
"Right. Top that."

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:58.000
No one ever could.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
The Cornaro loved their chapel.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
12,000 scudi? No problem.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Worth every scudo.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Word got round:
the dazzler was back.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Even the sour
old Pope Innocent X

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
began to sweeten on Bernini

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
as Borromini skulked unhappily
through the Vatican corridors.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
It's not that Borromini
never gets commissions

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
from the pope again.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
It's just that
it was Bernini who triumphed.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
So wherever you go in Rome now,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
you're really
in the cavaliere's city.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Popes came and went,
but Bernini endured.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
He gave up sinning,
became a model Christian,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
never strayed again,
they said.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
And what of the others
in this story?

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Costanza,
with her cut-up face,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000
eventually got out of jail

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
with the help
of her long-suffering husband.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Borromini went on to become
the great master builder

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
of ever more eccentric
and brilliant churches,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
but in the end,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
he never really felt
he got true recognition.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Eaten up by jealousy
and disappointment,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000
he ended up
by committing suicide.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
And what of brother Luigi?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Well, he returned to Rome
after his exile,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
and, deep into his 60s,
he was at it again,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
this time caught
in flagrante delicto

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000
in the precincts
of St. Peter's,

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:02.000
where he was arrested
for acts of violent sodomy.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
To clear the family name,
Bernini created this,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:18.000
the Blessed Ludovica Albertoni.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
For me, though,

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
none of those grandstanding
jobs in Rome

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
come close to this.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Why?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Because he's managed to make
visible something we all,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
if we're honest,
know we hunger for

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
but before which,
we're properly tongue-tied,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
some think which has produced
more bad writing,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
more excruciating poems

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
than anything else
you can think of.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000
No wonder when art historians
look at this,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:01.000
they tie themselves in knots
to avoid saying the obvious:

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
that we're looking at the most
intense convulsive drama

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
of the body
that any of us experience,

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000
which is not to say
that what we're looking at

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
is just a spasm
of erotic chemistry.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:19.000
It's precisely because
it isn't just that,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
because it is somehow a fusion
of physical craving

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000
and-- choose your word--

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
spiritual or emotional
transcendence

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
that Bernini's
 Ecstasy of St. Teresa

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
is a sculpture that possesses
the beholder completely,

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
the longer we stare.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
So perhaps when that
18th-century French connoisseur

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000
looked at Teresa and said,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
"If that's divine love,
I know it well,"

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000
he wasn't making
a sly joke at all

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
but doffing his hat
to Bernini

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
for using the power of art
to make the most difficult,

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
the most desirable thing
in the world:

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
the visualization
of pure bliss.
