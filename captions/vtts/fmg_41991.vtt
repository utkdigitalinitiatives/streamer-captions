00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.130
FOR MANY YEARS THE RICH
COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.730
HAVE TAKEN THE FOOD ON
THEIR PLATES FOR GRANTED.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.500
A TRIP TO THE SUPERMARKET
AND IT'S ALL THERE:

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.570
FOOD FROM EVERY
CORNER OF THE WORLD.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.130
BUT NOW THERE ARE WARNING SIGNS
THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.070
I VIEW THE CHALLENGE ON
THE FOOD FRONT AS PERHAPS

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.930
THE LEADING CHALLENGE
FACING HUMANITY TODAY.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.700
>>IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THERE
HAVE BEEN DRAMATIC SPIKES IN

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.600
FOOD PRICES - EVEN SPARKING
RIOTS ON THREE CONTINENTS.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.330
THE FUTURE WARS MIGHT BE
FOUGHT AROUND FOOD AND WATER

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.630
AS OPPOSED TO, SAY,
OIL AND TERRITORY.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.800
>>DIMINISHING NATURAL
RESOURCES AND RISING DEMAND

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.800
FROM AN EXPLODING
WORLD POPULATION

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.230
MEANS FOOD COULD BE IN
INCREASINGLY SHORT SUPPLY.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.370
THERE'S EVERY REASON TO
BE QUITE WORRIED ABOUT

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.100
FOOD SECURITY
FOR THE WORLD.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.200


00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.570
>>IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ECONOMY
CONSUMERS IN RICH COUNTRIES

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.770
HAVE GROWN USED TO A
LIMITLESS CHOICE OF FOOD

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.700
FROM ACROSS
THE WORLD.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.300
LOCAL MARKETS HAVE BEEN
REPLACED BY GLOBAL ONES,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.200
AND FOOD HAS
BECOME A COMMODITY.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:36.270


00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.630
RIDLEY ROAD MARKET IN LONDON,
ENGLAND IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.430
OF OUR GLOBAL
FOOD CHAIN.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.730
THERE'S A HUGE RANGE HERE -
EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.070
AND NOT JUST THE BRITISH SUN
- THE MEDITERRANEAN SUN,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.570
THE AFRICAN SUN, THE
SOUTH AMERICAN SUN -

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.470
PRODUCE FROM
ACROSS THE WORLD

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.030
IS BEING SOLD ON THIS
LOCAL ENGLISH MARKET.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.170


00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.000
MIRRORING SHOPS AND
SUPERMARKETS ACROSS THE GLOBE,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.400
THIS SCENE OF PLENTY,
ACCORDING TO EXPERTS

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.430
LIKE TIM LANG,
CANNOT LAST.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.330
THE NIGHTMARE SCENARIO
IS THAT THERE WILL BE

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.630
FOOD WARS, THERE WILL BE
SCARCITY WARS, THERE'LL BE

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.770
RESOURCE WARS, FIGHTING FOR
MINERALS, FOR THE FERTILIZERS,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.630
THERE'S OIL RUNNING OUT,
THERE'S CLIMATE CHANGE COMING.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.870
I THINK THE
PARTY'S OVER.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.330
THE CAPACITY OF THE WORLD TO
PRODUCE AS MUCH ABUNDANTLY

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.100
AS IT HAS DONE IS
BEGINNING TO BE SQUEEZED.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.330
UNLESS WE CHANGE HOW WE
GROW FOOD, HOW WE EAT IT,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.770
WHAT WE EAT, HOW MUCH
WE'RE PREPARED TO PAY FOR IT,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.730
WE'RE WALKING
INTO CRISIS.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.230


00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.130
I VIEW THE CHALLENGE ON
THE FOOD FRONT AS PERHAPS

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.530
THE LEADING CHALLENGE
FACING HUMANITY TODAY.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.000
>>LESTER BROWN IS THE FOUNDER
AND PRESIDENT OF THE INFLUENTIAL

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.170
CAMPAIGN GROUP, THE EARTH POLICY
INSTITUTE, AND HAS BEEN AN

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.770
ENVIRONMENTAL AND AGRICULTURAL
ANALYST FOR 50 YEARS.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.400
DURING THE LAST HALF
OF THE LAST CENTURY

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.330
THE NUMBER OF HUNGRY
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.470
WAS DECLINING, AND THEN
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.070
AFTER 2000 THE NUMBER OF
HUNGRY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.000
STOPPED DECLINING
AND BEGAN INCREASING

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.130
AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IT'S
GONE UP FAIRLY SUBSTANTIALLY.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.470
>>THE PREDICTIONS ARE
THAT A LOOMING FOOD CRISIS

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.570
WILL AFFECT RICH AND
POOR COUNTRIES ALIKE.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.200
I THINK FOOD SECURITY, EVEN FOR
THOSE OF US LIVING IN AFFLUENT

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.900
COUNTRIES, IS GOING TO BECOME
AN ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.970
TAKE MORE AND MORE OF OUR
INCOME TO FEED OURSELVES.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.100
IN THE U.S. WE'VE
BECOME ACCUSTOMED

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.400
TO RATHER CHEAP
FOOD OVER THE YEARS

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.400
AND THAT'S
BEGINNING TO CHANGE.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.400
WE'RE IN TROUBLE AND I
THINK MORE AND MORE PEOPLE

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.800
SENSE THAT NOW.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.330


00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.100
>>BUT WHAT'S CHANGED?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.270
WHY ARE WE FACING
THIS LOOMING CRISIS?

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.200
THE WORLD'S POPULATION HAS
DOUBLED OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.800
TO ALMOST
SEVEN BILLION.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.700


00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.870
AND JUST AT THE TIME WHEN THE
POPULATION IS SET TO SWELL BY

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.870
A FURTHER TWO BILLION, QUESTIONS
HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.370
ABILITY OF MODERN AGRICULTURE
TO KEEP UP WITH DEMAND.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.070
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IF WE CARRY
ON FARMING USING TODAY'S

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.330
TECHNIQUES AND WITH YIELDS AT
TODAY'S LEVELS, THEN BY 2050

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.530
WE WILL NEED TO DOUBLE THE
AMOUNT OF FOOD WE GROW.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.070
THIS INCREASE WOULD REQUIRE NEW
FARMING LAND THE SIZE OF BRAZIL

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.800
TO PRODUCE ENOUGH
FOOD TO FEED THE WORLD.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.630
THE EXPECTATION IS THAT CROP
PRICES COULD BE, ON AVERAGE,

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.770
SOME 40% HIGHER THAN THE
LONG TERM TRENDS TO DATE.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.270
>>RICHARD WARBURTON HAS
TO CONSIDER PREDICTIONS

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.530
OF FUTURE FOOD PRICES
AS THE HEAD OF THE UK'S

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.470
LARGEST AGRIBUSINESS
CONSULTANCY.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.670
THERE'S A FINITE AMOUNT OF LAND,
AND THAT FINITE AMOUNT OF USABLE

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.130
ARABLE LAND WILL NOT SUPPORT
A DOUBLING IN FOOD PRODUCTION

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.330
DUE IN 2050.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.600
I THINK POLICY MAKERS,
GOVERNMENT, ARE STARTING TO

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.700
REALIZE THERE'S A CORRELATION
BETWEEN FOOD SECURITY

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.800
AND POLITICAL
ECONOMIC STABILITY.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.100
I DON'T THINK IT'S TOO
FAR-FETCHED TO THINK THAT

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.230
FUTURE WARS MIGHT BE FOUGHT
AROUND FOOD AND WATER

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.630
AS OPPOSED TO, SAY,
OIL AND TERRITORY.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:04.600


00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.370
>>THIS ISN'T SOME
NIGHTMARE FUTURE SCENARIO.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.830
MANY EXPERTS SAY THAT WE HAVE
ALREADY SEEN THE EARLY TREMORS

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.100
OF THE CRISIS TO COME.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.970
POOR GLOBAL HARVEST IN
2007 PUSHED AN EXTRA

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.530
40 MILLION PEOPLE
INTO HUNGER.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:26.930
IN 2008 PEOPLE IN POORER
COUNTRIES ACROSS THE WORLD

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.970
TOOK TO THE STREETS.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.270
THEY HAD A
COMMON CAUSE.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.870
FOOD PRICES WERE RISING SO
FAST THAT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.570
COULD NO LONGER AFFORD
THE FOOD IN THEIR SHOPS.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.700
THIS HAS BEEN SEEN BY
MANY AS A WARNING

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.800
THAT FOOD SHORTAGES
IN YEARS TO COME

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.570
WILL CAUSE MORE POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC INSECURITY.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.070
SO WHAT ARE THE KEY FACTORS
PUSHING UP FOOD PRICES NOW

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.830
AND IN THE FUTURE?

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.400
MANY BELIEVE THAT ONE
OF THE BIGGEST FACTORS

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.130
IS CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.430


00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.800
DR. RAJENDRA PACHAURI ACCEPTED
THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.000
ON BEHALF OF
HIS ORGANIZATION,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.700
THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL
ON CLIMATE CHANGE, IN 2007.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.230
THERE'S A WHOLE RANGE OF
IMPACTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.230
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND
THESE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.530
IMPACTS ON DIFFERENT
PARTS OF THE WORLD.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.700
IN THE CASE OF, SAY, THE UNITED
KINGDOM, EXTREME EVENTS

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.830
INCLUDING DROUGHTS, FLOODS,
HUGE QUANTITIES OF RAINFALL

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.200
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,
ARE CERTAINLY GOING TO

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:51.400
HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON
THE PRODUCTION OF FOOD.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.600
IN THE CASE OF INDIA
WE'VE ESTIMATED THAT

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.600
EVERY ONE DEGREE INCREASE IN
TEMPERATURE COULD LEAD TO

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.970
5% TO 10%
REDUCTION IN YIELDS.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:08.000
AS EARLY AS 2020 SEVEN
COUNTRIES IN AFRICA ARE LIKELY

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.530
TO SUFFER A DECLINE IN YIELDS
OF SOME CROPS BY UP TO 50%.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.200
>>THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE
CHANGE ON OUR FOOD SUPPLIES

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.700
ARE PREDICTED TO BE FELT SOON
AND COULD BE FAR-REACHING.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.800
WORLDWIDE WE'RE NOT
GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH FOOD

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.070
TO FEED ALL THE PEOPLE.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:36.030
THE FIRST THING THAT'LL HAPPEN
IS THAT PRICES WILL INCREASE.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.400
THERE WILL BE PERIODS WHEN
PERHAPS WHAT THEY WANT TO EAT

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.870
MAY NOT EVEN
BE AVAILABLE.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.200
SO THERE'S EVERY REASON
TO BE QUITE WORRIED

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.000
ABOUT FOOD SECURITY
FOR THE WORLD.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.100
>>CLIMATE CHANGE FORECASTS
CAN SEEM LIKE DISCONNECTED

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.000
PREDICTIONS OF DOOM
FOR A FARAWAY TIME.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.900
BUT FOR SOME, CLIMATE
CHANGE IS ALREADY A REALITY,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:08.470
A STRUGGLE TO GET FROM
ONE DAY TO THE NEXT.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.630
DROUGHTS IN PARTS
OF KENYA HAVE BECOME

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:18.070
FOUR TIMES MORE COMMON
IN THE LAST 25 YEARS.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.230
THE COUNTRY HAS JUST SUFFERED
ITS THIRD FAILED HARVEST

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.230
IN A ROW AND THE WORST
DROUGHT IN MORE THAN A DECADE.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.200
SOME OF THE WORST HIT HAVE BEEN
THE MAASAI PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.600
HERDED LIVESTOCK IN THIS PART
OF THE WORLD FOR CENTURIES.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:50.200


00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.270
CHIEF SAMMY TARAKUAIE IS A
LEADER OF A MAASAI COMMUNITY

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.330
OF ABOUT 9,000 PEOPLE
WHO LIVE SOME 75 MILES

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.070
OUTSIDE NAIROBI
IN THE RIFT VALLEY.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.000
HE HAS SEEN THE CHANGE IN
THE LOCAL WEATHER PATTERNS

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.300
IN HIS LIFETIME.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:27.170


00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.570
>>BEFORE THE WEATHER BECAME
SO UNPREDICTABLE THIS WOULD

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.600
HAVE BEEN THE BEST TIME OF
YEAR FOR A MAASAI HERDSMAN.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:48.700


00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.030
>>THE CHIEF HAS HAD A
DRAMATIC LOSS OF CATTLE

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.700
IN THE LAST NINE
OR TEN YEARS.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:11:32.630


00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.100
>>THE REMAINS OF THE
HUNDREDS OF ANIMALS

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.570
CHIEF SAMMY HAS
LOST TO DROUGHT

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.470
OVER THE LAST FEW
YEARS ARE NEARBY.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.500
A CONSTANT REMINDER
OF WHAT HE HAS LOST.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.230
THIS CALF DIED IN APRIL.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.500
THIS WAS A
MILKING CALF

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.030
AND THE MOTHER
WAS A MILKING COW.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:55.870
AND IT DIED
WITH A SMALL CALF.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.170
CAN YOU SEE A
SMALL CALF HERE?

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.930
THIS ONE, THIS WAS
A COW AND A CALF.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.170
WHEN YOU SEE A COW DYING
YOU FEEL LIKE DYING TOO.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:09.470
BECAUSE IT IS A
PART OF YOUR LIFE.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:17.400
THE MAASAI SAY COWS
ARE A PART OF YOUR LIFE.

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.730
>>THIS IS A TRAGEDY FOR
ONE MAN AND HIS PEOPLE.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:28.830


00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.100
AND THE EXPERTS WHO SAY
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A KEY FACTOR

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.300
BEHIND THE PROBLEMS IN KENYA
BELIEVE IT COULD ALSO HIT

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.630
FOOD PRODUCTION IN
MORE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.870
WARM, DROUGHT-PRONE AREAS
OF AUSTRALIA, ARGENTINA,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.630
AND THE UNITED
STATES ARE AT RISK.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.430
AND THEY ARE ALL COUNTRIES
THAT EXPORT LARGE QUANTITIES

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.300
OF FOOD ACROSS
THE GLOBE.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.670
HALF THE WORLD'S
POPULATION COULD FACE A

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:58.370
CLIMATE-INDUCED FOOD CRISIS
BY THE END OF THE CENTURY.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:06.470


00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.470
IN MORE TEMPERATE CLIMATES THE
CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.930
ARE UNLIKELY TO
BE SO EXTREME.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.700
BUT SOME FARMERS SAY THE
EFFECTS ON AGRICULTURE

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.570
ARE ALREADY
CLEAR TO SEE.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:31.370


00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.070
THE LECKFORD ESTATE IN
ENGLAND IS A FARM OF ABOUT

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.630
4,000 ACRES THAT IS
OWNED AND RUN BY THE

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:40.070
BRITISH SUPERMARKET
CHAIN, WAITROSE.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.070
MORE THAN A THOUSAND
FRIESIAN CATTLE PRODUCE

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.370
MORE THAN FIVE MILLION LITERS
OF MILK A YEAR, AND APPLES,

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:52.300
PEARS, MUSHROOMS, AND
CEREALS ARE ALSO GROWN HERE.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:55.330
FARMER IAN DALTON SAYS
THAT GLOBAL WARMING

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:58.970
IS ALREADY
HAVING AN EFFECT.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.570
DURING THE 2007, 2008 YEARS
AND THE HARVEST OF 2007,

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.530
WE'VE SEEN
HUGE VOLATILITY.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.570
SO, YOU KNOW, PRICES OF WHEAT
DOUBLING AND THEN HALVING

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.900
IN LESS THAN 12 MONTHS IS AN
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.370
POSITION FOR FARMERS TO
MANAGE THEIR BUSINESSES.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.300
>>IAN HAS SEEN THE PRICES HE
HAS PAID FOR A TON OF WHEAT

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:26.370
SWING FROM $140 UP TO $300
AND THEN BACK DOWN AGAIN

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:31.230
TO $140 IN THE
LAST TWO YEARS.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:34.430
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT FARMERS
HAVE GOT TO FACE IS VOLATILITY.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.830
AND WHAT IT DOES TO ME
IS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:39.000
TO DECIDE WHAT
TO GROW NEXT YEAR.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.070
AND THAT WILL
AFFECT THE YIELD.

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.330
>>MANY BELIEVE THAT THE
VOLATILITY IN THE GRAIN MARKETS

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:50.530
IS THE RESULT, AT LEAST IN
PART, OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:53.530
WHETHER YOU CALL IT GLOBAL
WARMING OR GLOBAL CHANGE,

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.000
IT'S CERTAINLY HAVING
WHAT I THINK IS HAVING

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.600
A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN
TERMS OF THIS VOLATILITY.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.370


00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.530
WE'VE BEEN GROWING APPLES ON
THE FARM FOR THE BEST PART OF

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.930
70 YEARS AND WE ARE SEEING
THIS TREND TO EARLIER SPRINGS.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:13.070
WHAT WE'VE HAD IS A VERY WET
AND COLD WINTER AFTER A RUN OF

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.070
VERY MILD WINTERS, AND IT'S THIS
CHANGEABILITY, THIS VOLATILITY.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.900
YOU KNOW, WE SEEM TO SET
ANOTHER METEOROLOGICAL

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.270
RECORD EVERY OTHER
MONTH THESE DAYS

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:27.500
AND I THINK THAT IS ALL
PART OF GLOBAL WARMING.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.200
THERE IS ONLY ONE PLANET,
THERE IS ONLY A LIMITED

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.230
AMOUNT OF THE
RESOURCES WE USE.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.230
WE WILL HAVE TO REDUCE
OUR OWN CONSUMPTION.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.230
IF WE KEEP GROWING AS WE ARE,
WE'LL NEED TWO OR THREE PLANETS

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:45.070
NEVER MIND ONE.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.500
>>SO EVEN IN MORE TEMPERATE
PARTS OF THE WORLD,

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.870
CLIMATE CHANGE IS SET
TO MAKE AGRICULTURE

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:57.970
EVEN LESS PREDICTABLE FOR
FARMERS AND FOR CONSUMERS.

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:02.330
FOR SHOPPERS, WHEREVER
THEIR FOOD HAS BEEN GROWN

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.330
THERE WILL BE LESS
CERTAINTY ABOUT

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:10.730
THE AVAILABILITY OF FOOD,
ITS QUALITY, AND ITS PRICE.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.230
SOME OF THE WORLD'S KEY
NATURAL RESOURCES NEEDED

00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.970
FOR FOOD PRODUCTION
MAY ALSO BE UNDER THREAT.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.730
ONE LARGELY UNSEEN,
UNNOTICED, BUT CRUCIALLY

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.030
IMPORTANT COMMODITY
ESSENTIAL FOR TODAY'S

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:29.470
INDUSTRIALIZED, INTENSIVE
FORM OF AGRICULTURE IS OIL.

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:37.730


00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.300
OIL IS NEEDED FOR THE
TRACTORS AND THE TRANSPORT

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.030
USED IN AGRICULTURE.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.830
AND OF COURSE AS
FUEL FOR COOKING.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:50.030
AND WHAT ABOUT THE
FERTILIZERS AND THE PESTICIDES?

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:51.870
OIL AGAIN.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.830


00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.370
AND THEN THERE'S
STORAGE, PROCESSING

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.230
AND OFTEN OIL-BASED
PACKAGING AS WELL.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:06.530


00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:09.200
IT CAN TAKE UP TO
70 MILLILITERS OF OIL

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.500
TO PRODUCE A 100
GRAM PORK CHOP...

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:21.970
IT'S NEARLY DOUBLE THAT FOR
A 100 GRAM PACK OF CHEESE...

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.930
A TOMATO GROWN IN
A GREENHOUSE CAN USE

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:32.230
MORE THAN A THIRD
OF A LITER OF OIL.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.970
BUT THE PREDICTIONS ARE
THAT THE OIL WHICH HAS

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.700
ENABLED OUR INCREASINGLY
INTENSIVE AND MECHANIZED

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.570
MODERN FARMING TECHNIQUES
WILL NOT LAST FOREVER.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:45.430
AND WE'VE ALREADY
HAD WARNINGS

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:49.500
IN THE SHAPE OF
INCREASING OIL PRICES.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:57.430
OIL HIT A RECORD
$147 PER BARREL IN 2008.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:02.270
IT HELPED TO PUSH FOOD
INFLATION UP TO DOUBLE FIGURES.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.770
SOME FEAR THAT OIL PRICES
COULD REACH $200 PER BARREL

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.530
IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.600
SO WHAT EFFECT COULD A
DRASTIC DROP-OFF IN OIL SUPPLY

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.500
HAVE ON FOOD
PRODUCTION?

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.070
ONE COUNTRY THAT MAY HAVE THE
ANSWER HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:24.930
THE KIND OF OIL SHOCK PREDICTED
FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD: CUBA.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:38.170


00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:42.100
UNTIL 1989, CUBA EXCHANGED ITS
ABUNDANT SUGAR PRODUCTION

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:47.600
FOR CHEAP IMPORTED SUBSIDIZED
OIL FROM THE EASTERN BLOC.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.130
IN FACT IT WAS SO CHEAP
THAT CUBA PURSUED A HIGHLY

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:57.000
INDUSTRIALIZED FUEL-THIRSTY
FORM OF AGRICULTURE.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.370
AFTER THE COLLAPSE
OF THE SOVIET UNION

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.300
THE SUPPLY OF CRUDE OIL
WENT DOWN BY ABOUT 50%

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.670
WITH DRAMATIC IMPLICATIONS
FOR FOOD PRODUCTION.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:10.930
IT WAS AS IF THE OIL TAP
WAS SUDDENLY TURNED OFF.

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:19.200


00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.330
ALL THOSE SUBSIDIES WE
RECEIVED FROM ABROAD,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.670
AND ESPECIALLY
OIL, WAS REDUCED

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:28.370
AND THE ECONOMY
BASICALLY COLLAPSED.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:32.770
WE HAD TO GROW
FOOD WITH LESS OIL

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:37.070
AND THE FARMING SYSTEMS
WERE ADAPTED TO THAT.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.470
WE HAD TO CHANGE FROM VERY
CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.900
TO A MORE SELF-SUFFICIENT
AND LOCALLY BASED AGRICULTURE

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.600
AND COUNTING ON THE RESOURCES
THAT WE HAD AT THAT MOMENT.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.500
>>FERNANDO FUNES IS
WORKING ON A NEW LOW-OIL,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.000
HIGH-YIELD
APPROACH TO FARMING

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.130
THAT MAY HAVE LESSONS
FOR US ALL IN THE FUTURE.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.030
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS VERY
DIFFERENT TO THE VAST

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:05.670
SINGLE-CROP FIELDS YOU SEE IN
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.930
HERE THERE ARE ROWS OF SEVERAL
PLANTS GROWING SIDE BY SIDE.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.430
ANIMALS CAN BE
REARED ON FARM WASTE

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.270
AND THEY ARE ALSO
USED TO WORK THE LAND.

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:18.330
IT'S LIKE AGRICULTURAL
MIX 'N MATCH.

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:22.770
EVERY BIT OF LAND IS USED,
MAXIMIZING PRODUCTION.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.100
THIS KIND OF FARMING THAT
COMBINES MANY DIFFERENT CROPS

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:33.200
AND LIVESTOCK AND SO ON IS SET
UP TO CAPTURE ENERGY FROM SUN

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.470
AND TO MAKE BETTER USE
OF WATER AND NUTRIENTS.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.100
IN THE CONVENTIONAL WAY OF
FARMING, ABOUT FIVE CALORIES

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:48.870
ARE NECESSARY TO PRODUCE ONE
CALORIE IN TERMS OF PRODUCE.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.400
IN THIS KIND OF FARMING,
BIODIVERSITY MAKES POSSIBLE

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.500
TO PRODUCE ABOUT FIVE
PER ONE CALORIE INPUT.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.170
>>USING FERNANDO'S
CALCULATIONS,

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.230
THAT WOULD MAKE
THIS KIND OF LOW-OIL,

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.500
POLY-CROPPING
APPROACH TO AGRICULTURE

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.300
25 TIMES MORE EFFICIENT THAN
INDUSTRIALIZED MODERN FARMING.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.130
YOU DON'T USE
FUEL-THIRSTY TRACTORS.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:15.230
ACTUALLY YOU COULDN'T FIT THEM
IN BETWEEN THE ROWS OF PLANTS.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:22.500
AND YOU CAN PRODUCE A
LOT OF FOOD IN A SMALL AREA.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.970
BUT THIS KIND OF FARMING
IS NOT A MIRACLE SOLUTION

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.570
TO A FUEL SHORTAGE.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.700
A RETURN TO WHAT MANY WOULD SEE
AS A PRE-INDUSTRIALIZED FORM OF

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.770
AGRICULTURE WORLDWIDE WOULD
REQUIRE MILLIONS MORE PEOPLE TO

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:43.070
WORK THE LAND AND A DRAMATIC
RISE IN THE PRICE OF FOOD.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:51.270


00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.830
CUBA DIDN'T HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT
TO ADAPT ITS FARMING TECHNIQUES

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:58.530
IN THIS WAY, AND THE LOSS OF OIL
TO THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:02.130
HASN'T BEEN
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.830


00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.770
ONE OF THE FIRST CASUALTIES
WAS THE RANGE OF FOOD

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:14.070
THAT HAD BEEN AVAILABLE
FOR PEOPLE TO EAT.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.570
WHILST CUBANS HAVE AN INTAKE
OF CALORIES NOT MUCH BELOW

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.830
THE UNITED STATES,
MUCH OF THE CUBAN DIET

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:25.900
IS MADE UP OF
VEGETABLES AND PULSES.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:30.200
CUBANS GET ABOUT THREE TIMES
LESS OF THEIR FOOD ENERGY

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.300
FROM ANIMAL PRODUCTS
LIKE MEAT AND DAIRY

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.930
THAN THE AVERAGE
WESTERN COUNTRY.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:42.070


00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.070
TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE
OIL CRISIS, AND DESPITE THE

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:48.330
CHANGING DIET AND ADAPTED
AGRICULTURAL PROCESSES,

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.300
CUBA STILL IMPORTS
ABOUT HALF OF ITS FOOD.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:23:05.900


00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.600
A FUEL SHOCK CAN QUITE
QUICKLY BECOME A FOOD SHOCK.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.700
SO IF, AS SOME BELIEVE,
GLOBAL OIL RESERVES ARE NOW

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:15.870
UNDER THREAT, WE MAY
HAVE TO COMPLETELY RETHINK

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.070
OUR HEAVILY MECHANIZED
FORM OF AGRICULTURE.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.630
OIL NOT ONLY PROVIDES FUEL
FOR AGRICULTURAL VEHICLES,

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:27.730
IT FUELS OVER 600 MILLION
AUTOMOBILES WORLDWIDE.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:34.100


00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.270
ONE ALTERNATIVE
TO OIL-BASED FUEL

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.500
IS FUEL MADE WITH
PLANTS AND GRAIN.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.730
ENTHUSIASM FOR THESE
SO-CALLED "BIOFUELS"

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.430
HAS GROWN AS OIL
PRICES HAVE RISEN

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.970
AND CLIMATE CHANGE
FEARS ESCALATED.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.300
BUT SOME BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS ANOTHER

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.030
AND VERY SERIOUS
THREAT TO FOOD SECURITY.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.670


00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:04.700
INDIA HAS EMBRACED THE IDEA
OF BIOFUELS IN RECENT YEARS.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.400
BUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE JUST
A 10% RISE IN THE COST OF FOOD

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.970
MEANS ANOTHER 40 MILLION
PEOPLE ARE PUSHED INTO POVERTY,

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.430
IT'S A
CONTROVERSIAL POLICY.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:24.500


00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.370
THIS FIELD IS PLANTED
WITH JATROPHA.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:31.100
THERE'S QUITE A BUZZ ABOUT
IT IN ENVIRONMENTAL CIRCLES.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.900
IT'S SEEN AS THE LATEST
RENEWABLE ALTERNATIVE

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.100
TO FOSSIL FUEL.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.770
IT'S BEING GROWN IN
CHATTISGARH IN CENTRAL INDIA

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:43.430
AN AREA NOW DUBBED
"INDIA'S BIOFUEL STATE".

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:48.070
BEFORE JATROPHA WAS PLANTED,
18 FAMILIES USED TO GET FOOD

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:51.630
FROM THIS FIELD WHICH WAS
REGARDED AS COMMON LAND.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.900
THE LOCAL FARMERS HAD
THEIR CROPS UPROOTED

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.770
BY THE AUTHORITIES.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:00.930
THEY ARE NOW RELYING
ON FOOD HANDOUTS.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.300
THE VILLAGERS HAVE
BEEN JOINING FORCES

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.300
TO RESIST THE
PLANTING OF JATROPHA.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:15.470


00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.930
THE VILLAGERS HAVE RIPPED
UP SOME OF THE JATROPHA

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.030
BUT IT'S BEEN
REPLANTED.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.030
AJI DAKKA HAS BEEN JAILED
FOR HER RESISTANCE.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.170
SHE AND OTHER VILLAGERS
VOW TO FIGHT ON.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:26:08.930


00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.830
INDIA WANTS 20% OF
THE NATION'S DIESEL FUEL

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:15.430
TO COME FROM CROPS IN
JUST EIGHT YEARS' TIME.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.570
THIS WOULD
REQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL

00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.970
14 MILLION
HECTARES OF LAND.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:25.700
THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT SAYS
THAT LAND USED TO FEED THE

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:30.070
POPULATION SHOULD NOT BE
USED TO GROW CROPS FOR FUEL.

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.100
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY
REPORTED CASES OF FARMERS

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:38.370
AROUND THE DEVELOPING WORLD
BEING THROWN OFF THEIR LAND.

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:43.000
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE WORLD TODAY
IS AN EMERGING COMPETITION

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.670
BETWEEN CARS AND PEOPLE
FOR THE WORLD'S GRAIN SUPPLY.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:55.230


00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:57.500
AND IF GOVERNMENTS
DO NOT INTERVENE,

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.570
IF WE JUST LET THE MARKET
GO WITH THIS AND KEEP

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.970
SUBSIDIZING THE CONVERSION
OF GRAIN INTO FUEL,

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.370
THE WORLD'S GOING
TO BE IN TROUBLE.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.000
THE ECONOMIC INSTABILITY
LEADING TO POLITICAL

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.730
INSTABILITY AND IT BECOMES
A THREAT TO SECURITY.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.470
AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE
QUITE REALIZED THAT YET.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:17.300
I MEAN, THE IRONY IS THAT THE
U.S., IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:24.200
ITS OIL INSECURITY, HAS CREATED
GLOBAL FOOD INSECURITY

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:29.230
ON A SCALE THAT
WE'VE NOT SEEN BEFORE.

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:33.100
>>THE TREND TOWARDS USING
AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR FUEL

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.400
RATHER THAN FOOD
IS WORLDWIDE.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.430
IN THE U.S., AN ESTIMATED
ONE-THIRD OF THE COUNTRY'S

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:46.200
MAIZE CROP COULD GO
TO PRODUCE FUEL BY 2010.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.730
IN BRITAIN, SUGAR AND OILSEED
RAPE ARE THE COUNTRY'S

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:53.670
LARGEST BIOFUEL CROPS,
AND TOGETHER LAST YEAR

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.830
THEY PROVIDED 60
MILLION LITERS OF FUEL.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:08.570


00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.000
THIS IS BRITISH SUGAR'S
WISSINGTON PLANT -

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.500
THE LARGEST SUGAR
REFINERY IN EUROPE.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.500
BUT SUGARBEET HERE DOESN'T
ONLY GO TO MAKE SUGAR,

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.700
IT ALSO MAKES BIOFUEL.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.000
IN LINE WITH EUROPEAN
UNION POLICY,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.230
THE PROPORTION OF BIOFUELS
BURNED IN VEHICLES IN THE UK

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:31.630
MUST REACH ALMOST
6% DURING 2010.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.630
ACROSS THE WORLD THE RISE OF
BIOFUEL PRODUCTION HAS BEEN

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:39.900
LINKED TO THE FOOD PRICE
RISES SEEN IN RECENT YEARS.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.670
DR. JEREMY WOODS
IS ONE OF BRITAIN'S

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:48.000
TOP EXPERTS
ON BIOFUELS.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.100
IN PART IT'S LIKELY THAT
BIOFUELS WERE RESPONSIBLE

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:56.470
FOR PART OF THE INCREASE IN
THE FOOD PRICES, BUT IN FACT

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:59.500
THAT'S BEEN REALLY QUITE
SUBSTANTIALLY EXAGGERATED.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.630
AND THAT ARGUMENT I THINK HAS
CLOUDED OUT THE POTENTIAL

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.300
BENEFITS THAT BIOFUELS AND
BIOENERGY COULD BRING TO A

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:11.070
FUTURE WORLD WHERE OIL AND
GAS ARE BECOMING CONSTRAINED.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.200
IN THE FUTURE, THOUGH, IF
BIOFUELS ARE REGARDED AS THE

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:18.430
WHOLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM,
IT'S LIKELY THAT THEY WOULD

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:22.330
CAUSE REAL PROBLEMS IN TERMS
OF COMPETITION FOR FOOD.

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.000
WE'VE GOT SOME FUNDAMENTAL
THINKING TO DO ABOUT THE WAY

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.270
FOOD IS PRODUCED AND USED
GLOBALLY, AND THAT SHOULD BE

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:31.730
DONE IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO
MANAGE THIS BALANCE OF SUPPLY

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.600
AND DEMAND SO WE GET BACK
TO A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.730
SURPLUS FOOD BUT THAT
SURPLUS FOOD IS BEING USED

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:42.000
PRODUCTIVELY - I.E., FOR
BIOENERGY, FOR BIOFUELS.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.500
>>IF THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST
FEW YEARS IS ANYTHING TO GO BY,

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:48.470
FINDING THAT BALANCE
WILL BE DIFFICULT.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.330
THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME
WAY TO ENSURE THAT BIOFUELS

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:56.200
FOR THE RICH DOESN'T COME AT THE
EXPENSE OF FOOD FOR THE POOR.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:30:00.930
IT'S AS MUCH A POLITICAL
PROBLEM AS A PRACTICAL ONE.

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:04.800
ANOTHER OF THE WORLD'S KEY
RESOURCES IS SUFFERING

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.570
FROM OVER EXPLOITATION,
AND AGAIN IT IS VITAL

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.630
TO KEEP THE GLOBAL
POPULATION FROM HUNGER.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.070
MORE THAN ONE BILLION
PEOPLE WORLDWIDE

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:19.730
DO NOT HAVE
ACCESS TO SAFE WATER.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.470
GLOBAL WATER CONSUMPTION
IS PREDICTED TO DOUBLE

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.800
EVERY 20 YEARS, AND
WATER IS KEY TO TODAY'S

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:29.400
INTENSIVE MECHANIZED
FORM OF AGRICULTURE.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.830


00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.870
IN FACT, MOST OF WHAT WE
EAT DRAWS DOWN HEAVILY

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.670
ON GLOBAL
WATER RESOURCES.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.630
IT CAN TAKE UP TO 130
MILLILITERS OF WATER

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:46.830
TO GROW A GRAM
OF LETTUCE...

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:52.100
3.4 LITERS TO PRODUCE
ONE GRAM OF RICE...

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:57.770
AND ONE GRAM OF LAMB CAN USE
NEARLY 15 LITERS OF WATER.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:03.470


00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.530
IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD,
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:10.870
CAN USE UP TO 3,000 LITERS
OF FOREIGN WATER A DAY...

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.700
AND MOST OF IT IN
THE FORM OF FOOD.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:24.670


00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:29.900
PUNJAB, KNOWN AS
INDIA'S BREADBASKET.

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.500
THIS SMALL STATE ABOUT 200
MILES NORTHWEST OF DELHI

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:39.300
PRODUCES ONE-FIFTH OF
ALL THE COUNTRY'S WHEAT.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:44.130
AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
ARE GOLDEN FIELDS OF WHEAT

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.700
READY TO BE
HARVESTED.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.600
BUT LOOKS CAN
BE DECEIVING.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.530
FOOD PRODUCTION IN THIS
REGION IS NOW UNDER THREAT.

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:59.900
"PUNJAB" MEANS "THE LAND OF THE
FIVE RIVERS", BUT MANY DECADES

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:06.600
OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE HAVE
STARTED TO DRAIN THE STATE DRY.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.170
SUKHDEV SINGH IS A PUNJABI
FARMER WHO HAS BEEN

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.170
WORKING THIS LAND
SINCE THE 1970'S.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:34.770


00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:38.000
SUKHDEV HAS BEEN FORCED
TO DRILL DEEPER AND DEEPER

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.370
DOWN FOR WATER TO IRRIGATE
HIS FIVE ACRES OF LAND,

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:45.230
DRILLING TEN
WELLS IN TOTAL.

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:49.730
BUT THE DEEPER THEY GO, THE
POORER THE QUALITY OF WATER.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:54.770
IT'S MORE SALTY AND MUCH LESS
EFFECTIVE FOR IRRIGATION.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:33:21.970


00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.200
THOUSANDS OF FARMERS IN PUNJAB
ARE BEING FORCED TO BORROW

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.030
BEYOND THEIR MEANS TO PAY
FOR THE SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:33.670
NEEDED TO DIG THE NEW DEEP
WELLS AND IRRIGATE THEIR CROPS.

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:37.900
SUKHDEV SINGH TOO HAS HAD
TO BORROW TO DIG HIS WELLS.

00:33:37.900 --> 00:34:19.770


00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:24.730
IN SUKHDEV'S OWN VILLAGE THERE
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL SUICIDES

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.370
IN RECENT YEARS.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:30.470
IT'S SIMILAR
ACROSS PUNJAB.

00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.570
AND MANY FARM WORKERS ARE
NOW MOVING OUT OF AGRICULTURE

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:37.830
ALTOGETHER, BELIEVING THAT
THE SITUATION IS IRREVERSIBLE.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:49.670


00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:53.770
PUNJAB'S WATER TABLE IS DROPPING
BY AS MUCH AS A METER A YEAR.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.670
WHEAT PRODUCTION ACROSS
THE STATE HAS BEEN IN DECLINE

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.300
FOR A DECADE.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:05.800


00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.830
INDIAN AUTHOR, VANDANA SHIVA,
HAS INVESTIGATED WHAT WATER

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.270
SCARCITY MEANS FOR THE GLOBAL
FOOD SUPPLY WE ALL DEPEND ON.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.300
I THINK WATER SCARCITY IS
NOT A PROBLEM OF THE FUTURE;

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.030
IT'S HAPPENING. I
WITNESS IT ALL THE TIME.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.900
IT'S NOT ABOUT FUTURE WORLD
WARS OVER WATER, IT'S ABOUT

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:27.270
TODAY'S WARS OVER A
CONSTANTLY SHRINKING RESOURCE

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:30.800
IN A PERIOD OF AN INCREASING
APPETITE FOR WATER

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.130
IN A GLOBALIZED ECONOMY THAT
NO MORE SEES ITS OWN FOOTPRINT

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.930
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH
WATER THEY'VE USED.

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.270
>>AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
WITH THEIR INSATIABLE APPETITE

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.530
FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF FOODS
FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.700
SHARE A LARGE
PART OF THE BLAME.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:51.600
IF A FARMER GROWS
LETTUCE IN PUNJAB,

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.830
HE IS USING GROUNDWATER
TO MAKE THAT LETTUCE GROW.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:59.130
WHEN THAT LETTUCE
IS EXPORTED,

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.100
IT CARRIES WITH
IT VIRTUAL WATER.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.230
IT CARRIES A VERY
HEAVY WATER FOOTPRINT.

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:08.400
IN EFFECT THE RICH
COUNTRIES, THEY HAVE

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.830
IMPORTED VIRTUAL WATER,
WHICH THEY'RE NOT SEEING,

00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:16.600
BUT THEY HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY
EXPORTED DROUGHT.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.200
>>THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT
THE PROBLEM OF WORLDWIDE

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.870
WATER SCARCITY
CAN BE IGNORED.

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:25.200
WITHIN 15 YEARS EXPERTS
PREDICT THAT WORLD

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.500
WATER SHORTAGES COULD
REDUCE FOOD PRODUCTION

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.030
BY MORE THAN THE ENTIRE
CURRENT U.S. GRAIN CROP.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.900
WHILST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
HAVE BEEN IMPORTING FOOD

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.900
FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE TO
SATISFY DOMESTIC DEMAND,

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:43.930
THEIR OWN FOOD PRODUCTION
HAS ALSO BEEN SUFFERING.

00:36:43.930 --> 00:36:49.100
WORLDWIDE, WE EACH EAT ON
AVERAGE 20 KILOGRAMS OF FISH

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:50.630
EVERY YEAR.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.730
BUT SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT
THE WORLD'S STOCKS OF SEAFOOD

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.970
COULD COLLAPSE BY 2048.

00:36:56.970 --> 00:37:02.030


00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:06.530
GRIMSBY, ONE OF BRITAIN'S
BEST KNOWN FISHING HARBORS.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:15.030


00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:19.130
THIRTY YEARS AGO THERE WERE
AROUND 6,000 FISHERMEN WORKING

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:24.370
THE SEAS AROUND THIS AREA AND
ABOUT 40,000 JOBS BACK ON LAND.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:29.700
IT'S VERY
DIFFERENT TODAY.

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.570
THIS IS A RARE EVENT IN
GRIMSBY NOW: A UK TRAWLER

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:39.400
UNLOADING ITS OWN CATCH
HERE ON THE DOCKSIDE.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:44.130
THE UK IS INCREASINGLY
RELIANT ON FISH IMPORTS.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.970
GRIMSBY, ONCE THE PRIDE
OF BRITISH FISHING,

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.830
IS NOW MAINLY A DISTRIBUTION
AND PROCESSING CENTER

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:52.700
FOR OTHER
COUNTRIES' FISH.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:38:01.370


00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:05.230
EACH WEEKDAY MORNING
THERE'S A FISH MARKET.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.570
25,000 TONS OF FISH IS
SOLD HERE EACH YEAR.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:14.330
BUT THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED
TO SOME 60 YEARS AGO

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.270
WHEN THE GRIMSBY
FISHING FLEET ALONE

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:23.000
LANDED 200,000 TONS
OF FISH OVER 12 MONTHS.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.330
CALLUM ROBERTS
IS ONE OF THE UK'S

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:30.170
LEADING MARINE
CONSERVATIONISTS.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.770
COLLECTIVELY THE
AMOUNT OF BOTTOM FISH,

00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:35.530
THOSE THAT ARE CAUGHT
USING BOTTOM TRAWLS,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.170
HAS DECLINED BY OVER 90% SINCE
THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.370
SO THERE'S LESS
THAN ONE FISH AROUND

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:43.670
FOR EVERY TEN THAT
THERE WERE THEN.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:47.400
>>CALLUM HAS BEEN MONITORING
THE FISH STOCKS' FALL.

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.270
IN THE 19TH CENTURY SHOALS
OF HADDOCK WERE REPORTED

00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.970
THAT WOULD STRETCH
FOR 150 MILES

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:54.770
ALONG THE
YORKSHIRE COAST;

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:57.130
THEY'D BE THREE
OR FOUR MILES WIDE

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.370
AND REALLY YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO GO VERY FAR FROM PORT

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:03.100
TO GET AN EXCELLENT
DAY'S CATCH.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:07.370
THAT ABUNDANCE REALLY
CONTINUED THROUGH THE 1950'S

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.700
AND INTO THE 1960'S.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.630
WE WERE STILL CATCHING A GREAT
DEAL OF COD AND HADDOCK THEN,

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.900
BUT IT'S BEEN IN
DECLINE EVER SINCE THEN

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:19.570
UNTIL THE POINT TODAY WHERE
THERE'S HARDLY ANY LEFT.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:22.130
>>OVERFISHING HAS BEEN
BLAMED FOR THE DRAMATIC

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.070
DROP IN FISH STOCKS...

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.570
AND THE SIZE OF
THE FISH CAUGHT.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.100
A LOT OF THE FISH THAT YOU
SEE IN A MARKET LIKE THIS

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.400
HAVE NOT EVEN REACHED
SEXUAL MATURITY,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.700
SO THEY HAVEN'T HAD A
CHANCE TO REPRODUCE YET.

00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.200
AND AS FISHING PRESSURE HAS
RISEN, THE AMOUNT OF FISH IN

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.100
THE SEA HAS DWINDLED AND THEIR
SIZES HAVE GOT MUCH SMALLER.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:47.300
>>MORE THAN 80% OF UK FISH
SPECIES ARE UNDER THREAT.

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:54.470
THE COUNTRY NOW LANDS 15
TIMES LESS FISH THAN IN 1920.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:59.430
SOME EXPERTS CLAIM THAT THE
DOMESTIC FISHING INDUSTRY

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:03.170
COULD DIE OUT UNLESS
THE UK CATCH IS CUT BY HALF

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:09.100
AND FISHING BANNED
IN A THIRD OF ITS SEAS.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.870
MEANWHILE THE COUNTRY IS EATING
MORE FISH THAN EVER BEFORE.

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.730
AND THE FISH TO SUPPLY THIS
$9 BILLION A YEAR MARKET

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.330
NEEDS TO COME
FROM SOMEWHERE.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.970
AND THEY COULD COME FROM OFF
THE COAST OF POORER COUNTRIES

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:27.230
WHO HAVE BEEN PAID TO
ALLOW FISHING IN THEIR SEAS

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:32.230
EVEN IF THEY HAVE THEIR
OWN FOOD SHORTAGES.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:34.800
ONE OF THOSE
COUNTRIES IS SENEGAL,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.630
ONE OF THE POOREST
COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:43.130
IT'S EARLY MORNING AT THE
BEACH IN DAKAR, AND PAPANDOY

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:47.970
AND HIS CREW ARE HEADING
OUT FOR THEIR DAY'S FISHING.

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:51.800
LOCALS HAVE BEEN FISHING
IN PIROGUES FOR CENTURIES.

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:56.000
THE ONLY REAL CHANGE IS
THE MOTOR AT THE BACK.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:11.800


00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.700
>>ABOUT 200,000 PEOPLE WORK IN
THE FISHING INDUSTRY IN SENEGAL.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.830
IT'S THEIR LIVELIHOOD. BUT
THESE DAYS THE LOCAL FISHERMEN

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:23.730
HAVEN'T GOT THESE WATERS
ENTIRELY TO THEMSELVES.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:27.330
FOR YEARS NOW, TRAWLERS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:30.230
HAVE FISHED THESE WATERS
- SOME ILLEGALLY,

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:34.770
SOME WITH THE AGREEMENT OF
THE SENEGALESE GOVERNMENT.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.370
ABOUT 25,000 TONS OF
FISH IS EXPORTED TO THE

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.600
EUROPEAN UNION
FROM HERE EACH YEAR.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.200
AND LOCAL FISHERMEN HAVE
NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:42:31.700


00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.100
>>LAST YEAR THE EUROPEAN UNION
PAID DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.770
OVER 200 MILLION DOLLARS TO
ALLOW MODERN EUROPEAN FLEETS

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:42.630
TO FISH THEIR WATERS.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:47.930
THE EU USED TO HAVE AN
ARRANGEMENT LIKE THIS

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.270
WITH SENEGAL, BUT IT
ENDED OVER COMPLAINTS

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:56.400
THAT TOO MANY FISH
WERE BEING TAKEN.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.230
DOWN AT DAKAR HARBOR THE
QUAYSIDES ARE JAM PACKED

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.970
WITH MODERN
INDUSTRIAL TRAWLERS.

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:07.070
SOME SAY IT'S OPEN
SEASON OFF SENEGAL'S COAST.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:09.330
THAT'S HARDLY
SURPRISING.

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:11.870
THERE'S BIG
MONEY AT STAKE.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.230
THE GLOBAL FISHING
INDUSTRY IS SAID TO BE

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:21.830
WORTH MORE THAN
$160 BILLION A YEAR.

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.730
MOUSSA FAYE FROM
THE CHARITY <i>ACTIONAID</i>

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:27.030
CAMPAIGNS AGAINST
OVERFISHING

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.430
AND ARGUES THAT
EUROPEAN TRAWLERS

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:34.530
ARE STILL FINDING WAYS TO
FISH OFF SENEGAL'S COAST.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.770
SO HERE WE HAVE A LOT OF FISHING
BOATS FROM SOUTHERN EUROPE,

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:42.770
SPAIN, PORTUGAL,
OR FRANCE, ET CETERA.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:51.070
EUROPEAN ENTERPRISES WHO COME
FOR OUR RESOURCES AND WHO

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:56.230
EXPORT THE FISH AND REPATRIATE
ALSO THE PROFIT THEY MAKE

00:43:56.230 --> 00:44:01.530
AT THE EXPENSE OF MILLIONS
OF SENEGALESE PEOPLE.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.130
THERE IS NO SERIOUS
LIMITATION ALSO

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:08.400
FOR THE NUMBER OF
TRAWLERS AUTHORIZED TO FISH.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.230
I THINK THAT THIS FISH
RESOURCE SHOULD SERVE

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:14.170
THE SENEGALESE PEOPLE,
SERVE THE POOR PEOPLE HERE,

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:18.400
SHOULD BE A SOURCE OF
LIVELIHOOD FOR THESE PEOPLE.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.170
>>EACH YEAR MORE AND
MORE SENEGALESE FISHERMEN

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.000
WALK AWAY
FROM THE SEA,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.830
TURNING THEIR BACK ON
CENTURIES OF TRADITION.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.530
THE SENEGALESE DIET
IS BEING CHANGED TOO.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:34.130
FISH HAS TRADITIONALLY
BEEN THE CHEAPEST FORM

00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:35.900
OF ANIMAL PROTEIN
HERE, MAKING UP THE

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.300
LARGE MAJORITY OF
PROTEIN IN THE LOCAL DIET

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.230
AS IT DOES FOR A BILLION
PEOPLE ON THE PLANET TODAY.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:55.230


00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:58.100
THREE QUARTERS OF GLOBAL
FISH STOCKS ARE NOW FULLY

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.270
OR OVER EXPLOITED.

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.300
IF WE CARRY ON AS WE
ARE, ALL GLOBAL FISHERIES

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.070
COULD COLLAPSE BY THE
MIDDLE OF THE CENTURY,

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.400
MAKING FISH AN EXPENSIVE
DELICACY FOR THE RICH

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:14.200
AND RESULTING IN HUNGER FOR
MILLIONS OF THE WORLD'S POOR.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:30.370


00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.430
IT'S NOT JUST FISH
SUFFERING FROM

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.070
AN IMBALANCE BETWEEN
DEMAND AND SUPPLY.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.700
INCREASED CONSUMPTION OF
MEAT AND DAIRY PRODUCTS

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.600
ACROSS THE GLOBE IS
SET TO BE A MAJOR FACTOR

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:46.000
IN WORLDWIDE FOOD
SHORTAGES IN YEARS TO COME.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.600
THERE ARE ALMOST 1.5
BILLION COWS WORLDWIDE

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:58.170
AND MORE THAN ONE IN TEN OF
THEM ARE IN ONE COUNTRY: INDIA.

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:02.200
WHILE MEAT CONSUMPTION IS ONLY
INCREASING SLOWLY IN INDIA,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.270
PEOPLE HERE HAVE BECOME
HUGE CONSUMERS OF MILK,

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:07.400
MAKING THE COUNTRY
THE WORLD'S LARGEST

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.230
DAIRY PRODUCER.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:15.270


00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.800
DR. IAIN WRIGHT, A
SCOTSMAN BASED IN INDIA,

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.630
HAS BEEN FOLLOWING THIS
DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION.

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:29.370
IN THE LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS
OR SO THE MILK CONSUMPTION

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.500
IN INDIA HAS GONE UP
BY ALMOST SIX-FOLD.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.330
THAT'S BEEN DRIVEN BY BOTH
THE INCREASE IN POPULATION,

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:38.570
BUT ALSO BY AN INCREASE IN
MILK CONSUMPTION PER HEAD.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.700
MILK CONSUMPTION PER
PERSON HAS DOUBLED IN INDIA

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.030
IN THE LAST 40
YEARS OR SO.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:48.200
>>WHAT IS TRUE FOR MILK
IN INDIA IS TRANSLATED TO

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.430
MEAT CONSUMPTION ACROSS
THE DEVELOPING WORLD.

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:54.970
IN INDIA WE SEE INCREASES IN
THE NUMBER OF LARGE SCALE

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.930
POULTRY UNITS.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.530
IT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA
WITH AN INCREASE IN

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:02.630
PORK CONSUMPTION AND
PRODUCTION IN TERMS OF UNITS,

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:04.430
INCREASE IN POULTRY
CONSUMPTION

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.400
- BOTH MEAT AND
EGGS IN CHINA.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.370
LIKE MOST DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES, AS INCOMES RISE

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.470
PEOPLE GET SLIGHTLY RICHER
AND MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME,

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:16.530
THEN THEY START CONSUMING
MORE ANIMAL PRODUCTS.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:20.430


00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:22.930
>>GLOBAL MEAT AND MILK
PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:25.070
TO DOUBLE BY 2050.

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:27.370
THE EXPLOSION
OF WEALTH IN CHINA

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:29.730
HAS MEANT THAT IN THE
LAST DECADE ALONE,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:33.530
MEAT CONSUMPTION PER
PERSON HAS DOUBLED.

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:38.470


00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:41.100
AND THAT TREND IS
LIKELY TO CONTINUE

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.970
AS THE MIDDLE CLASSES IN
CHINA AND INDIA KEEP EXPANDING

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:49.970
AND THE WORLD'S POOREST
BECOME MORE PROSPEROUS.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:54.070
WE OFTEN THINK THAT THE BIG
INCREASE IN CONSUMPTION IS

00:47:54.070 --> 00:47:57.370
COMING FROM THE EMERGING MIDDLE
CLASSES IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD,

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:00.100
BUT IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE
STATISTICS YOU FIND THAT THE

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.270
PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING FROM
UNDER $2 A DAY TO BETWEEN

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.400
$2 AND $5 A DAY INCOME
ARE ALSO INCREASING

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.630
THEIR CONSUMPTION
OF ANIMAL PRODUCTS.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.030
AND BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT
SUCH A LARGE PROPORTION

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.570
OF THE TOTAL POPULATION,
THAT REPRESENTS A HUGE

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:18.470
INCREASE IN THE MARKET
FOR MEAT AND MILK.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:20.700
>>ALL OF THIS MEANS
AN INCREASING DEMAND

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.200
ON THE WORLD'S
MEAT SUPPLIES.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:27.270
ADD THAT TO WESTERN
COUNTRIES' MEAT CONSUMPTION

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:31.070
- OVER 80 KILOGRAMS FOR
EVERY PERSON EVERY YEAR -

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:35.000
AND IT'S NO WONDER THAT
THE UNITED NATIONS SAYS THAT

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.270
THE WORLD JUST CAN'T COPE WITH
THIS LEVEL OF MEAT CONSUMPTION.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:49.230
AND NOBEL PRIZE WINNER
RAJENDRA PACHAURI AGREES.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.000
I BELIEVE ONE AREA WHERE
WE NEED URGENT CHANGE IS

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.830
ESSENTIALLY IN REDUCING OUR
CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL PROTEINS.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.870
IN OTHER WORDS,
EATING LESS MEAT.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:05.000
EURO CATTLE THESE DAYS ARE
FED ALL KINDS OF INPUTS FOR

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
THEIR GROWTH AND A LARGE PART
OF IT IS ESSENTIALLY GRAINS.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
SO YOU'RE DIVERTING A LARGE
QUANTITY OF FOOD PRODUCTION

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.630
THAT PERHAPS COULD BE USED
DIRECTLY FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:22.630
AND NOW IS BEING PROVIDED FOR
CONVERSION TO ANIMAL PROTEIN.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.300
>>PRODUCING MORE MEAT
IS NOT JUST ABOUT HAVING

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.800
MORE SHEEP, COWS,
AND CHICKENS.

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.770
THEY ALL HAVE TO BE FED,
AND THE CEREAL USED

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:35.200
TO GET THE MEAT ONTO
OUR PLATES IS STAGGERING.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:41.900
IT TAKES 2.3 KILOGRAMS OF GRAIN
TO PRODUCE ONE KILO OF CHICKEN,

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:47.770
AROUND SIX KILOGRAMS OF
GRAIN MAKES A KILO OF PORK...

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:50.970
AND IT TAKES 15
KILOGRAMS OF GRAIN

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:56.030
TO PRODUCE JUST
ONE KILO OF BEEF.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:59.870
WE REALLY NEED SOME MAJOR
CHANGES IN OUR DIETARY HABITS

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.900
AND YOU LOOK AT THE
CASE OF NORTH AMERICA

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.330
WHERE YOU GO TO A
RESTAURANT AND ORDER A STEAK

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.770
- AS INDEED I USED TO DO BEFORE
I BECAME A VEGETARIAN -

00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:12.400
THEY GIVE YOU A
BIG HUGE HELPING.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.970
THIS HUGE STEAK THAT
YOU'RE EATING CAN FEED

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.400
ABOUT 40 PEOPLE IF YOU
WERE NOT CONSUMING THIS

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.200
- AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT
THIS TRANSLATES IMMEDIATELY

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.100
INTO SATISFYING THE
HUNGER OF 40 PEOPLE -

00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:31.470
BUT THE EQUIVALENT OF A STEAK
WOULD BE SOMEWHERE CLOSE

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:36.530
TO THAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE
BEING DEPRIVED OF FOOD.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:39.230
>>RAJENDRA PACHAURI'S
WARNINGS ABOUT MEAT

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:42.570
MAY BE TRUE
FOR ALL FOOD.

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:46.830
CURRENT LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION
IN RICH PARTS OF THE WORLD

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.800
ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.530
THE INEVITABLE INCREASE
IN CONSUMPTION

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:58.430
IN THE DEVELOPING
WORLD IS UNSTOPPABLE.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:04.930
A COLLISION COURSE WITH A
FOOD CRISIS SEEMS INEVITABLE.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:07.370
OUR WORLD AND
OUR RELATIONSHIP

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:11.070
WITH THE FOOD WE
EAT IS CHANGING...

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:15.530
MAYBE BEYOND
RECOGNITION.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:18.530
