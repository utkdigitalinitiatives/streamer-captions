BABIES HAVE A LOT TO LEARN
IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF LIFE,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.830
MORE IN FACT THAN THEY WILL
BE EXPECTED TO LEARN

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.130
IN THEIR FIRST
YEAR OF SCHOOL.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.000
TAKING CARE OF THIS NEW
LIFE IS FUN AND EXCITING

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.900
BUT CAN BE ANXIETY
PROVOKING AS WELL.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.630

KNOW THAT THE NATURAL

INSECURITY YOU MAY BE
FEELING IS MANAGEABLE

THIS INFORMATIONAL VIDEO
WILL WALK YOU THROUGH

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.330
THE DEVELOPMENTAL
MILESTONES OF BABIES

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.630
FROM BIRTH TO FIFTEEN MONTHS.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.300
AS A PARENT OR CAREGIVER
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MONITOR

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.000
THE NATURAL DEVELOPMENT
OF YOUR BABY.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330
YOUR INVOLVEMENT CAN
GREATLY ENHANCE

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.930
BABY'S SOCIAL AND
COGNITIVE GROWTH

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.660
FROM THE MOMENT HE COMES
HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.000
SOME OF THE MILESTONES WE'LL
ADDRESS ARE EASY TO IDENTIFY

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
SUCH AS SITTING,
CRAWLING AND WALKING.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.360
BUT DO YOU KNOW AT WHAT
AGE THESE MILESTONES

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.860
SHOULD BE REACHED?

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.530
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO HELP
BABY'S DEVELOPMENT?

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.900

BABY IS NOT DEVELOPING

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.600

THAT BABIES HAVE

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.160
SIX DIFFERENT TYPES OF CRIES?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.930
AND IT'S YOUR CHALLENGE
AS A PARENT OR CAREGIVER

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.600
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH
CRY MEANS WHAT.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.600
BABIES WILL CRY WHEN THEY ARE
HUNGRY, TIRED, WET OR DIRTY,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.060
HAVE PAIN,
DISCOMFORT, OR TENSION

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.200
AND EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BORED.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.300
DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL ONLY
NEED TO HEAR EACH CRY

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.560
A FEW TIMES BEFORE
YOU'LL SOON BE ABLE TO

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.400
DISTINGUISH AMONG THEM.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.200
AND REST ASSURED, BABIES
WILL ALSO LET YOU KNOW

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.530
WHEN THEY ARE HAPPY AND
THAT IS A WONDERFUL SOUND.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.500
WELL, NOW WITH HER BEING
JUST FOUR WEEKS,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.030
SHE HAS HER CRY THAT
I CAN KIND OF DISTINGUISH.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.360
I DISTINGUISHED
IT THE FIRST WEEK

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.300
'CAUSE SHE CRIES REAL HARD AND

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.700
IT'S AROUND THAT THREE HOUR
TIME WITH HER FEEDING.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.530
SO, SHE GETS REAL
RED AND SHE'S READY.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.730
IF I MAKE HER WAIT A
COUPLE OF MINUTES

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.100
TO WARM UP THE BOTTLE.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.760
SO, WE KIND OF
DISTINGUISHED THAT

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.130
AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.200
HE HAS DIFFERENT CRIES FOR WHEN
HE NEEDS CHANGING AND FEEDING.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.660
WHENEVER HE CRIES,
IF HE NEEDS FEEDING,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.960
WE GIVE HIM A BOTTLE AND
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.900
I KNOW HE NEEDS CHANGING.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.860
EVENTUALLY,
AT ABOUT SIX MONTHS,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.030
CRYING WILL BECOME
LESS FREQUENT,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.860
BUT UNTIL THEN, RESPONDING
TO A NEWBORN'S CRIES

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.930
WILL ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT BY
CREATING A SECURE BABY.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.900
SUDDEN OR LOUD NOISES MAY
ALSO CAUSE A NEWBORN

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.700
TO CRY AS THEY ARE STARTLED
EASILY AT THIS AGE.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.600
HOWEVER THIS SAME STARTLE
REFLEX IS AN IMPORTANT

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.030
DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONE
AND WILL BE APPARENT

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.930
FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS OF LIFE.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.660
ANOTHER REFLEX APPARENT FROM
BIRTH IS THE ROOTING REFLEX.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.800
A NEWBORN WHOSE CHEEK IS
GENTLY STROKED

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.060
WILL TURN IN THE
DIRECTION OF THE STIMULUS,

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.800
MOUTH OPEN READY TO SUCKLE.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.560
NEWBORNS WILL ALSO USE
THEIR STEPPING REFLEX

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.200
IF HELD UPRIGHT ON A FLAT
SURFACE AND THEY WILL

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.460
ACTUALLY APPEAR
TO BE WALKING.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.030
THE PALMER GRASP AND
PLANTAR GRASP ARE FUN

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.360
TO PRACTICE WITH
NEWBORNS AS WELL.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.700
THE PALMER REFLEX WILL
CAUSE A BABY TO GRASP

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.600
YOUR FINGER IF YOU PRESS
IT AGAINST HER PALM,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.160
WHEREAS THE PLANTAR
REFLEX CAUSES TOE CURLING

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.230
WHEN YOU RUN YOUR FINGER
ALONG THE BOTTOM

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.030
OF A BABY'S FOOT.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.230
HEY, CAMERON.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.460
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE UNABLE
TO TALK JUST YET,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.160
BABIES ARE LEARNING TO
COMMUNICATE FROM DAY ONE,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.530
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO
SMILE AND TALK TO YOUR BABY

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.400
AT ALL TIMES, WHILE
CHANGING DIAPERS, BATHING,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.360
AND FEEDING.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.960
FROM BIRTH, NEWBORNS ARE
ABLE TO FOCUS ON OBJECTS

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.860
WITHIN 8 TO 15 INCHES, SO
THEY CAN SEE YOU AND HEAR YOU.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.760
THIS COMMUNICATION
ENHANCES A BABY'S

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.400
DEVELOPMENT AND
SOCIALIZATION SKILLS.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.630
NEWBORNS WILL ALSO
QUICKLY LEARN TO FOLLOW

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.060
A HUMAN FACE WITH THEIR
EYES AND RESPOND TO

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.600
A VOICE WITH THEIR
HEAD AND EYES.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.360
SO ALTHOUGH, THEY WON'T BE
TALKING FOR MANY MORE MONTHS,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.600
THEY'VE ALREADY BEGUN
TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU

ON A SPECIAL LEVEL.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.660
SHE'S BECOMING MORE AWARE
OF MY VOICE EVERY DAY.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.600
THE FIRST TEN DAYS THEY
REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.660
YOUR VOICE.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.400
THEY START TO GET
TO KNOW YOUR VOICE.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.400

AT ME A LOT MORE.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.330

THE LAST WEEK.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.260
SHE'S LIKE, "OH!"

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.100
YOU KNOW, AND STUDYING MY FACE.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.660

HOLD HIS HEAD UP.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.400
THE FUN IS JUST BEGINNING
AS BABY LEARNS TO HOLD

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.400
HIS HEAD UP AND KEEP IT
STEADY WHEN ON HIS STOMACH.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.630
AND OOPS, NO MORE LEAVING
BABY STRANDED ON HIS BACK,

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.360
HE'S LEARNED TO ROLL OVER
FROM FRONT TO BACK.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.430
THAT ALSO MEANS HE CAN EASILY
ROLL OFF THE COUCH OR BED

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.200
SO WATCH OUT.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.760
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
BETWEEN 5 AND 7 MONTHS,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.400
BABY CAN BEAR
WEIGHT ON HER LEGS,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.100
HOLD HER HEAD
UPRIGHT WHEN SITTING

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.800
AND WILL SOON
LEARN HOW TO STAND.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.860
SHE DOES HOLD
HER HEAD UP MORE.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.830
SHE LIKES TO STAND.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.530
WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER SHE
HATED TO STAND,

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.000
BEAR WEIGHT ON HER LEGS.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.460
NOW SHE LOVES TO STAND.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.530
HOLD HER UP IN YOUR LAP
AND SHE JUST LOVES IT.

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:59.700
HE SITS UP A LOT BETTER
THAN HE USED TO.

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:01.800
HE STILL KINDA TIPS OVER
A LITTLE BIT BUT

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.860
HE DOES PRETTY GOOD AT THAT.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.000
HE CAN LAY ON HIS STOMACH
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.430
HE KINDA DOES THE WHOLE
SWING THING LIKE, YOU KNOW,

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.330
HE'S GETTING READY TO CRAWL.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.700
AND I THINK PROBABLY
HIS TALKING.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.660
HE'S TALKING.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.230
HE DOES A LOT OF
THE, YOU KNOW,

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:22.960
THE BABA'S AND STUFF LIKE
THAT AND IT'S GREAT.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.200
PLAYTIME IS MORE
INTERACTIVE NOW AS BABY

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.800
LEARNS TO BAT AT OBJECTS,
SMILE OR MIMIC SOMEONE,

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.200
TURN HIS HEAD IN THE
DIRECTION OF SOUND

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.300
AND LOOK FOR OBJECTS THAT
HAVE MOVED OUT OF SIGHT.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.660
THIS IS A PERFECT
TIME FOR FUNNY FACES,

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.400
PEEK-A-BOO, HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK
AND BUILDING BLOCKS.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.430
ENCOURAGE BABY TO FIND
PARTIALLY HIDDEN OBJECTS,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.100
GRASP FOR THINGS JUST
OUT OF REACH AND

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.100
EXPLORE OBJECTS WITH HIS
HANDS AND MOUTH.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.500
MAKE SURE TO KEEP SMALL
OBJECTS AND CHOKING HAZARDS

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.860
OUT OF BABY'S REACH.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.060
FIVE AND SIX MONTH OLDS
ALSO BEGIN TO EAT

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.060
A LARGER VARIETY OF FOODS.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.500
SO YOU'LL SEE YOUR BABY
BRING FOOD TO HIS MOUTH,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.230
TRANSFER OBJECTS FROM ONE
HAND TO ANOTHER, AND IF

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.360
YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, YOU
MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:11.360
A LITTLE FOOD ON YOUR FACE,
AND EVERYWHERE ELSE.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.360
BABY'S COMMUNICATION
SKILLS CONTINUE TO

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.930

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.460
TALKING, SINGING
AND PLAYING MUSIC.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.630
YOU'LL SOON BE REWARDED WHEN
BABY MAKES BUZZING NOISES

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.300
AND SAYS SOME SIMPLE WORDS -

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.330
EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY MEAN.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.560
WE DO SING TO HER.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.300

ESPECIALLY DURING BATHTIME.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.760

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.030
SHE TALKS AND I MIMIC HER

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.430

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.000
FROM A NEWBORN WHOSE ONLY WAY
OF COMMUNICATING WAS CRYING

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.660
AND WHO UNDERSTOOD NOTHING
BUT HIS OWN PRIMAL NEEDS,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.960
TO A SIX-MONTH-OLD WHO WAS
BEGINNING TO ARTICULATE SOUNDS,

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.200
COMPREHEND WORDS AND EXPRESS
ANGER, FRUSTRATION

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.760
AND HAPPINESS

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.830
TO AN EIGHT-MONTH-OLD WHO
WAS ABLE TO CONVEY MESSAGES

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.130
THROUGH SOUNDS AND GESTURES,

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.460
AND NOW, TO A FIFTEEN-MONTH-OLD

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:33.600
WHO HAS UTTERED OR WILL SOON
UTTER HIS REAL FIRST WORDS.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.730
AND YET WITH ALL THESE
ACCOMPLISHMENTS

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.030
ALREADY BEHIND HIM, BABY
STILL HAS MORE

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.800
ASTOUNDING GROWTH UP AHEAD.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.060
ENJOY EVERY MOMENT OF IT.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.660
AND REMEMBER THAT YOUR
INVOLVEMENT, WHETHER AS

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.000
A PARENT OR A CAREGIVER,
WILL GREATLY AFFECT

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.560
BABY'S GROWTH
AND DEVELOPMENT.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.800
FROM NEWBORN TO 15 MONTHS,
