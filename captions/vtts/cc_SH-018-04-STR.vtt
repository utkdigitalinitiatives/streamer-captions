O'er sixteen years andleave the growth untried

10
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.000

16
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.770

26

and remember well,

27
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.230
I mentioned a son o' theking's, which Florizel

28
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.970
I now name to you; andwith speed so pace

29
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.030
To speak of Perdita, nowgrown in grace

30
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.830
Equal with wondering: whatof her ensues

31
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.300
I list not prophecy; butlet Time's news

32
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.470
Be known when 'tis broughtforth.

33
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.500
A shepherd's daughter,

34
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.330
And what to her adheres,which follows after,

35
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.930
Is the argument of Time.

36
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.000
Of this allow,

37
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.670
If ever you have spenttime worse ere now;

38
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.170
If never, yet that Timehimself doth say

39
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.430
He wishes earnestly younever may.

40
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.600
I pray thee, good Camillo,be no more importunate:

41
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.970
'tis a sickness denyingthee any thing;

42
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.200
a death to grant this.

43
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.100
It is fifteen years sinceI saw my country:

44
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.270
though I have for the mostpart been aired abroad,

45
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.330
I desire to lay my bonesthere.

46
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.070
Besides, the penitentking, my master,

47
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.170
hath sent for me;

48
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.670

49

58
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.130

59
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.870
or take away with thee thevery services thou hast done;

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.370

64

and reconciled king, mybrother;

65
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.500
whose loss of his mostprecious queen and children

66
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.070
are even now to be afreshlamented.

67
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.400
Say to me, when sawest thouthe Prince Florizel, my son?

68
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.430
Kings are no less unhappy,their issue not being gracious,

69
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.900

70

Sir, it is three dayssince I saw the prince.

72
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.670
What his happier affairsmay be, are to me unknown:

73
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.400
but I have missingly noted,he is of late much retired

74
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.600
from court and is lessfrequent

75
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.630

76
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.430
than formerly he hathappeared.

77
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.230
I have considered so much,Camillo,

78
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.300
and with some care;

79
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.830

80

82
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.030

83

181
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.800
O, good sir, tenderly, O!

182
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.070
Alas, poor soul!

183
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.700
O, good sir, softly, goodsir!

184
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.770
I fear, sir, myshoulder-blade is out.

185
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.230
How now! canst stand?

186
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:34.830
Softly, dear sir; goodsir, softly.

187
00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.900
You ha' done me acharitable office.

188
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.670
Dost lack any money?

189
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.300
I have a little money forthee.

190
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.970
No, good sweet sir; no, Ibeseech you, sir:

191
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.030
I have a kinsmannot past

192
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.230
three quartersof a mile hence,

193
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.300
unto whom I was going;

194
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.830
I shall there have money,or any thing I want:

195
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.430
offer me no money,I pray you;

196
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.770
that kills my heart.

197
00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.670
What manner of fellow washe that robbed you?

198
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.070
A fellow, sir,

199
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.230
that I have known to goabout with troll-my-dames;

200
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.730
I knew him once a servantof the prince:

201
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.270
I cannot tell, good sir, forwhich of his virtues it was,

202
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.130
but he was certainlywhipped out of the court.

203
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.600
His vices, you would say;

204
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.500
there's no virtue whippedout of the court:

205
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.400
they cherish it to make itstay there;

206
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.970
and yet it will no morebut abide.

207
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.770
Vices, I would say, sir. Iknow this man well:

208
00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.070
he hath been since anape-bearer;

209
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.500
then a process-server, abailiff;

210
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.200
then he compassed a motionof the Prodigal Son,

211
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.130
and married a tinker'swife within a mile

212
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.170
where my land andliving lies;

213
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.700
and, having flown overmany knavish professions,

214
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.630
he settled only in rogue:some call him Autolycus.

215
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.930
Out upon him! prig, for mylife, prig:

216
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.200
he haunts wakes, fairs andbear-baitings.

217
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.130
Very true, sir; he,sir, he;

218
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.830
that's the rogue that putme into this apparel.

219
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.030
Not a more cowardly roguein all Bohemia:

220
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.700
if you had but looked big andspit at him, he'ld have run.

221
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.570
I must confess to you,sir, I am no fighter:

222
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.370
I am false of heart thatway; and that he knew,

223
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.170
I warrant him.

224
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.100
How do you now?

225
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:11.030
Sweet sir, much betterthan I was;

226
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.130
I can stand and walk:

227
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.470
I will even take my leaveof you,

228
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.300
and pace softly towards mykinsman's.

229
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.470
Shall I bring thee on theway?

230
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:19.530
No, good-faced sir; no,sweet sir.

231
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.130
Then fare thee well:

232
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:23.870
I must go buy spices forour sheep-shearing.

Jupiter became a bull, andbellow'd;

279
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.300
the green Neptune a ram,and bleated;

280
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.600

292
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.170
One of these two must benecessities,

293
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.800
Which then will speak,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800
that you must change thispurpose,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.100
Or I my life.

296
00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.830
Thou dearest Perdita,

darken not the mirth o'the feast.

299
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:22.630
Or I'll be thine, my fair,

300
00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.530
Or not my father's.

301
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.670
For I cannot be mine own,nor any thing to any,

302
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:30.500
if I be not thine. To thisI am most constant,

Would sing her song anddance her turn; now here,

-well you fit our ageswith flowers of winter.

341
00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.630
Sir, the year growingancient,

342
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.870
Not yet on summer's death,

343
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.970
nor on the birth oftrembling winter,

344
00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:50.700
the fairest flowers o' theseason

345
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.130
Are our carnations andstreak'd gillyvors

346
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.070
Which some call nature'sbastards:

347
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:58.530
of that kind our rusticgarden's barren;

348
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.770
and I care not to getslips of them.

349
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:02.770
Wherefore, gentle maiden,

350
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.630
Do you neglect them?

351
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.630
For I have heard it said

352
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.570
There is an art which intheir piedness

353
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.470
shares with great creatingnature.

354
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.270
Say there be;

355
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.170
Yet nature is made betterby no mean

356
00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:17.670
But nature makes thatmean:

357
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:20.270
so, over that art whichyou say adds to nature,

358
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:22.100
is an art that naturemakes.

359
00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.030
You see, sweet maid,

360
00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:26.830
we marry a gentler scionto the wildest stock,

361
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.170
And make conceive a barkof baser kind

362
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.430
By bud of nobler race:

363
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.670
this is an art which doesmend nature,

364
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:41.930
change it rather, but theart itself is nature.

365
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.900
So it is.

366
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.230
Then make your garden richin gillyvors,

367
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:48.930
And do not call thembastards.

368
00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.730
I'll not put the dibble inearth

369
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.600
to set one slip of them;

370
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.600
No more than were Ipainted

371
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.230
I would wish this youthshould say

372
00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:03.230
'twere well and only thereforedesire to breed by me.

373
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.170
Here's flowers for you;

374
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:09.400
Hot lavender, mints,savoury, marjoram;

375
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.430
The marigold, that goes tobed wi' the sun

376
00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.100
And with him risesweeping:

377
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.400
these are flowers ofmiddle summer,

378
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:20.230
and I think they are givento men of middle age.

379
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.630
You're very welcome.

380
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.100
I should leave grazing,were I of your flock,

381
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.970
And only live by gazing.

382
00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:29.030
Out, alas!

383
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.630
You'd be so lean, thatblasts of January

384
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.570
Would blow you through andthrough.

385
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.100
Now, my fair'st friend,

386
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.670
I would I had some flowerso' the spring that might

387
00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.030
Become your time of day;and yours, and yours,

388
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.300

389
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.030
Your maidenheads growing:O Proserpina,

390
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.170
For the flowers now, thatfrighted thou let'st fall

391
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.000
From Dis's waggon!daffodils,

392
00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.200
That come before theswallow dares, and take

393
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.800
The winds of March withbeauty; violets dim,

394
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.400
But sweeter than the lidsof Juno's eyes

395
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.800
Or Cytherea's breath; paleprimroses

396
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.400
That die unmarried, erethey can behold

397
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.300
Bight Phoebus in hisstrength--a malady

398
00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.770
Most incident to maids;bold oxlips and

399
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:23.030
The crown imperial; liliesof all kinds,

400
00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.730
The flower-de-luce beingone! O, these I lack,

401
00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:31.330
To make you garlands of,and my sweet friend,

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.530
To strew him o'er ando'er!

403
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:34.500
What, like a corse?

404
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.030
No, like a bank for loveto lie and play on;

405
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:42.670
Not like a corse; or if,not to be buried,

406
00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:52.930
But quick and in mine arms.Come, take your flowers:

407
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.970
Methinks I play as I haveseen them do

408
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.870
In Whitsun pastorals:

409
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.730
sure this robe of mine doeschange my disposition.

410
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.900
What you do

411
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.070
Still betters what is done.When you speak, sweet.

412
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.100
I'ld have you do it ever:when you sing,

413
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.330
I'ld have you buy and sellso, so give alms,

414
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.270
Pray so; and, for theordering your affairs,

415
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.830
To sing them too: when youdo dance,

416
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.430
I wish you a wave o' thesea, that you might

417
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.730
ever do nothing but that;move still, still so,

418
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.470
And own no other function:each your doing,

419
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:23.200
So singular in eachparticular,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.130
Crowns what you are doingin the present deed,

421
00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.330
That all your acts arequeens.

422
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:29.070
O Doricles,

423
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.030
Your praises are too large:but that your youth,

424
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.230
And the true blood whichpeepeth fairly through't,

425
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.730
Do plainly give you out anunstain'd shepherd,

426
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.830
With wisdom I might fear,my Doricles,

427
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.700
You woo'd me the falseway.

428
00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.670
I think you haveas little skill

429
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.330
to fear as I have purposeto put you to't.

430
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.300
But come; our dance, I pray:

431
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.500
Your hand, my Perdita: soturtles pair,

432
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.930
That never mean to part.

433
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.500
I'll swear for 'em.

434
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.800
This is the prettiestlow-born lass that ever

435
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.600
Ran on the green-sward:nothing she does or seems

436
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.800
But smacks of somethinggreater than herself,

437
00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.830
Too noble for this place.

438
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:09.900
He tells her something

439
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.730
That makes her blood lookout: good sooth,

440
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.370
she is the queen of curdsand cream.

441
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.870
Come on, strike up!

442
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.000
Mopsa must be yourmistress:

443
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.030
marry, garlic, to mend herkissing with!

444
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.800
Now, in good time!

445
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:32.770
Not a word, a word; westand upon our manners.

446
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.230
Come, strike up!

447
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:43.770
(a flute plays)

448
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.570
Pray, good shepherd, whatfair swain is this

449
00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.870
Which dances with yourdaughter?

450
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.670
They call him Doricles;and boasts himself

451
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:06.730
To have a worthy feeding:but I have it

452
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.270
Upon his own report and Ibelieve it;

453
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.500
He looks like sooth. Hesays he loves my daughter:

454
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.830
I think so too; for nevergazed the moon

455
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.630
Upon the water as he'llstand and read

456
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.870
As 'twere my daughter'seyes: and, to be plain.

457
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.330
I think there is not halfa kiss to choose

458
00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:28.500
Who loves another best.

459
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.070
She dances featly.

460
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.200
So she does any thing;though I report it,

461
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.170
That should be silent: ifyoung Doricles

462
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.930
Do light upon her, sheshall bring him that

463
00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.200
Which he not dreams of.

464
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.000
O master, if you did buthear the pedlar at the door,

465
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.030
you would never dance againafter a tabour and pipe;

466
00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.700
no, the bagpipe could notmove you:

467
00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.500
he sings several tunes fasterthan you'll tell money;

468
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.230
he utters them as he hadeaten ballads

469
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.230
and all men's ears grew tohis tunes.

470
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:31.000
He could never comebetter; he shall come in.

471
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.430
I love a ballad but eventoo well,

472
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.230
if it be doleful mattermerrily set down,

473
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.000
or a very pleasant thingindeed and sung lamentably.

474
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
He hath songs for man orwoman, of all sizes;

475
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.470
no milliner can so fit hiscustomers with gloves:

476
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.770
he has the prettiestlove-songs for maids;

477
00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:51.170
so without bawdry, whichis strange;

478
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.430
with such delicate burthensof dildos and fadings,

479
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:56.700
'jump her and thump her;'

480
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.970

mean mischief and break afoul gap into the matter,

483
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.370
he makes the maid toanswer '

484

Whoop, do me no harm, goodman;'

485
00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.170

Come, come, he must not.

713
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:32.670
Mark our contract.

714
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:37.000
Mark your divorce,young sir,

715
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.700
Discovering himself whomson I dare not call;

716
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.430
thou art too base to beacknowledged:

717
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:43.130
thou a sceptre's heir,

718
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.700
That thus affect'st asheep-hook!

719
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.830
Thou old traitor,

720
00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.530
I am sorry that by hangingthee

721
00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.530
I can but shorten thy lifeone week.

722
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:56.100
And thou, fresh piece ofexcellent witchcraft,

723
00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.900
who of force must know theroyal fool

724
00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.000
thou copest with,--

725
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.430
O, my heart!

726
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.030
I'll have thy beautyscratch'd with briers,

727
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.900
and made more homely thanthy state.

728
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:09.070
For thee, fond boy,

729
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.530
if I may ever know thou dostbut sigh

730
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.270
That thou no more shaltsee this knack,

731
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:20.170
as never I mean thoushalt,

732
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:23.370
we'll bar thee fromsuccession;

733
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.700
Not hold thee of ourblood, no, not our kin,

734
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:34.030
Far than Deucalion off:mark thou my words:

735
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:40.700
Follow us to the court.Thou churl, for this time,

736
00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.670
Though full of ourdispleasure,

737
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.770
yet we free thee from thedead blow of it.

738
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.530
And you, enchantment.

739
00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:53.200
Worthy enough a herdsman:yea, him too,

740
00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.700
That makes himself, butfor our honour therein,

741
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.700
Unworthy thee,

742
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.070
if ever henceforth thouthese rural latches

743
00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:02.770
to his entrance open,

744
00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.930
Or hoop his body more withthy embraces,

745
00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.100
I will devise a death ascruel for thee

746
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.100
As thou art tender to't.

747
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:21.330
Even here undone!

748
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.630
I was not much afeard;

749
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.700
for once or twice I wasabout to speak

750
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.470
and tell him plainly,

751
00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:30.900
The selfsame sun thatshines upon his court

752
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:32.930
Hides not his visage fromour cottage

753
00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:40.130
but looks on alike. Will'tplease you, sir, be gone?

754
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.670
I told you what would comeof this: beseech you,

755
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.930
Of your own state takecare: this dream of mine,--

756
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.930
Being now awake, I'llqueen it no inch farther,

757
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.470
But milk my ewes and weep.

758
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:59.170
Why, how now, father!

759
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.170
Speak ere thou diest.

760
00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.370
I cannot speak,

761
00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:12.770
nor think nor dare to knowthat which I know. O sir!

762
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:15.200
You have undone a man offourscore three,

763
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.530
That thought to fill hisgrave in quiet, yea,

764
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.630
To die upon the bed myfather died,

765
00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.970
To lie close by his honestbones:

766
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.370
but now some hangman mustput on my shroud

767
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:29.600
and lay me where no priestshovels in dust.

768
00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.470
O cursed wretch,

769
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.400
That knew'st this was theprince,

770
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.570
and wouldst adventure tomingle faith with him!

771
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:38.670
Undone! undone!

772
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.730
If I might die within thishour,

773
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.330
I have lived to die when Idesire.

774
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.470
Why look you so upon me?

775
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.770
I am but sorry, notafeard; delay'd,

776
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:53.030
But nothing alter'd: whatI was, I am;

777
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.500
More straining on forplucking back,

778
00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.100
not following my leashunwillingly.

779
00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.470
Gracious my lord,

780
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:59.600
You know your father'stemper:

781
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.200
at this time he will allowno speech,

782
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.930
which I do guess you donot purpose to him;

783
00:38:04.930 --> 00:38:07.830
and as hardly will he endureyour sight as yet, I fear:

784
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.630
Then, till the fury of hishighness settle,

785
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.470
Come not before him.

786
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:14.200
I not purpose it.

787
00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.070
I think, Camillo?

788
00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.230
Even he, my lord.

789
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.870
How often have I told you'twould be thus!

790
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:24.870
How often said,

791
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:28.630
my dignity would last buttill 'twere known!

792
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.370
It cannot fail but by theviolation of my faith;

793
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.700
and then let nature crush thesides o' the earth together

794
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:39.230
And mar the seeds within!Lift up thy looks:

795
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:41.270
From my succession wipeme, father;

796
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.800
I am heir to my affection.

797
00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.000
Be advised.

798
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.770
I am, and by my fancy:

799
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:47.270
if my reason will theretobe obedient,

800
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:48.670
I have reason;

801
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.300
If not, my senses, betterpleased with madness,

802
00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:51.070
Do bid it welcome.

803
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.700
This is desperate, sir.

804
00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:54.830
So call it: but it doesfulfil my vow;

805
00:38:54.830 --> 00:38:57.730
I needs must think ithonesty.

806
00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.700
Camillo, not for Bohemia,

807
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.730
nor the pomp that may bethereat glean'd,

808
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:04.200
for all the sun sees orthe close earth wombs

809
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.500
or the profound sea hidesin unknown fathoms,

810
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:11.330
will I break my oath yothis my fair beloved:

811
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.870
therefore, I pray you,

812
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.330
As you have ever been myfather's honour'd friend,

813
00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:15.630
When he shall miss me,

814
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.930
as, in faith, I mean notto see him any more,

815
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.900
cast your good counselsupon his passion;

816
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.130
let myself and fortune tugfor the time to come.

817
00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:25.230
This you may know and sodeliver,

818
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.930
I am put to sea with her

819
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.230
whom here I cannot hold onshore;

820
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.370
And most opportune to ourneed

821
00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:32.230
I have Aa vessel ridesfast by,

822
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:34.330
but not prepared for thisdesign.

823
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:35.200
What course I mean to hold

824
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.170
shall nothing benefit yourknowledge,

825
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.230
nor concern me thereporting.

826
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:38.270
O my lord!

827
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.000
I would your spirit wereeasier for advice,

828
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.630
Or stronger for your need.

829
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.230
Hark, Perdita

830
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.700
I'll hear you by and by.

831
00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.230
He's irremoveable,

832
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:53.130
Resolved for flight.

833
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:55.000
Now were I happy,

834
00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.200
if his going I could frameto serve my turn,

835
00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:03.170
Save him from danger, dohim love and honour,

836
00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.900
Purchase the sight againof dear Sicilia

837
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.500
And that unhappy king, mymaster,

838
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.230
whom I so much thirst tosee.

839
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:12.630
Now, good Camillo;

840
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.400
I am so fraught withcurious business

841
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.530
that I leave out ceremony.

842
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:18.500
Sir,

843
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.600
I think you have heard ofmy poor services,

844
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.100
i' the love that I haveborne your father?

845
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.900
Very nobly have youdeserved:

846
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.570
it is my father's music tospeak your deeds,

847
00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.000
not little of his care tohave them recompensed

848
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:28.830
as thought on.

849
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.200
Well, my lord,

850
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.830
If you may please to thinkI love the king

851
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.300
And through him what isnearest to him,

852
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.900
which is your graciousself,

853
00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.400
embrace but my direction:

854
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.430
If your more ponderous andsettled project

855
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:43.530
May suffer alteration, onmine honour,

856
00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.830
I'll point you where youshall have such receiving

857
00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.170
As shall become yourhighness;

858
00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:51.230
where you may enjoy yourmistress,

859
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.230
from the whom, I see,

860
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.670
There's no disjunction tobe made,

861
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:55.270
but by-- As heavensforefend!

862
00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:58.600
--your ruin; marry her,

863
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.930
And, with my bestendeavours in your absence,

864
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:05.130
Your discontenting fatherstrive to qualify

865
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.400
And bring him up toliking.

866
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:08.570
How, Camillo,

867
00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.130
May this, almost amiracle, be done?

868
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.900
That I may call theesomething more than man

869
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.400
And after that trust tothee.

870
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.100
Have you thought on aplace whereto you'll go?

871
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.570
Not any yet:

872
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:19.770
But as the unthought-

873
00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:21.630
on accident is guilty towhat we wildly do,

874
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:23.800
so we profess ourselves tobe the slaves of chance

875
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.400
and flies of every windthat blows.

876
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.870
Then list to me:

877
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:28.070
This follows,

878
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.600
if you will not changeyour purpose

879
00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:32.230
but undergo this flight,

880
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.730
make for Sicilia, andthere present yourself

881
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.000
and your fair princess,

882
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.370
For so I see she must be,'fore Leontes:

883
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:41.100
She shall be habited as itbecomes

884
00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.270
The partner of your bed.

885
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.600
Methinks I see Leontes

886
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.770
opening his free arms andweeping

887
00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.400
His welcomes forth;

888
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.430
asks thee the sonforgiveness,

889
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.830
As 'twere i' the father'sperson;

890
00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.530
kisses the hands of yourfresh princess;

891
00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:00.170
o'er and o'er divides him

892
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.430
'Twixt his unkindness andhis kindness;

893
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:03.970
the one he chides to hell

894
00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:08.030
and bids the other growfaster than thought or time.

895
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.370
Worthy Camillo,

896
00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:10.500
What colour for myvisitation

897
00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.570
shall I hold up before him?

898
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:12.970
Sent by the king yourfather

899
00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:15.500
To greet him and to givehim comforts.

900
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.170
Sir, the manner of yourbearing towards him,

901
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.300
with what you as from yourfather shall deliver,

902
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.330
Things known betwixt usthree,

903
00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.930
I'll write you down:

904
00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:26.370
The which shall point youforth at every sitting

905
00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.770
What you must say;

906
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:28.900
that he shall not perceive

907
00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.830
but that you have yourfather's bosom there

908
00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.270
And speak his very heart.

909
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:35.700
I am bound to you:

910
00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.100
There is some sap in this.

911
00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.270
A cause more promising

912
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.930
than a wild dedication ofyourselves

913
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:44.530
To unpath'd waters,undream'd shores,

914
00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:45.370
besides you know

915
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.370
prosperity's the very bondof love,

916
00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.470
Whose fresh complexion

917
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.000
and whose heart togetheraffliction alters.

918
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.830
One of these is true:

919
00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.100
I think affliction maysubdue the cheek,

920
00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.600
But not take in the mind.

921
00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.100
Yea, say you so?

922
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.700
There shall not atyour father's house

923
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.730
these seven years

924
00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.470
Be born another such.

925
00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.270
My good Camillo,

926
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.470
She is as forward of herbreeding

927
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:08.900
as she is i' the rear ourbirth.

928
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.900
I cannot say 'tis pity

929
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.170
She lacks instructions,

930
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:17.570
for she seems a mistressto most that teach.

931
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.270
Your pardon, sir;

932
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:21.100
for this I'll blush youthanks.

933
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.900
My prettiest Perdita!

934
00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.100
But O, the thorns we standupon! Camillo,

935
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.470
Preserver of my father,now of me,

936
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.800
The medicine of our house,how shall we do?

937
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.400
We are not furnish'd likeBohemia's son,

938
00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.670
Nor shall appear inSicilia.

939
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:32.300
My lord,

940
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.400
Fear none of this:

941
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.930
I think you know myfortunes do all lie there:

942
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:39.300
it shall be so my care tohave you royally appointed

943
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.900
as if the scene you playwere mine.

944
00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:43.470
For instance, sir,

945
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:46.800
That you may know youshall not want, one word.

946
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.970
Ha, ha! what a foolHonesty is!

947
00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.870
and Trust, his swornbrother,

948
00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:00.670
a very simplegentleman!

949
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.230
I have sold all mytrumpery;

950
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.430
not a counterfeit stone,

951
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:06.530
not a ribbon, glass,pomander, brooch,

952
00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:07.400
table-book, ballad,

953
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.430
knife, tape, glove,

954
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.970
shoe-tie, bracelet,horn-ring,

955
00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:12.430
to keep my pack fromfasting:

956
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.000
they throng who should buyfirst,

957
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.470
as if my trinkets had beenhallowed

958
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.200
and brought abenediction to the buyer:

959
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.330
by which means I saw whosepurse was best in picture;

960
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:26.730
and what I saw, to my gooduse I remembered.

961
00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:30.070
My clown, who wants butsomething

962
00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:31.130
to be a reasonableman,

963
00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.830
grew so in love with thewenches' song,

964
00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.230
that he would not stir hispettitoes

965
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.300
till he had bothtune and words;

966
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.730
which so drew the rest ofthe herd to me

967
00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.630
that all their othersenses stuck in ears:

968
00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:44.770
you might have pinched aplacket,

969
00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:45.870
it was senseless;

970
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.530
'twas nothing to geld acodpiece of a purse;

971
00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:52.800
I could have filed keysoff that hung in chains:

972
00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.800
no hearing, no feeling,but my sir's song,

973
00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.070
and admiring the nothingof it.

974
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:00.630
So that in this time oflethargy

975
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.270
I picked and cut most oftheir festival purses;

976
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.470
and had not the old mancome in with a whoo-bub

977
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:06.970
against his daughter andthe king's son

978
00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:08.330
and scared my choughs fromthe chaff,

979
00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:11.570
I had not left a pursealive in the whole army.

980
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:12.670
Nay, but my letters,

981
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.330
by this means being thereso soon as you arrive,

982
00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.930
shall clear that doubt.

983
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:17.870
And those that you'llprocure

984
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:18.670
from King Leontes--

985
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.970
Shall satisfy your father.

986
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:22.030
Happy be you!

987
00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:25.470
All that you speak showsfair.

988
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.270
Who have we here?

989
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:28.800
We'll make an instrumentof this,

990
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:31.130
omit nothing may give usaid.

991
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.130
If they have overheard menow, why, hanging.

992
00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.770
How now, good fellow! whyshakest thou so?

993
00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.000
Fear not, man; here's noharm intended to thee.

994
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.600
I am a poor fellow, sir.

995
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.200
Why, be so still;

996
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.130
here's nobody will stealthat from thee:

997
00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.600
yet for the outside of thypoverty

998
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.070
we must make anexchange;

999
00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.870
therefore discase theeinstantly,

1000
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.330
--thou must think there'sa necessity in't,

1001
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.630
--and change garments withthis gentleman:

1002
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.830
though the pennyworth onhis side be the worst,

1003
00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.600
yet hold thee, there'ssome boot.

1004
00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.170
I am a poor fellow, sir.

1005
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:01.470
I know ye well enough.

1006
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.700
Nay, prithee, dispatch:

1007
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.500
the gentleman is halfflayed already.

1008
00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.500
Are you in earnest, sir?

1009
00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.800
I smell the trick on't.

1010
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.700
Dispatch, I prithee.

1011
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.030
Indeed, I have hadearnest:

1012
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:11.130
but I cannot withconscience take it.

1013
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:13.500
Unbuckle, unbuckle.

1014
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.430
Fortunate mistress,

1015
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:18.000
--let my prophecy comehome to ye!

1016
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.270
--you must retire yourselfinto some covert:

1017
00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.670
take your sweetheart's hat

1018
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.130
And pluck it o'er yourbrows,

1019
00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.370
muffle your face,

1020
00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:26.130
Dismantle you, and, as youcan,

1021
00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.100
disliken the truth of yourown seeming;

1022
00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.600
that you may-- for I dofear eyes over--

1023
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.730
to shipboard getundescried.

1024
00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.000
I see the play so lies

1025
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.300
That I must bear a part.

1026
00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.670
No remedy.

1027
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:37.870
Have you done there?

1028
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.930
Should I now meet myfather,

1029
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.100
He would not call me son.

1030
00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:41.730
Nay, you shall have nohat.

1031
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.800
Come, lady, come.

1032
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.970
What I do next,

1033
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:46.430
shall be to tell the kingof this escape

1034
00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:47.800
and whitherthey are bound;

1035
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.830
Wherein my hope is I shallso prevail

1036
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:52.900
to force him after:

1037
00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.330
in whose company I shallreview Sicilia,

1038
00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.170
for whose sight I have awoman's longing.

1039
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:01.170
Farwell, my friend.

1040
00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:01.970
Adieu, sir.

1041
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.030
Fortune speed us!

1042
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.430
Thus we set on, Camillo,to the sea-side.

1043
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:07.970
The swifter speed thebetter.

1044
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.070
I understand the business,I hear it:

1045
00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:14.930
to have an open ear, a quickeye, and a nimble hand,

1046
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.430
is necessary for acut-purse;

1047
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:19.630
a good nose is requisitealso,

1048
00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:24.570
to smell out work for theother senses.

1049
00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:30.570
I see this is the time thatthe unjust man doth thrive.

1050
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:34.130
What an exchange had thisbeen without boot!

1051
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:39.330
What a boot is here withthis exchange!

1052
00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:42.930
Sure the gods do this yearconnive at us,

1053
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:49.000
and we may do any thingextempore.

1054
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.870
The prince himself isabout a piece of iniquity,

1055
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:51.970
stealing away from hisfather

1056
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.700
with his clog athis heels:

1057
00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:56.070
if I thought it were apiece of honesty

1058
00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:58.000
to acquaint the king withal,

1059
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.400
I would not do't:

1060
00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.400
I hold it the more knaveryto conceal it;

1061
00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.900
and therein am I constantto my profession.

1062
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.970
Aside, aside; here is morematter for a hot brain:

1063
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:12.430
every lane's end, everyshop, church, session,

1064
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:14.270
hanging, yields a carefulman work.

1065
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:19.070
See, see; what a man youare now!

1066
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.070
There is no other way butto tell the king

1067
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.330
she's a changeling

1068
00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.800
and none of your flesh andblood.

1069
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.470
Nay, but hear me.

1070
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:26.470
Nay, but hear me.

1071
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:27.770
Go to, then.

1072
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:29.830
She being none of yourflesh and blood,

1073
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:31.770
your flesh and blood hasnot offended the king;

1074
00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:32.970
and so your flesh andblood

1075
00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:36.270
is not to bepunished by him.

1076
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:38.730
Show those things youfound about her,

1077
00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:42.230
those secret things, allbut what she has with her:

1078
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.370
this being done, let thelaw go whistle:

1079
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:48.330
I warrant you.

1080
00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:52.430
I will tell the king all,every word, yea,

1081
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.130
and his son's pranks too;who, I may say,

1082
00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:56.200
is no honest man,

1083
00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.800
neither to his father norto me,

1084
00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.600
to go about to make me theking's brother-in-law.

1085
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.430
Indeed, brother-in-law wasthe farthest off

1086
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.800
you could have beento him

1087
00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.100
and then your blood hadbeen the dearer

1088
00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.600
by I knowhow much an ounce.

1089
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.930
Very wisely, puppies!

1090
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.830
Well, let us to the king:

1091
00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.900
there is that in thisfardel

1092
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:16.970
will make himscratch his beard.

1093
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:18.770
I know not what impedimentthis complaint

1094
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.570
may be tothe flight of my master.

1095
00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.470
Pray heartily he be atpalace.

1096
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:23.870
Though I am not naturallyhonest,

1097
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.470
I am so sometimes bychance:

1098
00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:29.470
let me pocket up mypedlar's excrement.

1099
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.500
how now, rustics!

1100
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.000
whither are youbound?

1101
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.700
To the palace, an it likeyour worship.

1102
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.500
Your affairs there, what,with whom,

1103
00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.700
the condition of thatfardel,

1104
00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:45.770
the place of yourdwelling,

1105
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:47.900
your names, your ages, ofwhat having, breeding,

1106
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.270
and any thing that is fittingto be known, discover.

1107
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:52.470
We are but plain fellows,sir.

1108
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:53.800
A lie; you are rough andhairy.

1109
00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.570
Let me have no lying: itbecomes none but tradesmen,

1110
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:00.970
Are you a courtier, an'tlike you, sir?

1111
00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:04.600
Whether it like me or no,I am a courtier.

1112
00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.600
Seest thou not the air of thecourt in these enfoldings?

1113
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.130
hath not my gait in it themeasure of the court?

1114
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:14.030
receives not thy nosecourt-odor from me?

1115
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:17.730
reflect I not on thybaseness court-contempt?

1116
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:19.900
Thinkest thou, for that Iinsinuate,

1117
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.200
or toaze from thee thybusiness,

1118
00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.300
I am thereforeno courtier?

1119
00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:26.570
I am courtier cap-a-pe;

1120
00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:28.100
and one that will eitherpush on

1121
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.330
or pluck back thybusiness there:

1122
00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:35.230
whereupon I command theeto open thy affair.

1123
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:37.230
My business, sir, is tothe king.

1124
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:39.700
What advocate hast thou tohim?

1125
00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.470
I know not, an't like you.

1126
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:44.170
Advocate's the court-wordfor a pheasant:

1127
00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:46.030
say you have none.

1128
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:49.700
None, sir; I have nopheasant, cock nor hen.

1129
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:56.500
How blessed are we thatare not simple men!

1130
00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:58.500
Yet nature might have mademe as these are,

1131
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:02.570
Therefore I will notdisdain.

1132
00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:05.300
This cannot be but a greatcourtier.

1133
00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:06.700
His garments are rich,

1134
00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.270
but he wears them nothandsomely.

1135
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:11.730
He seems to be the morenoble in being fantastical:

1136
00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.800
a great man, I'll warrant;

1137
00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.500
I know by the picking on'steeth.

1138
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:17.200
The fardel there? what'si' the fardel?

1139
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:18.370
Wherefore that box?

1140
00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:22.130
Sir, there lies such secretsin this fardel and box,

1141
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:24.770
which none must know butthe king;

1142
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:27.130
and which he shall knowwithin this hour,

1143
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.430
if I may come to thespeech of him.

1144
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:33.170
Age, thou hast lost thylabour.

1145
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.170
Why, sir?

1146
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.070
The king is not at thepalace;

1147
00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:40.530
he is gone aboard a newship to purge melancholy

1148
00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.200
and air himself:

1149
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.830
for, if thou beest capableof things serious,

1150
00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:46.630
thou must know the king isfull of grief.

1151
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.030
So 'tis said, sir; abouthis son,

1152
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:54.600
that should have married ashepherd's daughter.

1153
00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:58.770
If that shepherd be not inhand-fast, let him fly:

1154
00:51:58.770 --> 00:51:59.730
the curses he shall have,

1155
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:01.130
the tortures he shallfeel,

1156
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.900
will break the back ofman, the heart of monster.

1157
00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.270
Think you so, sir?

1158
00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.530
Not he alone shall sufferwhat wit

1159
00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:10.270
can make heavyand vengeance bitter;

1160
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:11.500
but those that are germaneto him,

1161
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.300
though removedfifty times,

1162
00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:16.230
shall all come under thehangman:

1163
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:20.830
which though it be greatpity, yet it is necessary.

1164
00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:24.130
An old sheep-whistlingrogue a ram-tender,

1165
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:28.300
to offer to have hisdaughter come into grace!

1166
00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.570
Some say he shall bestoned;

1167
00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.370
but that death is toosoft for him, say I

1168
00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:36.300
draw our throneinto a sheep-cote!

1169
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:39.330
all deaths are too few,the sharpest too easy.

1170
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:43.500
Has the old man e'er ason, sir, do you hear.

1171
00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.570
an't like you, sir?

1172
00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:50.100
He has a son, who shall beflayed alive;

1173
00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:52.000
then 'nointed over withhoney,

1174
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.900
set on the head of awasp's nest;

1175
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:55.970
then stand till he bethree quarters

1176
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:58.200
and a dram dead;

1177
00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.470
then recovered again withaqua-vitae

1178
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.330
or some other hot infusion;

1179
00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.330
then, raw as he is,

1180
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:06.100
and in the hottestday

1181
00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.670
prognosticationproclaims,

1182
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.900
shall be be set against abrick-wall,

1183
00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.700
the sun looking with asouthward eye upon him,

1184
00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:18.800
where he is to behold himwith flies blown to death.

1185
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.300
But what talk we of thesetraitorly rascals,

1186
00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.870
whose miseries are to besmiled at,

1187
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:26.630
their offences being socapital?

1188
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:28.500
Tell me, for you seem tobe honest plain men,

1189
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:30.300
what you have to the king:

1190
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:32.830
being something gentlyconsidered,

1191
00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.600
I'll bring you where he isaboard,

1192
00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.570
tender yourpersons to his presence,

1193
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.900
whisper him in yourbehalfs;

1194
00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:41.330
and if it be in manbesides the king

1195
00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.530
to effect your suits,

1196
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.200
here is man shall do it.

1197
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.600
He seems to be of greatauthority: close with him,

1198
00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:50.730
give him gold;

1199
00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:52.200
and though authority be astubborn bear,

1200
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.170
yet he is oft led by thenose with gold:

1201
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:56.530
show the inside of yourpurse

1202
00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:57.730
to the outside ofhis hand,

1203
00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:58.730
and no more ado.

1204
00:53:58.730 --> 00:54:03.430
Remember 'stoned,' and'flayed alive.'

1205
00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:10.700
An't please you, sir,

1206
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.730
to undertake the businessfor us,

1207
00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.200
here is that gold I have:

1208
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:19.370
I'll make it as much moreand leave this young man

1209
00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:22.530
in pawn till I bring ityou.

1210
00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.070
After I have done what Ipromised?

1211
00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:27.230
Ay, sir.

1212
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:30.370
Well, give me the moiety.

1213
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:34.070
Are you a party inthis business?

1214
00:54:34.070 --> 00:54:38.270
In some sort, sir: but thoughmy case be a pitiful one,

1215
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:40.630
I hope I shall not beflayed out of it.

1216
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:47.600
O, that's the case of theshepherd's son: hang him,

1217
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.930
he'll be made an example.

1218
00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.770
Comfort, good comfort!

1219
00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.470
We must to the king andshow our strange sights:

1220
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:57.270
he must know 'tis none ofyour daughter nor my sister;

1221
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.630
we are gone else.

1222
00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:02.800
Sir, I will give you asmuch as this old man does

1223
00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.970
when the business isperformed, and remain,

1224
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:05.770
as he says,

1225
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:08.800
your pawn till it bebrought you.

1226
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:18.170
I will trust you. Walkbefore toward the sea-side;

1227
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:19.770
go on the right hand:

1228
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.500
I will but look upon thehedge and follow you.

1229
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.270
We are blest in this man,as I may say, even blest.

1230
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:29.800
Let's before as hebids us:

1231
00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:35.300
he was provided todo us good.

1232
00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:44.100
If I had a mind to behonest,

1233
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.730
I see Fortune would notsuffer me:

1234
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.570
she dropsbooties in my mouth.

1235
00:55:49.570 --> 00:55:51.300
I am courted now with adouble occasion,

1236
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:54.470
gold and a means to do theprince my master good;

1237
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:58.230
which who knows how that mayturn back to my advancement?

1238
00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.100
I will bring these twomoles, these blind ones,

1239
00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.630
aboard him:

1240
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:06.170
if he think it fit toshore them again

1241
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.870
and that the complaintthey have to the king

1242
00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:08.930
concerns him nothing,

1243
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.330
let him call me rogue forbeing so far officious;

1244
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:13.800
for I am proof againstthat title

1245
00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:17.270
