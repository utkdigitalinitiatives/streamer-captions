00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.260
Hi, Caleb!

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:07.497
Hi, Caleb!

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.767
What is that?

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.838
Woman:
If you were able to imagine

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:15.075
a huge fourth
of July going off,

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.744
that is what's happening
in the brain of an infant.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.547
He's noticing everything...

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:21.815
Langley:
Eventually in time,

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.018
he's going to be able
to sit up on his own,

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:27.387
crawl a little bit more.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.421
All of those pieces

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.981
are critical development
with our infants.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:34.828
Narrator:
Years of data demonstrate

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.897
that infants who receive
high quality care

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.833
do better in school and in life.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:46.539
Forty years ago, our nation
came tantalizingly close

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.275
to making high quality
care like this

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:52.040
available to every family
who wanted it.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:56.082
But we didn't...

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.084
There are so many families
in general

00:01:58.084 --> 00:01:59.419
who are stuck

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.621
in the situation of leaving
their children in care

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:03.356
that they don't feel
comfortable with

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:04.624
or that they don't feel is safe,

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:07.060
or that they don't feel
is helping their child

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.094
develop to the fullest

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:11.030
because that's simply the only
option they can afford.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.600
Narrator:
Unlike these children,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.934
too many American kids

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:17.904
experience childcare
that is unregulated,

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:22.108
mediocre at best,
and hugely expensive-

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.244
despite the fact
that parents work

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.579
and depend on care
more than ever.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.148
How are you?

00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.651
Clare Sanford works
with parents

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.987
determined to find
the high quality care

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.955
all children need to thrive.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.759
She's also a mother of two.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.495
Should we take these
home to show dad?

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.264
Sanford:
We both work full time,

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:49.235
and our kids are actually
in care, quite a bit,

00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:51.638
50+ hours a week.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.240
Man:
When tweedle beetles fight...

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.275
Sanford:
Our childcare expenses,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.912
now that we have a second
child in full-time care,

00:02:58.912 --> 00:03:02.939
I think it runs to 18% or 19%
of our gross income...

00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:06.786
which seems like a lot!

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.619
It's way more than we spend
on our mortgage.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.927
Narrator:
And it's not just the cost.

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.328
In some places,

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:19.390
dog kennels are inspected more
often than childcare facilities.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.036
Most childcare workers
are paid less

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.970
than parking-lot attendants.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.108
And with few exceptions,

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:32.476
parents are pretty much
on their own.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.315
Sanford:
We want to believe

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.184
that every individual is able
to pull themselves up

00:03:38.184 --> 00:03:42.021
with their own boot straps
and there's a sense

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.991
that providing for
children and families

00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:48.027
in some ways is a form
of government interference

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:51.293
instead of a support for
families and children.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:56.263
Narrator:
But it wasn't always this way.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.470
Do we know the full story?

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:02.375
How did a country

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.712
that says it cares
about its youngest children

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:07.180
end up with a system

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.673
that neglects the needs
of so many of them?

00:04:21.394 --> 00:04:24.364
World War II drastically,
and suddenly,

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:27.197
propelled American women
into the workforce.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.838
Dubbed "Rosie the Riveters,"

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:34.274
they relocated to other
parts of the country

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.641
to work in shipyards
and armament factories...

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:42.341
many with young children
in tow.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:43.950
Woman:
They were away

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.851
from their family,

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.086
they were away from
the structures and networks

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:49.856
that they could've depended
on for childcare,

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:52.256
and they needed somebody
to watch their children.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.589
When they didn't have any,
they did what they could do.

00:04:57.864 --> 00:04:58.898
They left children alone,

00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:00.733
they left children in charge
of other children,

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.827
they left children
in often, trailers.

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:06.873
Narrator:
The government responded,

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.274
and approved funding

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:11.044
for a national network
of child development centers

00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.914
under legislation
known as The Lanham Act.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.716
When married women
with smatt children

00:05:16.716 --> 00:05:17.911
have to take jobs,

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.886
everything possible
will be done

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:22.184
to provide day care
for the children.

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.457
Narrator:
Lanham Act programs

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.727
provided care for 600,000 kids

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:30.930
at 3,000 centers
across the country.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.065
Lovett:
It focused not only

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:33.800
on children's development,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.070
it focused on their health,
on their education,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.139
on their welfare,
on nutrition.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.508
It really envisioned
an investment

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:44.977
in the children
of these workers

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:46.979
as something that would
benefit the country

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.311
in the long run.

00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.921
Narrator:
When the war ended,

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.286
the nation celebrated.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.993
But the Lanham Act
was terminated-

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:03.724
and most of the childcare
centers were shut down.

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.603
Policymakers expected
and childcare,

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:12.264
to return to the home...

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:17.043
But the number
of working mothers

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.476
would continue to grow.

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:22.682
After the war,

00:06:22.682 --> 00:06:25.351
Americans entered
a period of hope,

00:06:25.351 --> 00:06:27.149
but great uncertainty.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:33.059
But again, government
eased American families

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.895
through this huge
social change

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.522
with low-cost mortgages...

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.331
farm and small business loans...

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:44.367
college tuition...

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:47.298
job training...

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.540
and tax deductions
for dependent children.

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:54.279
The result?

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:59.152
An increase in
well-paid jobs, marriages,

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:01.387
and affordable housing.

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:02.255
Lovett:
Federal subsidies

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:05.091
really facilitated a move
on a grand scale

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:07.184
into what we would think of
as middle class.

00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:10.830
Narrator:
post-war prosperity

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.824
was by and large limited
to white families.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:21.537
The Civil Rights movement
was growing.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.012
African Americans demanded
the same rights

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:28.381
and opportunities
granted to white families

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.551
in the booming
post-war economy.

00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:32.351
Woman:
In many ways,

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.854
the Civil Rights Movement
really was about children.

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:38.591
Having parents who went
and sacrificed everything

00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.460
in order to get their children
a better life.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.692
And a fair chance to realize
their individual potential.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:48.067
Man:
It's hard to overestimate

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:50.470
the importance of
the Civil Rights Movement

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.805
in establishing equality

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:56.242
as a core value
of '60s political movements.

00:07:56.242 --> 00:08:00.770
It shapes all of the subsequent
movements into the 1960s.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.116
Narrator:
And it forced political leaders

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:06.745
to confront
America's inequalities.

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:12.992
This Administration today,
here and now,

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:17.797
declares unconditional war
on poverty in America.

00:08:17.797 --> 00:08:20.066
(applause)

00:08:20.066 --> 00:08:21.901
Narrator:
In 1964,

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.736
President Lyndon Johnson
introduced

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.806
the nation's
Great Society legislation:

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:29.308
programs like Medicare
and Medicaid,

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:32.178
job training,
and Civil Rights laws

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.680
would enable more
Americans to share

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.081
in the nation's
growing prosperity.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:40.853
Self:
In the '60s,

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.189
political movements
are pushing

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.157
a little bit closer
toward a notion

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.626
of a collective responsibility

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:50.263
for the health and well-being
of all families.

00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:53.933
The Great Society is
an extension of that idea.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:54.634
Lovett:
It's hard for us

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:55.935
to imagine it now,

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.837
but I think the vision
of the future

00:08:57.837 --> 00:09:02.008
in the 1960s and the 1970s
was one that was shared.

00:09:02.008 --> 00:09:05.845
We had shared visions
of what was possible.

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:07.146
There was an optimism

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:09.115
about what you could do
in the future,

00:09:09.115 --> 00:09:10.912
and children were
a central part of that.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.619
Narrator:
At the same time,

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.020
the lives of mothers
were changing.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.824
Self:
There's a real dramatic increase

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:21.227
in the number of women
in the paid workforce

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:25.331
between the World War II era
and the 1970s.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:28.868
And that's women with younger
children now for the first time

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:32.201
coming into the paid workforce
in large, large numbers.

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:37.143
Man:
We were looking at projections,

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:40.746
and there were clearly going
to be more women working

00:09:40.746 --> 00:09:45.384
because most of them
required it,

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:49.822
men's supervisory wages
were stuck,

00:09:49.822 --> 00:09:53.993
and suddenly women who may
still want to stay home

00:09:53.993 --> 00:09:56.291
were required to work.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:10:01.067
Lovett:
You have an economic situation

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:04.870
which will really necessitate
a return to work.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:08.674
Something like 50% of women,
and especially working mothers,

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:11.277
returned to the workforce.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:13.446
And so you have to
accommodate that!

00:10:13.446 --> 00:10:17.083
A quality comprehensive
child development program

00:10:17.083 --> 00:10:19.552
in this country, I think,
would be cost-effective.

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:20.419
I know it would be.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:22.254
It would be one of the best
dollar investments

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:25.088
we ever made, just in
sheer economic terms.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.530
Narrator:
In 1971, Minnesota Senator

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.933
and future Vice President
Walter Mondale

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:36.602
championed an ambitious
new policy,

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:38.604
to meet the changing needs
of children

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:41.440
and working families:

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.536
comprehensive childcare
for all American families.

00:10:47.313 --> 00:10:49.782
Sid Johnson,
a young government aide,

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:52.218
ran Mondale's subcommittee.

00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.119
Johnson:
He told me

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:54.987
that in the Washington Post

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:56.589
there'd been an article

00:10:56.589 --> 00:11:00.626
about a young African-American
in the second or third grade

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:05.631
who went to school within view
of his Senate office building...

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:08.734
His mother couldn't afford
day care.

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.634
Single parent.

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:15.908
The younger brother
at home-no lunch.

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:18.944
And Freddie would go
to school,

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:22.014
take half of his school lunch
and run home

00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:24.574
and share it with
his younger brother.

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:28.587
On this day,
he was running fast

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:32.752
and he was killed by a truck
that ran over him.

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:38.388
I'll never get over that.

00:11:39.832 --> 00:11:44.537
Right in the nation's capital,
right under the capital dome,

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:49.065
good people trying under the
toughest of circumstances.

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:52.945
And Senator Mondale thought,

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:56.449
"How could this happen
in our country-

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.009
the richest country
in the world?"

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:05.224
Nixon:
I see the face of a child.

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.526
What his color is,
what his ancestry is,

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:08.461
doesn't matter.

00:12:08.461 --> 00:12:11.497
What does matter is
he is an American child.

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:12.998
That child is more important

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:14.700
than any
politician's promise...

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.701
Narrator:
Senator Mondale

00:12:15.701 --> 00:12:17.503
had every reason to believe

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:19.572
that the richest country
in the world

00:12:19.572 --> 00:12:23.375
would make life better for
its most vulnerable citizens.

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:24.844
Nixon:
I ask you to help me make

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:26.746
the American dream come true,

00:12:26.746 --> 00:12:30.773
for those to whom it seems
an impossible dream today.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.056
Narrator:
When Richard Nixon took office,

00:12:37.056 --> 00:12:40.219
he promised support for
children from birth to five.

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:45.097
What happens to the child
from a nutritional standpoint,

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:46.599
from an educational standpoint,

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.001
from an environmental
standpoint,

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.903
in the years between 1 and 5

00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:53.205
may affect that child
for the balance of his life

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:55.401
regardless of what may
happen after that time.

00:12:57.576 --> 00:12:58.444
Man:
We used to have

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:59.712
a wonderful tradition.

00:12:59.712 --> 00:13:00.679
Every ten years

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.916
there would be a White House
Conference on Children.

00:13:03.916 --> 00:13:07.386
In 1970,
Nixon gave a presentation.

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:08.954
I helped write his speech,

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:12.191
and the absolute
number one priority

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:14.727
that they wanted action on

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:18.755
was good quality,
affordable childcare.

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.202
The big debate within
the Nixon Administration

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:27.239
was what was the quality of
that childcare going to be?

00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:30.242
A lot of the conservatives
in the Nixon Administration,

00:13:30.242 --> 00:13:33.379
they wanted what we would
call custodial care -

00:13:33.379 --> 00:13:37.116
just keep 'em dry
and safe and that's it.

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:39.718
Mondale:
We had a big fight over that.

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:42.621
We wanted quality care.

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:46.292
And I think all the evidence
shows that's what works.

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:49.228
As a matter of fact,
just custodial care -

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:53.299
a child stacked with other
children with no help-

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.630
could be harmful.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:57.469
Narrator:
Indiana Congressman

00:13:57.469 --> 00:14:00.739
John Brademas
co-sponsored the bill,

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:01.507
which would be called

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:04.510
the Comprehensive Child
Development Act.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.513
The legislation aimed to make
high quality childcare

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:11.916
and early education available
to all American families.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.591
It would be modeled
after Head Start,

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:20.259
an early childhood program

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:22.990
that was part of
the Great Society vision.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.999
Like other Great Society
programs,

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.869
Head Start sought
to promote social equality

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:31.503
and national prosperity.

00:14:31.503 --> 00:14:35.338
Teacher:
I want everybody to write, ABC.

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:38.076
Everybody!

00:14:39.144 --> 00:14:40.646
Narrator:
Marian Wright Edelman,

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:43.515
a young lawyer just out
of Yale Law School,

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.951
worked with Head Start
in rural Mississippi

00:14:45.951 --> 00:14:49.820
during the summer of 1965
when it first began.

00:14:50.623 --> 00:14:51.657
Edelman:
That was the largest

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:53.792
Head Start program
in the nation.

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:57.126
13,000 children, it created
3,000 new jobs.

00:14:58.464 --> 00:15:00.833
It was real
parent participation,

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.468
it was hope,
it was healthcare.

00:15:02.468 --> 00:15:03.869
And Head Start
was comprehensive

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:06.505
so that you got to deal with
all the needs of the child.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:11.534
And it was a beacon of what
should be for every child.

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:14.313
Narrator:
But funding for Head Start

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:17.681
was limited, and only available
to a fraction of children.

00:15:19.251 --> 00:15:21.687
Edelman saw the child
development act

00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:23.656
as a way to provide
the Head Start

00:15:23.656 --> 00:15:25.824
experience to all children,

00:15:25.824 --> 00:15:28.160
and organized a coalition
to help draft

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.561
and push through
the legislation.

00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:32.731
Edelman:
The unions were

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:34.566
the first place I went.

00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:37.436
I went to the teachers.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:39.772
Feminism was robust then,

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.908
and they became
apart of the coalition.

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.710
It was pretty clear
to me early on

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.512
that you had to build
self-interest

00:15:46.512 --> 00:15:50.642
into doing good for children
as a way of moving forward.

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:52.885
Lovett:
Groups like

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:54.620
the National Organization
of Women,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.890
or the Women's Action Alliance
really understood that,

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.792
in fact, if you wanted to
make a difference,

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.260
a tangible difference,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:05.197
you had to give women
access to childcare.

00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:06.966
The Women's Movement
affected the way

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:12.938
that we could imagine what half
of our population could do.

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:14.807
But also there was a narrative

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:18.644
that framed this re-imagining
of gender roles

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:21.170
as an attack on the family.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.651
Narrator:
In 1971,

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:29.588
Phyllis Schlafly was a political
activist in Alton, Illinois.

00:16:30.556 --> 00:16:33.292
She, along with a growing
number of conservatives,

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:35.828
fiercely opposed
the childcare bill,

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.763
and framed it as
an attack on families.

00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:42.668
The Mondale-Brademas bill

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:46.905
was a very radical piece
of legislation.

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:48.974
It was really for the government

00:16:48.974 --> 00:16:51.443
to takeover the raising
of children.

00:16:51.443 --> 00:16:53.746
That was not what we wanted

00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:57.648
and not the kind of country
that we wanted to live in.

00:17:00.419 --> 00:17:01.787
Narrator:
Schlafly and her allies

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:05.858
staunchly defended
their idea of the family,

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.089
where mothers would stay home
to care for their children...

00:17:11.697 --> 00:17:15.501
and asserted that with hard work
and determination alone,

00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:19.938
all families could prosper
without government programs.

00:17:19.938 --> 00:17:21.774
Self:
And so when they look at

00:17:21.774 --> 00:17:25.110
Civil Rights and all of these
kinds of social programs

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.280
that are attempting to support
the American family,

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.652
in their minds, they see that
as benefitting immoral families.

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:36.355
Families that have bad values.

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.891
Families that don't
work hard enough.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:40.292
Narrator:
Schlafly's ascent

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:41.560
in conservative circles

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.830
had been propelled
by "A Choice, Not an Echo,"

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:49.301
a self-published book that
she sold out of her garage -

00:17:49.301 --> 00:17:51.870
three million copies.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:54.673
The book was written
in support of Arizona Senator

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:59.344
Barry Goldwater's
1964 Presidential campaign.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:00.879
Announcer:
South Carolina 16 votes

00:18:00.879 --> 00:18:02.973
would put Barry Goldwater
over the top.

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:06.351
Narrator:
Although Goldwater suffered

00:18:06.351 --> 00:18:09.321
a landslide loss
to Lyndon Johnson,

00:18:09.321 --> 00:18:14.026
his campaign galvanized hardcore
conservatives like Schlafly,

00:18:14.026 --> 00:18:16.862
who had the knowledge,
resources and patience

00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:18.997
to build their
political following.

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:21.600
Schlafly:
I had been very active

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.937
in the Federation
of Republican Women,

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:28.173
so I had contacts
all over the country

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:32.111
of Republican women
who knew the political process

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:35.447
and who knew how to
contact their congressmen

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:37.745
and tell them what
we wanted them to do.

00:18:40.119 --> 00:18:41.420
Narrator:
But Schlafly's movement

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.955
was still underground,

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:45.524
and the Comprehensive
Child Development Act

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:49.188
was moving through Congress
with strong bipartisan support.

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:53.565
In addition to childcare
and pre-school,

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:55.534
new program would include

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:58.203
after-school care
for older children,

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:03.041
meals, medical treatment,
dental check-ups and counseling

00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.277
that would be available
to the poor for free

00:19:05.277 --> 00:19:07.946
and to everyone else
on a sliding scale.

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:11.650
Johnson:
It was locally controlled,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.986
it was totally voluntary,

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:17.422
limited to children
whose parents requested it.

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:19.725
Narrator:
The Comprehensive

00:19:19.725 --> 00:19:21.293
Child Development Act

00:19:21.293 --> 00:19:25.097
was budgeted at $2 billion
for the first year,

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:28.533
the equivalent
of $11.5 billion today.

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:32.905
The League of Women Voters,

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:35.774
American Home
Economics Association,

00:19:35.774 --> 00:19:38.143
Parent Teacher Association,

00:19:38.143 --> 00:19:40.445
the National Conference
of Catholic Charities,

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:42.447
all endorsed the bill,

00:19:42.447 --> 00:19:45.184
as did the United
Methodist Church,

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.453
the Baptist Joint Committee
on Public Affairs,

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:51.323
American Academy
of Pediatrics

00:19:51.323 --> 00:19:53.759
and a legion of others.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:54.760
Mondale:
There was

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.161
an overwhelming consensus

00:19:56.161 --> 00:19:59.364
that this was a sensible,
reasonable bill.

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:01.166
We were close
to getting something

00:20:01.166 --> 00:20:03.936
would give young Americans

00:20:03.936 --> 00:20:06.996
in that situation a
better chance.

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:13.345
Narrator:
In the fall of 1971,

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.047
the child development bill

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:17.345
passed both houses
of Congress.

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:21.353
Mondale:
, in my opinion,

00:20:21.353 --> 00:20:24.623
the most single important
new public policy needed

00:20:24.623 --> 00:20:25.783
in America today.

00:20:27.326 --> 00:20:28.994
Narrator:
But to become law,

00:20:28.994 --> 00:20:31.730
it would need
President Nixon's signature,

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.927
and opposition forces
had reached the White House.

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.337
A young conservative
White House aide

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:40.005
named Patrick Buchanan

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:43.909
was putting a different spin
on the child development bill.

00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:44.643
Buchanan:
I did call it

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:46.478
the most radical piece
of legislation

00:20:46.478 --> 00:20:49.848
to come out of this Congress
of the United States.

00:20:49.848 --> 00:20:52.484
And we saw that over
in the Soviet Union.

00:20:52.484 --> 00:20:54.052
Taking kids
from their parents

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:57.522
and putting them
into these institutions

00:20:57.522 --> 00:21:01.159
and having them educated there
rather than at home,

00:21:01.159 --> 00:21:03.389
didn't seem to me to be
traditionally American.

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:06.732
I was very close
to the President,

00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:11.370
and he'd look to me
to tell him

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.373
what the thinking
and feeling was

00:21:14.373 --> 00:21:16.174
of the Conservative Movement.

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:19.511
All these groups were
basically the elite,

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.912
if you will, the political elite
of the right.

00:21:23.515 --> 00:21:25.117
Narrator:
One group of powerful,

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:28.053
elite conservatives known
as the Manhattan 12

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:31.256
was so incensed by Nixon's
tilt towards the center

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:32.858
they planned to introduce

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:35.427
a right-wing republican
challenger to Nixon

00:21:35.427 --> 00:21:36.917
in the 72 primary.

00:21:38.196 --> 00:21:39.231
Buchanan:
Nixon had imposed

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.632
wage and price controls,

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:42.968
he had announced
he was going to China.

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:45.767
So he had a real problem
with the Conservative Movement.

00:21:48.373 --> 00:21:49.808
Narrator:
The childcare bill

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:53.745
became a lightning rod
for conservative attacks.

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:55.547
With Buchanan's support,

00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:57.582
the Manhattan 12 launched
a campaign

00:21:57.582 --> 00:22:00.285
of editorials
attacking the bill,

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:02.686
and demanding
a presidential veto.

00:22:04.923 --> 00:22:07.559
Buchanan:
If I saw editorials

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:09.661
on this issue,
I could write a memo

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.430
to the President
of the United States saying:

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.098
"This is developing,
this is building,

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:17.069
we're up for re-election,
and we've got a problem here."

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:18.670
Narrator:
Buchanan made sure

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.407
that Nixon could see there
was a real political threat-

00:22:22.407 --> 00:22:24.205
and a political opportunity.

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:28.580
The solution?

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.116
Nixon would veto the bill,

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:33.819
and Buchanan would write
the message himself,

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.687
in language so strong

00:22:35.687 --> 00:22:39.524
it would not only extinguish
the idea once and for all-

00:22:39.524 --> 00:22:41.993
it would electrify
his right wing base.

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:14.793
I said I want to write a veto
at the same time

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:16.995
which is political
and ideological

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:21.867
and which hits the Child
Development Act at its core.

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:25.701
And that's exactly what he did,
and he hit a grand slam.

00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:30.709
Narrator:
On December 9,1971,

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:33.007
Nixon released
his veto message.

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.214
The President
says the $2 billion

00:23:36.214 --> 00:23:38.717
to have been spent on
the first year for childcare

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:42.087
would be, as he put it,
a long leap into the dark.

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:42.921
One of his other objections...

00:23:42.921 --> 00:23:44.856
Buchanan:
This is the heart of it...

00:23:44.856 --> 00:23:47.692
"...for the federal government
to plunge headlong financially

00:23:47.692 --> 00:23:50.195
"into supporting
child development

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:52.764
"would commit
the vast moral authority

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:54.099
of the national government..."

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:58.703
"...to the side of communal
approaches to child rearing

00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:02.663
over and against the
family-centered approach."

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:05.332
Do you agree with that?

00:24:06.044 --> 00:24:07.842
Yes. Yeah.

00:24:10.382 --> 00:24:11.679
Yeah. Oh, it's great.

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:13.452
Brademas:
With one stroke of the

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:15.287
President Nixon has broken
his own promise

00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.755
to support child development,

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:20.025
and he has greatly damaged
the chances

00:24:20.025 --> 00:24:23.562
for the children
of working families

00:24:23.562 --> 00:24:26.064
as well as poor children
to have an opportunity

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:28.400
for the kind of healthful
and stimulating development

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.302
which the President,
at one point in time

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:33.271
pledged his administration
to support.

00:24:33.271 --> 00:24:35.073
Edelman:
The veto really did hurt.

00:24:35.073 --> 00:24:37.742
It said it was
undermining the family

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:39.811
when the family and
parent role was central

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:42.214
to everything
we'd talked about.

00:24:42.214 --> 00:24:44.616
It said it was going to
communalize family life.

00:24:44.616 --> 00:24:44.649
Nixon's veto message

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:45.817
Nixon's veto message

00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.753
is really the first time
that an American President,

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:51.890
the leader of one
of the national parties

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.960
reaches out
and takes that rhetoric

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.761
and nationalizes it,

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:59.464
this rhetoric about the threat
to the American family.

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:03.301
And suddenly the right wing

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:06.601
had a new and powerful
organizing tool.

00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:09.307
Narrator:
Mondale and Brademas

00:25:09.307 --> 00:25:12.644
tried to revive their
childcare legislation,

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:16.314
but conservative forces
were growing even stronger.

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:17.315
Mondale:
We decided

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:19.518
back at it again.

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:21.853
We changed some
of the wording

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.822
that the right wing had used.

00:25:23.822 --> 00:25:26.691
We took the word
"comprehensive" out of there.

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:31.596
We emphasized the control
that rested in the parents,

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:34.833
the voluntary nature
of the program.

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:37.131
But the opposition was building.

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:41.606
Narrator:
An anonymous flyer

00:25:41.606 --> 00:25:43.808
was rippling
through the country,

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:46.278
with misleading
and false accusations

00:25:46.278 --> 00:25:47.677
against the new bill.

00:25:49.147 --> 00:25:50.315
Johnson:
It alleged

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:54.152
that parents cannot
require their children

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:58.356
to go to church or Sunday school
or the synagogue.

00:25:58.356 --> 00:26:04.396
It said further that if
a government official found

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:07.666
that in his or her judgment
the parents

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:12.337
were not doing an adequate job
rearing their children,

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:13.538
they could come in

00:26:13.538 --> 00:26:17.842
and take the authority away
from the parents.

00:26:17.842 --> 00:26:19.010
Narrator:
The flyer ignited

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.147
a firestorm of editorials.

00:26:22.147 --> 00:26:24.547
Letters poured into Washington.

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:28.253
Johnson:
I got dozens of calls

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:31.690
from my colleagues,
staff members,

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.492
Republican and Democratic,
saying,

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:36.494
"How do we respond to this?"

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:38.530
Mondale:
Some of the attacks

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.865
were so unhinged
from reality and honesty.

00:26:44.703 --> 00:26:45.737
Johnson:
The veto message

00:26:45.737 --> 00:26:51.209
and the unsigned flyer
touched emotions and fears.

00:26:51.209 --> 00:26:54.045
It turned out to be a very
effective organizing tool

00:26:54.045 --> 00:26:54.876
for the right wing.

00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:03.187
Fear in politics almost
always triumphs hope.

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:06.358
Buchanan:
That was one of the last

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:10.061
great attempts of
the Great Society Democrats

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:14.532
to basically recreate America.

00:27:14.532 --> 00:27:16.735
We stopped that piece cold.

00:27:16.735 --> 00:27:20.405
And I'm glad we did.

00:27:20.405 --> 00:27:22.374
Mondale:
They did find a golden

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:26.945
of anxiety in America
that worked,

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:28.380
and they knew it worked.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.177
And I think they've kept it up.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:33.551
Narrator:
Similar legislation

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:37.750
didn't breathe in Washington
for over four decades.

00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:41.092
What Nixon's veto

00:27:41.092 --> 00:27:44.663
of the childcare development
act really symbolized,

00:27:44.663 --> 00:27:47.565
is that the American
social contract

00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:52.404
would really not extend
in a broad way,

00:27:52.404 --> 00:27:54.531
to help American families.

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:56.941
Narrator:
During the 40 years

00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:59.411
since the veto, politicians,

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.813
many calling themselves
"pro-family,"

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:04.949
have continued to
chip away at programs

00:28:04.949 --> 00:28:07.786
that actually helped
children and families,

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:10.653
and helped our society
build its middle class.

00:28:12.657 --> 00:28:15.193
They've targeted them
as unaffordable,

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:20.131
not the government's job,
and an intrusion on families.

00:28:20.131 --> 00:28:26.438
When we bailout banks,
or when we allow resources

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:30.875
to be garnered by
the top 1 % of the population

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.812
and we forget that
we have an investment

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:37.182
in the entire population

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:41.653
we really set a different kind
of value system.

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.154
The President says he vetoed it

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:45.790
mostly because of
its provisions for chitdcare.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:48.159
Services ranging
from prenatal care

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.729
to counseling for teenagers
would have been established.

00:28:50.729 --> 00:28:51.529
Mr. Nixon says,

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.298
and I quote from
his veto statement,

00:28:53.298 --> 00:28:56.167
"No immediate need
has been demonstrated"

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:57.669
for these centers.

00:28:57.669 --> 00:29:00.001
Dan Rather, CBS News,
Washington.

00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:04.542
Did you know about that?

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:05.874
-1 didn't know about it.
-1 didn't.

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.513
Can you imagine

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:13.384
if there was a federal program
with sliding fee childcare-

00:29:13.384 --> 00:29:15.887
would that be fantastic
or would that be fantastic?

00:29:15.887 --> 00:29:15.920
Hi, Caleb!

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.089
Hi, Caleb!

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:20.353
Are you looking for Mama Lisa?

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:23.728
Hi, Caleb!

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:25.096
Narrator:
There is a federal

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:29.734
childcare program for one of
our nation's largest employers.

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:31.436
Man:
If our families

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.937
are taken care of,

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.272
there's a sense
of security out there

00:29:34.272 --> 00:29:35.940
that we don't have
to worry about them

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.670
and we can concentrate
on the mission.

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:41.045
Narrator:
The military's childcare

00:29:41.045 --> 00:29:44.582
was once as abysmal as
the rest of the country's.

00:29:44.582 --> 00:29:48.853
But in 1989,
18 years after Nixon's veto,

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:52.257
Congress mandated that
they provide high quality care

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:54.657
to any of their families
who wanted it.

00:29:55.593 --> 00:29:56.861
Langley:
That's our future.

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.230
That's tomorrow's scientists.

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.432
That's tomorrow's educators.

00:30:01.432 --> 00:30:03.663
What we do
is absolutely critical.

00:30:04.302 --> 00:30:06.805
(engine roar)

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:09.474
Narrator:
Today, the US Armed Forces

00:30:09.474 --> 00:30:11.776
offers some of the best
child-centered care

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:12.573
in the nation.

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:17.982
It's affordable,
and strictly regulated.

00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:20.418
We were once achingly close

00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:25.623
to extending this kind of care
to allot America's children.

00:30:25.623 --> 00:30:28.393
We know how to doit.

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:31.062
We've enacted
effective family policies

00:30:31.062 --> 00:30:33.898
in past times of need.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.798
Will we do it again?

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:40.104
We've got to figure out
how to sound the sirens,
