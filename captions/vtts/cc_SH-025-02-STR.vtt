00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.730


2
00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.930
Amen.

3
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:19.130
Amen.

4
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:31.500
Amen.

5
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.130
Why so, now have I done a good day's work.

6
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.370
You peers, continue this united league.

7
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.200
I every day expect an embassage from my Redeemer

8
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.470
to redeem me hence,

9
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.130
and now in peace my soul shall part to Heaven,

10
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.630
since I have made my friends at peace on Earth.

11
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.200
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand.

12
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.400
Dissemble not your hatred.

13
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.800
Swear your love.

14
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.330
By heaven, my soul is purged from grudging hate,

15
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.570
and with my hand, I seal my true heart's love.

16
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.000
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like.

17
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.270
Take heed you dally not before your king,

18
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.400
lest he that is the supreme King of kings

19
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.730
confound your hidden falsehood

20
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.500
and award either of you to be the other's end.

21
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.600
So prosper I as I swear perfect love.

22
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.970
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart.

23
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.670
Yourself, madam, is not exempt from this.

24
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.570
Nor you, son Dorset;

25
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.900
Buckingham, nor you.

26
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.800
You have been factious, one against the other.

27
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.770
Wife, love Lord Hastings.

28
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.930
Let him kiss your hand.

29
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.030
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

30
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.900
There, Hastings.

31
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.030
I will never more remember our former hatred,

32
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.700
so thrive I and mine.

33
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.900
Dorset, embrace him.

34
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.900
Hastings, love lord marquess.

35
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.670
This interchange of love, I here protest,

36
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.670
upon my part shall be inviolable.

37
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.670
And so swear I.

38
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.330
Now princely Buckingham.

39
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.970
Seal thou this league

40
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.330
with thy embracements to my wife's allies,

41
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.500
and make me happy in your unity.

42
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.970
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate on your grace,

43
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.300
but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours,

44
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.700
God punish me with hate in those where I expect most love.

45
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.670
When I have most need to employ a friend,

46
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.000
and most assured that he is a friend,

47
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.370
deep, hollow, treacherous, or full of guile,

48
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.670
be he unto me!

49
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.670
This do I beg of God

50
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.930
when I am cold in love to you or yours.

51
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.430
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,

52
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.670
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.

53
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.700
O! There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here

54
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.530
to make the blessed period of this peace.

55
00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.900
And in good time,

56
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.730
here come Sir Richard Ratcliffe and the duke.

57
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.370
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen.

58
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.900
And, princely peers, a happy time of day.

59
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.300
Happy indeed, as we have spent the day.

60
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.230
Gloucester,

61
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.530
we have done deeds of charity,

62
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.070
made peace of enmity, fair love of hate

63
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.700
between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.

64
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.700
A blessed labor, my most sovereign lord.

65
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.930
Among this princely heap,

66
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.030
if any here by false intelligence or wrong surmise

67
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.500
hold me a foe,

68
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.900
if I unwittingly or in my rage

69
00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.170
have aught committed that is hardly borne

70
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.800
by any in this presence,

71
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.830
I desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace.

72
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.830
'Tis death to me to be at enmity.

73
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.700
I hate it and desire all good men's love.

74
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.570
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,

75
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.270
which I will purchase with my duteous service.

76
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.930
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,

77
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.700
if ever any grudge were lodged between us;

78
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.930
of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you,

79
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.870
that all without desert have frowned on me;

80
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.170
dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen, indeed, of all;

81
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.170
I do not know that Englishman alive

82
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.000
with whom my soul is any jot at odds

83
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.800
more than the infant that is born tonight.

84
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.930
I thank my God for my humility.

85
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.470
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.

86
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.800
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.

87
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.930
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your highness

88
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.570
to take our brother Clarence to your grace.

89
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.030
Why, madam, have I offered love for this,

90
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.870
to be so flouted in this royal presence?

91
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.130
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?

92
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.630
You do him injury to scorn his corse.

93
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.700
Who knows not he is dead?

94
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.500
Who knows he is?

95
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.170
All-seeing Heaven, what a world is this?

96
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.430
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?

97
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.700
Ay, my good lord.

98
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.970
And no man in the presence

99
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.230
but his red color hath forsook his cheeks.

100
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.870
Is Clarence dead?

101
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.870
The order was reversed!

102
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.770
But he, poor man, by your first order died,

103
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.100
and that a winged Mercury did bear.

104
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.200
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand

105
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.830
that came too lag to see him buried.

106
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.530
God grant that some less noble and less loyal,

107
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.530
nearer in bloody thoughts but not in blood,

108
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.800
deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did

109
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.230
and yet go current from suspicion.

110
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.300
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done.

111
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.300
I pray thee, peace.

112
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.470
My soul is full of sorrow.

113
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.170
I will not rise unless your highness hear me.

114
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.230
Then say at once what is it thou demand'st.

115
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.630
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life,

116
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.600
who slew today a righteous gentleman

117
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.970
lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.

118
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.030
Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,

119
00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.570
and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?

120
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.330
My brother killed no man.

121
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.500
His fault was thought,

122
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.830
yet his punishment was bitter death.

123
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.630
Who sued to me for him?

124
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.030
Who in my wrath kneeled at my feet

125
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.570
and bade me be advised?

126
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.530
Who spoke of brotherhood?

127
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.330
Who spoke of love?

128
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.130
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty Warwick

129
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.200
and did fight for me?

130
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:17.530
Who told me in the field at Tewksbury

131
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.230
when Oxford had me down, he rescued me and said,

132
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.700
"Dear brother, live, and be a king"?

133
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:34.230
Who told me, when we both lay in the field,

134
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.130
frozen almost to death,

135
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.400
how he did lap me even in his garments

136
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.130
and did give himself, all thin and naked,

137
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.070
to the numb cold night?

138
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.170
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluck'd,

139
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.530
and not a man of you had so much grace to put it in my mind!

140
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.300
Oh, but when your carters or your waiting vassals

141
00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.730
have done a drunken slaughter,

142
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.270
you straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon!

143
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:16.570
And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.

144
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:32.170
But for my brother, not a man would speak,

145
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:37.430
nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself for him, poor soul.

146
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.370
The proudest of you all

147
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:44.070
have been beholding to him in his life,

148
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.530
yet none of you would once beg for his life!

149
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.070
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold

150
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.270
on me and you and mine and yours for this!

151
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:08.800
Come, Hastings.

152
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.070
Help me to my closet.

153
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.230
Oh, poor Clarence.

154
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.400
This is the fruits of rashness.

155
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.170
Marked you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen

156
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.130
looked pale when they did hear of Clarence death?

157
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:56.130
O, they did urge it still unto the king.

158
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.870
God will revenge it.

159
00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.530
Come, lords, will you go to comfort Edward with our company?

160
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:07.600
We wait upon your grace.

161
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.830
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?

162
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.500
No, boy.

163
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.230
Why do you weep so oft and beat your breast

164
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.670
and cry, "O Clarence, my unhappy son"?

165
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.570
Why do you look on us and shake your head

166
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.800
and call us orphans, wretches, castaways

167
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.170
if that our noble father were alive?

168
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.870
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both.

169
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:58.630
I do lament the sickness of the king,

170
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.370
as loath to lose him, not your father's death.

171
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.870
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.

172
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.530
Then you conclude, my grandam.

173
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.030
He is dead.

174
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:16.200
The king, mine uncle, is to blame for it.

175
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.900
God will revenge it,

176
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.900
whom I will importune with earnest prayers

177
00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.070
all to that effect.

178
00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.070
And so will I!

179
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.830
Peace, children, peace.

180
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.270
The king doth love you well.

181
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.970
Incapable and shallow innocents,

182
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.900
you cannot guess who caused your father's death.

183
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.130
Grandam, we can,

184
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.730
for my good uncle Gloucester told me

185
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.130
the king, provoked to it by the queen,

186
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.670
devised impeachments to imprison him.

187
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.270
And when my uncle told me so,

188
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.330
he wept and pitied me,

189
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:56.600
kindly kissed my cheek,

190
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.330
bade me rely on him as on my father,

191
00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.430
and he would love me dearly as a child.

192
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.130
Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shape

193
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.900
and with a virtuous vizard hide deep vice!

194
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:15.530
He is my son, aye, and herein my shame,

195
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.070
yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.

196
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.870
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?

197
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.100
Aye, boy.

198
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.130
I cannot think it.

199
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.970
Hark! What noise is this?

200
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.800
Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,

201
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.670
to chide my fortune and torment myself?

202
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.230
I'll join with black despair against my soul

203
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.570
and to myself become an enemy.

204
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:41.330
What means this scene of rude impatience?

205
00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.600
To make an act of tragic violence.

206
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.330
Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead!

207
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.730
Why grow the branches when the root is gone?

208
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.000
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?

209
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.730
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,

210
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.170
that our swift-winged souls may catch the king's

211
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.900
or like obedient subjects,

212
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.170
follow him to his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.

213
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.170
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow

214
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.570
as I had title in thy noble husband.

215
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.400
I have bewept a worthy husband's death

216
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.630
and lived with looking on his images.

217
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.500
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance

218
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.870
are cracked in pieces by malignant death,

219
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.000
and I for comfort have but one false glass

220
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.870
that grieves me when I see my shame in him.

221
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.000
Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother

222
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.800
and hast the comfort of thy children left.

223
00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.330
But death hath snatched my husband from mine arms

224
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.470
and plucked two crutches from my feeble hands,

225
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.370
Clarence and Edward.

226
00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.800
O, what cause have I,

227
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.130
thine being but a moiety of my moan,

228
00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.730
to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries!

229
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.630
Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death.

230
00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.100
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?

231
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.770
Our fatherless distress was left unmoaned.

232
00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.070
Your widow dolor likewise be unwept!

233
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.900
Give me no help in lamentation.

234
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.330
I am not barren to bring forth complaints.

235
00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.470
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,

236
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.030
that I, being governed by the watery moon,

237
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.730
may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!

238
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.930
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!

239
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.930
Oh, for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!

240
00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:43.430
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence.

241
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.600
What stay had I but Edward?

242
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.100
And he's gone.

243
00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.930
What stay had we but Clarence?

244
00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:49.930
And he's gone.

245
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.100
What stays had I but they?

246
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.100
And they are gone.

247
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.830
Was never widow had so dear a loss!

248
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:58.570
Were never orphans had so dear a loss.

249
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.770
Was never mother had so dear a loss.

250
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.930
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.

251
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.670
Their woes are parceled.

252
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.270
Mine is general.

253
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.870
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I.

254
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.100
I for a Clarence weep.

255
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.000
So doth not she.

256
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.230
These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I.

257
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.830
I for an Edward weep.

258
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.900
So do not they.

259
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.270
Alas, you three, on me,

260
00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:49.100
threefold distressed, pour all your tears.

261
00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.800
I am your sorrow's nurse,

262
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.270
and I will pamper it with lamentation.

263
00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.130
Comfort, dear mother.

264
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.030
God is much displeased

265
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:10.330
that you take with unthankfulness his doing.

266
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.270
In common worldly things, 'tis called ungrateful

267
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.570
with dull unwillingness to repay a debt

268
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:19.400
which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent,

269
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.000
much more to be thus opposite with Heaven,

270
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.100
for it requires the royal debt it lent you.

271
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.730
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,

272
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.200
of the young prince, your son.

273
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.170
Send straight for him. Let him be crowned.

274
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:38.870
In him your comfort lives.

275
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.830
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave

276
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.570
and plant your joys in living Edward's throne.

277
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:46.130
Sister, have comfort.

278
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.470
All of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star,

279
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.330
but none can help our harms by wailing them.

280
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.070
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy.

281
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.570
I did not see your grace.

282
00:17:57.570 --> 00:17:59.700
Humbly on my knee, I crave your blessing.

283
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.930
God bless thee and put meekness in thy rest,

284
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:08.130
love, charity, obedience, and true duty.

285
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.070
Amen.

286
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.800
And make me die a good old man.

287
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.400
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing.

288
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.270
I marvel that her grace did leave it out.

289
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.930
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers

290
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.230
that bear this heavy mutual load of moan,

291
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.970
now cheer each other in each other's love.

292
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.430
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,

293
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.900
we are to reap the harvest of his son.

294
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.570
The broken rancor of your high-swollen hate,

295
00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.300
but lately splintered, knit, and joined together,

296
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.730
must gently be preserved, cherished, and kept.

297
00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.770
Me seemeth good that with some little train,

298
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.700
forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd

299
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.230
hither to London to be crowned our king.

300
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.230
Why with some little train, my lord of Buckingham?

301
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.700
Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude,

302
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.770
the new-healed wound of malice should break out,

303
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.700
which would be so much the more dangerous

304
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.770
by how much the estate is green and yet ungoverned,

305
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.670
where every horse bears his commanding rein

306
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.230
and may direct his course as please himself,

307
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.200
as well the fear of harm,

308
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.870
as harm apparent, in my opinion, ought to be prevented.

309
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.270
I hope the king made peace with all of us,

310
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.400
and the compact is firm and true in me.

311
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.570
And so in me.

312
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:42.030
And so, I think, in all.

313
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.030
Yet, since it is but green,

314
00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.000
it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach

315
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.900
which haply by much company might be urged.

316
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.870
Therefore, I say with noble Buckingham

317
00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:56.870
that it is meet so few should fetch the prince.

318
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.400
And so say I.

319
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:04.670
Then be it so.

320
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.630
And go we to determine who they shall be

321
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.570
that straight shall post to Ludlow.

322
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.400
Madam, and you, my sister,

323
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.930
will you go to give your censures in this business?

324
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.030
With all our hearts.

325
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.700
Now, my lord, whoever journeys to the prince,

326
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.400
for God's sake, let not us two stay at home,

327
00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.770
for by the way, I'll sort occasion

328
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.170
as index to the story we late talked of,

329
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.400
to part the queen's proud kindred from the prince.

330
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.870
My other self, my counsel's consistory,

331
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.770
my oracle, my prophet.

332
00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:57.000
My dear cousin, I, as a child, will go by thy direction.

333
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.900
Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

334
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:17.000
Good morrow, neighbor.

335
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.730
Whither away so fast?

336
00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.730
I promise you, I scarcely know myself.

337
00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.370
Hear you the news abroad?

338
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.130
Yes, that the king is dead.

339
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:30.670
Oh, ill news, by our lady.

340
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.830
Seldom comes the better.

341
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.100
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.

342
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.470
Neighbors, God speed.

343
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:38.800
Give you good morrow, sir.

344
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.630
Doth the news hold of good King Edward's death?

345
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:43.200
Aye, sir, it is too true; God help the while.

346
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.470
Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.

347
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.470
No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall reign.

348
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:52.470
Woe to that land that's governed by a child.

349
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.400
In him there is a hope of government,

350
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:58.330
which, in his nonage council under him,

351
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.700
and in his full and ripened years, himself, no doubt,

352
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.570
shall then and till then govern well.

353
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:05.270
So stood the state when Henry the Sixth

354
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:07.400
was crowned in Paris but at nine months old.

355
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.930
Stood the state so?

356
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.230
No, no, good friends, God wot.

357
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.630
For then this land was famously enriched

358
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.130
with politic grave counsel.

359
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:20.000
Then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.

360
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.800
Why, so hath this, both by his father and mother.

361
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.600
Better it were they all came by the father

362
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.030
or by his father there were none at all,

363
00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.000
for emulation, who shall now be nearest,

364
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.400
will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.

365
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.530
O, full of danger is the duke of Gloucester

366
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.770
and the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud.

367
00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.300
And were they to be ruled and not to rule,

368
00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.470
This sickly land might solace as before.

369
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:50.930
Come, come. We fear the worst.

370
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.170
All will be well.

371
00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:57.170
When clouds are seen, wise men put on their cloaks.

372
00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.530
When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand.

373
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:03.900
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?

374
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:08.070
Untimely storms makes men expect a dearth.

375
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:11.430
All may be well, but if God sort it so,

376
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.070
'tis more than we deserve or I expect.

377
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:15.470
Truly, the hearts of men are full of fear.

378
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.400
You cannot reason almost with a man

379
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.570
that looks not heavily and full of dread.

380
00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.900
Before the days of change, still is it so.

381
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.730
By a divine instinct,

382
00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:28.300
men's minds mistrust ensuing danger.

383
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.870
As by proof, we see the waters swell before a boisterous storm.

384
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.230
But leave it all to God.

385
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:36.400
Whither away?

386
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.570
Marry, I was sent for to the justices.

387
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.730
Yes, so was I.

388
00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.300
I'll bear you company.

389
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.130
Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony-Stratford,

390
00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.700
and at Northampton, they do rest tonight.

391
00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.930
Tomorrow or next day, they will be here.

392
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.870
I long with all my heart to see the prince.

393
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.300
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.

394
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.470
But I hear no.

395
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.630
They say my son of York

396
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.400
hath almost overta'en him in his growth.

397
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.230
Aye, Mother, but I would not have it so.

398
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.400
Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.

399
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.800
Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,

400
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.930
my uncle Rivers talked how I did grow more than my brother.

401
00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.000
"Aye," quoth my uncle Gloucester,

402
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.630
"Small herbs have grace; great weeds do grow apace."

403
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.470
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,

404
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:35.030
because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.

405
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.470
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold

406
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.170
in him that did object the same to thee.

407
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.930
He was the wretchedest thing when he was young,

408
00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:45.100
so long a-growing and so leisurely,

409
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.730
that if this rule were true, he should be gracious.

410
00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.600
And so, no doubt, he is, my gracious madam.

411
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.630
I hope he is, but yet let mothers doubt.

412
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.000
Now, by my troth, if I had been remembered,

413
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.300
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,

414
00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.570
to touch his growth nearer than he touched mine.

415
00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.730
How, my young York?

416
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:07.830
I pray thee, let me hear it.

417
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:09.600
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast

418
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.930
that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.

419
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.300
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.

420
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.200
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.

421
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.600
I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?

422
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.200
Grandam, his nurse.

423
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.300
His nurse?

424
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.370
Why, she was dead ere thou was born.

425
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.330
If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.

426
00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:29.270
Parlous boy, go to. You are too shrewd!

427
00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:31.800
Good madam, be not angry with the child.

428
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.270
Pitchers have ears.

429
00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.870
Here is a messenger.

430
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.100
What news?

431
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.430
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.

432
00:25:48.330 --> 00:25:49.570
How doth the prince?

433
00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.700
Well, madam, and in health.

434
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:55.730
What is thy news?

435
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.670
Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,

436
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:01.830
and with them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.

437
00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.630
Who hath committed them?

438
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.670
The mighty dukes Gloucester and Buckingham.

439
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:08.070
For what offense?

440
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:09.800
The sum of all I can, I have disclosed.

441
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.300
Why or for what the nobles were committed

442
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.400
is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.

443
00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:21.430
Ay, me.

444
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.600
I see the ruin of my house.

445
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.100
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind.

446
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.130
Insulting tyranny begins to jot

447
00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:34.500
upon the innocent and aweless throne.

448
00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:39.500
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre.

449
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.130
I see as in a map the end of all.

450
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.730
Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,

451
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:56.230
how many of you have mine eyes beheld.

452
00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:01.670
My husband lost his life to get the crown.

453
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.530
And often, up and down, my sons were tossed,

454
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.170
for me to joy and weep their gain and loss.

455
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.700
And being seated and domestic broils clean over-blown,

456
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.600
themselves, the conquerors, make war upon themselves,

457
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.600
brother to brother, blood to blood,

458
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.770
self against self.

459
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.330
O, preposterous and frantic outrage,

460
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.530
end thy damned spleen,

461
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.270
or let me die, to look on earth no more.

462
00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.670
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.

463
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.700
Madam, farewell.

464
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.800
Stay. I will go with you.

465
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.000
You have no cause.

466
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.630
My gracious lady, go,

467
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.170
and thither bear your treasure and your goods.

468
00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.230
For my part,

469
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.630
I'll resign unto your grace the seal I keep.

470
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.970
and so betide to me

471
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.070
as well I tender you and all of yours.

472
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.200
Go.

473
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.600
I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

474
00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.730
