WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Announcer: GRANDPARENTS
 ARE GETTING MORE INVOLVED
 THESE DAYS.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
LET CLARISSA PUT IT
 IN THE CAN-- BOWL.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
- I WANNA DO IT!
- I'M CLARISSA.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
ISN'T HE A NICE DOGGIE?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Announcer:
 BUT WHAT DOES THAT
 MEAN FOR THE CHILDREN?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'VE HAD THEM
MOST OF THEIR LIVES.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
SO I'M THE ONLY
MOTHER THEY KNOW.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
- TODAY...
- Y'ALL HAVE A GREAT DAY.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
...A NEW CONCEPT
 IN HELPING GRANDPARENTS
 HELP THEIR FAMILIES,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
AND HOW TO HELP
 OUR OWN KIDS UNDERSTAND
 THE LESSONS OF LIFE.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT.
I'M MISSING YOUR--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"BRAZELTON ON PARENTING."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
THE ROLE OF GRANDPARENT

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY
OVER THE PAST FEW
GENERATIONS.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
FIRST, EXTENDED FAMILIES
WERE THE NORM

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
AND GRANDPARENTS PLAYED
AN ACTIVE ROLE

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
IN THE DAY-TO-DAY RAISING
OF THE CHILD.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
THEN AS PEOPLE MOVED AWAY
FROM NEIGHBORHOODS
FOR THEIR CAREERS,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
FAMILIES BECAME
MORE NUCLEAR

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
AND I'M AFRAID,
MORE ISOLATED.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
TODAY WE ARE PAYING
THE PRICE OF THAT
ISOLATION

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
AND TURNING BACK
TO TRADITIONAL SOURCES
OF SUPPORT.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
WE BEGIN OUR LOOK
AT THE NEW GRANDPARENT

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
WITH A UNIQUE PROGRAM
THAT'S ADDRESSING
A CRITICAL ISSUE:

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
GRANDPARENTS WHO'VE
ACTUALLY HAD TO TAKE OVER

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
THE ROLE OF PARENT
FOR THEIR GRANDKIDS.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
SHIRLEY WASHINGTON--
 GRANDMOTHER.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
SHIRLEY'S 66
 AND SHE'S HAD TO TAKE ON
 A BRAND-NEW ROLE.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I HAVE THREE
GRANDCHILDREN.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
TWO OF THEM ARE WITH ME
MOST OF THE TIME.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
WHERE DO I
FIT IN?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
BUT SHIRLEY HAD A PROBLEM 
 MANY IN HER POSITION FACE.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Washington:
 I WAS IN A SHELTER.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
MY APARTMENT WAS
 FLOODED OUT PREVIOUSLY.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
WHEN YOU'RE SEARCHING
 FOR AN APARTMENT
 FOR 10 MONTHS...

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
- GO, GRANDMA.
- ...SOMETIMES
  YOU LOSE HOPE.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
BUT WHEN THIS CAME UP,
 IT WAS AN ANSWER
 TO MY PRAYERS.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
YOU WANNA BUY IT?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Brazelton:
 THIS IS GRANDFAMILIES HOUSE,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
A UNIQUE AND INNOVATIVE
 SOLUTION IN SUPPORTING 
 PEOPLE LIKE SHIRLEY.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Janet Van Zandt:
 THE GRANDFAMILIES HOUSE
 IS THE FIRST

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
AND STILL THE ONLY 
HOUSE IN THE NATION

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
THAT IS SPECIFICALLY
FOR GRANDPARENTS

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
WHO ARE RAISING
THEIR GRANDCHILDREN
WITHOUT THE PARENTS PRESENT.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
FOR THESE ELDERS
 WHO ARE FEELING THE EFFECTS
 OF THE AGING

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
AT THE SAME TIME
 THAT THEY'VE DECIDED
 TO TAKE ON

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
THE CHALLENGE OF RAISING
 YOUNG CHILDREN,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
WE WANTED TO CREATE
 AN ENVIRONMENT

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THAT WOULD SUPPORT
 THE FAMILIES.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
WE WANTED
TO CREATE A PLACE

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
THAT WAS PHYSICALLY
SUITED FOR THEM,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
THAT HAD THE GRAB BARS
IN THE BATHROOMS

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
AND THE ELEVATORS
 AND THE RAMPS,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
AND ALSO HAD
 THE PLAYGROUNDS

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
AND THE CHILD-PROOF
WINDOWS

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT
YOU NEED FOR THE KIDS.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Brazelton:
 THE NEED FOR PLACES
 LIKE THIS IS GROWING.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Van Zandt:
 THERE ARE NOW APPROXIMATELY
 1.5 MILLION CHILDREN

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
WHO ARE LIVING WITH
 THEIR GRANDPARENTS WITHOUT
 THEIR PARENTS PRESENT.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Brazelton:
 COMMUNITIES HAVE
 TO RECOGNIZE

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
THE NEW REALITIES
 AND RESPOND,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
CITY COUNCILMAN
 MICKEY ROACHE KNOWS
 ALL TOO WELL.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I WAS PROBABLY
THE LAST ONE TO KNOW

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
ABOUT THE GRANDSON SO...

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
ONE DAY I GET HOME,
THERE WAS A LITTLE BASSINET
OR SOMETHING.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
IT GOES WILD.
I FIGURED OUT RIGHT AWAY

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
THIS LITTLE BABY BOY
WAS MY GRANDSON.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
75% OF THE GRANDPARENTS

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
WHEN ASKED WHAT WAS THE
 MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE--
 WAS HOUSING.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
THAT'S WHY THIS IS
SO WONDERFUL TO BE
SITTING HERE TODAY

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
IN THIS
GRANDFAMILIES HOME.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Brazelton:
 THE PROGRAM PROVIDES
 MUCH MORE THAN HOUSING.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
SUPPORT SERVICES
ARE SPECIALLY DESIGNED

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
LIKE PRESCHOOL
 AND AFTER-SCHOOL

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
TO MEET THE NEEDS
 OF THE GRANDCHILDREN

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
WHO OFTEN HAVE BEEN THROUGH
A GREAT DEAL OF TRAUMA.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
MANY OF THEM WERE
ABUSED OR NEGLECTED.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
ALL OF THEM HAVE LOST
THEIR PARENTS IN SOME FASHION.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
THEY'RE KIDS WHO HAD
 A COUPLE OF STRIKES

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
AGAINST THEM
 TO BEGIN WITH

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
AND THE FACT THAT
 WE CAN BUILD A COMMUNITY
 TO SUPPORT THEM

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
- IS REALLY IMPORTANT.
- THAT'S YOUR GRANDMA!

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
IN LIVING HERE,
IT HAS MADE THINGS
A LOT EASIER FOR US.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
THEY'RE YOUR CHILDREN.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
AND YOU KNOW YOU
 TRY TO RAISE THEM,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
AND YOU DO YOUR VERY BEST
 TO RAISE THEM,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD
RAISE YOUR OWN CHILD.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
BUT THERE IS
 A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR
 RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
JANEYA REALLY NEEDS
A LOT OF PATIENCE BECAUSE
OF HER HANDICAP

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT SHE CAN'T HELP.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
SHE STOMPS.  SHE SCREAMS,
 SHE HOLLER.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
 SHE CAN GET YOUR ATTENTION

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
THAT WAY, BECAUSE
 SHE CANNOT TALK.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
WITH MYESHA, IF IT
WASN'T FOR THE DAYCARE
DOWNSTAIRS,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
A REGULAR DAYCARE OUTSIDE
THE GRANDFAMILIES HOUSE,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I DON'T THINK
 WE COULD HAVE AFFORDED IT.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Dorothy:
 MYESHA, TELL MS. MIMI
 I SAID HI.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
THE GRANDPARENTS ARE
BETTER OFF FINANCIALLY
FOR LIVING HERE.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
THEY HAVE THE RENT
WHICH IS SUBSIDIZED

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
AND WE'RE ABLE
TO HELP WITH THINGS
LIKE TRANSPORTATION

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
AND THE ON-SITE PROGRAMS.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
THEY'RE VERY PLEASED
 THAT WE HAVE A VAN.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
WE CAN TAKE THEM
 TO SHOPPING TRIPS

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
AND WE CAN PICK UP FOOD
 AND WE CAN DO ACTIVITIES.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
WE HAVE A FAMILY ADVOCATE.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
WE'VE HAD
 A LAWYER COME IN

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
AND DO LEGAL RIGHTS
OF GRANDPARENTS.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
WE'VE HAD
SOMEBODY COME IN
AND DO NUTRITION PROGRAMS,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
SOME HEALTH EDUCATION
 PROGRAMS.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Dorothy:
 THEY HAVE LIKE
 A FOOD BANK EVERY FRIDAY

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
THAT THEY GIVE OUT FOOD
TO ALL THE RESIDENTS
IN THE BUILDING,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
AND A LOT OF
 DONATION COMES IN.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Brazelton:
 GRANDFAMILIES HOUSE
 DOESN'T JUST

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
BENEFIT
 THE GRANDPARENTS.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
THE GRANDFAMILIES HOUSE
IS IMPORTANT

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
BECAUSE IT CREATES
A KIND OF COMMUNITY

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
AND A VALIDATION
THAT OFTEN THEY DIDN'T
GET BEFORE,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
WHERE IT SAYS IT'S OKAY
 THAT YOU'RE LIVING WITH
 YOUR GRANDMOTHER

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
AND THAT YOUR MOTHER
 AND FATHER ARE NOT THERE.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
YOUR MISSPELLED WORDS?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Dorothy:
 THE HARD PART OF
 BEING A GRANDPARENT

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
IS THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOUR CHILDREN
MISS THEIR PARENTS.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
THE OLDEST CHILD THOUGHT
 THAT I WAS SEPARATING THEM
 FROM THE PARENT.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I MADE A DECISION
 THAT I WOULD LET HER GO

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
AND STAY WITH
 THE PARENT FOR A WHILE.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
 TOO WELL.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
SO SHE GOT HER ANSWERS

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
AND SHE KNOWS WHERE
THE BEST PLACE IS FOR HER.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
- Girl: GENU-INE.
- GENUINE.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
- GENU-INE.
- GENU-INE.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
- GENUINE.
- YEAH.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
GRANDPARENTS END UP
WITH THEIR GRANDCHILDREN

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
FOR MANY MANY REASONS.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
MOST OF IT
HAS TO DO WITH

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
A LOT OF THE THINGS
THAT GO ON IN OUR SOCIETY
AS A WHOLE.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
THERE ARE ISSUES 
 AROUND ILLNESSES,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
DEATH OF A CHILD,
 INCARCERATION,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
DRUG PROBLEMS,
 MENTAL ILLNESS
 IS ANOTHER ONE.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
THESE ISSUES ARE
JUST PART OF SOCIETY

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
AND THE GRANDPARENTS
THAT TAKE ON THIS ROLE

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
HAVE AGREED TO DO IT
 BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
A GREAT DEAL OF LOVE
 FOR THEIR GRANDCHILDREN.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
YOU'VE TAKEN A CHILD
 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
IN A FOSTER HOME SITUATION
 IF YOU HADN'T,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
AND YOU'VE
HELPED THEM ALONG

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE 
 FEELING A LOT OF LOSS.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
IF YOU ASK ANY
 GRANDPARENT DOING IT,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
THERE ISN'T
 ANY OTHER CHOICE.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
THEY'RE LOVEABLE.
THEY'RE FUN. THEY HAVE FUN.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
THEY JUST KEEP YOU
WANTING TO LOVE THEM

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
AND DO THE VERY BEST
YOU CAN FOR THEM.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
SO I MEAN,
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH THE BURDEN OF IT.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I AIN'T GOT NO COMPLAINT.
 I LOVE THEM.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Dorothy:
 IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
 CAME UP AGAIN THE SAME WAY,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I WOULD TAKE
 MY GRANDCHILDREN.
 I WOULD RAISE THEM

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
BECAUSE I LOVE
MY GRANDCHILDREN

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
AND IF I HAD TO TAKE
ANY OF THE OTHER ONES,
I WOULD.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
- ( girls sing loudly )
- YEAH!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
THERE WAS NO CHOICE THERE,
NO OPTION THERE.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I KNEW WHAT I HAD TO DO--
I PRAYED OVER IT.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
- GENUINE.
- GENU-INE?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
- GENUINE.
- GENU-INE.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Dorothy:
 PROBABLY IF I DIDN'T
 HAVE THEM WITH ME,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I WOULDN'T BE
 UP AND ABOUT.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
- G-U--
- SOUND IT OUT.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I AM.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Dorothy:
 I DON'T HAVE TIME
 TO JUST MOPE AROUND

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
AND WORRY ABOUT
WHAT I DON'T HAVE

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
OR ANY OTHER PREDICAMENT
THAT I THINK THAT I'M IN.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Dorothy:
REWARDED FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR,
EFFORT AND...

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Van Zandt:
 THERE'S THIS SILENT
 SAFETY NET

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
AND THE PEOPLE
 IN THE COMMUNITY
 CAN COME FORWARD

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
AND RISE TO THE OCCASION

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
AND STEP BEYOND THEIR
OWN PERSONAL NEEDS

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
AND TAKE ON THESE
CHALLENGES AND SAY,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
"WE'LL RAISE THE KIDS.
WE'LL FORM A COMMUNITY,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
CLOSE IN AND RAISE
THESE KIDS OURSELVES."

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Roache:
 ALL OVER THE COUNTRY

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
YOU'RE GONNA
 FIND GRANDPARENTS
 OF ALL KINDS, YOU KNOW?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
THEY CAN BE WHITE,
BLACK, HISPANIC.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
THERE'S A NEED TO PROVIDE
 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR
 THESE GRANDPARENTS.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
YOU GOT TO HOLD ON
AND NANA GOTTA HOLD ON.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Roache:
 IT'S A PROFOUND STORY.
 IT'S ABOUT COURAGE,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
IT'S ABOUT CARING,
 IT'S ABOUT UNSELFISHNESS,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
AND IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT
 THE LOVE OF KIDS.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
TODAY WE HAVE
CRYSTAL HOLMES WITH US,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
OUR INTERNET
 EXPERT FROM IBM.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
GRANDPARENTS
AND COMPUTERS?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
WHAT'S ON
THE INTERNET FOR US?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
( chuckles )
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
THERE'S QUITE A BIT
OF INFORMATION.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
THE SITE WE'RE
GONNA GO TO TODAY

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
IS THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION
 FOR RETIRED PERSONS.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
WE ACTUALLY CAN GO
 TO THIS SITE,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
ENTER IN A SEARCH WORD
 ON "GRANDPARENT."

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
THEY HAVE QUITE A FEW
 DOCUMENTS RANGING FROM

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
"GRANDPARENTS GOING THROUGH
 LIFE TRANSITIONS AND
 INDEPENDENT LIVING,"

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
ALL THE WAY TO "GRANDPARENTS
 RAISING GRANDCHILDREN."

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
THEY EVEN HAVE
 SUPPORT GROUPS

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
FOR GRANDPARENTS
 RAISING GRANDCHILDREN.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
BUT YOU KNOW,
THE INTERNET PROVIDES MORE
THAN JUST INFORMATION.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
IT ACTUALLY IS A VERY ROBUST
COMMUNICATIONS TOOL.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
SO GRANDPARENTS
CAN ACTUALLY GET ON
THE INTERNET,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
SIGN UP FOR
A FREE E-MAIL SERVICE,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
AND THEY CAN COMMUNICATE
WITH THEIR GRANDCHILDREN.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
AND IT'S REALLY NEAT
THAT THE TECHNOLOGY
PROVIDES

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
THE ABILITY TO SEND
DIGITAL PHOTOS.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET
A CAMERA THAT YOU PUT
ON TOP OF YOUR COMPUTER.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
IF YOUR GRANDCHILDREN
HAVE THE SAME TECHNOLOGY,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
YOU CAN ACTUALLY COMMUNICATE
LIVE VIDEO ACROSS THE STREET,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
OR EVEN ACROSS THE WORLD.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
IT'S A FASCINATING TOOL,
SO I THINK GRANDPARENTS

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
WILL FIND IT'S A GREAT
THING TO USE.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
GOLLY, IT'S JUST AS
IF YOU WERE REALLY
FURNISHING

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
BETWEEN THESE TWO
GENERATIONS.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
AND THE WONDERFUL THING
IS THAT THE GRANDCHILDREN
MUST FEEL LIKE,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
"OH, MY GRANDFATHER IS
JOINING ME IN MY MEDIUM."

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
AND BERRY,
OUR NEXT INTERNET QUESTION

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
COMES FROM KAREN
IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
HER QUESTION IS...

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
GRANDPARENTS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
MUST BE WONDERING

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
HOW TO KEEP
IN COMMUNICATION WITH
THEIR LITTLE FAMILIES

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
WHEN THEY'RE NOT
CLOSE TO THEM.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
WE'VE JUST HEARD
SOME WONDERFUL WAYS
TO USE THE INTERNET

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
TO KEEP COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN GRANDPARENTS
AND GRANDCHILDREN.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I WOULD ADD
SOME OTHER THINGS LIKE:

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
USE THE TELEPHONE
REGULARLY;

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
BE SURE TO MAKE
SOME VIDEOTAPES

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
THAT YOUR GRANDCHILDREN
CAN LOOK AT FROM
TIME TO TIME,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
MAYBE EVEN
AS A BEDTIME STORY.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THEN I WOULD ADD
ONE OTHER THING:

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
BE SURE THAT
YOU AS A PARENT

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
TALK TO YOUR CHILDREN
ABOUT THE GRANDPARENTS.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
"WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,
THIS WENT ON."

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
AND THEY'LL PICK UP
ON IDENTIFYING WITH YOU
AND THE GRANDPARENT.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
PRESENTED BYTHE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT pampers.com.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ISSUES
PARENTS FACE TODAY

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
IS HELPING
THEIR KIDS COPE

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
WITH AN IMPORTANT
GRANDPARENT'S ILLNESS
OR DEATH.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I'M JOINED TODAY
 BY MARIA TROZZI,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
DIRECTOR OF
THE GOOD GRIEF PROGRAM
AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
HOW WOULD YOU
HELP PREPARE A KID?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
WELL, WE CERTAINLY HAVE
TO BE WILLING TO FACE IT
FOR OURSELVES

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
IF WE ARE EXPECTED TO HELP
OUR CHILDREN FACE IT.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
AND I THINK THERE ARE
A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT
PARENTS HAVE,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
BUT THERE'S
AN EMBEDDED OPPORTUNITY

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
FOR HELPING KIDS
DEVELOP RESILIENCE THERE.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
AND I THINK THAT'S
WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
RESILIENCE, YOU MEAN
THIS KIND OF FACING
A TERRIBLE SITUATION

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
CAN COME OUT ALL RIGHT?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
WELL, EVEN BETTER
THAN THAT.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
ULTIMATELY, CHILDREN
WILL FACE LOSSES
AS THEY GROW UP.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
WE WISH THAT
NOT TO BE TRUE,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
BUT WE KNOW THAT
IT'S INEVITABLE.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
AND HOW A CHILD
 FACES A GRANDPARENT'S
 ILLNESS AND DEATH

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
WILL PREPARE HER FOR FACING
OTHER LOSSES IN HER LIFE
WHEN SHE'S AN ADULT

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
DEPENDING ON
HOW MOM FACES IT,
HOW DAD FACES IT.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
THINK OF THE OPPORTUNITIES
FOR EXPRESSING OUR
NEGATIVE FEELINGS--

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
SADNESS AND ANGER
AND THE FEELINGS OF BEING
OVERWHELMED WITH ILLNESS.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
THESE ARE ALL MODELS
 THAT CHILDREN CAN
 DRAW UPON.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
AND I THINK WHAT CHILDREN
PARTICULARLY NEED--
YOUNG CHILDREN,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
IS A BEHAVIORAL WAY
OF LOOKING AT IT

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
THAT IS, TO TALK ABOUT
 GRANDPARENTS' BEHAVIOR.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
A LOT OF 70-YEAR-OLD
GRANDPARENTS ARE VERY VITAL

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
AND LEAD VERY ACTIVE,
COMPLICATED LIVES
AS WELL.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
AND SO WHEN THEY
 BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
FOR PARENTS TO BE
ABLE TO TALK ABOUT
THE DIFFERENCES--

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
GRANDMA USED TO BE ABLE TO--
"I'LL PLAY TENNIS WITH YOU

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
OR READ WITH YOU."
AND NOW SHE'S SLEEPING A LOT

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
OR NOW SHE'S
 IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
AND A LOT OF TIMES
CHILDREN JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
AND PARENTS DENY
AND WANNA PUT IT
AWAY THEMSELVES,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
SO OF COURSE THEY
DON'T WANT TO FACE IT
WITH THEIR KIDS.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
 TO CHILDREN AT DIFFERENT AGES

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
SO YOU COULD PREPARE
THEM FOR THIS?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
IT REALLY DEPENDS SO MUCH
ON THE AGE OF THE CHILD,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP
THAT SHE HAS WITH GRANDMOTHER
OR GRANDFATHER.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
AND I THINK FOR A CHILD
UNDER THE AGE OF
THREE OR FOUR

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
TO TRY TO KEEP
THE CHILD'S ROUTINE

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
AND CONSISTENT
AS POSSIBLE

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
IS ALWAYS A GOOD IDEA
AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
THAT GRANDMOTHER
IS VERY ILL-- IS SICK,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
PERHAPS NOT THE WAY
YOU GET SICK WHEN
YOU HAVE A COLD

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
OR WHEN YOU
GET A TEMPERATURE,
BUT IN FACT HAS A DISEASE.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
WHEN WE USE LANGUAGE SUCH AS
"WE LOST GRANDPA TODAY,"

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
YOU KNOW,
"GRANDPA'S SLEEPING"

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
OR "HE PASSED AWAY"
OR "PASSED ON,"

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
FOR A YOUNG CHILD,
THAT DOESN'T DESCRIBE
WHAT HAPPENED.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
AND IT OFTEN LEADS THEM
TO, AT THE VERY LEAST,
FEEL CONFUSED,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
AND AT THE VERY MOST,
ACTUALLY FEEL TERRIFIED,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I REMEMBER SHORTLY
AFTER MY FATHER DIED.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
I CAME DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE MORNING AND WAS
GETTING BREAKFAST.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I WAS TAKING
A GALLON OF MILK OUT
OF THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
AND IT SLIPPED OUT
OF MY HANDS.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
AND AS IT DID, THE MILK JUST
SPILLED ALL OVER THE TABLE.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I STARTED CRYING,
REALLY CRYING.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
THAT'S NOT MY
TYPICAL WAY OF GOING.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
AND THEY LOOKED AT ME
AND JUMPED UP AND
STARTED TO HELP.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
WITHIN A FEW MINUTES,
WE WERE SETTLED AT
THE KITCHEN TABLE.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I SAID, "I'M HAVING
A REALLY HARD MORNING.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I'M REALLY MISSING
PAPA RIGHT NOW.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I'M FEELING REALLY SAD,
AND I CAN STILL 
MAKE YOUR LUNCH.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I CAN STILL
DRIVE YOU TO SCHOOL."

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
- I CAN STILL CARRY ON.
- YOU REMEMBERED TO
  ADD THAT ON?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
ABSOLUTELY.
TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
SO THAT THEY'RE
NOT TERRIFIED.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
TO SAY, "THIS IS
WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I'M MISSING YOUR PAPA
AND I CAN STILL
CARE FOR YOU.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
- AND WHY CAN I DO THAT?
 BECAUSE I'M AN ADULT."
- YEAH.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
AND THAT'S, I THINK,
THE MESSAGE

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
THAT WE DO FACE
THESE OVERWHELMING FEELINGS,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
BUT IF WE HAVE
THE COPING SKILLS,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
WE CAN REALLY JOIN
 OUR CHILDREN.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
IT'S A WONDERFUL THING
 TO SHARE.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I THINK PARENTS WOULD
AVOID THAT SO EASILY

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T
WANT TO HAVE TO PASS ON

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
THEIR ON GRIEVING
TO THEIR CHILD.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
BUT THEY'RE REALLY
PASSING ON THEIR
COPING SKILLS,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
AND THEY'RE ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGING

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
HOW MUCH THEY LOVE
THAT PERSON.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
- AND ISN'T THAT WORTH IT?
- YOU MAKE IT TURN
 SOMETHING TERRIBLE

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
INTO SOMETHING FACEABLE,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
AND SOMETHING THAT
CAN HELP CHILDREN LEARN
TO COPE WITH LOSS.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
- THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S
 WHAT IT'S ABOUT, ISN'T IT?
- ISN'T IT?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE...

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Brazelton:
 TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM
 THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Man:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
- HI. I HAVE A THREE-AND-
 A-HALF-MONTH-OLD GRANDSON.
- GREAT.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
WHAT KINDS OF THINGS
CAN I DO TO ENCOURAGE
HIS DEVELOPMENT?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
- ENCOURAGE HIS DEVELOPMENT?
- RIGHT.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
- OH, SUCH AS WHAT?
- WHAT GAMES, TOYS OR--

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
- UH-HUH.
- AT THIS AGE,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
LIKE MUSIC HE SHOULD
BE LISTENING TO?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
- YOU WANT SOME ADVICE?
- MM-HMM.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
DON'T PUSH SO HARD,
( laughs )

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
AND JUST BE
 A GRANDMOTHER.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
GRANDMOTHERS
AND GRANDFATHERS

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
ARE FOR RELAXATION,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
FOR BEING HELD
IN SOFT COTTON WOOL

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
AND, YOU KNOW, 
BEING NURTURED,
BEING ADMIRED.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
ANYTHING THEY DO
IS ADMIRABLE.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
AND JUST BEING THERE
AND EVERYTHING THAT 
COMES ALONG.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
SO WHEN HE LOOKS
AT YOU, LOOK BACK.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
YOU CAN'T DO.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
ONE IS NEVER GO IN
LOOKING A GRANDCHILD
IN THE FACE.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
ANYTIME YOU WALK
 IN THE HOUSE

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
AND LOOK AT YOUR
 GRANDCHILD IN THE FACE,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
YOU GET WHAT YOU DESERVE--
A SCREAMING BABY.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
THAT IS SO INTRUSIVE.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
SO WHAT I'VE LEARNED TO DO
WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
PARTLY BECAUSE MY DAUGHTERS
AND DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
ARE VERY VERY
SENSITIVE PEOPLE--

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
BUT ANYWAY, I'VE LEARNED
 TO LOOK JUST PAST
 THEIR CHILDREN.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AND THEN THE GRANDCHILDREN
LOOK AT ME LIKE,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
"PAPA, YOU'RE NOT
SPEAKING TO ME."

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
AND THEN THEY START
GETTING INTO A RHYTHM

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
AND I GET INTO
THE SAME RHYTHM WITH THEM.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
AND AS SOON AS I'M
IN THE SAME RHYTHM,
THEY BEGIN TO REALIZE.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
AND THEN WE GET CLOSER
AND THEN THEY MAKE SOME BID
FOR MY ATTENTION.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
AND I USUALLY PASS
THE FIRST BID.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
YOU KNOW,
THEY'LL, "PAPA."

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
AND I'LL TRY
 TO IGNORE THAT
 AND THEN, "PAPA!"

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
"YEAH, HI," AND THEN
LOOK AWAY QUICKLY.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
AND JUST LET THEM--
LET THEM COME TO YOU.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
AND IT'S LIKE MAGIC.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
THEY ALL JUST CAN'T WAIT

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
TO TEASE YOU INTO
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
AT THREE AND A HALF MONTHS,
I WOULD THINK THE SAME THING.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
WHEN YOU PICK HIM UP,
LOOK FOR CUES TO BE SURE

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
IT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER OR YOUR
SON-IN-LAW-- DAUGHTER.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
AND BE SURE
 IT'S OKAY WITH HER,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
AND WAIT UNTIL
 HE MAKES A BID FOR YOU.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
THEN GO, "HI."

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
AND THEN WHEN HE MAKES
ANOTHER BID, "HI."

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
AND JUST GET INTO
THIS LOVELY INTERACTION
WITH HIM.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
AND THE ONLY THING
 I THINK WE AS GRANDPARENTS

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
HAVE TO BE
CONSTANTLY AWARE OF

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
IS HOW JEALOUS
WE MAKE OUR CHILDREN.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
- ( audience laughs )
- AND EVERYTHING WE DO

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
HITS THEM
 BELOW THE BELT.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
SO BE SENSITIVE TO THEM.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
AND THEN IF I EVER EVER
TELL ONE OF THEM
WHAT TO DO--

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
UGH, I OUGHT TO BE
SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
SO I THINK JUST BEING
A GRANDPARENT

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
IS SUCH A BIG GIFT.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000
I CAN RE--

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
I'M A PEDIATRICIAN
BECAUSE OF MY GRANDMOTHER.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
SHE USED TO SAY,
 "BERRY, YOU'RE SO GOOD
 WITH BABIES."

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
WHENEVER I HEAR THAT NOW,
I SEE HER FACE.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
NOTHING LIKE IT.
( chuckles )

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000

"BRAZELTON ON PARENTING,"

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
PRESENTED BY THE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT pampers.com

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT GRANDPARENTS

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
CAN SHOW THEIR GRANDKIDS
THE MOUNTAINTOPS.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
BY THAT, I MEAN
THEY CAN GIVE A CHILD

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
THE DREAMS
OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
AND THE UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
TO FUEL THOSE DREAMS.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I KNOW
MY GRANDMOTHER DID.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
SHE'S WHY I'M
A PEDIATRICIAN TODAY.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
AND I'LL ALWAYS
BE THANKFUL TO HER.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
IF YOU'RE A GRANDPARENT,
DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
TO KEEP IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR GRANDKIDS.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
IF YOU'RE A PARENT,
DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
TO MAKE YOUR PARENTS
A PART OF THE KIDS' LIVES.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
THE REASON IS SIMPLE--

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
YOUR CHILDREN NEED
THEIR GRANDPARENTS.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
