00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.100


3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.470
I will, my lord.

4
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.630
You shall do marvellous wisely,good Reynaldo,

5
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.970
Before you visit him, to makeinquire Of his behavior.

6
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.830
My lord, I did intend it.

7
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.700
Marry, well said; very wellsaid.

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.430
Look you, sir, Inquire me firstwhat Danskers are in Paris;

9
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.770
And how, and who, what means,where they keep,

10
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.370
What company, at what expense;

11
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.230
and finding By thisencompassment

12
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.830
and drift of question That theydo know my son,

13
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.030
come you more nearer

14
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.870
Than your particular demandswill touch it:

15
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.730
Take you, as 'twere, somedistant knowledge of him;

16
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.700
As thus, "I know his father andhis friends

17
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.430
And in part him."

18
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.030
Do you mark this, Reynaldo?

19
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.130
Ay, very well, my lord.

20
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.170
"And in part him;" but you maysay, "not well.

21
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.500
"And if't be he I mean, he'svery wild;

22
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.770
Addicted, so and so."

23
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.870
And there put on him Whatforgeries you please;

24
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.130
marry, none so rank As maydishonour him;

25
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.400
take heed of that;

26
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.530
But, sir, such wanton, wild andusual slips

27
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.530
As are companions noted and mostknown

28
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.000
To youth and liberty.

29
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.900
As gaming, my lord.

30
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.630
Ay, or drinking, fencing,swearing, quarrelling,

31
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.870
Drabbing: you may go so far.

32
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.200
My lord, that would dishonourhim.

33
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
Faith, no; as you may season itin the charge.

34
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.300
But, my good lord--

35
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.630
Wherefore should you do this?

36
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.100
Ay, my lord, I would know that.

37
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.330
Marry, sir, here's my drift;

38
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.830
You laying these slight sullieson my son,

39
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.200
Your party in converse, him youwould sound,

40
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.270
Having ever seen in theprenominate crimes

41
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.100
The youth you breathe of guilty,

42
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
be assured He closes with you inthis consequence;

43
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.000
"Good sir," or so, or "friend,"or "gentleman,"

44
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.600
According to the phrase and theaddition Of man and country.

45
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.800
Very good, my lord.

46
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:59.270
And then, sir, does he this--hedoes--

47
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.570
what was I about to say?

48
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.630
By the mass, I was about to saysomething: where did I leave?

49
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.500
At "closes in the consequence,"at "friend or so"

50
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.800
and "gentleman."

51
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.930
At "closes in the consequence"?

52
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.000
Ay, marry; He closes thus:

53
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.530
"I know the gentleman; I saw himyesterday,"

54
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.030
or t' other day, Or then, orthen; with such,

55
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.030
or such; and, as you say,

56
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.030
There was a' gaming; thereo'ertook in's rouse;

57
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.600
There falling out at tennis: orperchance,

58
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.130
"I saw him enter such a house ofsale,"

59
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.370
Videlicet, a brothel, or soforth.

60
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.830
See you now;

61
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.070
Your bait of falsehood takesthis carp of truth:

62
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.530
And thus do we of wisdom and ofreach,

63
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.570
With windlasses and with assaysof bias,

64
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.900
By indirections find directionsout:

65
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.070
So by my former lecture andadvice, Shall you my son.

66
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.800
You have me, have you not?

67
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.600
My lord, I have.

68
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.970
God be wi' you; fare you well.

69
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.430
Good my lord!

70
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.000
Observe his inclination inyourself.

71
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.100
I shall, my lord.

72
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.430
And...

73
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.130
Let him ply his music.

74
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.630
Well, my lord.

75
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.900
Farewell!

76
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.230
How now, Ophelia!

77
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.030
What's the matter?

78
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.900
My lord, my lord, I've have beenso affrighted!

79
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.170
With what, i' the name of God?

80
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.400
My lord, as I was sewing in mycloset,

81
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.900
Lord Hamlet, with his doubletall unbraced;

82
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.670
No hat upon his head; hisstockings foul'd,

83
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.770
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved tohis ancle; Pale as his shirt;

84
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.500
his knees knocking each other;

85
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.830
And with a look so piteous inpurport

86
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.800
As if he had been loosed out ofhell To speak of horrors,

87
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.700
he comes before me.

88
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.530
Mad for thy love?

89
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.430
My lord, I do not know; Buttruly, I do fear it.

90
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.870
What said he?

91
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.700
He took me by the wrist and heldme hard;

92
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.470
Then goes he to the length ofall his arm;

93
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.170
And, with his other hand thuso'er his brow,

94
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.470
He falls to such perusal of myface As he would draw it.

95
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.370
Long stay'd he so;

96
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.700
At last, a little shaking ofmine arm

97
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:29.130
And thrice his head thus wavingup and down,

98
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.600
He raised a sigh so piteous andprofound

99
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.700
As it did seem to shatter allhis bulk And end his being.

100
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.400
That done, he lets me go:

101
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.270
And, with his head over hisshoulder turn'd,

102
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.030
He seem'd to find his waywithout his eyes;

103
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.800
For out o' doors he went withouttheir helps,

104
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.200
And, to the last, bended theirlight on me.

105
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.630
Oh, come.

106
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.500
Go with me: I will go seek theking.

107
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.070
This is the very ecstasy oflove.

108
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.300
What, have you given him anyhard words of late?

109
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.130
No, my good lord, but, as youdid command,

110
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.570
I did repel his letters anddenied His access to me.

111
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.130
That hath made him mad.

112
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.500
Oh, I'm sorry that with betterheed and judgment

113
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.470
I had not quoted him:

114
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.270
I fear'd he did but trifle Andmeant to wreck thee;

115
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.170
Oh, I'm sorry.

116
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.430
Go we to the king:

117
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.800
This must be known; which, beingkept close,

118
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.900
might move More grief to hidethan hate to utter love.

119
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.730
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz andGuildenstern!

120
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.570
Moreover that we much did longto see you,

121
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.270
The need we have to use you didprovoke Our hasty sending.

122
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.370
Something have you heard OfHamlet's transformation;

123
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.530
so I call it,

124
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.800
Sith nor the exterior nor theinward man

125
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.170
Resembles that it was.

126
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.500
What it should be, More than hisfather's death,

127
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.700
that thus hath put him

128
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.730
So much from the understandingof himself,

129
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.670
I cannot dream of: I entreat youboth,

130
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.800
That, being of so young daysbrought up with him,

131
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.970
And sith so neighbour'd to hisyouth and havior,

132
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.100
That you vouchsafe your resthere in our court

133
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.370
Some little time:

134
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.270
so by your companies To draw himon to pleasures,

135
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.770
and to gather, So much as fromoccasion you may glean,

136
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.000
Whether aught, to us unknown,afflicts him thus,

137
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.770
That, open'd, lies within ourremedy.

138
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.770
Good gentlemen, he hath muchtalk'd of you;

139
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.930
And sure I am two men there isnot living

140
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.470
To whom he more adheres.

141
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:41.670
Both your majesties Might,

142
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:43.330
by the sovereign power you haveof us,

143
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.570
Put your dread pleasures moreinto command Than to entreaty.

144
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.100
But we both obey, And here giveup ourselves,

145
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.530
in the full bent To lay ourservice freely at your feet,

146
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.700
To be commanded.

147
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.670
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentleGuildenstern.

148
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.300
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentleRosencrantz:

149
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.300
And I beseech you instantly

150
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.670
to visit My too much changedson.

151
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:08.500
Heaven make our presence and ourpractises Pleasant

152
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.100
and helpful to him!

153
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.000
Ay.

154
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.430
Amen.

155
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.500
The ambassadors from Norway, Mygood lord,

156
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.170
Are joyfully return'd.

157
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.370
Thou still hast been the fatherof good news.

158
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.900
Have I, my lord?

159
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.000
I assure you, my good liege,

160
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.500
I hold my duty as I hold my soul

161
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.070
Both to my God and to mygracious king:

162
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.500
And I do think, or else thisbrain of mine

163
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.730
Hunts not the trail of policy sosure As it hath used to do,

164
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.600
that I have found The very cause

165
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.300
of Hamlet's lunacy.

166
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.400
O, speak of that; that do I longto hear.

167
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.970
Give first admittance to theambassadors;

168
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.630
My news shall be the fruit tothat great feast.

169
00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.300
Thyself do grace to them, andbring them in.

170
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.170
He tells me, my dear Gertrude,

171
00:07:58.170 --> 00:07:59.970
he hath found The head andsource

172
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:01.900
of all your son's distemper.

173
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.800
I doubt it is no other but themain;

174
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:11.030
His father's death and ouro'erhasty marriage.

175
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.230
Well, we shall sift him.

176
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.400
Welcome, my good friends!

177
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.030
Say, Voltemand, what from ourbrother Norway?

178
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.330
Most fair return of greetingsand desires.

179
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.800
Upon our first, he sent out tosuppress His nephew's levies;

180
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.630
which to him appear'd To be apreparation

181
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.170
'gainst the Polack; But, betterlook'd into,

182
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.270
he truly found It was againstyour highness:

183
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.430
whereat grieved,

184
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:40.230
That so his sickness, age andimpotence

185
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.630
Was falsely borne in hand, sendsout arrests On Fortinbras;

186
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.330
which he, in brief, obeys;

187
00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.630
Receives rebuke from Norway,

188
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.570
and in fine Makes vow before hisuncle

189
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.870
never more To give the assay ofarms against your majesty.

190
00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.970
Whereon old Norway, overcomewith joy,

191
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.200
Gives him three score thousandcrowns in annual fee,

192
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.000
And his commission to employthose soldiers,

193
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.630
So levied as before, against thePolack:

194
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.070
With an entreaty, herein furthershown,

195
00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.170
That it might please you to givequiet pass

196
00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.300
Through your dominions for thisenterprise,

197
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.570
On such regards of safety andallowance

198
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.970
As therein are set down.

199
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.470
It likes us well;

200
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.070
Go to your rest; at night we'llfeast together:

201
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.670
Most welcome home!

202
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.400
This business is well ended.

203
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.030
My liege, and madam,

204
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.100
to expostulate What majestyshould be,

205
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.970
what duty is, Why day is day,

206
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.670
night night, and time is time,

207
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.730
Were nothing but to waste night,day and time.

208
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.770
Therefore, since brevity is thesoul of wit

209
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.370
And tediousness the limbs andoutward flourishes,

210
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.600
I will be brief: your noble sonis mad.

211
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.700
Mad call I it; for, to definetrue madness,

212
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.600
What is't but to be nothing elsebut mad?

213
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.070
But let that go.

214
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.400
More matter, with less art.

215
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.400
Madam, I swear I use no art atall.

216
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.630
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tistrue 'tis pity;

217
00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.830
And pity 'tis 'tis true: afoolish figure;

218
00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.800
But farewell it, for I will useno art.

219
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.770
Mad let us grant him, then:

220
00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:38.100
and now remains That we find outthe cause of this effect,

221
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.600
Or rather say, the cause of thisdefect,

222
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.770
For this effect defective comesby cause:

223
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:49.170
Thus it remains, and theremainder thus.

224
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.330
Perpend.

225
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.830
I have a daughter-- have whileshe is mine--

226
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.830
Who, in her duty and obedience,mark,

227
00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:02.330
Hath given me this: now gather,and surmise.

228
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.030
"To the celestial and my soul'sidol,

229
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.230
the most beautified Ophelia."

230
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.070
That's an ill phrase, a vilephrase;

231
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:16.000
"beautified" is a vile phrase:but you shall hear.

232
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.470
Thus: "In her excellent whitebosom, these"--et cetera.

233
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.470
Came this from Hamlet to her?

234
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.400
Good madam, stay awhile; I willbe faithful.

235
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.600
"Doubt thou the stars are fire;Doubt that the sun doth move;

236
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.300
"Doubt truth to be a liar; Butnever doubt I love.

237
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.570
"O dear Ophelia, I am ill atthese numbers;

238
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.770
"I have not art to reckon mygroans:

239
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.130
"but that I love thee best, Omore best, believe it.

240
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.630
"Adieu.

241
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:54.030
"Thine evermore most dear lady,whilst this machine is to him.

242
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:55.300
--Hamlet."

243
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.530
This, in obedience, hath mydaughter shown me.

244
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:01.400
But how hath she Received hislove?

245
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.930
What do you think of me?

246
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.200
As of a man faithful andhonourable.

247
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.300
I would fain prove so.

248
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.300
But what might you think,

249
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.570
When I had seen this hot love onthe wing--

250
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.330
As I perceived it, I must tellyou that,

251
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.900
Before my daughter told me--what might you,

252
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.070
Or my dear majesty your queenhere, think,

253
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.700
If I had play'd the desk ortable-book,

254
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.370
Or given my heart a winking,mute and dumb,

255
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.500
Or look'd upon this love withidle sight;

256
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.970
What might you think?

257
00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.300
No, I went round to work,

258
00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.700
And my young mistress thus I didbespeak:

259
00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.270
"Lord Hamlet is a prince, out ofthy star;

260
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.800
This must not be."

261
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.670
And then I prescripts gave her,

262
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.870
That she should lock herselffrom his resort,

263
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.730
Admit no messengers, receive notokens.

264
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.700
Which done, she took the fruitsof my advice;

265
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.630
And he, repelled-- a short taleto make--

266
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:53.970
Fell into a sadness, then into afast,

267
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.870
Thence to a watch, thence into aweakness,

268
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.270
Thence into a lightness, and, bythis declension,

269
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.070
Into the madness wherein now heraves,

270
00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.570
And all we mourn for.

271
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.630
Do you think 'tis this?

272
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.170
It may be, very likely.

273
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.930
Take this from this, if this beotherwise:

274
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:13.370
How may we try it further?

275
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.770
Ah, You know, sometimes he walksfour hours together

276
00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:19.330
Here in the lobby.

277
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.730
At such a time I'll loose mydaughter to him:

278
00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:25.170
Be you and I behind an arrasthen;

279
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.930
Mark the encounter:

280
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.500
if he love her not And be notfrom his reason fall'n thereon,

281
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.700
Let me be no assistant for astate,

282
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.700
But keep a farm and carters.

283
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.970
We will try it.

284
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.870
But look, where sadly the poorwretch comes reading.

285
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.000
Away, I do beseech you, bothaway:

286
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.600
I'll board him presently.

287
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:06.570
How does my good Lord Hamlet?

288
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.170
Well.

289
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.000
God have mercy.

290
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.770
Do you know me, my lord?

291
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.870
Excellent well.

292
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:32.970
Ah.

293
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.230
You are a fishmonger.

294
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.330
Not I, my lord.

295
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.970
Then I would you were so honesta man.

296
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.270
Honest, my lord!

297
00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:41.470
Ay, sir; to be honest, as thisworld goes,

298
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:45.130
is to be one man picked out often thousand.

299
00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:46.330
That's very true, my lord.

300
00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.830
For if the sun breed maggots ina dead dog,

301
00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.430
being a god kissing carrion--

302
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.270
Have you a daughter?

303
00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.270
I have, my lord.

304
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.670
Let her not walk i' the sun:conception is a blessing:

305
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.670
but not as your daughter mayconceive.

306
00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.470
Friend, look to it.

307
00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.230
How say you by that? Stillharping on my daughter.

308
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:11.370
Yet he knew me not at first;said I was a fishmonger.

309
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:16.400
He is far gone, far gone: andyet truly in my youth

310
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.030
I suffered much extremity forlove;

311
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.730
very near this.

312
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.900
I'll speak to him again.

313
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.530
What do you read, my lord?

314
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:28.600
Words, words, words.

315
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.470
What is the matter, my lord?

316
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.130
Between who?

317
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:37.000
I mean, what is the matter thatyou read, my lord.

318
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.900
Slanders, sir: for the satiricalrogue says

319
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.500
here that old men have greybeards,

320
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.900
that their faces are wrinkled,

321
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.600
their eyes purging thick amberand plum-tree gum.

322
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.170
That they have a plentiful lackof wit,

323
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.070
together with most weak hams:

324
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.070
all which, sir, though I mostpowerfully and potently believe,

325
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.330
yet I hold it not honesty tohave it thus set down,

326
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:04.270
for you yourself, sir, shouldgrow old as I am,

327
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.900
if like a crab you could gobackward.

328
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.630
Though this be madness, yetthere is method in't.

329
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.030
I'll speak to him again.

330
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.630
My Lord, will you walk out o'the air?

331
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.770
Into my grave?

332
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.400
Indeed, that's out o' the air.

333
00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.970
How pregnant sometimes hisreplies are!

334
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.100
My lord, I will take my leave ofyou.

335
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.130
You cannot, sir, take from me

336
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:36.030
any thing that I will morewillingly part withal:

337
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:43.330
except my life, except my life,except my life.

338
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.630
Fare you well, my lord.

339
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.500
These tedious old fools!

340
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.300
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet;there he is.

341
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.700
God save you, sir!

342
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:03.430
My honoured lord!

343
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.030
My most dear lord!

344
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.430
My excellent good friends!

345
00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.270
How dost thou, Guildenstern?

346
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.830
Ah, Rosencrantz!

347
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:18.170
Good lads, how do ye both?

348
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.130
As the indifferent children ofthe earth.

349
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.470
Happy, in that we are notover-happy;

350
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.400
On fortune's cap we are not thevery button.

351
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.570
Nor the soles of her shoe?

352
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.070
Neither, my lord.

353
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.870
Then you live about her waist,in the middle of her favours?

354
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.030
'Faith, her privates we.

355
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.300
In the secret parts of fortune?

356
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:40.870
O, 'tis too true.

357
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.470
She is a strumpet.

358
00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.670
What news?

359
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:50.200
None, my lord, but that theworld's grown honest.

360
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:59.530
Then is doomsday near: but yournews is not true.

361
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.170
Let me question more inparticular:

362
00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.800
what have you, my good friends,

363
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.370
deserved at the hands offortune,

364
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.570
that she sends you to prisonhither?

365
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.830
Prison, my lord!

366
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.230
Denmark's a prison.

367
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.330
Then is the world one.

368
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:12.730
A goodly one;

369
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.300
in which there are manyconfines, wards and dungeons,

370
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.130
Denmark being one o' the worst.

371
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.400
We think not so, my lord.

372
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.030
Why, then, 'tis none to you;

373
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:24.000
for there is nothing either goodor bad,

374
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.530
but thinking makes it so: to meit is a prison.

375
00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:31.970
Why then, your ambition makes itone;

376
00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:33.470
'tis too narrow for your mind.

377
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.470
O God, I could be bounded in anut shell

378
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:39.370
and count myself a king ofinfinite space,

379
00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:45.170
were it not that I have baddreams.

380
00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.400
Which dreams indeed areambition,

381
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.470
for the very substance of theambitious

382
00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.500
is merely the shadow of a dream.

383
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.700
A dream itself is but a shadow.

384
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.800
Shall we to the court?

385
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.300
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.

386
00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.670
We'll wait upon you.

387
00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.200
No such matter:

388
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.670
I will not sort you with therest of my servants,

389
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.100
for, to speak to you like anhonest man,

390
00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.970
I am most dreadfully attended.

391
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.630
But, in the beaten way offriendship,

392
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:09.900
what make you at Elsinore?

393
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.430
To visit you, my lord; no otheroccasion.

394
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:19.170
Beggar that I am, I am even poorin thanks;

395
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.700
but I thank you: and sure, dearfriends,

396
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.500
my thanks are too dear ahalfpenny.

397
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.730
Were you not sent for?

398
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.830
Is it your own inclining?

399
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.900
Is it a free visitation?

400
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.900
Come, come; deal justly with me.

401
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.470
Come; nay, speak.

402
00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:37.500
What should we say, my lord?

403
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.530
Why, any thing, but to thepurpose.

404
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:41.800
You were sent for;

405
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.100
and there is a kind ofconfession in your looks

406
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:47.630
which your modesties have notcraft enough to colour:

407
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.530
I know the good king and queenhave sent for you.

408
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.830
To what end, my lord?

409
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.430
That you must teach me.

410
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.870
But let me conjure you by therights of our fellowship

411
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:03.300
and by the obligation of ourever-preserved love,

412
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.630
be even and direct with mewhether you were sent for or no.

413
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:07.870
What say you?

414
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:11.800
Nay, then I have an eye of you.

415
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.800
If you love me, hold nothing.

416
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.770
My lord, we were sent for.

417
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:18.930
I will tell you why.

418
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:22.630
So shall my anticipation preventyour discovery,

419
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:27.170
and your secrecy to the king andqueen moult no feather.

420
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:33.030
I have of late-- but wherefore Iknow not--

421
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:37.570
lost all my mirth, forgone allcustom of exercises;

422
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.330
and indeed it goes so heavilywith my disposition

423
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.530
that this goodly frame, theearth,

424
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.100
seems to me a sterilepromontory,

425
00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.600
this most excellent canopy, theair, look you,

426
00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.070
this brave o'erhangingfirmament,

427
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:59.100
this majestical roof frettedwith golden fire,

428
00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.230
why, it appears no other thingto me

429
00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:06.530
than a foul and pestilentcongregation of vapours.

430
00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.170
What a piece of work is a man.

431
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.070
How noble in reason,

432
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.630
How infinite in faculties.

433
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:22.430
In form and moving how expressand admirable.

434
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:25.830
In action how like an angel.

435
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:30.070
In apprehension how like a god.

436
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:36.170
The beauty of the world, theparagon of animals!

437
00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:45.300
And yet, to me, what is thisquintessence of dust?

438
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.200
Man delights not me.

439
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.730
No, nor woman neither,

440
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.770
though by your smiling you seemto say so.

441
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.870
My lord, there was no such stuffin my thoughts.

442
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.730
Why did you laugh then,

443
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:02.600
when I said, "man delights notme"?

444
00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:04.900
To think, my lord, if youdelight not in man,

445
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.670
what lenten entertainment theplayers shall receive from you:

446
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.470
we coted them on the way; andhither are they coming,

447
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:10.630
to offer you service.

448
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.730
He that plays the king shall bewelcome;

449
00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.070
his majesty shall have tributeof me;

450
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.500
What players are they?

451
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.830
Even those that you were wont totake such delight in,

452
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.470
the tragedians of the city.

453
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.970
How chances it they travel?

454
00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:27.770
Their residence, both inreputation and profit,

455
00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:28.970
was better both ways.

456
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.070
I think their inhibition

457
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.800
comes by means of the lateinnovation.

458
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.470
Do they hold the same estimationthey did when I was in the city?

459
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.570
Are they so followed?

460
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:36.670
No, indeed, are they not.

461
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.130
How comes it? Do they growrusty?

462
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.430
No, their endeavour keeps in thewonted pace:

463
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.800
but there is, sir, an aery ofchildren,

464
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.500
little eyases, that cry out onthe top of question,

465
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:48.470
and are most tyrannicallyclapped for't.

466
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.800
These are now the fashion,

467
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.670
and so berattle the commonstages--

468
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.030
so they call them--

469
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:55.770
that many wearing rapiers areafraid of goose-quills

470
00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.070
and dare scarce come thither.

471
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.170
What, are they children?

472
00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:59.630
Who maintains 'em?

473
00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.870
Will they pursue the quality nolonger than they can sing?

474
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.170
Will they not say,

475
00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.770
when they shall grow themselvesto common players--

476
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:08.130
their writers do them wrong,

477
00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.830
to make them exclaim againsttheir own succession?

478
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.270
'Faith, there has been much todo on both sides;

479
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.500
and the nation holds it no sinto tarre them to controversy:

480
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.400
It is not very strange; for myuncle is king of Denmark,

481
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.370
and those that would make mowsat him while my father lived

482
00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.230
now give twenty, forty, fifty,an hundred ducats a-piece

483
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.470
for his picture in little.

484
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:33.700
'Sblood, there is something inthis more than natural,

485
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.230
if philosophy could find it out.

486
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:38.570
There are the players.

487
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.070
Gentlemen, you are welcome toElsinore.

488
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.330
Your hands, come then:

489
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.530
the appurtenance of welcome isfashion and ceremony:

490
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:46.100
let me comply with you in thisgarb.

491
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.400
You are welcome.

492
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:52.570
But my uncle-father andaunt-mother are deceived.

493
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:55.730
In what, my dear lord?

494
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:58.630
I am but mad north-north-west:

495
00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:04.670
when the wind is southerly Iknow a hawk from a handsaw.

496
00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:08.070
Well be with you, gentlemen!

497
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:09.630
Hark you, Guildenstern;

498
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.170
and you too: at each ear ahearer.

499
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.470
That great baby you see there

500
00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:15.630
is not yet out of hisswaddling-clouts.

501
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.470
I will prophesy he comes to tellme of the players; mark it.

502
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.330
You say right, sir.

503
00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:24.900
O' Monday morning; 'twas thenindeed.

504
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.700
My lord, I have news to tellyou.

505
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.700
My lord, I have news to tellyou.

506
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.770
When Roscius was an actor inRome--

507
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.370
The actors are come hither, mylord.

508
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:35.470
Buzz, buzz!

509
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:36.630
Upon mine honour,

510
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.030
Then came each actor on his ass.

511
00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:40.770
The best actors in the world,

512
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.430
either for tragedy, comedy,history, pastoral,

513
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.370
pastoral-comical,historical-pastoral,

514
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:46.470
tragical-historical,

515
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:49.700
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral,

516
00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.770
scene individable or poemunlimited.

517
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.030
Seneca cannot be too heavy orPlautus too light.

518
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.600
For the law of writ and theliberty,

519
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.030
these are the only men.

520
00:24:57.030 --> 00:25:02.070
O Jephthah, judge of Israel,what a treasure hadst thou!

521
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.470
What a treasure had he, my lord?

522
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.830
Why, "One fair daughter and nomore,

523
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.270
The which he loved passingwell."

524
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.170
Still on my daughter.

525
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.570
Am I not i' the right, oldJephthah?

526
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.670
If you call me Jephthah, mylord,

527
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.530
I have a daughter that I lovepassing well.

528
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.830
Nay, that follows not.

529
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.070
What follows, then, my lord?

530
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:28.330
Why, "As by lot"--

531
00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.370
God wot.

532
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.970
But look!

533
00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:35.470
Where my abridgement comes.

534
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.530
Welcome, all.

535
00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:49.430
I am glad to see thee well.

536
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:53.130
Welcome, good friends.

537
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.700
O, my old friend!

538
00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:01.130
Why, thy face is valenced sinceI saw thee last.

539
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.270
Comest thou to beard me inDenmark?

540
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:07.130
What, my young lady andmistress!

541
00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.770
By'r lady, your ladyship isnearer to heaven

542
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.230
than when I saw you last, by thealtitude of a chopine.

543
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.500
Pray God, your voice, likeapiece of uncurrent gold,

544
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.270
be not cracked within the ring.

545
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.430
Masters, you are all welcome.

546
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.230
We'll e'en to't like Frenchfalconers,

547
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:29.600
fly at any thing we see: we'llhave a speech straight.

548
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.230
Come, give us a taste of yourquality;

549
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.430
come, a passionate speech.

550
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.130
What speech, my good lord?

551
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.830
I heard thee speak me a speechonce,

552
00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.530
but it was never acted; or, ifit was, not above once;

553
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.970
for the play, I remember,pleased not the million;

554
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:49.570
'twas caviare to the general.

555
00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:52.400
One speech in it I chieflyloved:

556
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.130
'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; andthereabout of it

557
00:26:56.130 --> 00:27:00.100
especially, where he speaks ofPriam's slaughter:

558
00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:04.670
if it live within your memory, Ipray you begin at this line.

559
00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:06.800
Let me see, let me see--

560
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.600
"The rugged Pyrrhus, like theHyrcanian beast"--

561
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.300
No, 'tis not so.

562
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.770
It begins with Pyrrhus:

563
00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:22.500
"The rugged Pyrrhus, he whosesable arms,

564
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.470
"Black as his purpose, did thenight resemble

565
00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:28.170
"When he lay couched in theominous horse,

566
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.200
"Hath now this dread and blackcomplexion

567
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.130
"smear'd With heraldry moredismal;

568
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:38.200
"head to foot Now is he totalgules;

569
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.470
"roasted in wrath and fire,

570
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.470
"And thus o'er-sized withcoagulate gore,

571
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.800
"With eyes like carbuncles,

572
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:51.730
the hellish Pyrrhus Oldgrandsire Priam seeks."

573
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.630
So proceed you.

574
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.370
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken,

575
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.430
with good accent, gooddiscretion.

576
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:11.170
Anon he finds him Striking tooshort at Greeks;

577
00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.170
his antique sword, Rebellious tohis arm,

578
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:18.170
lies where it falls, Repugnantto command:

579
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:23.070
unequal match'd, Pyrrhus atPriam drives;

580
00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:24.900
in rage strikes wide;

581
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.070
But with the whiff and wind ofhis fell sword

582
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:30.070
The unnerved father falls.

583
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:35.100
Then senseless Ilium, Seeming tofeel this blow,

584
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.430
with flaming top Stoops to hisbase,

585
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.500
and with a hideous crash Takesprisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

586
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.130
This is too long.

587
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:48.400
It shall to the barber's withyour beard.

588
00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:52.370
Prithee, say on: he's for a jigor a tale of bawdry,

589
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:59.400
or he sleeps: say on: come toHecuba.

590
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.500
But who, O, who had seen themobled queen--

591
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.430
The mobled queen?

592
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:10.200
That's good; "mobled queen" isgood.

593
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.330
Shh.

594
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:14.470
Run barefoot up and down,

595
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.530
threatening the flames Withbisson rheum;

596
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:22.500
a clout upon that head Wherelate the diadem stood,

597
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.000
and for a robe, About her lankand all o'er-teemed loins,

598
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.870
A blanket, in the alarm of fearcaught up; Who this had seen,

599
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.430
with tongue in venom steep'd,

600
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.970
'Gainst Fortune's state wouldtreason have pronounced.

601
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.030
But if the gods themselves didsee her then

602
00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.100
When she saw Pyrrhus makemalicious sport

603
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.800
In mincing with his sword herhusband's limbs,

604
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.500
The instant burst of clamourthat she made,

605
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.900
Unless things mortal move themnot at all,

606
00:29:53.900 --> 00:30:00.130
Would have made milch theburning eyes of heaven,

607
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.170
And passion in the gods.

608
00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:05.470
Look, whether he has not turnedhis colour

609
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.570
and has tears in his eyes.

610
00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.730
Prithee no more.

611
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:14.430
'Tis well.

612
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.670
I'll have thee speak out therest of this soon.

613
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.570
Good my lord, will you see theplayers well bestowed?

614
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:30.570
Do you hear, let them be wellused;

615
00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:35.100
for they are the abstract andbrief chronicles of the time:

616
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.400
after your death you were betterhave a bad epitaph

617
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.670
than their ill report while youlive.

618
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:45.500
My lord, I shall use themaccording to their deserts.

619
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.600
God's bodykins, man, muchbetter.

620
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:56.500
Use every man after his desert,and who shall 'scape whipping?

621
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.630
Use them after your own honourand dignity:

622
00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.700
the less they deserve,

623
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.500
the more merit is in yourbounty.

624
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.330
Take them in.

625
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.570
Come, sirs.

626
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:18.130
Follow him, friends: we'll heara play to-morrow.

627
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:19.800
Dost thou hear me, old friend;

628
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.800
can you play "The Murder ofGonzago?"

629
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.900
Ay, my lord.

630
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.170
We'll ha't to-morrow night.

631
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.470
You could, for a need,

632
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:28.300
study a speech of some dozen orsixteen lines,

633
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:32.130
which I would set down andinsert in't, could you not?

634
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.330
Ay, my lord.

635
00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.530
Very well.

636
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.470
Follow that lord; and look youmock him not.

637
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:45.330
My good friends...

638
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.670
I'll leave you till night.

639
00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:51.900
You are welcome to Elsinore.

640
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.100
Good my lord!

641
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.800
Ay, so.

642
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:02.800
God buy you.

643
00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:20.730
Now I am alone.

644
00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:35.100
O, what a rogue and peasantslave am I!

645
00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:39.570
Is it not monstrous that thisplayer here,

646
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:44.430
But in a fiction, in a dream ofpassion,

647
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:48.470
Could force his soul so to hisown conceit

648
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.830
That from her working all hisvisage wann'd,

649
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:58.130
Tears in his eyes, distractionsin his aspect,

650
00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:02.500
A broken voice, and his wholefunction

651
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.270
suiting With forms to hisconceit?

652
00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.730
And all for nothing!

653
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:14.470
For Hecuba!

654
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:17.600
What's Hecuba to him, or he toHecuba,

655
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.530
That he should weep for her?

656
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.070
What would he do

657
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:28.170
Had he the motive and the cuefor passion That I have?

658
00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:32.830
He would drown the stage withtears

659
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.830
And cleave the general ear withhorrid speech,

660
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.800
Make mad the guilty and appalthe free,

661
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.000
Confound the ignorant,

662
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.630
and amaze indeed The veryfaculties

663
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.530
of eyes and ears.

664
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:49.670
Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettledrascal,

665
00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:54.070
peak, Like John-a-dreams,unpregnant of my cause,

666
00:33:54.070 --> 00:34:04.670
And can say nothing; no, not fora king

667
00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.530
Upon whose property and mostdear life

668
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.230
A damn'd defeat was made.

669
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:14.100
Am I a coward?

670
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.000
Who calls me villain?

671
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.230
Breaks my pate across?

672
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:21.570
Plucks off my beard and blows itin my face?

673
00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.300
Tweaks me by the nose?

674
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:25.930
Gives me the lie i' the throatAs deep as to the lungs?

675
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.130
Who does me this?

676
00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.300
Ha!

677
00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.970
Ah, 'swounds, I should take it:

678
00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.770
for it cannot be But I ampigeon-liver'd

679
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.800
and lack gall To make oppressionbitter,

680
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.730
or ere this I should have fattedall the region kites

681
00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.030
With this slave's offal.

682
00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.130
Bloody, bawdy villain!

683
00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:55.970
Remorseless, treacherous,lecherous, kindless villain!

684
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.570
O, vengeance!

685
00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.870
Why, what an ass am I!

686
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:17.970
This is most brave, That I, theson of a dear father murder'd,

687
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.000
Prompted to my revenge by heavenand hell,

688
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.770
Must, like a whore, unpack myheart with words,

689
00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:25.230
And fall a-cursing, like a verydrab, A scullion!

690
00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.430
Fie upon't!

691
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:27.770
Foh!

692
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.030
About my brain!

693
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:45.130
I have heard That guiltycreatures

694
00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.970
sitting at a play Have by thevery cunning

695
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.270
of the scene Been struck so tothe soul

696
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:55.730
that presently They haveproclaim'd their malefactions;

697
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.270
For murder, though it have notongue,

698
00:35:58.270 --> 00:36:02.030
will speak With most miraculousorgan.

699
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.200
I'll have these players Playsomething like the murder

700
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.800
of my father Before mine uncle.

701
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.530
I'll observe his looks; I'lltent him to the quick.

702
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:15.230
If he but blench, I know mycourse.

703
00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.200
The spirit that I have seen Maybe a devil:

704
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.070
and the devil hath power Toassume a pleasing shape;

705
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:32.300
yea, and perhaps Out of myweakness and my melancholy,

706
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:35.170
As he is very potent with suchspirits,

707
00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:43.970
Abuses me to damn me:

708
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:47.670
I'll have grounds More relativethan this.

709
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.630
