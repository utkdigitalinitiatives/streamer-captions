00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.999
<br/>

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:33.999
I don't consider democracy to be<br/>
really functioning when one

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:37.999
side's got a loud speaker and<br/>
the other side is being forced

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:39.999
to whisper.<br/>

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:43.999
How have we managed to create<br/>
a system in which a major

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.999
voice, or voices, in a policy<br/>
debate is not able to be

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.999
heard, because it doesn't raise<br/>
enough money to buy the

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:55.501
access to talk to the<br/>
American people.

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.999
Our democracy is drowning in<br/>
free speech that's paid for by

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.999
all these interests that have<br/>
enough money to pay for the

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.999
microphones and the airwaves<br/>
to get their message out.

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.999
It's who has the money<br/>
to frame the issue.

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:10.999
Because if you don't have the<br/>
money to frame the issue, then

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:13.083
whether you're right or<br/>
wrong isn't going to

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:14.999
matter in the long run.<br/>

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:16.999
Well, the government may still<br/>
be a major threat to free

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.999
expression, but commercial<br/>
interests consolidating,

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.626
particularly in the<br/>
media business,

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:23.999
could be an equal threat.<br/>

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:27.709
<br/>

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.999
If we have to rely on the media<br/>
to at least analyze what

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.999
the corporations are doing, and<br/>
the media don't do that,

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.083
how do we level the<br/>
playing field?

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:41.999
I don't know.<br/>

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.999
I don't know, Bill.<br/>

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:48.792
<br/>

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:51.999
Funding for this program is<br/>
provided by the John D. And

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.125
Catherine T. MacArthur<br/>
Foundation and by the Bernard

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.999
and Audre Rapoport Foundation.<br/>

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:02.999
Corporate funding is provided by<br/>
Mutual of America, building

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:06.918
America's future through pension<br/>
and retirement plans,

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:08.999
encouraging dialogue<br/>
and discussion.

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:14.999
The spirit of America,<br/>
Mutual of America.

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:15.999
I'm Bill Moyers.<br/>

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.417
The guarantee of free speech in<br/>
the first amendment to our

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:20.999
Constitution is a great idea.<br/>

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.334
It means government can't keep<br/>
you from getting your two

00:02:23.334 --> 00:02:25.999
cents worth into the<br/>
public debate.

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.999
But what the framers of our<br/>
government didn't reckon with

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.999
is that two cents doesn't buy<br/>
much free speech these days.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.999
You can say anything<br/>
you want to say.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:35.999
But if you really want<br/>
to be heard today,

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.999
we're talking big money.<br/>

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.999
The framers didn't reckon on<br/>
the mass media, and they

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.999
didn't reckon on the rise of<br/>
huge corporations, private

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.999
empires with the money to buy<br/>
the kind of free speech that

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:49.999
guarantees a hearing.<br/>

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.999
In this program, we'll look at<br/>
what this means for democracy

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
through three stories of<br/>
powerful industries who knew

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.000
what they wanted and got it.<br/>

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.999
And we'll hear from some forces<br/>
in the growing chorus

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.999
of those who worry that<br/>
corporations no longer simply

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.999
take part in the public<br/>
debate, they buy it.

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:15.999
<br/>

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.999
Duplin County, North Carolina,<br/>
home to Cindy Watson.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.999
She made a name for herself<br/>
here, and a living, selling

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:24.417
ruffle curtains.<br/>

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:26.999
She had never planned<br/>
to go into politics.

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.999
She was busy raising<br/>
three children.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:33.834
And besides, only democrats<br/>
won elections in Duplin.

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:35.751
I've always been a conservative,<br/>
and I've always

00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:36.999
been a republican.<br/>

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.999
And when my third district<br/>
chairman just asked me to put

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.999
my name in to run,<br/>
I had no desire.

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:43.999
I had never been involved<br/>
with government, local

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.999
or any other ways.<br/>

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.999
<br/>

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:51.999
I was the first woman, and<br/>
certainly the first republican

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.999
in 100 years, that was elected<br/>
to the North Carolina general

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.999
assembly from this area.<br/>

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.999
<br/>

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.999
She was elected in 1995 to serve<br/>
a small rural district.

00:04:03.999 --> 00:04:06.999
Her platform stressed tax<br/>
reform and help for

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:06.999
agribusiness.<br/>

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.999
Her concerns included<br/>
typical constituents

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.999
and some not so typical.<br/>

00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.999
In the 815 square miles,<br/>
we have a lot

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:20.501
more hogs than people.<br/>

00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:22.999
Hog farming has exploded<br/>
in North Carolina.

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.667
It's now the state's largest<br/>
agricultural industry, larger

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.000
even than tobacco.<br/>

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.999
The swine industry has been<br/>
extremely good, financially.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:34.999
We have car dealers that are<br/>
selling fleets of trucks.

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.999
We have restaurants here.<br/>

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:39.999
When I moved here in 1976, there<br/>
was not a Pizza Hut,

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.000
there was not a Hardee's, there<br/>
was not a McDonald's.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.626
But Watson found out all those<br/>
pigs brought more than jobs

00:04:45.626 --> 00:04:46.999
and prosperity.<br/>

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.999
The massive growth of hog<br/>
farms meant massive

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.999
growth of hog waste.<br/>

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.999
She began to hear from<br/>
constituents who told her hog

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:59.834
waste is definitely not a good<br/>
neighbor, especially when you

00:04:59.834 --> 00:05:00.999
live downwind.<br/>

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:03.999
I really can't explain<br/>
the odor.

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.999
It's a nausea, almost a burning<br/>
sensations to the eyes

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.999
and nose, and it creates a<br/>
tremendous amount of flies.

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:13.999
<br/>

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.999
We don't have central heat<br/>
and air in our house.

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.999
In the summertime, we depend on<br/>
cross ventilation, if you

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:21.999
know what that is.<br/>

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:24.999
All of a sudden, out bedroom<br/>
is filled with

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.999
this terrible stench.<br/>

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:34.542
And it wakes me up with<br/>
asthmatic bronchitis attacks.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:37.999
I have screamed, I have kicked,<br/>
I have cried, and

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:39.999
nobody listens.<br/>

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:43.417
In fact, if you tell them<br/>
how it affects you--

00:05:43.417 --> 00:05:44.999
the hog growers--<br/>

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:46.999
they laugh.<br/>

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:48.999
They think it's funny.<br/>

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:50.999
They say it doesn't stink.<br/>

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:53.999
It smells like money.<br/>

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.999
The hog population in Duplin<br/>
County increased a staggering

00:05:56.999 --> 00:06:01.999
1,400% in the last 20 years<br/>
to about 2.3 million.

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:05.125
But the corporate hog farms<br/>
still dispose of the waste the

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.999
way it had been done on<br/>
independent farms like this

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:10.999
one, before hogs here numbered<br/>
in the millions--

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:12.999
collecting it in lagoons,<br/>
then spraying

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:14.999
it onto nearby fields.<br/>

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.999
If you're spraying hog<br/>
field, that water's

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.167
going down in the ground.<br/>

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:21.999
Your water that you drink<br/>
comes out of the ground.

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:23.999
So that's going down to that<br/>
water that you're going to

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:27.999
drink, sooner or later, if you<br/>
spray enough of it out there.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.999
Ammonia gas evaporates from<br/>
the lagoons and the spray

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:34.584
fields, then falls back<br/>
on the landscape.

00:06:34.584 --> 00:06:35.999
How do you like this?<br/>

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:37.999
This is algae.<br/>

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.999
At one time, this entire<br/>
creek was clear.

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.999
On weekends, or late in the<br/>
afternoon, you could come

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:45.999
through, and families would<br/>
be out here fishing.

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.999
And as I've come back, we see<br/>
all of our creeks that have a

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:53.999
green covering over them from,<br/>
I believe, thousands of the

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:56.876
lagoon systems that are spraying<br/>
ammonia or nitrogen

00:06:56.876 --> 00:06:58.501
into the air.<br/>

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.999
She was seeing people being<br/>
victimized by business

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:08.584
interests that she had thought<br/>
were trying to help America.

00:07:08.584 --> 00:07:11.999
Bob hall is Research Director<br/>
at Democracy South, a North

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:13.999
Carolina public interest<br/>
group.

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:16.999
He's followed what happened<br/>
after Cindy Watson began

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:17.999
listening to her neighbors.<br/>

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:19.626
--and I was asking those<br/>
questions that

00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:20.000
you asked to me.<br/>

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.999
She was a feisty advocate for<br/>
her people, who were being

00:07:24.999 --> 00:07:28.999
inundated with this massive<br/>
contamination from the hog

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:29.999
factory farms.<br/>

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:34.999
10 parts per million is the<br/>
EPA-acceptable level of

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:36.999
drinking in this state.<br/>

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:38.999
This is 17.18.<br/>

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:41.792
She went back to her core<br/>
values and said, this is

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:44.999
wrong, what you guys are doing,<br/>
these big hog people.

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:46.083
And you're my neighbors.<br/>

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:48.999
And some of you even donated<br/>
to help elect me as a

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:49.999
Republican.<br/>

00:07:49.999 --> 00:07:51.999
But I can't do what<br/>
you want me to do.

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:53.999
I have to say no to you.<br/>

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:57.999
No meant challenging the hog<br/>
industry to clean up its act.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:07:59.999
But the corporate farmers<br/>
had other plans.

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:03.334
They wanted to expand even more,<br/>
and they were used to

00:08:03.334 --> 00:08:04.999
getting their way.<br/>

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:07.999
Many of the state's zoning laws<br/>
were written, in part, by

00:08:07.999 --> 00:08:10.751
a former legislator named<br/>
Wendell Murphy, who just

00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:13.999
happens to be the Chairman and<br/>
CEO of Murphy Family Farms,

00:08:13.999 --> 00:08:18.000
one of the biggest hog<br/>
producers in America.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.999
He's on the Forbes<br/>
list and so on.

00:08:20.999 --> 00:08:23.999
But he was a State Senator<br/>
for a number of years.

00:08:23.999 --> 00:08:27.999
And in that role, he passed, and<br/>
made sure it got passed, a

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:30.999
number of crucial pieces of<br/>
legislation, one of which was

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:37.999
that local counties couldn't<br/>
zone hog factory farms. So

00:08:37.999 --> 00:08:41.999
that really created the<br/>
framework that allow those

00:08:41.999 --> 00:08:45.999
farms to expand without anybody<br/>
money saying, no, no,

00:08:45.999 --> 00:08:46.999
you're getting a little<br/>
too large.

00:08:46.999 --> 00:08:48.999
No, no, the amount<br/>
of waste you're

00:08:48.999 --> 00:08:50.999
putting here is too dangerous.<br/>

00:08:50.999 --> 00:08:53.375
But Cindy Watson wouldn't<br/>
back off.

00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:56.999
In 1997, she helped pass a<br/>
moratorium to limit the growth

00:08:56.999 --> 00:08:59.999
of hog farms until the industry<br/>
figured out a better

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:02.999
way to dispose of<br/>
all that waste.

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:05.999
When she was up for reelection,<br/>
she anticipated a

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:06.999
tough campaign.<br/>

00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:09.999
But she never imagined what<br/>
was about to hit her.

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:12.999
It started just before the<br/>
primary, when Duplin area

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:14.999
voters began receiving<br/>
probing phone calls.

00:09:14.999 --> 00:09:17.999
Do you consider yourself to<br/>
be pro-like or pro-choice?

00:09:17.999 --> 00:09:20.999
At first, they seemed like<br/>
objective opinion polls.

00:09:20.999 --> 00:09:21.999
They weren't.<br/>

00:09:21.999 --> 00:09:24.417
Cindy Watson is letting her<br/>
personal attitudes affect her

00:09:24.417 --> 00:09:26.999
judgment, and often doesn't<br/>
have her facts right.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:30.709
Political pros call them push<br/>
polls, loaded questions

00:09:30.709 --> 00:09:31.999
designed to prejudice<br/>
the voter's

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:32.999
opinion of a candidate.<br/>

00:09:32.999 --> 00:09:35.999
Cindy Watson flip-flops<br/>
on the issues.

00:09:35.999 --> 00:09:38.999
It was clearly not do you know<br/>
that Cindy Watson is trying to

00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:40.999
regulate the hog industry.<br/>

00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:41.999
That wasn't what they wanted.<br/>

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:45.999
They were looking for any<br/>
possible way that they could

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:48.999
embarrass, intimidate, undercut<br/>
her credibility.

00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:51.999
Cindy Watson is misleading<br/>
people about her record on the

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:51.999
environment.<br/>

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:53.999
Along with the telephone<br/>
polling came

00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:55.584
a blizzard of ads.<br/>

00:09:55.584 --> 00:09:57.042
Representative Cindy Watson--<br/>

00:09:57.042 --> 00:10:00.999
Ads in newspapers, on the<br/>
radio, on television.

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:04.999
Public trust is lost when<br/>
politicians mislead people.

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:08.999
They all had the same theme,<br/>
condemning Cindy Watson and

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:12.959
shifting focus away from<br/>
hog industry pollution.

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.999
They were costing somebody<br/>
a bundle.

00:10:14.999 --> 00:10:16.999
But who was spending<br/>
all that money?

00:10:16.999 --> 00:10:20.999
The ads said they were paid for<br/>
by a group calling itself

00:10:20.999 --> 00:10:21.999
Farmers for Fairness.<br/>

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:24.999
It's a wonderful name,<br/>
Farmers for Fairness.

00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.999
You think of here's Old<br/>
MacDonald and all the other

00:10:27.999 --> 00:10:28.999
Old MacDonalds.<br/>

00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:31.375
They've gotten together, and<br/>
they're fighting for fairness.

00:10:31.375 --> 00:10:32.999
Oh, it's wonderful.<br/>

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.999
Here at home, Representative<br/>
Cindy Watson is telling us--

00:10:34.999 --> 00:10:38.999
Well, it turns out it's<br/>
not at all that way.

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:41.959
It turned out that Farmers for<br/>
Fairness was a cover for a

00:10:41.959 --> 00:10:44.792
consortium including Murphy<br/>
Family Farms and other

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:45.999
corporate hog interests.<br/>

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:47.999
It's what's known as<br/>
a front group.

00:10:47.999 --> 00:10:51.999
These are groups that to any<br/>
ordinary citizen, you have no

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:54.334
idea what the group is for,<br/>
and you certainly don't

00:10:54.334 --> 00:10:57.999
associate them with some<br/>
powerful interest. Charles

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:00.999
Lewis runs the Nonprofit Center<br/>
for Public Integrity in

00:11:00.999 --> 00:11:01.999
Washington, DC.<br/>

00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:04.999
His most recent book documents<br/>
the influence of

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:06.999
big money in politics.<br/>

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:08.999
The idea of the front group<br/>
is it's got to have a

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:11.999
highfalutin, nice-sounding<br/>
name.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:15.999
It's got to invariably not<br/>
release any of its information

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:17.999
about who funds it.<br/>

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:21.250
And the reason that's valuable<br/>
to that industry is it's

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:21.999
another voice.<br/>

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:25.999
It's another entity in the<br/>
political process saying this

00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:28.999
is a good thing or bad thing,<br/>
whatever the subject is.

00:11:28.999 --> 00:11:31.999
And so you'll create the sense<br/>
that there is a growing chorus

00:11:31.999 --> 00:11:34.999
of concern over some issue.<br/>

00:11:34.999 --> 00:11:37.501
Farmers for Fairness'<br/>
spokesperson is Lu-Ann Coe.

00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:38.999
What's your operating budget?<br/>

00:11:38.999 --> 00:11:40.999
<br/>

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:42.250
We don't release that.<br/>

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.999
<br/>

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:45.999
I can tell you this.<br/>

00:11:45.999 --> 00:11:47.999
It's been more than we<br/>
ever wanted to spend.

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:50.000
Your own consultant says Farmers<br/>
for Fairness spent

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.999
$10,000 a week in the months<br/>
before the May primary in that

00:11:54.999 --> 00:11:56.999
one little district.<br/>

00:11:56.999 --> 00:12:00.999
Why was that district<br/>
so important to you?

00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:02.999
That is the heart<br/>
of hog country.

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:04.334
That's the heart, right there.<br/>

00:12:04.334 --> 00:12:05.999
And that's where<br/>
Miss Watson is.

00:12:05.999 --> 00:12:08.042
Representative Cindy Watson--<br/>

00:12:08.042 --> 00:12:11.999
They mounted a massive<br/>
campaign, an almost

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:16.999
unbelievable campaign, for a<br/>
Republican woman from a very

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:20.999
small county, trying to get<br/>
rid of her, trying to just

00:12:20.999 --> 00:12:22.999
abolish her from the scene.<br/>

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:25.999
Paid for by Farmers<br/>
for Fairness.

00:12:25.999 --> 00:12:28.709
Here's an important distinction<br/>
to keep in mind.

00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:31.999
Federal election laws strictly<br/>
regulate ads that tell you to

00:12:31.999 --> 00:12:34.292
vote for or against<br/>
a candidate.

00:12:34.292 --> 00:12:37.999
These ads can only be run by the<br/>
candidates themselves, by

00:12:37.999 --> 00:12:40.834
political parties, or by<br/>
Political Action Committees,

00:12:40.834 --> 00:12:43.999
PACs, all subject to strict<br/>
limits on corporate

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:44.999
contributions.<br/>

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:47.999
The idea is that candidates<br/>
should know who is financing

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:50.999
their opposition, that you, the<br/>
voter, should know who's

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:52.999
putting money up to influence<br/>
elections.

00:12:52.999 --> 00:12:56.999
So if you buy an ad that does<br/>
advocate voting for or against

00:12:56.999 --> 00:13:00.999
someone, you have to file<br/>
disclosure forms. But there's

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:02.999
a gaping loophole in the law.<br/>

00:13:02.999 --> 00:13:05.999
If your organization buys an<br/>
ad that doesn't use those

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:08.999
exact words, vote for<br/>
or against, it's

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:10.999
considered issue advocacy.<br/>

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:15.999
And issue ads are not regulated<br/>
by campaign laws.

00:13:15.999 --> 00:13:18.999
Representative Cindy Watson<br/>
blames hog farmers for

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.999
polluting rivers.<br/>

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:22.999
In other words, it can walk<br/>
right up to the line of

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:24.999
telling you why you should<br/>
vote against

00:13:24.999 --> 00:13:25.999
someone or for someone.<br/>

00:13:25.999 --> 00:13:30.125
It just can't take that last<br/>
step and make it explicit.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:32.999
Kathleen Hall Jamieson is Dean<br/>
of the Annenberg School for

00:13:32.999 --> 00:13:35.999
Communication at the University<br/>
of Pennsylvania.

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:39.999
She writes extensively on how<br/>
so-called issue advocacy has

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:43.417
become a funnel for unregulated<br/>
money in politics.

00:13:43.417 --> 00:13:45.209
The practical matter is this.<br/>

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:48.999
When you get into an election<br/>
season, and you see an ad that

00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:51.584
shows a candidate's picture,<br/>
and it's an unflattering

00:13:51.584 --> 00:13:53.999
picture, and it tells you a<br/>
lot of things about the

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:56.709
candidate that are hostile, they<br/>
are not friendly to the

00:13:56.709 --> 00:14:00.834
candidate, and the ad then<br/>
closes by saying, call this

00:14:00.834 --> 00:14:03.501
number, for practical purposes,<br/>
everything up to

00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:05.999
that last moment has looked like<br/>
it's an ad that's going

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:07.999
to tell you how to vote.<br/>

00:14:07.999 --> 00:14:10.999
Why else would people spend<br/>
money to show you unflattering

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:14.000
pictures and give you hostile<br/>
information in a context in

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.999
which the election is<br/>
about to occur?

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:19.626
Were you trying to get people<br/>
to vote against her?

00:14:19.626 --> 00:14:21.999
We were trying to<br/>
change opinion.

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:25.999
And if the people out there<br/>
looked at our message and

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.584
said, well now that makes sense,<br/>
I haven't heard that

00:14:28.584 --> 00:14:31.209
side of it before, and maybe<br/>
what Miss Watson is saying

00:14:31.209 --> 00:14:35.167
isn't quite all there is to<br/>
it, then if they voted

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:36.334
against her, fine.<br/>

00:14:36.334 --> 00:14:37.999
If they didn't, that was fine.<br/>

00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:40.999
They were using these issue ads,<br/>
and this is something new

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:44.999
to me, and new to all of<br/>
us, I think, of this is

00:14:44.999 --> 00:14:45.000
the way to do it.<br/>

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.999
It's first amendment speech.<br/>

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:48.999
They can say anything they want<br/>
to, as long as they did

00:14:48.999 --> 00:14:51.999
not say for or against me.<br/>

00:14:51.999 --> 00:14:53.709
We are not a political<br/>
action committee.

00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:56.375
We are just exercising<br/>
our first amendment

00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:57.999
right to free speech.<br/>

00:14:57.999 --> 00:15:02.999
And even we're so conscious of<br/>
following the letter of the

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:06.999
law that we had an attorney<br/>
who was an electoral law

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:10.999
expert to vet each one of our<br/>
ads, and our polls, to tell

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:11.999
us, is this correct?<br/>

00:15:11.999 --> 00:15:13.999
Can we do this or not?<br/>

00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:20.999
They use all this legal trickery<br/>
to do issue ads or

00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:23.999
independent expenditure, all<br/>
these different things that

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:25.999
are very calculated.<br/>

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:29.999
But at its core,<br/>
it's politics.

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:36.542
And it's companies who can't<br/>
vote using their treasuries,

00:15:36.542 --> 00:15:39.709
their resources, to<br/>
influence voting.

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:42.999
So one would assume that there<br/>
are corporate donations in

00:15:42.999 --> 00:15:43.999
Farmers for Fairness--<br/>

00:15:43.999 --> 00:15:44.999
Oh, yes.<br/>

00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:45.999
Absolutely.<br/>

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:48.042
--exercising their<br/>
free speech.

00:15:48.042 --> 00:15:48.999
And that's how you see it?<br/>

00:15:48.999 --> 00:15:50.999
It's the only way they<br/>
could get it.

00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:50.999
Is to buy it.<br/>

00:15:50.999 --> 00:15:51.999
That's to but it.<br/>

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:54.459
It's the only way<br/>
we could get it.

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:55.999
We don't like to spend money.<br/>

00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:58.999
So we want to make sure that<br/>
every dollar we do

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:01.209
spend, it's on target.<br/>

00:16:01.209 --> 00:16:02.751
Was it?<br/>

00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:05.999
It seemed to be.<br/>

00:16:05.999 --> 00:16:07.999
Cindy Watson lost<br/>
the Republican

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:09.999
primary to a hog farmer.<br/>

00:16:09.999 --> 00:16:11.999
Her campaign budget<br/>
did not include a

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:13.999
single television ad.<br/>

00:16:13.999 --> 00:16:16.999
No exact figures available on<br/>
how much the hog industry

00:16:16.999 --> 00:16:19.999
spent to defeat her, but records<br/>
show Farmers for

00:16:19.999 --> 00:16:23.999
Fairness spent $2.6 million<br/>
dollars on media activities in

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:26.999
the year leading up<br/>
to the primary.

00:16:26.999 --> 00:16:28.999
The State Board of Elections<br/>
eventually challenged the

00:16:28.999 --> 00:16:32.542
group's tactics, but a federal<br/>
court ruled they'd done

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:34.709
nothing illegal.<br/>

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:36.999
The courts have generally sided<br/>
with corporations on

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:40.999
issue advertising, essentially<br/>
saying that limiting spending

00:16:40.999 --> 00:16:42.751
is limiting speech.<br/>

00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:44.999
But some legal scholars say<br/>
it's how huge companies

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:49.042
influence politics in ways the<br/>
constitution never intended.

00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:52.999
You could do a PhD thesis in the<br/>
law on the strange way we

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:56.999
treat corporation sometimes as<br/>
though they were human beings

00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:59.709
and sometimes as though<br/>
they were not.

00:16:59.709 --> 00:17:02.000
Burt Neuborne, once the National<br/>
Legal director of the

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.999
American Civil Liberties Union,<br/>
is now Legal Director

00:17:04.999 --> 00:17:06.999
of the Brennan Center for<br/>
Justice at New York

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:07.999
University.<br/>

00:17:07.999 --> 00:17:10.999
For example, for the fifth<br/>
amendment, we never gave that

00:17:10.999 --> 00:17:11.999
to corporations.<br/>

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.999
Corporations don't have the<br/>
right to be free from

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:14.999
self-incrimination.<br/>

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:16.999
People working in<br/>
corporations do.

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:18.999
But if the corporation were to<br/>
come into an American court

00:17:18.999 --> 00:17:20.834
and say, I take the<br/>
fifth amendment,

00:17:20.834 --> 00:17:21.083
the judge would left.<br/>

00:17:21.083 --> 00:17:22.999
The judge would say,<br/>
you don't have any

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:22.999
fifth amendment rights.<br/>

00:17:22.999 --> 00:17:23.999
Get out of here.<br/>

00:17:23.999 --> 00:17:27.167
But with the first amendment,<br/>
we went exactly

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:28.501
the opposite way.<br/>

00:17:28.501 --> 00:17:30.999
We said, no, corporations are<br/>
going to be treated as though

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:32.999
they are a human being.<br/>

00:17:32.999 --> 00:17:36.209
And they're going to be given<br/>
the same rights to speak that

00:17:36.209 --> 00:17:38.999
human beings are given.<br/>

00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:41.999
In 1978, a Supreme Court<br/>
ruling effectively gave

00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:45.959
corporations some of the same<br/>
free speech rights previously

00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:47.375
reserved for individuals.<br/>

00:17:47.375 --> 00:17:50.999
The people who will defend that<br/>
decision say, look, what

00:17:50.999 --> 00:17:54.751
the 1978 decision did is unleash<br/>
this great machine for

00:17:54.751 --> 00:17:57.999
the generation of information,<br/>
and that we are richer as a

00:17:57.999 --> 00:18:01.999
political culture now, because<br/>
we have the corporations able

00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:07.999
to put ideas and information<br/>
out into the public.

00:18:07.999 --> 00:18:09.999
That's the one side<br/>
of the debate.

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:11.999
The other side of the debate<br/>
would say, yes, but the one

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:14.999
thing that corporations do<br/>
better than anybody else is to

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:15.999
accumulate money.<br/>

00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:18.999
And for the corporation then<br/>
to dump that money into the

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:22.999
democratic process is to<br/>
unbalance the market and ideas

00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:26.999
in a way that yes, it's<br/>
richer, but it's

00:18:26.999 --> 00:18:27.999
richer in one direction.<br/>

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:32.999
<br/>

00:18:32.999 --> 00:18:34.999
It's long been the case<br/>
that money talks.

00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:37.999
But in the modern electronic<br/>
square, where rich

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:40.999
corporations exercise first<br/>
amendment rights through

00:18:40.999 --> 00:18:43.999
unregulated spending,<br/>
big money can shout.

00:18:43.999 --> 00:18:46.999
It can shout from one end of<br/>
the country to the other.

00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:48.999
It happened just recently in<br/>
a major policy debate in

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:51.999
Congress, powerful corporations,<br/>
using their

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.999
resources not only to mislead<br/>
the public, but to intimidate

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:58.792
the United States Senate.<br/>

00:18:58.792 --> 00:19:00.999
Spring, 1998.<br/>

00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:03.209
After months of negotiations,<br/>
Congress is moving toward

00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:06.042
passing the McCain bill,<br/>
legislation to hold the

00:19:06.042 --> 00:19:09.999
tobacco industry accountable<br/>
for the effects of smoking.

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:11.999
The bill had been passed<br/>
out of committee by an

00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:14.999
overwhelming majority and looked<br/>
like a sure winner.

00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:17.125
Under the agreement<br/>
we have reached--

00:19:17.125 --> 00:19:20.999
Even tobacco industry leaders<br/>
were willing to sign on.

00:19:20.999 --> 00:19:23.999
But when the bill was amended<br/>
to threaten their exemption

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:27.999
against future lawsuits,<br/>
they left the table.

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:31.999
The extraordinary settlement<br/>
that could have set the nation

00:19:31.999 --> 00:19:34.999
on a dramatically new<br/>
and constructive

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:36.999
direction is dead.<br/>

00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:40.584
Seven days after the Senate<br/>
Commerce Committee passed a

00:19:40.584 --> 00:19:43.999
bill far tougher than the<br/>
tobacco industry ever thought

00:19:43.999 --> 00:19:46.999
they would pass, Steve Goldstone<br/>
and R.J. Reynolds

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:49.999
bolted from the process, and<br/>
with them took all of the

00:19:49.999 --> 00:19:50.999
other tobacco companies.<br/>

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:53.999
Matthew Myers is General Counsel<br/>
for the nonprofit

00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:56.834
group Campaign for Tobacco-Free<br/>
Kids.

00:19:56.834 --> 00:19:57.999
Then all hell broke loose.<br/>

00:19:57.999 --> 00:20:00.501
Washington has gone<br/>
cuckoo again.

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.999
Instead of doing something<br/>
about youth smoking,

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:05.999
Washington wants to raise half<br/>
a trillion dollars in new

00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:08.999
taxes, spend billions on federal<br/>
programs, create 17--

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:11.999
Tobacco companies didn't have<br/>
public opinion or a majority

00:20:11.999 --> 00:20:13.125
in Congress on their side.<br/>

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:15.999
But they did have one thing<br/>
their opponents didn't.

00:20:15.999 --> 00:20:19.999
They had money, all they needed<br/>
to wage a massive

00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:21.751
propaganda war.<br/>

00:20:21.751 --> 00:20:23.999
It's Christmas in Washington,<br/>
and they're piling big

00:20:23.999 --> 00:20:24.375
presents under the tax tree.<br/>

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:27.999
They began with air attacks,<br/>
a bombardment of issue

00:20:27.999 --> 00:20:28.000
advertising.<br/>

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.999
Over $40 million was spent on<br/>
this campaign, the highest

00:20:31.999 --> 00:20:33.999
amount ever spent in a sustained<br/>
issue advocacy

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:36.999
campaign in the United States.<br/>

00:20:36.999 --> 00:20:39.999
In a study for the Annenberg<br/>
school, Kathleen Hall Jamieson

00:20:39.999 --> 00:20:42.999
examined the claims of tobacco's<br/>
ad campaign.

00:20:42.999 --> 00:20:45.999
The underlying themes of that<br/>
issue advocacy campaign were

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:47.999
that this bill is a<br/>
big tax and spend

00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:49.999
bill for special programs--<br/>

00:20:49.999 --> 00:20:52.626
the implication is, and you<br/>
wouldn't approve of them--

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:56.834
that will result in a black<br/>
market and will not actually

00:20:56.834 --> 00:21:00.999
produce a reduction in youth<br/>
smoking, but will produce very

00:21:00.999 --> 00:21:02.999
expensive cigarettes.<br/>

00:21:02.999 --> 00:21:07.999
That combination of appeals<br/>
aired at saturation level

00:21:07.999 --> 00:21:10.999
across cable in the United<br/>
States increased the

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:13.999
likelihood that people<br/>
were misled about the

00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:15.999
content of the bill.<br/>

00:21:15.999 --> 00:21:17.999
This tobacco tax some in<br/>
Congress are talking about

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:19.792
doesn't make any sense.<br/>

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:22.999
The propaganda was carefully<br/>
targeted to influence not just

00:21:22.999 --> 00:21:25.999
the public, but the senators<br/>
who'd be voting on the bill.

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:28.459
--more taxes for more<br/>
big government.

00:21:28.459 --> 00:21:30.999
I'm going to remember this fall<br/>
what the politicians do

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:32.999
this summer.<br/>

00:21:32.999 --> 00:21:37.999
The $40 million advertising<br/>
campaign was designed to

00:21:37.999 --> 00:21:41.292
change the framework of the<br/>
debate, not so much because

00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:43.999
they were going to change<br/>
American public opinion, but

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:46.834
because they were going to make<br/>
it acceptable to vote

00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:50.999
against this bill by making<br/>
a vote a vote against big

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:55.999
government, big spending, and<br/>
big taxes, and not a vote for

00:21:55.999 --> 00:21:57.125
big tobacco.<br/>

00:21:57.125 --> 00:22:00.999
These are the real heroes of the<br/>
American economy, men and

00:22:00.999 --> 00:22:03.999
women across this country who<br/>
work hard for their families.

00:22:03.999 --> 00:22:07.999
And suddenly, the tobacco<br/>
industry became the protector

00:22:07.999 --> 00:22:10.999
of the blue-collar worker,<br/>
the bastion against big

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:11.999
government.<br/>

00:22:11.999 --> 00:22:13.999
Last June, there was a historic<br/>

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.999
resolution of tobacco issues.<br/>

00:22:15.999 --> 00:22:16.709
This would have changed--<br/>

00:22:16.709 --> 00:22:19.999
The ads launched salvo after<br/>
salvo of half truths and

00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:20.999
distortions.<br/>

00:22:20.999 --> 00:22:22.999
Now politics has taken over.<br/>

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.999
Instead of a reasonable debate<br/>
on the resolution, Washington

00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:28.999
has gone haywire, proposing the<br/>
same old tax and spend.

00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:31.999
Well, the interesting question<br/>
is what are the taxes on?

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:32.999
And the answer is cigarettes.<br/>

00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:34.999
And what's the spending for?<br/>

00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:36.999
And it's a list of things that<br/>
most people, if asked, would

00:22:36.999 --> 00:22:40.999
approve of, such as paying the<br/>
states back for the Medicaid

00:22:40.999 --> 00:22:43.999
expenditures they've incurred<br/>
by providing insurance

00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:46.999
coverage and health care for<br/>
those who otherwise couldn't

00:22:46.999 --> 00:22:50.999
afford it, but who were ill<br/>
because of tobacco use.

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:52.999
And who will pay the majority<br/>
of these taxes?

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:56.999
Working people, people earning<br/>
$30,000 a year or less.

00:22:56.999 --> 00:22:59.999
Will the bulk of the cost of<br/>
this bill be paid by people

00:22:59.999 --> 00:23:01.999
making under $30,000.<br/>

00:23:01.999 --> 00:23:04.999
Yes, it will, but with one<br/>
important qualification.

00:23:04.999 --> 00:23:06.999
All of those people<br/>
are smokers.

00:23:06.999 --> 00:23:10.626
And so it's not you, the person<br/>
making under $30,000

00:23:10.626 --> 00:23:12.999
who's seeing the ad, it's<br/>
you, the smoker.

00:23:12.999 --> 00:23:16.999
And the reason for taxing is, in<br/>
fact, not the government's

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:18.999
appetite for additional money.<br/>

00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:21.999
Cigarettes up to $5 a<br/>
pack, $50 a carton.

00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:23.999
The reason for additional<br/>
taxing is to create an

00:23:23.999 --> 00:23:27.999
economic disincentive for<br/>
teenagers to smoke.

00:23:27.999 --> 00:23:30.999
There will be new federal<br/>
spending, 17 new government

00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:32.999
bureaucracies.<br/>

00:23:32.999 --> 00:23:35.999
17 new government bureaucracies<br/>
is simply false.

00:23:35.999 --> 00:23:37.999
There's no evidence in the bill<br/>
that there are 17 new

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:38.999
bureaucracies.<br/>

00:23:38.999 --> 00:23:41.999
Not even the source that's<br/>
cited, Morgan Stanley, would

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:44.999
argue that there are 17<br/>
new bureaucracies.

00:23:44.999 --> 00:23:47.000
And these sources up on the<br/>
screen suggest to you that

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.999
some neutral source did a study<br/>
to conclude here that

00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:52.999
there are 17 new government<br/>
bureaucracies.

00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:54.999
But when you look at the source<br/>
what you're going to

00:23:54.999 --> 00:23:57.999
find out is, first, it isn't<br/>
a Morgan Stanley study.

00:23:57.999 --> 00:23:59.999
It's a Morgan Stanley<br/>
employee.

00:23:59.999 --> 00:24:01.999
And he's summarizing<br/>
a speech by a

00:24:01.999 --> 00:24:03.999
tobacco company executive.<br/>

00:24:03.999 --> 00:24:07.709
As you move claim by claim<br/>
through this ad, there are

00:24:07.709 --> 00:24:10.999
very few claims in the ad that<br/>
don't have some need for

00:24:10.999 --> 00:24:12.999
contextualization.<br/>

00:24:12.999 --> 00:24:15.999
Big taxes, big government,<br/>
big job losses.

00:24:15.999 --> 00:24:19.167
The tobacco companies use more<br/>
than just advertising to

00:24:19.167 --> 00:24:20.999
manipulate the Congress.<br/>

00:24:20.999 --> 00:24:23.999
What the tobacco industry<br/>
successfully did was used

00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:26.999
phone banking to call people<br/>
around the country.

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:29.999
And they would then describe<br/>
this bill, in a way that had

00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:32.999
no resemblance to what the bill<br/>
looked like, and say to

00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:35.999
the individual on the other<br/>
side, if you want to tell your

00:24:35.999 --> 00:24:38.959
member of Congress how opposed<br/>
you are to it, we'll patch you

00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:41.999
through for free.<br/>

00:24:41.999 --> 00:24:43.999
Members of congress got phone<br/>
calls from people who didn't

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:45.042
even know what bill<br/>
it was they were

00:24:45.042 --> 00:24:46.999
calling about sometimes.<br/>

00:24:46.999 --> 00:24:48.999
But you can't get away from<br/>
the fact that members of

00:24:48.999 --> 00:24:51.999
Congress count the number of<br/>
communications they get from

00:24:51.999 --> 00:24:53.626
their constituents.<br/>

00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:55.292
What is John McCain thinking?<br/>

00:24:55.292 --> 00:24:57.999
He and President Clinton<br/>
want to tax 50

00:24:57.999 --> 00:24:58.751
million adult Americans.<br/>

00:24:58.751 --> 00:25:00.834
They also went after the<br/>
conservative Republican

00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:03.999
senator who sponsored the bill,<br/>
John McCain of Arizona.

00:25:03.999 --> 00:25:06.999
We thought Senator McCain was<br/>
for lower taxes and less

00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:07.999
government.<br/>

00:25:07.999 --> 00:25:10.999
Well, I've got to say that the<br/>
tobacco companies raised my

00:25:10.999 --> 00:25:13.999
name ID, according to a<br/>
poll, to around 70%.

00:25:13.999 --> 00:25:16.999
It became a household word,<br/>
McCain, unfortunately.

00:25:16.999 --> 00:25:19.999
More like four letters<br/>
in some households.

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:23.999
But I really became aware of it,<br/>
really graphically aware

00:25:23.999 --> 00:25:28.667
of it, when phone calls to both<br/>
my home and office, and

00:25:28.667 --> 00:25:32.999
being stopped in the street by<br/>
people parodying the tobacco

00:25:32.999 --> 00:25:35.999
ads which said, what's happened<br/>
to John McCain?

00:25:35.999 --> 00:25:39.042
He's become a big tax and<br/>
spend liberal and a big

00:25:39.042 --> 00:25:39.999
government liberal.<br/>

00:25:39.999 --> 00:25:42.999
People literally would stop me<br/>
in the street and say, what's

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:43.999
happened to you, John?<br/>

00:25:43.999 --> 00:25:46.999
Like as if I'd experienced<br/>
some accident or illness.

00:25:46.999 --> 00:25:49.999
It's the largest consumer<br/>
tax in history.

00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:52.999
It hits middle and lower income<br/>
Americans the hardest.

00:25:52.999 --> 00:25:54.751
It was a dishonest campaign.<br/>

00:25:54.751 --> 00:25:58.999
No one requires that it be an<br/>
honest campaign, but it was

00:25:58.999 --> 00:25:59.999
patently false.<br/>

00:25:59.999 --> 00:26:02.999
So does the first amendment<br/>
give corporations

00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:04.999
the right to lie?<br/>

00:26:04.999 --> 00:26:07.999
The first amendment, I think,<br/>
gives corporations

00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:08.999
the right to lie.<br/>

00:26:08.999 --> 00:26:13.999
But I also believe that one of<br/>
the lessons here is that when

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:17.999
journalists and media see that<br/>
there is a lie being

00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:20.667
perpetrated on the American<br/>
people, that it

00:26:20.667 --> 00:26:21.999
also deserves coverage.<br/>

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:27.417
And the media, in this case, in<br/>
my view, probably did not

00:26:27.417 --> 00:26:30.999
do as much in informing the<br/>
American people about these

00:26:30.999 --> 00:26:31.999
ads as they could have.<br/>

00:26:31.999 --> 00:26:35.999
Well, the news media, in this<br/>
case, owned by large

00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:38.999
corporations who profited<br/>
enormously from those ads.

00:26:38.999 --> 00:26:41.501
I mean, the profits from the<br/>
ads went to the television

00:26:41.501 --> 00:26:44.999
stations, which are owned by,<br/>
as you know, corporations.

00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:46.999
I would not like to make the<br/>
accusation that there was a

00:26:46.999 --> 00:26:52.000
connection, but I do believe<br/>
that the media, especially

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.999
television news, could have done<br/>
a lot more in covering

00:26:54.999 --> 00:26:58.999
this, if only in the fact that<br/>
it was unprecedented in its

00:26:58.999 --> 00:27:00.999
scope and expense.<br/>

00:27:00.999 --> 00:27:03.918
Jamieson's research show that<br/>
during the months of the

00:27:03.918 --> 00:27:06.999
debate over the McCain bill,<br/>
while big tobacco was spending

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:10.999
millions on TV to defeat it,<br/>
only one nightly network news

00:27:10.999 --> 00:27:13.999
show, ABC's, ran a story<br/>
examining the claims of the

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:15.999
industry ads.<br/>

00:27:15.999 --> 00:27:18.999
Coverage was minimal as well<br/>
on cable TV, which raked in

00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:20.999
much of the campaign's millions<br/>

00:27:20.999 --> 00:27:22.999
in advertising revenue.<br/>

00:27:22.999 --> 00:27:24.999
The larger question,<br/>
then, is this.

00:27:24.999 --> 00:27:27.999
If you're getting that kind of<br/>
income out of this advertising

00:27:27.999 --> 00:27:32.999
process, don't you have some<br/>
obligation to provide some

00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:35.999
alternative access to the<br/>
alternative points of view?

00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:37.999
The tax falls upon the<br/>
American people.

00:27:37.999 --> 00:27:40.999
While TV news offered scant<br/>
critiques of the tobacco

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:44.999
campaign, the messages of the<br/>
ads were echoed verbatim on

00:27:44.999 --> 00:27:45.999
the Senate floor.<br/>

00:27:45.999 --> 00:27:47.999
There is a requirement in the<br/>
bill that the money be

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:50.999
collected from these<br/>
hardworking, low-income

00:27:50.999 --> 00:27:51.999
Americans--<br/>

00:27:51.999 --> 00:27:53.999
--and to create more federal<br/>
bureaucracies and big

00:27:53.999 --> 00:27:56.501
government than we've ever<br/>
created by one vote.

00:27:56.501 --> 00:27:59.959
Among the most vociferous was<br/>
a politician who, for years

00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:01.999
had been one of the top<br/>
recipients of campaign

00:28:01.999 --> 00:28:03.999
contributions from<br/>
big tobacco.

00:28:03.999 --> 00:28:10.709
What the tobacco bill is<br/>
about is tax and spend.

00:28:10.709 --> 00:28:12.999
Kentucky's Mitch McConnell<br/>
did more than carry

00:28:12.999 --> 00:28:13.999
the industry's message.<br/>

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:15.999
He flexed its muscle.<br/>

00:28:15.999 --> 00:28:20.999
Hours before the Senate was to<br/>
take the most important vote

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:23.584
on the McCain bill, a vote<br/>
whether to go forward or not,

00:28:23.584 --> 00:28:26.125
Senator Mitch McConnell, who<br/>
was then and still is, the

00:28:26.125 --> 00:28:28.999
Chairman of the Republican<br/>
Senate Campaign Committee, had

00:28:28.999 --> 00:28:32.999
a closed door meeting with his<br/>
fellow Republican senators.

00:28:32.999 --> 00:28:37.417
And he's acknowledged that at<br/>
meeting, he told them then if

00:28:37.417 --> 00:28:41.999
senators voted to kill the<br/>
McCain bill, they didn't need

00:28:41.999 --> 00:28:46.250
to worry that their political<br/>
constituents would see it as a

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:49.999
vote for big tobacco, because<br/>
the tobacco industry had

00:28:49.999 --> 00:28:54.709
promised that they would<br/>
continue to run the ads that

00:28:54.709 --> 00:28:59.999
they had been running for months<br/>
long after the vote and

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:02.876
well into the campaign season.<br/>

00:29:02.876 --> 00:29:05.999
In other words, translated<br/>
into simple English, the

00:29:05.999 --> 00:29:07.999
industry's advertising<br/>
is going to

00:29:07.999 --> 00:29:09.999
help you get reelected.<br/>

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:13.999
Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman,<br/>
Mr. Bond--

00:29:13.999 --> 00:29:15.999
Tobacco won the war.<br/>

00:29:15.999 --> 00:29:17.999
Corporate spending had<br/>
turned the tide

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:19.999
against a popular bill.<br/>

00:29:19.999 --> 00:29:23.999
I would remind you that we<br/>
passed this bill out of a 20

00:29:23.999 --> 00:29:27.250
member committee, 1/5 the United<br/>
States Senate, by a

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.999
vote of 19 to one.<br/>

00:29:29.999 --> 00:29:32.999
Everyone predicted that the bill<br/>
would then pass through

00:29:32.999 --> 00:29:34.999
the Senate after some debate<br/>
and amendments.

00:29:34.999 --> 00:29:37.999
It ended up not making it.<br/>

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:40.999
Every corporation, every special<br/>
interest, whether you

00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:44.209
like them or not, is entitled<br/>
to ensure that

00:29:44.209 --> 00:29:46.292
its message is heard.<br/>

00:29:46.292 --> 00:29:49.999
But you can't get away from the<br/>
fact that the influence of

00:29:49.999 --> 00:29:53.999
money so distorts the free<br/>
speech that it's no longer an

00:29:53.999 --> 00:29:57.667
honest and fair debate among<br/>
competing ideas.

00:29:57.667 --> 00:30:00.999
It's who has the money<br/>
to frame the issue.

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:02.999
Because if you don't have the<br/>
money to frame the issue, then

00:30:02.999 --> 00:30:04.999
whether you're right or<br/>
wrong isn't going to

00:30:04.999 --> 00:30:06.417
matter in the long run.<br/>

00:30:06.417 --> 00:30:08.999
I'm not suggesting that<br/>
one point of view

00:30:08.999 --> 00:30:10.999
doesn't deserve access.<br/>

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:11.709
It does.<br/>

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:13.999
In fact, that's a premise<br/>
of democracy.

00:30:13.999 --> 00:30:17.999
Views that we find abhorrent<br/>
have access to our system.

00:30:17.999 --> 00:30:19.501
That's protected speech.<br/>

00:30:19.501 --> 00:30:21.999
But what happens if we<br/>
inadvertently create a

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:25.417
situation in which by virtue<br/>
of privileging those with

00:30:25.417 --> 00:30:28.999
money, we make it very difficult<br/>
for those without to

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:30.999
be heard at all?<br/>

00:30:30.999 --> 00:30:34.918
Up until 1978, we lived quite<br/>
well, as a free society with

00:30:34.918 --> 00:30:37.999
good free speech law, without<br/>
saying that corporations would

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:40.999
have an unlimited amount of<br/>
power to spend any amount of

00:30:40.999 --> 00:30:42.999
money they want to<br/>
on politics.

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:46.999
Seems to me that we could say to<br/>
corporations, look, you've

00:30:46.999 --> 00:30:47.999
got a pretty good deal.<br/>

00:30:47.999 --> 00:30:51.999
You've got limited liability,<br/>
you have unlimited life, you

00:30:51.999 --> 00:30:54.999
can collect as much money as you<br/>
want, but you can't spend

00:30:54.999 --> 00:30:58.375
it on politics unless one<br/>
of two things happen.

00:30:58.375 --> 00:31:03.999
Unless you agree to cap it at<br/>
an amount that won't totally

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:07.876
distort the democratic process,<br/>
or unless we find

00:31:07.876 --> 00:31:10.999
some way to fund the voices on<br/>
the other side so that we can

00:31:10.999 --> 00:31:12.999
then have a full-scale debate.<br/>

00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:18.709
But I don't consider democracy<br/>
to be really functioning when

00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:22.209
one side's got a loud speaker<br/>
and the other side is being

00:31:22.209 --> 00:31:23.999
forced to whisper.<br/>

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:26.999
I know that the American Civil<br/>
Liberties Union, your old

00:31:26.999 --> 00:31:30.999
colleagues and friends, remains<br/>
fundamentalist on the

00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:31.999
first amendment.<br/>

00:31:31.999 --> 00:31:34.999
No abridgment whatsoever<br/>
of corporate speech

00:31:34.999 --> 00:31:36.999
or anybody's speech.<br/>

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:38.542
You clearly don't see eye<br/>
to eye with them.

00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:38.999
No.<br/>

00:31:38.999 --> 00:31:41.999
I mean, I don't think Madison<br/>
put that first amendment in

00:31:41.999 --> 00:31:45.999
there just as a device to<br/>
protect rich people's ability

00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:47.584
to dominate the political<br/>
discourse.

00:31:47.584 --> 00:31:50.000
I think Madison put the first<br/>
amendment in the Constitution

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.999
because he was aspiring toward<br/>
an ideal democracy, toward a

00:31:54.999 --> 00:31:58.999
democracy of equals, in which<br/>
individuals could speak, in

00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:01.999
which the polity would be a<br/>
polity of free standing

00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:04.999
individuals who could exchange<br/>
information and have that

00:32:04.999 --> 00:32:08.999
information be used as the<br/>
mechanism for voting choice.

00:32:08.999 --> 00:32:10.999
When the founders were<br/>
conceptualizing freedom of

00:32:10.999 --> 00:32:14.334
speech, if there were the<br/>
tobacco industry and there

00:32:14.334 --> 00:32:17.999
were the anti-tobacco folks,<br/>
the tobacco industry could

00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:20.999
take its stump and stand up on<br/>
the stump and say to the

00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:23.999
audience, it's a tax and spend<br/>
bill that will create huge

00:32:23.999 --> 00:32:26.999
government bureaucracies in<br/>
order to pay for special

00:32:26.999 --> 00:32:28.999
programs in a federal<br/>
Christmas tree

00:32:28.999 --> 00:32:29.999
with a black market.<br/>

00:32:29.999 --> 00:32:31.000
And it won't help kids<br/>
stop smoking.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.709
And the anti-tobacco people<br/>
could stand up and say,

00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:35.000
smoking is killing<br/>
our children.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.542
This bill has money to reimburse<br/>
the states for the

00:32:37.542 --> 00:32:39.459
costs of absorbing the<br/>
costs of the deaths

00:32:39.459 --> 00:32:40.999
caused by the industry.<br/>

00:32:40.999 --> 00:32:43.999
We want a campaign to minimize<br/>
children's use of a product

00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:45.501
that has been advertised to<br/>
them, even though the tobacco

00:32:45.501 --> 00:32:46.999
industry said they were<br/>
advertising it.

00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:47.999
And the tobacco industry<br/>
could get up

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.250
and rebut that position.<br/>

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:51.999
And the audiences could come<br/>
and listen to both,

00:32:51.999 --> 00:32:52.999
or listen to either.<br/>

00:32:52.999 --> 00:32:54.999
But they each would<br/>
have a stump.

00:32:54.999 --> 00:32:58.042
We're now in an environment in<br/>
which the tobacco industry

00:32:58.042 --> 00:33:01.626
buys its stump and gets up<br/>
and makes its statement.

00:33:01.626 --> 00:33:03.999
The anti-tobacco people don't<br/>
have the money to buy the

00:33:03.999 --> 00:33:06.999
stump, and in effect, the<br/>
tobacco industry has bought

00:33:06.999 --> 00:33:09.999
the access that the other<br/>
side can't afford.

00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:13.999
We've now made freedom of speech<br/>
freedom of speech if

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:15.999
you can afford to buy<br/>
the access to speak.

00:33:15.999 --> 00:33:18.751
<br/>

00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:20.999
Buying media time your opponents<br/>
can't afford is

00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.999
certainly one way to monopolize<br/>
the public debate.

00:33:23.999 --> 00:33:26.999
But it's not the only way to use<br/>
free speech to advance and

00:33:26.999 --> 00:33:28.626
protect your interests.<br/>

00:33:28.626 --> 00:33:31.000
Some corporations don't<br/>
just buy media time.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.999
They buy the media.<br/>

00:33:33.999 --> 00:33:38.584
It's a media-opoly,<br/>
a media-opoly.

00:33:38.584 --> 00:33:41.999
The whole media's controlled by<br/>
a few corporations thanks

00:33:41.999 --> 00:33:44.999
to deregulation by the FCC.<br/>

00:33:44.999 --> 00:33:47.334
This was a satire from<br/>
Saturday Night Live.

00:33:47.334 --> 00:33:50.209
They own networks from<br/>
CBS to CNBC.

00:33:50.209 --> 00:33:53.999
They can use them to say<br/>
whatever they please.

00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:59.999
And put down the opinions<br/>
of anyone who disagrees.

00:33:59.999 --> 00:34:02.999
Was it a vision inspired by<br/>
paranoia or a cogent look at

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:04.999
the future of free speech?<br/>

00:34:04.999 --> 00:34:08.999
When it is the media itself<br/>
that decides not only what

00:34:08.999 --> 00:34:12.999
advertisements to take that are<br/>
political in nature, but

00:34:12.999 --> 00:34:16.999
what free information to provide<br/>
the public called

00:34:16.999 --> 00:34:20.626
news, and we've then<br/>
deregulated, allowed them to

00:34:20.626 --> 00:34:26.999
own more within their<br/>
industries, we've let loose a

00:34:26.999 --> 00:34:28.999
giant here.<br/>

00:34:28.999 --> 00:34:31.999
Gene Kimmelman, Co-Chairman of<br/>
Consumers Union in Washington,

00:34:31.999 --> 00:34:35.999
DC, has tracked the growing<br/>
impact of media conglomeration

00:34:35.999 --> 00:34:36.999
on public policy.<br/>

00:34:36.999 --> 00:34:40.999
It is dangerous in an open, free<br/>
society like ours because

00:34:40.999 --> 00:34:47.417
we rely on the media so much for<br/>
public discourse, for the

00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:48.999
expression of democratic<br/>
values.

00:34:48.999 --> 00:34:53.999
Well, what does it matter that<br/>
Disney owns ABC, or that

00:34:53.999 --> 00:34:55.999
General Electric owns NBC?<br/>

00:34:55.999 --> 00:34:57.125
What does it matter to us?<br/>

00:34:57.125 --> 00:35:00.999
The danger is not just<br/>
when it's Disney, GE.

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:05.209
It's when there are very few<br/>
companies that control the

00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:10.999
most popular media outlets and<br/>
there's a policy issue that

00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:13.999
comes up that could hurt<br/>
them financially.

00:35:13.999 --> 00:35:17.959
It is very unlikely we're going<br/>
to get a full airing of

00:35:17.959 --> 00:35:20.999
that kind of an issue.<br/>

00:35:20.999 --> 00:35:24.999
Case in point, the 1996<br/>
Telecommunications Act.

00:35:24.999 --> 00:35:28.167
In February of that year,<br/>
industry leaders from phone to

00:35:28.167 --> 00:35:31.959
cable to satellite to broadcast<br/>
gathered alongside

00:35:31.959 --> 00:35:33.999
government officials to<br/>
celebrate a revolutionary

00:35:33.999 --> 00:35:36.999
revision of America's<br/>
communications law.

00:35:36.999 --> 00:35:39.999
This was a love fest. This was<br/>
the President and the Vice

00:35:39.999 --> 00:35:41.584
President getting together<br/>
with the Speaker and the

00:35:41.584 --> 00:35:43.999
Majority Leader and the leaders<br/>
of the committees that

00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:45.999
had moved this legislation.<br/>

00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:46.999
After all, this was historic.<br/>

00:35:46.999 --> 00:35:50.999
This was a major overhaul of<br/>
telecommunications policy.

00:35:50.999 --> 00:35:53.999
First time in 60 years,<br/>
since 1934.

00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:56.999
Today with a stroke of a pen,<br/>
our laws will catch up with

00:35:56.999 --> 00:35:57.999
our future.<br/>

00:35:57.999 --> 00:36:04.999
There was talk of millions of<br/>
jobs, tremendous GNP growth,

00:36:04.999 --> 00:36:07.999
competition, choice for<br/>
consumers, new services never

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:10.999
dreamt of, lower prices.<br/>

00:36:10.999 --> 00:36:12.000
It was a panacea.<br/>

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.999
This bill is an indication<br/>
of what can be done when

00:36:14.999 --> 00:36:17.999
Republicans and Democrats work<br/>
together in a spirit of

00:36:17.999 --> 00:36:19.999
genuine cooperation<br/>
to advance--

00:36:19.999 --> 00:36:22.999
What the President didn't say<br/>
was that the bill's real

00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:25.999
beneficiaries included the media<br/>
giants themselves, who

00:36:25.999 --> 00:36:28.999
had lobbied long and hard<br/>
for the bill's passage.

00:36:28.999 --> 00:36:33.999
Here you have the broadcast<br/>
industry actively working to

00:36:33.999 --> 00:36:35.999
transform television.<br/>

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:38.999
Geoff Chester runs the Center<br/>
for Media Education in

00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:40.792
Washington, DC.<br/>

00:36:40.792 --> 00:36:41.999
Television's going to change.<br/>

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:44.999
Consumers are going to have<br/>
to buy a new TV set.

00:36:44.999 --> 00:36:46.999
There are going to be many,<br/>
many more channels.

00:36:46.999 --> 00:36:50.999
The rules that determine how<br/>
accountable local broadcasters

00:36:50.999 --> 00:36:53.999
are to their community<br/>
are being weakened.

00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:57.999
Station license periods<br/>
are being extended.

00:36:57.999 --> 00:37:00.999
In essence, the<br/>
Telecommunications Act was

00:37:00.999 --> 00:37:04.999
like giving the broadcasters a<br/>
blank check with television.

00:37:04.999 --> 00:37:07.999
Do with it what you want.<br/>

00:37:07.999 --> 00:37:11.999
One thing television<br/>
broadcasters wanted, and got,

00:37:11.999 --> 00:37:13.999
was the lifting of restrictions<br/>
on the number of

00:37:13.999 --> 00:37:15.999
stations one company<br/>
could own.

00:37:15.999 --> 00:37:18.999
But it was another provision,<br/>
buried deep within the act,

00:37:18.999 --> 00:37:21.209
that stood to make<br/>
them billions.

00:37:21.209 --> 00:37:24.999
The free use of something called<br/>
the digital spectrum.

00:37:24.999 --> 00:37:28.999
The average American does not<br/>
know what digital spectrum is.

00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:30.999
They just don't know,<br/>
nor frankly should

00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:31.999
they have to know.<br/>

00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:35.999
They're working and being with<br/>
their families, et cetera.

00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:39.999
But here in Washington, their<br/>
assets that they own were

00:37:39.999 --> 00:37:41.584
being given away.<br/>

00:37:41.584 --> 00:37:43.999
Again, let me thank you from the<br/>
bottom of my heart, every

00:37:43.999 --> 00:37:45.999
one of you, for making<br/>
this great

00:37:45.999 --> 00:37:46.999
day for America possible.<br/>

00:37:46.999 --> 00:37:48.999
Thank you.<br/>

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:51.999
What was being given away<br/>
amounted to a set of new

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:54.209
channels over which it's<br/>
possible to bring us a much

00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:56.999
better, high-definition<br/>
picture.

00:37:56.999 --> 00:37:59.999
But broadcasters see in these<br/>
new channels something more,

00:37:59.999 --> 00:38:03.125
marketing opportunities never<br/>
before imaginable over the

00:38:03.125 --> 00:38:04.999
publicly-owned airwaves.<br/>

00:38:04.999 --> 00:38:08.042
Having a piece of the digital<br/>
spectrum is like having the

00:38:08.042 --> 00:38:10.709
keys to Fort Knox.<br/>

00:38:10.709 --> 00:38:13.626
Digital technology will allow<br/>
broadcasters to take the one

00:38:13.626 --> 00:38:16.999
channel that they have right now<br/>
and turn it into five, 10,

00:38:16.999 --> 00:38:19.999
even 20 or more channels.<br/>

00:38:19.999 --> 00:38:21.999
Digital technology will allow<br/>
broadcasters to create

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:25.999
interactive channels which<br/>
allow you to click on a

00:38:25.999 --> 00:38:28.501
commercial to buy a product.<br/>

00:38:28.501 --> 00:38:31.999
They want to take that piece of<br/>
free spectrum, chop it up

00:38:31.999 --> 00:38:36.999
into a lot of little channels,<br/>
and make piles of money from

00:38:36.999 --> 00:38:38.375
this valuable resource.<br/>

00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:41.999
Now since we as the people own<br/>
it, you might ask, why aren't

00:38:41.999 --> 00:38:44.042
we selling it to the<br/>
broadcasters and using that

00:38:44.042 --> 00:38:46.125
money for all sorts<br/>
of social goods?

00:38:46.125 --> 00:38:49.999
Well, that's a whole other<br/>
question, and it might speak

00:38:49.999 --> 00:38:51.999
to the lobbying power of<br/>
the broadcast industry.

00:38:51.999 --> 00:38:57.999
<br/>

00:38:57.999 --> 00:39:00.999
These people that bring us the<br/>
news, that objectively cover

00:39:00.999 --> 00:39:04.999
the news, are out there trying<br/>
to influence Congress and

00:39:04.999 --> 00:39:08.999
Washington as much as anybody.<br/>

00:39:08.999 --> 00:39:11.459
Like the other telecom<br/>
industries, broadcasters had

00:39:11.459 --> 00:39:12.999
been pouring millions<br/>
into campaign

00:39:12.999 --> 00:39:14.999
contributions to Congress.<br/>

00:39:14.999 --> 00:39:16.999
But that wasn't all<br/>
they were doing.

00:39:16.999 --> 00:39:20.999
The broadcasters had hundreds<br/>
of lobbyists spread all over

00:39:20.999 --> 00:39:24.999
the hill for a couple years<br/>
leading up to that period.

00:39:24.999 --> 00:39:26.999
But the reason they're so<br/>
powerful is they don't just

00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:28.999
give a lot of money out.<br/>

00:39:28.999 --> 00:39:30.999
And they just don't have<br/>
a phalanx of lobbyists

00:39:30.999 --> 00:39:33.999
smothering Capitol Hill<br/>
with their positions.

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:36.999
But they have one advantage<br/>
that no one else has.

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:40.959
They control the fate<br/>
of all politicians.

00:39:40.959 --> 00:39:42.000
Let me tell you how<br/>
they do that.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.876
There's an issue before<br/>
the Congress which

00:39:44.876 --> 00:39:46.999
affects their industry.<br/>

00:39:46.999 --> 00:39:51.999
Call in the station managers<br/>
from the congressman's

00:39:51.999 --> 00:39:55.083
district or the senator's<br/>
state.

00:39:55.083 --> 00:39:56.999
They all come to Washington.<br/>

00:39:56.999 --> 00:40:00.999
They sit down in a room with a<br/>
senator or representative.

00:40:00.999 --> 00:40:03.999
Now, there's never<br/>
any threats made.

00:40:03.999 --> 00:40:06.999
There's never any statement<br/>
that if you don't do this,

00:40:06.999 --> 00:40:10.999
we're going to say bad things<br/>
about you in our newscast. But

00:40:10.999 --> 00:40:11.999
they are the messengers.<br/>

00:40:11.999 --> 00:40:13.042
They are the messengers.<br/>

00:40:13.042 --> 00:40:16.250
They portray you, and your work<br/>
here in Washington, to

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.999
the people of your state<br/>
or district.

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:19.999
That's incredibly powerful.<br/>

00:40:19.999 --> 00:40:23.334
In the language of the bill that<br/>
we will be considering--

00:40:23.334 --> 00:40:25.999
John McCain was one of the few<br/>
senators who opposed the

00:40:25.999 --> 00:40:27.999
giveaway of the digital<br/>
spectrum.

00:40:27.999 --> 00:40:30.751
Another was Senate Majority<br/>
Leader Bob Dole.

00:40:30.751 --> 00:40:32.999
Now, let me get this straight.<br/>

00:40:32.999 --> 00:40:36.542
America lends the broadcasters<br/>
a national resource so they

00:40:36.542 --> 00:40:39.292
can increase their profit<br/>
margins, but they don't think

00:40:39.292 --> 00:40:40.999
it's fair to pay rent.<br/>

00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:43.751
But Dole and McCain were<br/>
lonely voices.

00:40:43.751 --> 00:40:46.999
I heard and saw many other<br/>
members of Congress who said,

00:40:46.999 --> 00:40:49.999
look, this is good<br/>
for America.

00:40:49.999 --> 00:40:51.999
All Americans are going<br/>
to get a much better

00:40:51.999 --> 00:40:53.999
picture on their TV set.<br/>

00:40:53.999 --> 00:40:55.999
Things are going to be great.<br/>

00:40:55.999 --> 00:40:57.999
And I agree with all that.<br/>

00:40:57.999 --> 00:41:01.999
But why should a profit-making<br/>
corporation get that asset for

00:41:01.999 --> 00:41:03.999
free and not have<br/>
to pay for it?

00:41:03.999 --> 00:41:06.999
Mr. president when something is<br/>
owned by the taxpayer and

00:41:06.999 --> 00:41:10.792
is of great value and we have<br/>
a way of taking that very

00:41:10.792 --> 00:41:13.000
valuable commodity that's owned<br/>
by the taxpayers and

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.417
auction it off--<br/>

00:41:14.417 --> 00:41:16.999
The digital spectrum could bring<br/>
the public up to $70

00:41:16.999 --> 00:41:18.999
billion at auction.<br/>

00:41:18.999 --> 00:41:20.999
But the broadcasters didn't<br/>
want an auction.

00:41:20.999 --> 00:41:23.999
Basically, they wanted the<br/>
spectrum for free.

00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:28.999
If we'd said, look, we've got<br/>
$10 billion worth of public

00:41:28.999 --> 00:41:32.667
land out there in the West. And<br/>
we're going to give it to

00:41:32.667 --> 00:41:35.999
various corporations in America<br/>
for them to use.

00:41:35.999 --> 00:41:38.999
And they're going to give us<br/>
back some other land which

00:41:38.999 --> 00:41:42.209
really isn't nearly as good<br/>
in exchange for that, the

00:41:42.209 --> 00:41:43.999
American people would<br/>
have never stood for

00:41:43.999 --> 00:41:44.999
such a thing, ever.<br/>

00:41:44.999 --> 00:41:47.999
<br/>

00:41:47.999 --> 00:41:50.999
It had all the makings of<br/>
a major news stories.

00:41:50.999 --> 00:41:52.999
Were powerful corporations<br/>
picking the

00:41:52.999 --> 00:41:54.999
pocket of the taxpayer?<br/>

00:41:54.999 --> 00:41:56.999
It's the very kind of thing<br/>
that broadcast journalism

00:41:56.999 --> 00:41:58.626
often investigates.<br/>

00:41:58.626 --> 00:42:01.999
After all, TV news<br/>
loves a scandal.

00:42:01.999 --> 00:42:03.999
We have on NBC, what<br/>
is it called,

00:42:03.999 --> 00:42:05.999
The Fleecing of America.<br/>

00:42:05.999 --> 00:42:09.626
Where were they when their own<br/>
networks and other TV stations

00:42:09.626 --> 00:42:12.667
were, in fact, lobbying and<br/>
getting what they wanted out

00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:13.999
of the Telecommunications Act?<br/>

00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:15.292
The provision of news is--<br/>

00:42:15.292 --> 00:42:17.999
Dean Alger is author of the<br/>
book Megamedia, a study of

00:42:17.999 --> 00:42:19.999
corporations and mass media.<br/>

00:42:19.999 --> 00:42:22.999
He examined the coverage of the<br/>
Telecom Act on the three

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:25.999
nightly network news broadcasts,<br/>
from the beginning

00:42:25.999 --> 00:42:27.999
of the Senate debate until<br/>
the night before

00:42:27.999 --> 00:42:28.999
the bill was passed.<br/>

00:42:28.999 --> 00:42:31.999
The telecommunications<br/>
act was introduced,

00:42:31.999 --> 00:42:33.999
roughly, in May, 1995.<br/>

00:42:33.999 --> 00:42:35.999
And it was finally passed<br/>
in early February, 1996.

00:42:35.999 --> 00:42:41.999
During that nine months, the<br/>
three network news shows--

00:42:41.999 --> 00:42:43.999
NBC, ABC, CBS--<br/>

00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:47.999
aired a sum total of only<br/>
19 minutes on this

00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:49.999
Telecommunications Act.<br/>

00:42:49.999 --> 00:42:52.999
None of that 19 minutes<br/>
including a single mention of

00:42:52.999 --> 00:42:55.626
the debate over whether<br/>
broadcasters should pay for

00:42:55.626 --> 00:42:56.999
use of the digital spectrum.<br/>

00:42:56.999 --> 00:43:01.999
If five senators took a<br/>
legitimate trip somewhere

00:43:01.999 --> 00:43:03.999
overseas to investigate<br/>
something that might be

00:43:03.999 --> 00:43:05.999
costing the American people<br/>
money, that would be reported

00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:09.999
on the evening news as a junket,<br/>
costing thousands and

00:43:09.999 --> 00:43:11.999
thousands of dollars.<br/>

00:43:11.999 --> 00:43:13.209
And that would be news.<br/>

00:43:13.209 --> 00:43:14.999
And maybe it is news.<br/>

00:43:14.999 --> 00:43:16.999
Maybe it should be reported.<br/>

00:43:16.999 --> 00:43:18.999
But when it comes to a billion<br/>
dollar giveaway to

00:43:18.999 --> 00:43:21.999
them, mum's the word.<br/>

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:25.999
You will not see this story on<br/>
any television or hear it on

00:43:25.999 --> 00:43:30.167
any radio broadcast because<br/>
it directly affects them.

00:43:30.167 --> 00:43:32.999
You said from the Senate floor,<br/>
we will not see this

00:43:32.999 --> 00:43:36.999
story on any television or hear<br/>
it on any radio broadcast

00:43:36.999 --> 00:43:38.999
because it directly<br/>
affects them.

00:43:38.999 --> 00:43:39.999
And did you?<br/>

00:43:39.999 --> 00:43:42.667
Did you hear anything on--<br/>

00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:42.999
No.<br/>

00:43:42.999 --> 00:43:43.999
I never heard.<br/>

00:43:43.999 --> 00:43:45.999
I saw a few print stories<br/>
about it.

00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:48.999
But never did I see a<br/>
television program.

00:43:48.999 --> 00:43:52.999
Later on, there was one,<br/>
I believe, on CBS.

00:43:52.999 --> 00:43:58.792
But the coverage, compared with<br/>
what any other story of

00:43:58.792 --> 00:44:00.999
this magnitude would have<br/>
gotten, was minuscule.

00:44:00.999 --> 00:44:04.999
The media did not want to<br/>
discuss what it was doing.

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:07.667
It would be like a bank robber<br/>
stopping the bank robbery and

00:44:07.667 --> 00:44:08.999
saying, look at what<br/>
we're doing here.

00:44:08.999 --> 00:44:10.999
Let's have a press conference<br/>
in front of the bank while

00:44:10.999 --> 00:44:11.999
we're doing it.<br/>

00:44:11.999 --> 00:44:15.999
I mean, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox,<br/>
everyone, who wanted to

00:44:15.999 --> 00:44:16.999
discuss this?<br/>

00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:18.999
They're all going to make<br/>
hundreds of millions of

00:44:18.999 --> 00:44:21.999
dollars, billions of dollars,<br/>
over the next several years.

00:44:21.999 --> 00:44:24.999
The last thing they want to<br/>
do is have a discussion.

00:44:24.999 --> 00:44:27.999
I do think we should resolve<br/>
this spectrum issue before the

00:44:27.999 --> 00:44:29.999
bill is considered.<br/>

00:44:29.999 --> 00:44:32.999
Dole finally agreed to support<br/>
the Telecom Act in exchange

00:44:32.999 --> 00:44:35.999
for a promise that an auction<br/>
might still be possible.

00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:38.999
In the months following,<br/>
broadcast news paid scant

00:44:38.999 --> 00:44:39.999
attention to the issue.<br/>

00:44:39.999 --> 00:44:42.999
Meanwhile, the broadcast lobby<br/>
sprang into action--

00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:44.417
Air is a wonderful thing.<br/>

00:44:44.417 --> 00:44:45.999
--with issue advertising.<br/>

00:44:45.999 --> 00:44:48.999
We all breathe it,<br/>
and it's free.

00:44:48.999 --> 00:44:50.999
We use the air too.<br/>

00:44:50.999 --> 00:44:52.999
Ads like this were careful<br/>
not to mention

00:44:52.999 --> 00:44:53.999
the spectrum auction.<br/>

00:44:53.999 --> 00:44:57.626
Instead, they claimed Congress<br/>
was planning to tax viewers.

00:44:57.626 --> 00:44:59.375
Now Congress has a new idea.<br/>

00:44:59.375 --> 00:45:02.876
They tax everything else,<br/>
why not the airwaves?

00:45:02.876 --> 00:45:04.999
You'll have to pay more to watch<br/>
your favorite shows, and

00:45:04.999 --> 00:45:06.999
we could lose them<br/>
all together.

00:45:06.999 --> 00:45:08.999
Call toll free and<br/>
tell Congress

00:45:08.999 --> 00:45:09.999
not to tax the airwaves.<br/>

00:45:09.999 --> 00:45:10.999
Tell them--<br/>

00:45:10.999 --> 00:45:13.999
In the spring, Congress quietly<br/>
gave the broadcasters

00:45:13.999 --> 00:45:14.999
what they wanted.<br/>

00:45:14.999 --> 00:45:16.999
There would be no auction.<br/>

00:45:16.999 --> 00:45:20.999
They got $70 billion worth<br/>
of free airwaves.

00:45:20.999 --> 00:45:23.834
The then head of the Federal<br/>
Communications Commission

00:45:23.834 --> 00:45:24.999
called it the biggest corporate<br/>

00:45:24.999 --> 00:45:26.999
giveaway this century.<br/>

00:45:26.999 --> 00:45:30.999
So this industry has been<br/>
dumping obscene amounts of

00:45:30.999 --> 00:45:33.999
money, tens of millions of<br/>
dollars, into the process

00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:35.999
around the time of this<br/>
key legislation.

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:38.042
And we've had no public<br/>
discussion about it.

00:45:38.042 --> 00:45:39.999
The public can't get upset about<br/>
it because they don't

00:45:39.999 --> 00:45:40.999
know about it.<br/>

00:45:40.999 --> 00:45:43.999
Because these guys control<br/>
the airwaves, they have,

00:45:43.999 --> 00:45:45.209
quote-unquote, free speech.<br/>

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:46.999
They're protecting our first<br/>
amendment rights.

00:45:46.999 --> 00:45:49.999
I feel much better when I go to<br/>
bed at night knowing that.

00:45:49.999 --> 00:45:52.999
I do a lot of interviews<br/>
on consumer issues.

00:45:52.999 --> 00:45:55.999
I have news crews coming in all<br/>
the time to talk about a

00:45:55.999 --> 00:45:56.959
variety of issues.<br/>

00:45:56.959 --> 00:45:58.999
And they always ask, what<br/>
aren't we covering?

00:45:58.999 --> 00:45:59.999
What else could we cover?<br/>

00:45:59.999 --> 00:46:01.999
And I always say, you know,<br/>
there's one very important

00:46:01.999 --> 00:46:02.999
issue out there.<br/>

00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:05.999
There's enough money involved<br/>
in this issue that you could

00:46:05.999 --> 00:46:07.999
probably provide health<br/>
insurance for everyone in this

00:46:07.999 --> 00:46:09.999
country who doesn't have it.<br/>

00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:13.999
Or you could provide a major<br/>
tax cut to the middle class

00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:15.751
and low-income people.<br/>

00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:16.999
The broadcasters then<br/>
always show

00:46:16.999 --> 00:46:18.292
interest. What is the issue?<br/>

00:46:18.292 --> 00:46:18.999
There's that much money<br/>
on the table?

00:46:18.999 --> 00:46:19.999
There's that much?<br/>

00:46:19.999 --> 00:46:20.999
This is such a big issue,<br/>
what is it?

00:46:20.999 --> 00:46:25.999
I say, it's if we just charge<br/>
fair-market value for the

00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:27.999
spectrum broadcast companies<br/>
receive for

00:46:27.999 --> 00:46:30.000
free from the public.<br/>

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.250
Usually there's silence,<br/>
maybe a grin.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.999
Most say, oh, come on.<br/>

00:46:35.999 --> 00:46:38.334
There's no way we're ever going<br/>
to get to do that kind

00:46:38.334 --> 00:46:39.959
of a segment.<br/>

00:46:39.959 --> 00:46:43.626
Are you suggesting some<br/>
deep, dark, mysterious

00:46:43.626 --> 00:46:44.999
conspiracy at work here?<br/>

00:46:44.999 --> 00:46:45.999
Absolutely not.<br/>

00:46:45.999 --> 00:46:48.999
You don't need to cook up some<br/>
dark, deep conspiracy.

00:46:48.999 --> 00:46:54.999
This is an age-old phenomenon<br/>
of willful people wanting to

00:46:54.999 --> 00:46:58.999
acquire wealth and power,<br/>
whether the power is formal

00:46:58.999 --> 00:47:00.999
governmental power<br/>
or, in this case,

00:47:00.999 --> 00:47:03.999
building enormous empires.<br/>

00:47:03.999 --> 00:47:05.999
It's not easy to get on the air<br/>

00:47:05.999 --> 00:47:07.999
criticizing the media giants.<br/>

00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:11.999
On stories affecting their<br/>
interests, no news is good.

00:47:11.999 --> 00:47:16.417
Jim Hightower had a syndicated<br/>
radio show on ABC.

00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:18.042
Jim Hightower on a Saturday--<br/>

00:47:18.042 --> 00:47:22.999
The Disney deal came down to<br/>
buy Cap Cities/ABC and

00:47:22.999 --> 00:47:25.999
Hightower challenged it, said<br/>
it was Mickey Mouse.

00:47:25.999 --> 00:47:27.999
Jim, I've got news for you.<br/>

00:47:27.999 --> 00:47:28.999
Who is this?<br/>

00:47:28.999 --> 00:47:30.999
Well, this is your new boss.<br/>

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:32.834
I'm the chairman of the board.<br/>

00:47:32.834 --> 00:47:33.999
Mickey Mouse?<br/>

00:47:33.999 --> 00:47:35.999
And then he challenged the whole<br/>
Telecommunications Act

00:47:35.999 --> 00:47:37.999
and said this is not good<br/>
for the public.

00:47:37.999 --> 00:47:39.999
Now, bear in mind, we're not<br/>
talking about monopoly here

00:47:39.999 --> 00:47:42.292
over toasters.<br/>

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:46.999
We're talking about monopoly<br/>
over your access to news and

00:47:46.999 --> 00:47:48.417
information.<br/>

00:47:48.417 --> 00:47:51.999
And it's information that you<br/>
and I need if we are going to

00:47:51.999 --> 00:47:53.999
have a democracy in<br/>
this country.

00:47:53.999 --> 00:47:55.999
Well, he was off the<br/>
air fairly quickly.

00:47:55.999 --> 00:48:00.083
Now, ABC said they didn't like<br/>
the ratings at that point in

00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:03.999
time, that the program just<br/>
wasn't successful.

00:48:03.999 --> 00:48:05.999
And that may be true.<br/>

00:48:05.999 --> 00:48:08.999
The problem for the public<br/>
is we'll never know.

00:48:08.999 --> 00:48:11.999
We're threatened here not just<br/>
as consumers but as citizens.

00:48:11.999 --> 00:48:13.999
It's our democracy<br/>
that's at stake.

00:48:13.999 --> 00:48:17.999
<br/>

00:48:17.999 --> 00:48:19.999
Now, you might say to yourself,<br/>
well, the media have

00:48:19.999 --> 00:48:21.999
never reported on their<br/>
owners or on their

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.999
behind the scenes dealings.<br/>

00:48:23.999 --> 00:48:24.999
And you'd be right.<br/>

00:48:24.999 --> 00:48:26.999
There was no golden age<br/>
of self-scrutiny

00:48:26.999 --> 00:48:28.999
by the press lords.<br/>

00:48:28.999 --> 00:48:32.000
What's different today is that<br/>
never before have so much

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.792
media been controlled<br/>
by so few owners.

00:48:35.792 --> 00:48:40.999
For example, whether you're<br/>
watching ABC News, a History

00:48:40.999 --> 00:48:45.999
Channel documentary, sports on<br/>
ESPN, a Lifetime movie, or

00:48:45.999 --> 00:48:48.999
commentary on E!, you're<br/>
watching Disney.

00:48:48.999 --> 00:48:50.999
And that's just scratching<br/>
the surface.

00:48:50.999 --> 00:48:53.999
Disney brings you information<br/>
via newspapers, magazines,

00:48:53.999 --> 00:48:56.751
radio stations, local<br/>
TV stations,

00:48:56.751 --> 00:48:59.999
and of course, movies.<br/>

00:48:59.999 --> 00:49:03.999
If you watch FOX News, the<br/>
FX channel, or the Family

00:49:03.999 --> 00:49:05.999
Channel, you're watching a<br/>
tiny fraction of Rupert

00:49:05.999 --> 00:49:09.999
Murdoch's powerful news<br/>
corporation, a global media

00:49:09.999 --> 00:49:13.250
empire controlling newspapers,<br/>
book publishers, regional

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:16.626
sports networks, even the<br/>
satellites capable of

00:49:16.626 --> 00:49:20.042
delivering programming<br/>
to 75% of the world.

00:49:20.042 --> 00:49:22.167
US NATO officials fear--<br/>

00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:26.000
When you watch CBS News, The<br/>
Nashville Network, or listen

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.999
to any one of more than 170<br/>
radio stations, including

00:49:29.999 --> 00:49:34.999
several in the same cities,<br/>
you're hearing from CBS Inc.

00:49:34.999 --> 00:49:36.876
And just consider this.<br/>

00:49:36.876 --> 00:49:39.876
Not only do these corporations<br/>
have more media outlets to

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:41.999
protect and promote their<br/>
interests, they've never had

00:49:41.999 --> 00:49:44.999
so many different interests<br/>
to promote and protect.

00:49:44.999 --> 00:49:46.999
Just take one example.<br/>

00:49:46.999 --> 00:49:50.999
The ultimate industrial media<br/>
conglomerate is General

00:49:50.999 --> 00:49:56.999
Electric, that controls NBC and<br/>
MSNBC and CNBC, et cetera.

00:49:56.999 --> 00:49:59.999
What is General Electric<br/>
involved in besides media?

00:49:59.999 --> 00:50:03.999
Well, in fact, they're in<br/>
everything from jet engines to

00:50:03.999 --> 00:50:07.999
abrasives to nuclear and other<br/>
electrical generating systems,

00:50:07.999 --> 00:50:10.083
hotels, insurance and finance.<br/>

00:50:10.083 --> 00:50:15.959
When NBC reporters come upon<br/>
some issue involved in those

00:50:15.959 --> 00:50:18.999
industrial areas, are they going<br/>
to think twice about

00:50:18.999 --> 00:50:19.999
what they cover?<br/>

00:50:19.999 --> 00:50:22.999
There's a built-in, profound<br/>
conflict of interest.

00:50:22.999 --> 00:50:24.999
It means that you're<br/>
not going to be

00:50:24.999 --> 00:50:27.709
investigating certain subjects.<br/>

00:50:27.709 --> 00:50:30.125
It means that you're not going<br/>
to see NBC investigating

00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:31.042
General Electric.<br/>

00:50:31.042 --> 00:50:34.792
You're not going to have ABC<br/>
doing a big, lengthy

00:50:34.792 --> 00:50:36.999
investigation about Disney.<br/>

00:50:36.999 --> 00:50:41.209
I heard Michael Eisner, head of<br/>
Disney, on National Public

00:50:41.209 --> 00:50:45.999
Radio say, I don't want ABC<br/>
News covering Disney.

00:50:45.999 --> 00:50:49.042
I don't want Disney<br/>
covering Disney.

00:50:49.042 --> 00:50:53.999
If ABC doesn't cover Disney,<br/>
maybe for some good reasons,

00:50:53.999 --> 00:50:57.999
we may not have enough other<br/>
people to cover Disney.

00:50:57.999 --> 00:51:01.999
The media giants are making so<br/>
many deals with each other

00:51:01.999 --> 00:51:03.999
that companies that might<br/>
normally be considered

00:51:03.999 --> 00:51:06.999
competitors are instead<br/>
becoming partners.

00:51:06.999 --> 00:51:11.999
This very exclusive club has<br/>
developed that determines what

00:51:11.999 --> 00:51:16.999
we see on TV. This club goes to<br/>
Congress and gets whatever

00:51:16.999 --> 00:51:20.999
they want, for the most part,<br/>
in terms of access to the

00:51:20.999 --> 00:51:21.999
media system.<br/>

00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:23.999
But we're all left out<br/>
of the picture.

00:51:23.999 --> 00:51:26.999
The picture is even murkier<br/>
than you think.

00:51:26.999 --> 00:51:29.999
Look at the case of<br/>
Telecommunications Inc., known

00:51:29.999 --> 00:51:33.167
to its 14 million cable<br/>
subscribers as TCI.

00:51:33.167 --> 00:51:36.501
The Discovery Channel, The<br/>
Learning Channel, and Animal

00:51:36.501 --> 00:51:39.999
Planet are all joint ventures<br/>
between TCI and Cox

00:51:39.999 --> 00:51:42.999
Communications, itself<br/>
a media giant.

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:45.999
With Comcast, yet another cable<br/>
giant, TCI owns the

00:51:45.999 --> 00:51:48.999
shopping channel, QVC.<br/>

00:51:48.999 --> 00:51:50.918
Then there's Bravo.<br/>

00:51:50.918 --> 00:51:53.999
TCI owns a piece of that<br/>
channel, but so do GE and

00:51:53.999 --> 00:51:56.999
Cablevision, which is even<br/>
more complicated than it

00:51:56.999 --> 00:52:02.999
sounds, because TCI also owns<br/>
1/3 of Cablevision.

00:52:02.999 --> 00:52:06.751
TCI's 10% stake in Time Warner,<br/>
whose cable operation

00:52:06.751 --> 00:52:09.999
ought to be TCI's fierce<br/>
competitor, gives them instead

00:52:09.999 --> 00:52:13.999
an interest in Time Warner's<br/>
vast holdings, over 24 book

00:52:13.999 --> 00:52:17.209
publishers, 30 cable and<br/>
satellite networks, film

00:52:17.209 --> 00:52:20.375
studios like Warner Brothers,<br/>
and music and magazine

00:52:20.375 --> 00:52:23.999
holdings that link up with<br/>
the likes of Sony.

00:52:23.999 --> 00:52:24.999
And that's not all.<br/>

00:52:24.999 --> 00:52:27.999
TCI even owns two thirds of the<br/>
company that produces The

00:52:27.999 --> 00:52:31.459
News Hour on public<br/>
television.

00:52:31.459 --> 00:52:33.999
All this must make TCI<br/>
one of the true big

00:52:33.999 --> 00:52:35.999
fish of telecom, right?<br/>

00:52:35.999 --> 00:52:39.334
Well yes, but not too big to<br/>
be swallowed up by an even

00:52:39.334 --> 00:52:40.999
bigger fish.<br/>

00:52:40.999 --> 00:52:45.999
In 1999, TCI was bought by<br/>
AT&T, the very monopoly

00:52:45.999 --> 00:52:49.999
regulators once broke up<br/>
to spur competition.

00:52:49.999 --> 00:52:54.083
This is a tremendous danger<br/>
for our society because if

00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:56.999
it's the car business and<br/>
there's mergers and

00:52:56.999 --> 00:53:01.999
consolidation, we fear higher<br/>
prices, less choice,

00:53:01.999 --> 00:53:04.999
concentration of ownership,<br/>
and we try to monitor it.

00:53:04.999 --> 00:53:10.999
But if we make a mistake, you<br/>
can break it up, challenge it.

00:53:10.999 --> 00:53:13.167
The facts are out there<br/>
to the public.

00:53:13.167 --> 00:53:15.999
If it's a media company merging<br/>
with another major

00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:20.959
media company, once it<br/>
has occurred, who is

00:53:20.959 --> 00:53:21.999
going to take it on?<br/>

00:53:21.999 --> 00:53:23.999
But the big shots don't care--<br/>

00:53:23.999 --> 00:53:27.999
And what about that Saturday<br/>
Night Live satire on NBC that

00:53:27.999 --> 00:53:29.999
did take on the media giants?<br/>

00:53:29.999 --> 00:53:33.999
Well, it ran only once on a<br/>
live broadcast. Then it

00:53:33.999 --> 00:53:37.999
mysteriously disappeared from<br/>
the show during reruns.

00:53:37.999 --> 00:53:41.667
The Executive Producer said,<br/>
quote, I don't think it worked

00:53:41.667 --> 00:53:41.999
comedically.<br/>

00:53:41.999 --> 00:53:42.999
[FLAT TONE]<br/>

00:53:42.999 --> 00:53:43.999
[LAUGHTER]<br/>

00:53:43.999 --> 00:53:45.999
Please stand by.<br/>

00:53:45.999 --> 00:53:46.999
Please stand by.<br/>

00:53:46.999 --> 00:53:48.999
It means there's technical<br/>
difficulties.

00:53:48.999 --> 00:53:50.999
<br/>

00:53:50.999 --> 00:53:55.999
You have said that money and<br/>
speech is the issue of the

00:53:55.999 --> 00:53:56.999
21st century.<br/>

00:53:56.999 --> 00:53:57.999
What do you mean by that?<br/>

00:53:57.999 --> 00:53:59.999
Well, I mean the relationship<br/>
between money and speech.

00:53:59.999 --> 00:54:02.999
I mean whether people who have<br/>
the money are going to so

00:54:02.999 --> 00:54:05.751
dominate the ability to express<br/>
their opinions, that

00:54:05.751 --> 00:54:07.834
people who don't have the money<br/>
are going to be turned

00:54:07.834 --> 00:54:09.334
into listeners, not speakers.<br/>

00:54:09.334 --> 00:54:10.959
I'm not satisfied with that.<br/>

00:54:10.959 --> 00:54:13.167
I'm not satisfied with a<br/>
two-tier first amendment that

00:54:13.167 --> 00:54:16.999
says a relatively small slice<br/>
of the world gets to decide

00:54:16.999 --> 00:54:19.999
what gets said, and all the<br/>
rest of us sit like

00:54:19.999 --> 00:54:23.751
groundlings in the audience<br/>
and grunt about whether we

00:54:23.751 --> 00:54:24.999
like it or not.<br/>

00:54:24.999 --> 00:54:27.999
Because that's what we're going<br/>
to, unless we can find a

00:54:27.999 --> 00:54:31.999
way to increase the ability of<br/>
people without large amounts

00:54:31.999 --> 00:54:35.626
of money to either get access to<br/>
the media, to get access to

00:54:35.626 --> 00:54:39.999
the political process, to in<br/>
some way break through the

00:54:39.999 --> 00:54:42.999
huge screen that money creates<br/>
these days, so that they can

00:54:42.999 --> 00:54:44.999
get their voices<br/>
heard as well.

00:54:44.999 --> 00:54:46.999
The first amendment<br/>
is aspirational.

00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:47.542
It's Romantic.<br/>

00:54:47.542 --> 00:54:50.999
It says that the purpose is to<br/>
create a world in which people

00:54:50.999 --> 00:54:53.584
can speak freely and equally<br/>
to one another.

00:54:53.584 --> 00:54:56.918
And therefore, there's an<br/>
obligation to step in, at some

00:54:56.918 --> 00:55:00.918
point, and even the playing<br/>
field so that individuals can

00:55:00.918 --> 00:55:03.999
actually have real discussions<br/>
and real debate.

00:55:03.999 --> 00:55:06.999
Because what we've now got is<br/>
not a real democracy with real

00:55:06.999 --> 00:55:09.334
debate, but we've<br/>
got a plutocracy

00:55:09.334 --> 00:55:10.999
in which money talks.<br/>

00:55:10.999 --> 00:55:23.999
<br/>

00:55:23.999 --> 00:55:27.999
This law also recognizes<br/>
that with freedom comes

00:55:27.999 --> 00:55:28.999
responsibility.<br/>

00:55:28.999 --> 00:55:32.999
It clearly enables the age of<br/>
possibility in America to

00:55:32.999 --> 00:55:35.999
expand to include<br/>
more Americans.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.999
I congratulate the broadcasters<br/>
and their

00:55:37.999 --> 00:55:40.792
surrogates here in the Senate<br/>
and in the Congress.

00:55:40.792 --> 00:55:44.999
I congratulate them for their<br/>
incredible influence that has

00:55:44.999 --> 00:55:48.375
prevented us from mandating an<br/>
auction of the spectrum which

00:55:48.375 --> 00:55:50.999
belongs to the taxpayers.<br/>

00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:53.999
We're going to be back later<br/>
with my interview with my new

00:55:53.999 --> 00:55:55.999
bosses at ABC--<br/>

00:55:55.999 --> 00:55:56.999
Mickey Mouse?<br/>

00:55:56.999 --> 00:55:59.999
<br/>

00:55:59.999 --> 00:56:01.999
It's a big mess,<br/>
and literally.

00:56:01.999 --> 00:56:11.999
<br/>

00:56:11.999 --> 00:56:15.999

Foundation and by the Bernard

00:56:19.999 --> 00:56:23.209
and Audre Rapoport Foundation.<br/>

Corporate funding is provided by<br/>
Mutual of America, building

00:56:27.999 --> 00:56:30.999
America's future through pension<br/>
and retirement plans,

00:56:30.999 --> 00:56:33.999
encouraging dialogue<br/>
and discussion.

00:56:33.999 --> 00:56:37.999
The spirit of America,<br/>
Mutual of America.
