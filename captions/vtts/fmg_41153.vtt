00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.160
YOU WILL NEVER FIND
ANYONE ELSE LIKE ME.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.830
I AM UNIQUE.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.700
I AM THE RIGHT PERSON FOR
THE JOB OF MARRYING YOU.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.830
I'VE GOT NO INTENTIONS OF
GETTING MARRIED TO YOU OR TO...

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.060
I'LL GET MARRIED
WHEN KATHERINE DOES.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.960
YOUR KATHERINE?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.900
THAT'S JUST NOT
GONNA HAPPEN, IS IT?

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.530
ISN'T IT?

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.360
WELL, WHO'D
MARRY HER?

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.760
I DON'T KNOW.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.730
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET RID OF ME.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.460
HELLO.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.230
HELLO.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:39.460
SO, WOULD YOU
LIKE A DRINK?

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:52.730
SO, HOW DO I SAY
I WANT YOU TO...

00:12:52.730 --> 00:13:00.260
MAKE MY PIP SQUEAK

HARRY!

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.260
OH, YOU'RE IN!

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.460
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE IN AUSTRALIA.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:13.960
NO, THEY
THREW ME OUT.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.460
WHAT FOR?

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.330
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.960
HAVE YOU BEEN
IN A CAR CRASH?

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.730
NO, NOT RECENTLY.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.960
UH, I'M...

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.630
GOOD. ME TOO.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.260
DO YOU MIND
IF I, UH...?

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.560
NO, HELP YOURSELF.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.130
SO, BACK IN ENGLAND.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:48.500
TOYING WITH THE IDEA OF SETTLING
DOWN, GETTING MARRIED.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.660
WHY?

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.560
MY FATHER DIED.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.330
NO. REALLY? I'M SORRY,
I HAD NO IDEA.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.060
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE
SOME MONEY AND HE DIDN'T,

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.430
THE OLD... LOVE.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.000
SORT OF BACKWARDS
AND FORWARDS.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.700
I WAS PUTTING ABOUT
THAT HE LEFT ME LOADED.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.560
BUT IT DIDN'T CUT MUCH ICE
WITH INLAND REVENUE.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.400
ARE THEY STILL
AFTER YOU?

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.400
SO I'VE COME TO WIVE IT
WEALTHILY IN PADUA.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.060
REALLY?

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.330
DON'T KNOW ANYONE TO
FIT THE BILL, DO YOU?

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:22.560
RICH.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.400
THEY DON'T NEED TO BE ANYTHING
ELSE, REALLY. JUST RICH.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.200
A FEMALE PREFERABLY.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.700
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.900
NO, I COULDN'T INFLICT
THAT, EVEN ON YOU.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.560
HAVE YOU GOT
SOMEONE IN MIND?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.000
NO.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.400
OH, WELL.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.830
YOU COULDN'T LEND ME
$54 GRAND, COULD YOU?

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.060
NO.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.800
ALRIGHT THEN.
ONWARDS AND UPWARDS.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.260
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.200
I DON'T KNOW - CHINA?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.330
WAIT A MINUTE,
I KNOW A...

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.900
WHAT?

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:04.060
WAIT... MIND IF I LIE
DOWN FOR A MINUTE?

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.530
I HAD A BIT OF A BAD
NIGHT LAST NIGHT.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.900
HANGOVER?

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.860
NO, NO, I'M FINE.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.930
NO, NO, YOU
DON'T LIE DOWN...

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:23.260
YOU NEVER LIE DOWN!
ON YOUR FEET!

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.130
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT
IT ALL THE WAY!

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.830
YOU'VE GOTTA GRAB IT BY THE
JUGULAR, SLAP IT ON THE FACE,

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.460
KICK IT IN THE BALLS!
YOU GET DRESSED,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.400
YOU GO OUT, YOU GET FRESH
AIR, YOU EAT DONUTS.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.530
YOU GIVE IN ONCE AND IT'LL
THINK IT CAN WALK ALL OVER YOU

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.330
EVERY TIME. YOU'VE GOTTA
BE FIRM AND STRONG.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.660
YOU'VE GOTTA DEAL WITH IT THE
WAY YOU DEAL WITH A WOMAN.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.200
WHAT, BY KICKING
IT IN THE BALLS?

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.100
TWELVE YEARS...
TWELVE YEARS.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.260
THEN - AND THIS IS WHAT MADE
ME SMILE VAGUELY EARLIER ON

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:59.660
WHEN YOU WERE GOING ON
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED -

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.430
SHE SAYS "I'LL GET MARRIED
WHEN KATHERINE DOES".

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.460
THIS IS HER SISTER.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:07.600
BIANCA'S SISTER?

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.000
KATHERINE. MINOLA... YOU
MUST HAVE SEEN HER.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.700
ON THE TELLY.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.760
SHE'S AN MP.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.330
THIS KATHERINE IS LOOKING
FOR A HUSBAND, IS SHE?

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.130
NO. I DON'T KNOW,
IT WAS A JOKE.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.000
IS SHE RICH?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.300
THE IDEA IS SHE'S
TRYING TO GET ON.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.100
SHE'S A BIG DEAL,
POTENTIALLY, A VERY BIG DEAL.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.060
YOU CAN'T NOT
HAVE HEARD OF HER.

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:37.530
SHE'S BAD TEMPERED,
ON THE TELLY.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.500
SHE PROBABLY INVENTED
THE INLAND REVENUE.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.500
FACE LIKE A
BUSTED SHOE.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:49.160
EVERYONE THINKS SHE'S A DYKE, OR
MAD, OR HITLER, OR SOMETHING.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.800
BUT... MONEY.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.260
I ASSUME SO.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.160
SO WHEN CAN
I MEET HER?

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.800
NO.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:03.330
SHE'S AN UGLY, BAD TEMPERED,
PUERILE, VIOLENT,

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:08.860
SAD, STRANGE, SCREW-UP
WITH PROBLEMS.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.330
I LIKE HER MORE
AND MORE.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:17.260
AND, SHE'S A VIRGIN.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.600
BIANCA TOLD ME.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.930
38 YEARS OLD
AND STILL A VIRGIN.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.100
THAT'S HOW
BAD IT IS.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.760
THAT'S GOTTA TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.030
THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU WANT, IS IT?

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.060
NOT THESE DAYS.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.000
IF I PROPOSED
TO HER...

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.700
JUST DON'T GO THERE. NOT
EVEN FOR A GOLD MINE.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.230
PLEASE, HARRY. THOU
KNOWS NOT GOLD'S EFFECT.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.330
ARE YOU
EATING THAT?

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.130
EXCUSE ME.

COULD THEY INTERVIEW

SIBLING RIVALRY AMONGST

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.500
THANK YOU, I'LL

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.060
AND YOUR MOTHER'S HERE,
SHE'S ON HER WAY UP.

WHO THE HELL
LET HER IN?

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.700
SECURITY.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.460
ON WHO'S AUTHORITY?

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.300
MINE. SHE'S
YOUR MOTHER.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.500
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
MY MOTHER LOOKS LIKE.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.460
SHE COULD BE A TERRORIST
FOR ALL YOU KNOW.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.000
CAN I GO HOME?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.200
YEAH, GET LOST.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.700
(KNOCKING)

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.760
MRS. MINOLA,
COME IN.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.100
KATHERINE! BIANCA'S VERY KEEN
FOR YOU TO COME TO HER PARTY.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.160
WHY?

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.030
SHE WORRIES ABOUT
YOU. SO DO I.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.760
FORCING ME TO LIVE
IT UP WITH A BUNCH OF

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.630
OVERPAID COKE-SNORTING
ANOREXICS

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.800
IS GOING TO MAKE YOU
BOTH FEEL BETTER, IS IT?

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.830
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT GETTING MARRIED?

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.130
THAT WAS A JOKE.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.860
BUT YOU'RE STANDING
FOR THE LEADERSHIP,

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.460
IT'S BEEN ON
THE NEWS.

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:47.060
THE TWO THINGS AREN'T
IRREVOCABLY LINKED.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.430
IT NEEDN'T BE A
JOKE, WHY SHOULD IT?

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.860
APART FROM THE FACT THAT
NO ONE'S EVER ASKED ME

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.060
AND THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN OUT
WITH ANYONE TO SPEAK OF?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:56.500
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.000
MAYBE IT'S AN OPTION
I SHOULD CONSIDER.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.700
YOU DON'T...?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.730
WHAT?

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:04.830
SHOP AROUND THE
CORNER, DO YOU?

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.060
NO.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:08.860
BECAUSE SOME
PEOPLE THINK YOU DO

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.800
AND IF YOU GOT MARRIED
THEY WOULDN'T.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.130
NEXT TIME SOMEONE
ASKS ME TO MARRY THEM

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.030
I'LL BEAR
THAT IN MIND.

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.560
GOOD.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.030
COME ON. I'VE GOT A CAR
WAITING DOWNSTAIRS.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.630
NO, I'VE GOT PHONE
CALLS TO MAKE.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.660
FIVE MINUTES.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.930
JUST SHOW YOUR FACE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.830
YOU CAN'T LOSE YOUR TEMPER
AND MAKE A FOOL OF YOURSELF

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.660
IN FIVE MINUTES.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:36.630
I CAN.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.430
YOU'RE MAD.

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:37.930
EVEN IF THE BITCH FROM
THE BLACK LAGOON IS HERE,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.000
WHICH IS UNLIKELY, WHAT ARE
YOU GOING TO SAY TO HER?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.830
BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING
TO INTRODUCE YOU.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.100
COME ON!

50 QUID SAYS YOU
WON'T GET HER LOOKING.

50 QUID SAYS YOU
WON'T WANT TO

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:54.300
ONCE YOU CLAP EYES
ON THE OLD TROUT.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.930
EXCUSE ME.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.760
KATHERINE! GET BACK HERE
NOW AND APOLOGIZE!

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:04.800
YOU WILL NOT DO
THIS TO MY GUESTS!

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.500
HE JUST OFFERED TO
SHOW HER A FEW CHORDS

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.330
AND SHE SMASHED THE
GUITAR OVER HIS HEAD.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.200
ANY TIME ANYONE'S
NICE TO HER

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.730
SHE THINKS THEY'RE
TAKING A LICK!

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.430
OH, GO TO HELL! ALL OF
YOU. AND STAY THERE!

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.330
IS THIS HER?

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.300
KATE!

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.560
KATHERINE!

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.860
I PREFER KATE.

DO YOU?

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.360
IT SUITS YOU, KATE.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.760
KATE.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.060
MY SORT OF KATE.
KATE, KATE.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:39.530
AND YOU ARE?

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.960
I'M GOING TO
MARRY YOU.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.330
ARE YOU INDEED?

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.530
IF I CAN HELP IT.

00:23:47.530 --> 00:23:49.930
YOU SEE SOMEONE YOU NEVER
CLAPPED EYES ON BEFORE

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.330
AND IN A FLASH
YOU JUST KNOW.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.430
RIGHT THERE IN
FRONT OF YOU.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.630
REALLY? WELL, IT'S BEEN A
DELIGHT AND A PLEASURE

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.560
AND I CAN THINK OF NOTHING
FINER THAN SPENDING

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.830
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH
A CERTIFIABLE LUNATIC!

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:03.400
I DO HAVE THINGS TO DO, SO
IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME...

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.860
I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU BUT
THE DOORS AREN'T OPENING.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.630
WHAT? OH.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:24.160
DON'T DO THAT.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.430
(ALARM)

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.460
NOW YOU'VE REALLY
BUGGERED IT UP!

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.400
HAVE I? SORRY.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.230
HAVE YOU GOT A MOBILE?
- NOPE.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.100
DAMN.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:37.030
GIVES US TIME TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.330
MAY I PUT MY CARDS
ON THE TABLE?

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.900
PLEASE DON'T.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.660
HELLO!

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.360
THERE'S SOMETHING
REALLY VERY...

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.100
WHAT?

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.930
AROUSING ABOUT THE WAY YOU MOVE
YOUR LIPS WHEN YOU SNARL.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.660
EXCUSE ME?

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.960
TALK.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.130
WHAT?

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.800
SAY SOMETHING.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.230
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. DID MY
MOTHER PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.360
NO, I WAS JUST
THINKING OF SEX.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:11.560
THE KIND OF THING
PEOPLE SHOW OFF ABOUT.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.330
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.100
ARE YOU
THREATENING ME?

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:18.560
NO, I'M JUST POINTING OUT THAT
SOME PEOPLE MIGHT REGARD THIS -

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.900
IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES -
AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO UM,

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.900
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.100
YOU AREN'T MAKING
LEWD THREATS.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.930
NO, I WAS HAVING LEWD THOUGHTS,
NOT MAKING LEWD THREATS.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:30.000
WELL, DON'T!

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.360
DON'T WHAT?

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.060
HAVE LEWD THOUGHTS,
NOT ABOUT ME.

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:34.900
THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M HERE FOR.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.060
IT'S OFF THE MENU, DO
YOU UNDERSTAND?

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.600
OH, KATE.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.230
KATHERINE!

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:46.200
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TEMPTING
YOU ARE TO A MAN LIKE ME.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.360
YOU DO THAT AGAIN,
I'LL HIT YOU BACK.

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.560
HARDER.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.030
KATE.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.200
MISS MINOLA.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.160
I LIKE EVERYTHING
YOU DO.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:07.160
I LIKE EVERYTHING
ABOUT YOU.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:11.160
AND I'M SERIOUS! I
WANT TO MARRY YOU.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.460
WHO ARE YOU?

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:18.560
OTHERS CALL YOU HORRIBLE,
DISGUSTING, AND OBNOXIOUS.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.460
YOU'RE NOTHING OF THE
KIND. YOU'RE PLUCKY.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.200
YOU'RE FUN,
YOU'RE EXCITING.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.900
I DON'T THINK I'VE
EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.930
WHAT MY KIND OF
WOMAN WAS BEFORE.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.230
KATE?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.300
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.930
THE CONCIERGE CALLED
TO SAY THE LIFT WAS STUCK

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.930
AND DID WE KNOW ANYONE
WHO MIGHT BE IN THERE.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.700
THIS IS KATE.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.960
YEAH, WELL, WE'VE MET.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.000
WE'RE GOING
TO BE MARRIED.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.260
IN YOUR
DREAMS, MUSH.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:00.760
DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HER;
SHE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF ME.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.760
WE AGREED TO KEEP
QUIET ABOUT IT IN PUBLIC.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.660
REALLY?

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.530
I'LL BOOK THE REGISTRY,
UH, AS SOON AS I CAN.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.400
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.100
RIGHT, YOU DO THAT.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.760
BYE, BE IN TOUCH.

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.660
OKAY.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.060
KISS ME, KATE!

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.130
UP YOURS, WEIRDO.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.260
I THINK SHE LIKES ME.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.130
DON'T TELL ME I HAVE
TO BE NICE TO THEM

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.300
IN ORDER TO GET
THEM TO VOTE FOR ME.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.200
I HAVE INTEGRITY AS WELL
AS BEING THE SHARPEST

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.930
TOOL IN THE SHED, AND IF
THEY CAN'T APPRECIATE THAT...

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:47.730
JUST ROUND THEM UP AND
REMIND THEM THAT LAST TIME

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.400
WE HAD A WOMAN IN CHARGE
WE ACTUALLY WON ELECTIONS.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:56.300
I DO WANT TO
FRIGHTEN THEM, YES.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.330
THANK YOU, BYE.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:03.830
BLOKE 'ROUND TO SAY YOU'RE
HAVING LUNCH WITH HIM.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.730
SORRY, WHO?

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.660
HE DIDN'T SAY. SAID YOU
MET HIM AT BIANCA'S PARTY.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.460
HE'LL BE BY THE BANDSTAND IN
ST. JAMES PARK IN FIVE MINUTES.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.000
ALRIGHT, THANK YOU.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.060
OH! OH!

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.160
WATCH WHERE YOU'RE
GOING! MORON.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.360
IDIOT.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.600
COME ON!

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.500
FORGET IT.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.330
KATE!

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.660
SORRY ABOUT
THAT.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.560
FETCH!

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.930
YOU TOSSER.

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:09.160
YOU'VE GOT A
PROBLEM, BALDY OX?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:12.130
COME ON! YOU
WANNA GO, DO YOU?

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.860
COME ON!

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.800
KIDS, EH?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.730
ARE YOU
STALKING ME?

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.500
NO, BUT I'D LIKE TO.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.330
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.330
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
ALL MY BABIES.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.730
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.960
I KNOW ENOUGH.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.630
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.260
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW?

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.130
SO HOW MUCH DO YOU
OWE THE REVENUE?

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.560
$54 GRAND
PLUS INTEREST.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.130
THAT'S WHY I WENT TO AUSTRALIA
- TIL I GOT BOOTED OUT

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.160
FOR NOT HAVING
A WORK PERMIT.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.330
I'M NOT A FRAUDSTER.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:03.600
I'M NOT. I'M JUST
APPALLING WITH MONEY.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.000
JUST LIKE MY OLD MAN - HE
WAS FAMOUS FOR IT. WELL,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.630
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HE'D
BEEN FAMOUS FOR ANYTHING.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.400
SO, IT WAS A JOKE,
YOU KNOW?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.160
WANTING TO MARRY SOMEONE RICH -
EXCEPT IT WASN'T, NOT ENTIRELY.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.300
AND THEN, CLANG.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.160
IT TOOK ON A VERY
DIFFERENT COMPLEXION.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:29.730
WELL, YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED
TO LEARN THAT THIS IS

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.860
THE FIRST OFFER OF
MARRIAGE I'VE HAD ALL WEEK.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.930
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS WEEKEND?

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.760
I'M TRYING TO RUN A LEADERSHIP
CAMPAIGN AT THE MOMENT, WHY?

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.600
HAVE YOU GOT A CAR?

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.830
WHY?

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:46.100
I WAS THINKING I'D
SHOW YOU THE HOUSE.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.230
IT'S A DUMP, THOUGH. BE
WARNED. IT WAS LAST TIME

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.930
I SAW IT, I CAN'T IMAGINE
IT'S IMPROVED ANY.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:14.230
I SHOULD SELL IT. IF I
HAD ANY SENSE I WOULD.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:18.600
I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THEIR
RIGHT MIND WOULD BUY IT.

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:22.360
ANYWAY, I
GREW UP HERE.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.130
SO DID MY
ANCESTORS.

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:33.900
FOR 300 YEARS -
15, 16 GENERATIONS,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.600
EACH ONE MORE
FECKLESS THAN THE LAST.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:39.400
IT'S A WONDER
WE SURVIVED.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.200
BUT WE HAVE, AND I
DON'T WANT TO SELL IT.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.660
BUT YOU CAN'T
AFFORD TO KEEP IT.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:49.630
NOT UNLESS I MARRY
EXTREMELY WELL.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.500
WE USED TO PLAY
FOOTBALL IN HERE.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.060
ONE SPRING MY DAD
FILLED IT WITH PIGS.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.600
PIGS?

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.530
HE BOUGHT
THESE PIGS...

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.030
HE WAS DRUNK, HE'D HAD
A WIN ON THE HORSES.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.600
HE'D MAKE MILLIONS
WITH THESE PIGS.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.400
EXACTLY HOW,
HE NEVER SAID.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.500
THEN WHEN HE GOT BORED OF
THEM, I THINK WE ATE THEM.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.630
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR MOM?

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.660
WE DIDN'T NEED HER.
SHE CLEARED OFF.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.360
WHEN?

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.530
WHEN I WAS SIX.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:30.160
WHERE DID YOU
GO TO SCHOOL?

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.930
LOCAL COMP WHERE I
USED TO GET PICKED ON.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:37.330
STILL, IT WAS
CHARACTER BUILDING.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:39.900
PROBABLY.

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:45.860
I SHOULD SELL IT AND GET THE
INLAND REVENUE OFF MY BACK.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.260
STILL HAVE PLENTY OF CHANGE
AND STILL HAVE A TITLE.

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:53.930
YOU'VE GOT A TITLE?

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:59.660
OH, YES. I'M THE 16TH
EARL OF CHARLBURY.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:06.500
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I AM A GENTLEMAN.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:11.130
HOW ABOUT SOME TAKE-AWAY?
YOU'D HAVE TO PAY FOR IT.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.660
HOW WAS NEW
YORK, BIANCA?

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.260
BIG.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.060
HOW'S THE ROMANCE?

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.000
WE'RE VERY
MUCH IN LOVE.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.100
YOU MUST BE LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE WEDDING.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.060
WELL, WE'RE NOT
QUITE THERE YET.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.900
NOT YOU, LOVE.
YOUR SISTER.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.100
I'M SORRY?

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.330
KATHERINE'S WEDDING ON SATURDAY
TO THE EARL OF CHARLBURY.

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.430
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING YET?

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.060
THIS ISN'T A JOKE, IS IT?

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.360
NOT AS FAR AS I'M
AWARE, SIR. NO.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.760
HAVE YOU MET HIM?

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.230
NO.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.360
BUT HE
DEFINITELY EXISTS?

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.430
WELL, I ASSUME.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.530
SOMEONE HASN'T SENT
THESE OUT AS A PRANK

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:08.830
TO EMBARRASS HER, TO
MESS UP THE CAMPAIGN?

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.800
THEY'VE DEFINITELY
COME FROM HERE?

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.060
OH, YES! YES, I CHOSE
THE DESIGN FOR HER.

00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.060
SO, WHAT'S HE LIKE?

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:20.360
WELL, AS I SAID, I'VE NOT...

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:22.460
WHAT'S SHE SAID
ABOUT HIM?

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:27.930
NOTHING MUCH, JUST THAT
SHE'S GONNA MARRY HIM.

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:29.700
CONGRATULATIONS!

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.960
KATHERINE, I HAD NO IDEA.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.060
OH. WELL, NO.
NEITHER DID I.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.230
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.100
IT'S ALL BEEN
RATHER SUDDEN.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.000
DOROTHY AND I WOULD
BE DELIGHTED.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.300
SHE ADORES WEDDINGS; SO
DO THE GIRLS. WHAT A TREAT.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.460
THE EARL OF CHARLBURY.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.900
YES.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.460
DO I KNOW HIM?

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.260
HOW THE HELL
WOULD I KNOW?

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.600
I JUST WONDERED
WHERE YOU FOUND HIM.

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.000
I MEAN, WHERE
YOU MET HIM.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.460
HE'S ATTRACTIVE AND
HE PROPOSED TO ME.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:09.100
OH, WELL, THAT'S
VERY GOOD NEWS.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:14.360
IS IT GOOD, OR IS ALL
OF IT MAD, REALLY?

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.630
MAD? IT'S A STROKE
OF GENIUS.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.260
GENIUS?

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.560
I THINK SO, YES.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.260
WHAT ARE YOU
GAWPING AT?

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:42.930
WHY DIDN'T YOU RING ME
AND TELL ME ABOUT IT?

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:45.460
SHE WANTED TO
SEE YOUR FACE.

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.460
NO, I JUST COULDN'T
BE BOTHERED.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.200
SO, WHAT'S HE LIKE?

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:56.530
ECCENTRIC,
OVERWHELMING.

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.400
HE TALKS TOO MUCH.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.130
HE HITS PEOPLE - WHEN
THEY GET IN HIS WAY.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.300
I THINK HE
SOUNDS DELIGHTFUL.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.960
YOU SHOULD MARRY
SOMEONE WITH A TITLE.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.530
IT'S ALL SO BORING.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.960
I SHOULD MARRY
SOMEONE WITH A TITLE.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.360
ISN'T IT ALL A
BIT SUDDEN?

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.160
YEAH.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.500
I THINK IT'S ALL
VERY ROMANTIC.

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.130
AND HE JUST ASKED
YOU TO MARRY HIM?

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.460
YEAH.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:25.860
JUST LIKE THAT?

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:27.600
YEAH.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.400
AND DO YOU TRUST HIM?

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.660
OF COURSE SHE DOES!

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:40.460
WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD
OPEN SOME CHAMPAGNE!

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.300
GOOD IDEA, DARLING.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.160
WHEN ARE WE
GOING TO MEET HIM?

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.630
AT THE WEDDING
I SUPPOSE.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.800
WELL, THERE YOU GO.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.330
50 QUID, FAIR
AND SQUARE.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:26.200
I TAKE MY HAT OFF TO YOU,
YOU SAD IDIOT.

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.500
I NEVER THOUGHT
YOU'D SEE IT THROUGH.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:32.030
I CAN'T DO IT.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:35.800
OKAY...

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:43.400
OKAY. OH GOD!

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.860
RIGHT, UM...

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.430
BETTER THAT YOU
SHOULD SAY IT NOW.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:50.860
HONESTLY, I DON'T
THINK YOU REALIZE

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.100
WHAT YOU'D BE LETTING
YOURSELF IN FOR.

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.160
IF EVER THERE WAS A FACE THAT
COULD TURN MILK SOUR...

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:03.100
I MEAN NOT DRESSED
LIKE THIS.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.000
OH!

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.030
SO...?

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:20.000
NO. YOU CAN'T.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.230
IT'S YOUR
WEDDING DAY!

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.030
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
NOT EVEN TO HER!

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:29.500
ESPECIALLY NOT TO HER!
SHE'S A POLITICIAN.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.260
SHE'S ALMOST THE LEADER OF
THE OPPOSITION FOR GOD'S SAKE!

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.460
I'M NOT GONNA
LIE TO HER.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:39.300
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS WOMAN.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.300
I AM.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:47.560
I AM, AND THERE'S THINGS ABOUT
ME SHE NEEDS TO KNOW.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:05.800
(PHONE RINGING)

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.930
HANG ON, DARLING.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.060
HANG ON.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.960
WHERE THE HELL
ON EARTH IS HE?

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.860
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
ASSUME HE'S NOT COMING.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.660
QUARTER
PAST 11:00.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:30.830
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
ASSUME THE WORST.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.560
HE COULD HAVE
HAD AN ACCIDENT.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.030
ANY NUMBER OF THINGS
COULD HAVE HAPPENED.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.130
OH, HELL!

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:38.700
CALM DOWN.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.930
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:42.930
I THOUGHT IT WAS
ALL VERY ODD.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.300
WHAT?

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.400
YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN
HIM FIVE MINUTES

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.230
WHY GET MARRIED?
WHY NOT JUST...?

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.900
KATHERINE!

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.860
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE ONLY A BRIDESMAID!

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.230
KATHERINE!

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:57.660
HE'S PROBABLY
NOT WORTH IT!

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:00.330
(PHONE RINGING)

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.060
YES?

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.030
HE'S HERE,
HE'S COMING!

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.230
TURN AROUND.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.030
QUICKLY...

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:10.030
NOW!

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:23.660
♪

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.130
OH, MY GOD.

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:27.930
I'M SORRY.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.760
I KNOW YOU WANT TO KILL ME BUT
TRAFFIC WAS ALL SNARLED UP

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:37.700
AND WE WERE STUCK
THERE FOR AGES... SORRY.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:42.800
AND THIS BLOKE LENT US HIS
MOPED - WHICH WAS LUCKY.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.260
IT'S TRUE.

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.000
AND NOW I'M HERE.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.060
IS THAT HIM?

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.930
OKAY.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.600
COME ON, KATE.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.860
LET'S GET MARRIED.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.530
YOU'RE DRESSED
LIKE A WOMAN.

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.100
YES, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.600
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE
- NOT FOR ME -

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.730
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
ONE FOR YOU EITHER.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.660
I'M NOT A POOF, A
COMMON MISCONCEPTION.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.660
IT'S JUST ONCE IN A WHILE
I LIKE TO PUT ON A SKIRT

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.900
AND WEAR MAKEUP.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.830
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING,
HAVEN'T YOU?

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:29.200
I HAVE HAD THE ODD SHERBET OR
TWO TO STEADY THE OLD NERVES

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.600
AND WE WOULD HAVE PHONED
TO TELL YOU WHERE WE WERE

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:37.230
BUT HARRY, HIS BLOODY MOBILE
IS FLAT AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:42.930
YOU'VE TURNED UP LATE AND
YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE A TART!

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:46.360
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE
MENTIONED IT BEFORE,

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.660
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT.
IT'S NOT EASY.

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.160
PEOPLE TEND TO
LAUGH... OR CRY.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.830
IT'S A STUPID DARE.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.960
SOME BET WITH THAT HALF-WIT
TOSSER YOU HANG ABOUT WITH.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:59.830
IT'S ACTUALLY
NOT A DARE.

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:02.400
YES, IT IS, TO
HUMILIATE ME.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.960
KATE... KATE..

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.000
YOU'VE SCREWED UP
BIG TIME, BUSTER.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.730
I WANT YOU TO LET
GO OF MY ARM.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.130
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
EMBARRASS ME...

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.330
ME EMBARRASS YOU!?

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:15.900
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.800
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?!

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.530
JUST ASKING.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:22.460
NO, I'M SORRY. I'M NOT
GOING THROUGH WITH THIS.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.230
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
MAKE A FOOL OUT OF ME.

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.830
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE A
FOOL OUT OF ME, YOU MEAN.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.330
I THINK YOU'RE DOING A
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF THAT

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.200
ALL BY YOURSELF.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.800
THAT'S UNKIND.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.960
THIS ISN'T HAPPENING.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:40.130
I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE
HAD A DRINK. IT'S A FAIR POINT,

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.300
BUT I WAS SCARED THAT
YOU MIGHT NOT TURN UP.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.500
YOU WERE SCARED I
WOULDN'T TURN UP?

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.830
IF YOU WALK AWAY NOW IT'S
GONNA LOOK REALLY BAD.

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.560
NOT FOR ME NECESSARILY
BUT FOR YOU.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.000
THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE
LITTLE VOTERS OUT THERE.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.460
WHEN THE TABLOIDS FIND
OUT THAT YOU WALKED OUT

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:00.100
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY "SHE
DOESN'T KNOW HER OWN MIND.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:03.460
SHE CAN'T MAKE A DECISION. SHE
WANTS TO RULE THE COUNTRY?"

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:10.000
I'M MARRYING A MAN WHO - UGH,
THAT'S A GOOD DECISION, IS IT?

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.730
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE A POTENTIAL LEADER, IS IT?

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:17.060
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO, MY
LOVE, MY DOVE, IS PUT ON A VERY

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.800
BIG SMILE AND ACT LIKE
ALL THIS WAS DELIBERATE

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:26.130
AND PLANNED AND WE'LL CHEW THE
FAT ABOUT IT LATER, ALRIGHT?

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.060
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?!

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.360
DEARLY BELOVED...

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.260
WE KNOW ALL THAT; JUST
CUT TO THE VOWS.

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.500
THE VOWS!

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.160
WE HAVEN'T
GOT ALL DAY.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.600
OUR PLANE LEAVES IN
LESS THAN AN HOUR.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.630
ALL THIS FUSS BECAUSE
I WAS 15 MINUTES LATE.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.130
YOU'RE DRESSED LIKE
A CHRISTMAS TREE.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.400
OH, COME ON, IT'S ME YOU'RE
MARRYING, NOT MY...

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.830
WHAT PLANE?

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.400
THE PLANE PLANE.

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.360
I CALL UPON THEE... NO.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:57.700
FIRST, IF THERE'S ANYONE HERE
PRESENT KNOW ANY REASONS

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:03.000
WHY THESE HERE PERSONS MAY
NOT BE LAWFULLY MARRIED...

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.900
NO. GOOD, NEXT.

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.130
WE ARE NOT FLYING
OUT UNTIL TOMORROW.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.760
OH GOD, NO. I MADE A
MISTAKE WITH THE TICKETS.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.060
IT'S NOT TOMORROW IT'S TODAY AND
CHECK IN'S IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.360
THE VOWS YOU'RE ABOUT TO TAKE
ARE TO BE MADE IN THE NAME OF

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.400
GOD WHO IS THE JUDGE OF ALL
THE SECRETS OF OUR HEARTS.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.760
THEREFORE IF EITHER OF YOU
KNOW A REASON WHY YOU MAY

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.300
NOT BE LAWFULLY MARRIED
YOU MUST DECLARE IT NOW.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.330
I HAVEN'T GOT MY
THINGS, I CAN'T GO.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.700
HARRY SENT THE CAR AROUND
TO PICK UP YOUR CLOTHES

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.660
AND YOUR
PASSPORT, SO...

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.860
WILL YOU TAKE KATHERINE MINOLA
TO BE YOUR LAWFUL WEDDED WIFE?

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.360
YEAH, YEAH.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.760
WHAT ABOUT THE
RECEPTION?

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.700
WE CAN'T NOT BE AT
OUR OWN RECEPTION.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:43.630
THEY'LL CELEBRATE WITHOUT US,
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, DARLING.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.900
WILL YOU LOVE HER, COMFORT
HER, HONOR AND PROTECT HER,

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.260
AND FORSAKING ALL
OTHERS BE FAITHFUL TO HER

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.130
AS LONG AS YOU
BOTH SHALL LIVE?

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.630
WHAT? YUP.

00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:53.230
NO, IT'S "I WILL".

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.160
I WILL!!

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:02.400

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.260
...TO BE YOUR LAWFUL
WEDDED HUSBAND.

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.660

GULLET AND INTO HIS CHEST CAVITY

OPPORTUNITY?

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:21.960
OH, YES, I WILL.

WHERE'S THE HONEYMOON,
KATHERINE?

BIG SMILE, PLEASE.

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.730
MY WIFE AND I MUST
MAKE TRACKS.

BIG SMILE, EVERYONE.

YOUR KATE
GETTING MARRIED.

HE ISN'T ACTUALLY

BORDERLINE, IT'S
DIFFICULT TO TELL.

STILL, THEY'RE
WELL MATCHED.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.200

WHEN YOUR KATE GOT MARRIED

YOU'D MARRY ME?

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.260
HARRY, I DIDN'T SAY
THAT EXACTLY.

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.300

SHOULD NEVER TAKE

ANYTHING I
SAY SERIOUSLY.

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:38.800
I COULDN'T MARRY YOU ANYWAY,
NOT EVEN IF YOU WERE

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.200
STUDDED IN DIAMONDS
AND DIPPED IN CHOCOLATE.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.100
I'M ENGAGED...

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:04.260
I THINK THAT ALL WENT
RATHER WELL, NO?

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:10.460
YOU CAN'T NOT SPEAK TO ME
FOR THE NEXT 40 YEARS, KATE.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.100
IT'S JUST
NOT FEASIBLE.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.760
OH, YOU THINK IT'S GOING
TO LAST THAT LONG?

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:27.560
I DID TRY TO PUT A SUIT ON,
KATE. I JUST FELT ODD IN IT.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:34.400
DON'T SPEAK TO ME.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:38.660
IF I'D HAVE TURNED UP ON TIME
YOU'D HAVE SEEN THE FUNNY SIDE.

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:41.160
YOU WOULD.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.200
WE CAN'T FALL OUT BECAUSE
OF BAD TIMING, KATE.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:52.430
IF I'D SHOWN UP PISSED,
LET ALONE DRESSED LIKE

A MONKEY'S ASS, WOULD YOU
HAVE SEEN THE FUNNY SIDE?

00:47:57.530 --> 00:48:00.260
I HAD A CAREER
UNTIL TODAY.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.900
ALL MY LIFE, EVERYTHING
I'VE EVER DONE,

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:06.460
EVERYTHING I'VE TRIED TO ACHIEVE
YOU JUST SWEPT IT ALL AWAY!

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:08.730
I'VE BECOME ONE OF THOSE SAD
FOOLS WHO GETS REMEMBERED

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.930
FOR THE WRONG REASONS.
"OH, YES, KATHERINE MINOLA,

00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:15.660
SHE WAS PICKED FOR THE TOP
UNTIL SHE MARRIED THAT FREAK!"

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.660
AND THE FUNNY BIT IS SHE ONLY
MARRIED HIM BECAUSE SHE WAS

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.160
STUPID ENOUGH TO BE
FLATTERED BY HIS PATHETIC

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.360
HALF-ASSED DECLARATIONS
OF LOVE, AND THEN

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:31.530
IT WAS ONLY FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE THEY GOT DIVORCED.

00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:36.500
WE'RE GOING ON OUR HONEYMOON,
FOR GOD'S SAKE, WOMAN,

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.930
TO HAVE WILD, ATHLETIC
SEX 15 TIMES A NIGHT.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:45.600
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE
TALK ABOUT DIVORCE, KATE.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.460
I REALLY WOULD PREFER IT IF YOU
DIDN'T SPEAK TO ME ACTUALLY.

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.430
THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO, MY
LOVE, IS TO JUST LOOK FORWARD TO

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:58.660
A LONG AND INTERESTING MARRIAGE
WITH A MAN THAT'LL...

00:48:58.660 --> 00:49:01.730
THE ONLY REASON I'M
GOING TO ITALY IS BECAUSE

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:04.030
I'VE PAID FOR IT. AS
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.860
THIS MARRIAGE IS OVER.
IT NEVER STARTED.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.760
YOU'RE NOT
MY HUSBAND!

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.100
AND AS SOON AS I CAN FIND
A DECENT, RESPECTABLE,

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.960
UNOBTRUSIVE WAY
OUT OF IT, I SHALL!

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.460
FOREPLAY.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.660
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER! THIS
MAN IS HARASSING ME.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:17.660
IF YOU PUT HIM NEXT
TO ME ON THE PLANE

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:20.860
I SHALL SEE TO IT
THAT YOU GET SACKED.

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:23.860
AREN'T YOU STANDING
FOR THE LEADERSHIP?

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:26.500
NO.

00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.530
NO...

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.730
YOU DO REALIZE THAT I'VE
GOT ALL THE DOCUMENTS

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:16.430
FOR THE CAR
AND THE VILLA?

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:22.460
WHICH I PAID FOR, SO I
SUGGEST YOU HAND IT OVER

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:28.860
AND DISAPPEAR IN A PUFF OF SMOKE
UP YOUR OWN BACKSIDE - FAST!

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.860

LITTLE LADY WANT?

BUCKET OF
CYANIDE.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.930
DO YOU HAVE
A TELEPHONE?

I WANT YOU TO TELL
THE COMMITTEE.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.500
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:30.000
JUST DO IT. I'LL
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:28.300
THERE'S NO PHONE.

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.460
MY MOBILE, IT'S IN THE CAR.

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.330
NO, IT ISN'T.

00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:35.500
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DRIVE TO THE VILLAGE.

00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:37.830
WITH THE AMOUNT
I'VE HAD TO DRINK?

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:39.500
YOU'LL HAVE TO
WALK THERE THEN.

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.300
IN THESE HEELS?

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.430
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH
MY MOBILE, YOU MORON?

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:46.300
OKAY, FINE.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.600
I'LL WEAR SOME OF YOUR
CLOTHES - YOUR OTHER CLOTHES

00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.300
- AND THEN I WILL DRIVE
DOWN TO THE VILLAGE.

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.160
I COULDN'T POSSIBLY
LET YOU DO THAT.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.760
WHAT?

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.500
WEAR MY CLOTHES.

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.860
SEVERAL THOUSAND LEAGUES
BENEATH YOUR DIGNITY, SURELY.

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:02.760
OH, DON'T TALK CRAP.
JUST GO AND GET THEM.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.330
THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE
PROBLEM WITH THE CAR.

00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:06.900
WHAT?

00:57:06.900 --> 00:57:09.060
ALL THE TIRES ARE FLAT.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.230
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:17.000

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:41.460
IS THERE A FOOT
PUMP ANYWHERE?

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:46.100
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN, BUT
AS TO ITS WHEREABOUTS...

00:57:46.100 --> 00:57:48.830
YOU DO REALIZE THAT WE
HAVEN'T GOT ANY FOOD?

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:52.330
WHAT DO WE NEED FOOD FOR - WE
HAVE LOVE TO KEEP US GOING.

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:54.160
I'M GOING TO GO
AND LIE DOWN.

YOU INVITED YOUR FRIEND
ON OUR HONEYMOON -

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.530
NOT THAT IT'S ANY
KIND OF A HONEYMOON!

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:14.630
I'M GONNA GO LIE DOWN,

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:20.300

I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO KEEP AWAY FROM ME.

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:22.060
I'M TRYING TO SLEEP,
YOU MORON!

IT'LL HELP TO PASS THE TIME.

HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA KEEP THIS UP?

WHERE'S MY SUITCASE?

01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.900
IT'S IN PISA.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:01:06.930 --> 01:01:11.600
IT'S MY WEDDING NIGHT, I'M ALL
ALONE WITH MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE,

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.760
WHAT MIGHT I POSSIBLY
BE THINKING?

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.060
IF YOU TOUCH ME
I'LL SCREAM.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.060
PROMISE?

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:26.960
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
LONG I'VE WAITED FOR THIS.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.760
DON'T YOU DARE!

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.830
YOU'VE TEASED ME
LONG ENOUGH!

FINE! OKAY, GET
ON WITH IT THEN!

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:38.100
I'VE LONGED FOR THIS MOMENT
SINCE THE FIRST TIME

01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:39.730
I CLAPPED EYES
ON YOU.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:41.530
FINE! DO IT!

01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:43.500
I'M GOING TO!

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.060
DO IT THEN!

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.530
ARE YOU READY?

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:54.930
WHEN YOU ARE.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.800
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:01:59.960
WHAT?

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.600
I CAN'T DO IT.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.030
CAN'T YOU?

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:05.260
NOT EVEN IF YOU BEG. YOU
CAN GET DOWN ON YOUR

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.630
HANDS AND KNEES AND
GROVEL BUT IT'S NO GOOD.

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.900
FORGET IT. I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE SEX WITH YOU

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:12.260
UNTIL YOU SAY
SOMETHING NICE TO ME.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:15.700
SAY SOMETHING
NICE TO ME?

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.960
RIGHT. FINE,
FORGET IT.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.330
THIS THING, YOU NOTICE
AFTER A WHILE THIS PATTERN

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:49.630
YOU START TO SEE AND IT'S LIKE
TIME AFTER TIME, WITH WOMEN,

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:56.560
I CAN SEE THEIR INNER BEAUTY
BUT THEY NEVER SEE MINE, EVER.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.060
THEY DON'T EVEN
SPOT A GLIMPSE OF IT.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:01.560
THEY'RE NOT
EVEN LOOKING.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.630
WITH SOMEONE LIKE BIANCA,
YOU KNOW, SHE'S GORGEOUS

01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:10.660
AND SHE GETS EVERYTHING AND
I'M JUST A BIT BLOODY ORDINARY

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.460
AND I GET NOTHING.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.500
I'M STILL ALWAYS ON THE
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:25.300
AND SHE'S JUST IN THERE - BEING,
DOING ANYTHING SHE WANTS

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:28.860
WITH ANYONE
SHE WANTS TO.

01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:05.630
I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT
NOBODY KNOWS HER LIKE I DO.

01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:09.330
NOBODY'S RIGHT
FOR HER LIKE I AM.

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:14.760
NOBODY CAN GIVE
HER MORE THAN I CAN.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.130
AM I DELUDING
MYSELF?

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:29.460
ARE YOU NOT
EATING THAT?

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:35.160
SO, PLAN B - I MIGHT
MARRY A RICH WIDOW.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.400
YOU KNOW ANY?

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.330
I'M COMPILING A LIST.

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.300
KATE!

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:44.460
HARRY'S BROUGHT US BREAD,
CHEESE, WINE, OLIVES.

01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:47.100
ALL DIFFERENT
KINDS OF MEAT.

01:04:47.100 --> 01:04:49.800
OH, WELL, YOU
WOULDN'T HAVE LIKED IT.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.600
THE OTHER GOOD NEWS IS HARRY'S
BROUGHT YOUR SUITCASE

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.000
ALL THE WAY FROM PISA.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.260
HAVE I?

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.760
I'LL GO AND HAVE
A LOOK FOR IT.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.060
NO, NO, NOTHING'S
TOO MUCH TROUBLE.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.560
NOT FOR YOU, MY LOVE.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:03.300
TALK TO OUR FRIEND.
ENTERTAIN HIM.

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:05.160
TELL HIM SOME OF
YOUR DIRTY JOKES.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.200
TRY NOT TO LAUGH
TOO LOUD, HARRY.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:09.630
DON'T DISTURB THE
BATS AND THE WOLVES.

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:25.100
CAN I HAVE ONE OF
YOUR CIGARETTES?

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.330
YEAH!

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:44.260
IT WAS GENUINE, YOU KNOW,
YESTERDAY MORNING,

01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:46.500
THE REASON WE
WERE LATE.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.760
AND HE GOT DRUNK
BECAUSE... I DON'T KNOW.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.230
HE WAS FRIGHTENED.

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:54.030
OF WHAT?

01:05:54.030 --> 01:05:57.030
WHATEVER IT IS THAT PEOPLE
GET FRIGHTENED ABOUT

01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:00.100
ON THEIR WEDDING DAY.

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:04.030
YOU SEE, WHAT YOU HAVEN'T
GRASPED YET ABOUT HIM

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:09.230
IS THAT UNDERNEATH IT ALL
HE'S JUST AN UNSTABLE,

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.330
UNBALANCED
EXHIBITIONIST

01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:17.360
WHO NEEDS SOMEONE TO
THINK THE WORLD OF HIM.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:20.700
I THINK I'VE
GRASPED THAT NOW.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.960
WHAT ABOUT
THE CLOTHES?

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.900
HE HAS THESE
TENDENCIES.

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:35.400
BUT WHY NOT TALK TO ME
ABOUT IT BEFORE? OR AFTER?

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:40.460
JUST NOT THERE, ON THE DAY,
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.160
HE DIDN'T WANT
TO LIE TO YOU.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.400
I KNOW THE
TIMING WAS CRAP.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:54.200
BUT MAYBE HE WAS WORRIED THAT
IF HE DID EVERYTHING PROPERLY

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.960
YOU MIGHT MISTAKE HIM
FOR ONE OF THE GROWNUPS.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:06.500
BECAUSE HE ISN'T ONE.
AND HE NEVER WILL BE.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:11.460
HE'S PROBABLY NO MORE THAN
ABOUT SIX I SHOULD THINK.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.430
BLESS HIM.

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:22.160
BUT HE DOES THINK THE WORLD OF
YOU IN HIS OWN STRANGE WAY.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.000
MY CAREER'S RUINED.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.860
WHAT MAKES
YOU SAY THAT?

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.160
COME ON.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.800
WHAT?

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:34.860
LOOK, IF YOU'RE AS BIG A FISH
AS EVERYBODY RECKONS YOU ARE,

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:38.800
YOU BEING MARRIED TO AN
ECCENTRIC ARISTOCRAT'S

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.860
HARDLY GONNA THROW A SPANNER
IN THE WORKS, IS IT?

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:45.430
NOT IN YOUR
PARTY ANYWAY.

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:47.660
WHY DID YOU
MARRY HIM?

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:50.730
BECAUSE IT'D
LOOK GOOD?

01:07:50.730 --> 01:07:55.400
OR DO YOU ACTUALLY
LOVE HIM?

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:06.400
THEN IS YOUR CAREER REALLY
MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT?

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:13.500
WELL...

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.830
YES, OF
COURSE IT IS.

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.330
OH.

01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.460
OKAY.

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:24.130
IS IT?

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:29.230
NO.

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:31.060
HERE YOU ARE, KATE...

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:34.260
ALL THE WAY FROM PISA.

01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:42.700
HE'S GONNA THROW IT ALL IN THE
SWIMMING POOL, ISN'T HE?

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:45.960
HE'S GONNA TAUNT ME WITH A
WEEK'S WORTH OF CLEAN KNICKERS

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.060
AND THEN TOSS IT ALL
INTO THE POOL.

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.900
I WOULD IMAGINE
THAT'S... YEAH.

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:55.330
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, KATE,
IS BE NICE TO ME

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:58.430
UNRESERVEDLY,
WITHOUT SARCASM,

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:03.560
AND YOU HAVE LESS THAN
TEN SECONDS TO DO IT.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.200
NINE...

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.000
EIGHT...

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.400
SEVEN...

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.130
SIX...

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:15.530

I DON'T WEAR
KNICKERS ANYWAY.

HOW BRIGHTLY
SHINES THE MOON.

CONTRADICT ME.

YOU SHOULDN'T
TALK BOLLOCKS.

01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.300
WHY? BECAUSE
YOU WON'T LIKE IT?

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.830
I'D LIKE AN APOLOGY
FOR ALL THE NONSENSE

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:05.130
YOU'VE SUBJECTED ME TO
SINCE WE GOT HERE.

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.460
ME APOLOGIZE?

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:12.600
AND IF I SAY THAT'S THE
MOON IT'S THE MOON. OKAY?

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.330
HOW DO YOU WORK
THAT OUT, THEN?

01:12:15.330 --> 01:12:18.130
YOU'RE MY WIFE, YOU AGREE
WITH EVERYTHING I SAY.

01:12:18.130 --> 01:12:22.330
DO I? EVEN WHEN
YOU'RE WRONG?

01:12:22.330 --> 01:12:24.500
ESPECIALLY THEN.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.160
I NEVER AM WRONG SO IT'S
NOT REALLY AN ISSUE.

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:33.860
GOOD. I'M GLAD YOU THINK
YOU'VE SORTED THAT OUT.

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:38.360
AND WE'LL HAVE NO MORE
TALK OF DIVORCE EITHER.

01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:44.930
IS THAT ABSOLUTELY
CLEAR, KATE?

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:49.800

I'M GONNA MAKE
YOU BREAKFAST.

YOU KNOW, THAT WAS...

01:13:05.730 --> 01:13:08.860
I HAVE TO SAY...

WAS REALLY...

YOU'RE NOT?

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.530
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE
OF YOU TO ASK

01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:40.630
AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT
YOU FEEL THE NEED TO.

01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:44.060
I'M GONNA MAKE
SOME BREAKFAST.

01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:06.260
WEDDINGS ARE SUCH A GOOD EXCUSE
TO HAVE FUN AND SPEND MONEY.

IT MUCH MORE OFTEN.

KNOWS AS WELL AS I DO THAT

LANGUAGE OF THAT KIND WILL
NOT BE TOLERATED IN THE HOUSE

01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:51.560

WITHDRAWS THE STATEMENT.

WHITE WITHIN HER CHEEKS.

HE'S LET HIMSELF IN FOR?

ARE YOU TRYING TO IMPLY
SOMETHING ABOUT MY MOTHER?

THAT HARRY'S CAUGHT UP WITH?

SOMETHING ABOUT MY BEST FRIEND?

ABOUT YOUR BEST FRIEND.

STINKS OF VENOM.

NO SMELL.

YOU TELL ME. YOU'RE
THE ONE WHO'S FOREVER

SLAGGING HER OFF.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.000
HE ISN'T YOUR BEST
FRIEND, BY THE WAY.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.130

YOU'RE A JERK.

YES. YES, WE'LL BE WITH
YOU IN 15 MINUTES.

THIS IS THE 21ST CENTURY, PAL,
AND IT'S TIME YOU GOT ON BOARD

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:55.530

AROUND WITH ME!

(TRANSLATOR)

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.660
IT'S A WISE PRECAUTION SIGNING
A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT.

IT'S NOT, IT STINKS.

WITH ME, HARRY?

TO MEET YOUR NEW BLOKE.

YEAH, I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
MEET YOUR NEW WOMAN.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.900
YOU HAVE.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:24.160
WE DRANK CHAMPAGNE
TOGETHER ONE EVENING

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.530
AND REALIZED WE'D ALWAYS HAD
A THING ABOUT ONE ANOTHER.

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:32.160
BUT YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH TO
BE HIS MOTHER, MOTHER.

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.860
HARDLY.

01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.660

YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL. SHE'LL
HAVE YOU SIGNING A PRENUP NEXT.

I DON'T THINK SO.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.130
I THINK IT'S A
WISE PRECAUTION.

01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:53.260
IT ASSUMES THINGS ARE
GONNA GO WRONG.

01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.700
IT DOESN'T!

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.530
IT'S UNNECESSARY
THEN.

01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.460
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.230
IT ASSUMES THINGS MAY GO WRONG
WHICH IS A VERY DIFFERENT THING.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:03.060
WE LIVE IN AN AGE
OF DIVORCE.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.100
IT'S FOOLISH TO IGNORE
THE STATISTICS.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.630
SHE'S A VERY
RICH WOMAN.

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:11.430
LOOK, JUST GET MARRIED
OR DON'T GET MARRIED.

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:13.660
KEEP IT SIMPLE, EH?

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.800
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, KATHERINE?

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:18.900
DID YOU SIGN A PRENUPTIAL
AGREEMENT?

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:22.660
NO. IT DIDN'T
OCCUR TO ME TO.

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.100
WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:27.330
KATHERINE, SERIOUSLY...

01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:30.200
IS IT SO WRONG IN THIS DAY AND
AGE FOR A SUCCESSFUL WOMAN -

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.160
ANY WOMAN - TO TRY AND
PROTECT HERSELF BY ASKING

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:37.630
THE MAN SHE MARRIES TO SIGN
A LITTLE LEGAL DOCUMENT?

01:20:37.630 --> 01:20:40.960
OF COURSE IT ISN'T WRONG,
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT!

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:43.900
IT ISN'T, IS IT,
KATHERINE?

01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:49.700
IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE AND
OBVIOUS AND SENSIBLE AND FAIR.

01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.360
ISN'T IT?

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:54.900
I THINK YOU SHOULD FROWN
LESS TO BEGIN WITH,

01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:56.900
OTHERWISE
YOU'LL PUT HIM OFF.

01:20:56.900 --> 01:20:59.760
THAT'S PRICELESS
COMING FROM YOU.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.530
I THINK THAT YOUR HUSBAND
IS YOUR LORD AND YOUR LIFE

01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:05.600
AND YOUR KEEPER.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.660
EXCUSE ME?

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:08.230
HE'S THE BOSS.

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.400
DAY IN, DAY OUT HE SUBMITS
HIS BODY TO PAINFUL LABOR.

01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.100
UH, NO HE DOESN'T.

01:21:13.100 --> 01:21:15.200
AND ALL WE DO IS SIT AT HOME IN
FRONT OF THE TELLY ALL DAY

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.030
EATING CHOCOLATES.

01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:19.530
I KNOW I DO, WHEN I'M NOT
RUNNING THE COUNTRY.

01:21:19.530 --> 01:21:21.500
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.030
I'VE BEEN LIKE YOU -
ARGUMENTATIVE, OBNOXIOUS,

01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:28.160
BAD-TEMPERED - AND WHAT
GOOD DID IT DO ME? HEY?

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.400
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO
WHATEVER HE TELLS YOU TO DO

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.730
WHENEVER HE
TELLS YOU TO DO IT.

01:21:33.730 --> 01:21:38.230
I MEAN, GOOD LORD. HOW COULD
WE EVER BE EQUAL TO THEM?

01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:42.460
THEY'RE BIG, NOISY,
AND OPINIONATED

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:46.960
AND WE'RE LITTLE AND
NOISY AND OPINIONATED.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.660
IT'S SO OBVIOUS I'M SURPRISED
I'M HAVING TO SPELL IT OUT.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:53.730
YEAH. HOWEVER, BACK
IN THE REAL WORLD...

01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:56.300
BACK IN THE REAL WORLD I
THINK YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED

01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.700
TO PLACE YOUR HANDS BELOW
YOUR HUSBAND'S FEET

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.000
IN TOKEN OF
YOUR DUTY TO HIM

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.230
AND NOT ASK HIM TO SIGN ANY
BLOODY SILLY AGREEMENTS.

01:22:03.230 --> 01:22:05.130
IF YOU DON'T FEEL
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT

01:22:05.130 --> 01:22:07.400
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T BE
MARRYING HIM, FRANKLY.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:12.000
GO ON, THEN. YOU DO IT. PLACE
YOUR HANDS BENEATH HIS...

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.930
I WOULD. IF HE
ASKED ME TO.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.700
BUT HE WON'T ASK ME
TO BECAUSE HE FEELS

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.560
EXACTLY THE SAME WAY ABOUT
ME AND HE WOULDN'T EXPECT

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.660
ANYTHING FROM ME THAT I
WOULDN'T EXPECT FROM HIM.

01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:25.960
WOULD YOU?

01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.460
YUP.

01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:28.600
NO.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:31.260
PROBABLY NOT.

01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:35.600
SO, NO. WE DIDN'T DO A
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT.

01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:53.830
DO YOU REALLY NOT REGRET
SIGNING THE POSTNATAL THINGIE?

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:55.430
NO.

01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:58.200
BESIDES WHICH THEY'RE NOT WORTH
THE PAPER THEY'RE WRITTEN ON.

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:00.700
THE JUDICIARY DID TRY
TO PERSUADE GOVERNMENT

01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.760
TO PASS SOME LEGISLATION
TO MAKE THEM MORE BINDING

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.030
BUT THEY'VE GOT BETTER
THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:07.900
BUT IF THEY WERE MORE
BINDING, WOULD YOU?

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:13.000
NO... NO.

01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:20.960
OH, YES. I SHOULD
HAVE SAID EARLIER...

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.960
I'M PREGNANT.

01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.230
WHAT?

01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:25.660
YES.

01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:27.460
OH, THAT'S AMAZING!

01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.700
HOWEVER, YOU'LL HAVE
TO LOOK AFTER THEM

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.500
BECAUSE I'M NOT
GIVING UP MY CAREER.

01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:32.800
THAT'S FINE.

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:34.400
I'M NOT CONVINCED.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.800
YOU'LL FEED THEM ALL CHICKEN
AND THROW THEM IN A POND

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.960
TO SEE IF THEY FLOAT OR LEAVE
THEM ON A BUS SOMEWHERE.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.360
MY GOD, I'M GONNA SHAG
YOU RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:42.160
GO ON.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.160
I WILL.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.700
I DARE YOU.

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:46.000
THEM?

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:49.030
IT'S TRIPLETS.
