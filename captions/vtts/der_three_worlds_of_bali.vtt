00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:15.215
<v Narrator>Major funding for Odyssey</v>

2
00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:20.019
was provided by the National
Endowment for the Humanities.

3
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.422
Additional funding was provided by

4
00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.459
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,

5
00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.862
and the Polaroid Corporation.

6
00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:33.500
(triumphant music)

7
00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:53.219
(bell music)

8
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.809
(chanting in foreign language)

9
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.648
<v ->This is a Balinese performance,</v>

10
00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:25.819
portraying the invisible
forces of nature at work.

11
00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.490
These are the shadows of those forces,

12
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.725
shadows of gods and demons.

13
00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:37.597
Gods who embody growth
inhabit the other world,

14
00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:42.502
the demonic forces of decay
dwell in the world below.

15
00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:44.370
In the middle world, where we humans live,

16
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.007
an equilibrium must be maintained,

17
00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.311
or all three worlds will come to an end.

18
00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.683
But guarding such a catastrophe,

19
00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.751
the Balinese must constantly keep

20
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.087
growth and decay in balance.

21
00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.858
The medium through which
they attempt to do this

22
00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:08.094
and the pomp which they
bottle their entire society,

23
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:09.162
is their art.

24
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.428
<v ->My name is Steve Lansing,</v>

25
00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:45.098
I'm an anthropologist, and for
most of my professional life

26
00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.833
I've been studying civilization

27
00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.569
on the island of Bali in Indonesia.

28
00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.305
What interested me about
Bali was the fact that it's

29
00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:54.541
probably the best example of a society

30
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.743
in which the arts play a major role

31
00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.913
in the lives of almost all the people.

32
00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.815
In thousands of temples around the island,

33
00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.218
poetry, theater, music, and the other arts

34
00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.953
are performed by ordinary people

35
00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.289
as offerings for the gods and demons.

36
00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.193
(speaking in foreign language)

37
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.240
Artistic performances
make the temples work,

38
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.076
and the temples make society work.

39
00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.254
<v Narrator>Usually social</v>
scientists view societies

40
00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:43.489
as created by economic forces,

41
00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.991
but Bali is different.

42
00:03:44.991 --> 00:03:47.894
Civilization began here
with Sandskrit poetry

43
00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.197
about a wondrous, mythical Indian world.

44
00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.316
Today, those same poems are chanted

45
00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:12.285
by Ida Dadboos Siyasa,

46
00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.587
who is learning to become a high priest

47
00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:16.322
by studying the ancient manuscripts

48
00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:18.157
of Hindu Buddhist philosophy,

49
00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:19.692
which is chiefly preserved in Bali

50
00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:24.530
by copying them onto the
leaves of the lontar palm.

51
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.268
2000 years ago, Bali was a tribal society,

52
00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.503
who liked chiefs.

53
00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:32.605
Then wandering priests brought books

54
00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.041
of Hindu Buddhist poetry from India,

55
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:37.143
like this epic, the Banyan.

56
00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:41.047
(chanting in foreign language)

57
00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.759
The Balinese use the classical Indian rule

58
00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.260
described in these poems as models

59
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.230
creating a new civilization.

60
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.265
They continually modify their own society

61
00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:02.435
until myths of the poetry became real.

62
00:05:25.224 --> 00:05:26.659
Today priests not the only people

63
00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.428
who read the lontar books.

64
00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:30.296
Through poetry clubs like this one,

65
00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.831
the ancient literature reaches

66
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:34.667
into the lives of nearly everyone.

67
00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.341
Since the poems are in a
language no longer spoken,

68
00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:43.710
every line is spontaneously translated

69
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.878
and its meaning discussed.

70
00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.183
Anyone can learn to read the lontars,

71
00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.920
but a high priest must
live their philosophy.

72
00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:47.874
(easy pipe music)

73
00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:52.111
To become a high priest, Ida Daboos

74
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.047
must symbolically perform his own funeral,

75
00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:58.084
and cut all ties to the ego.

76
00:06:58.084 --> 00:07:00.686
Only then can he serve society.

77
00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.025
1000 years ago,

78
00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:08.060
the holy men and women who
lived in this monastery,

79
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.396
carved like a cave into the hillside,

80
00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.331
followed the same path.

81
00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.836
Living apart from society,
they studied the lontars,

82
00:07:16.836 --> 00:07:19.505
became advisors to Bali's kings.

83
00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:25.344
Together, priests and kings ruled Bali

84
00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:27.280
until the 20th century.

85
00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.554
The center of the middle world was here,

86
00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:36.522
at the great palace of Klungkung.

87
00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:40.193
Today a Hall of Justice
is all that remains.

88
00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.095
The Kakord Mayan is the grandson

89
00:07:43.095 --> 00:07:45.598
of the last king of Klungkung.

90
00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:48.401
In the days of his grandfather,

91
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.137
Bali was peaceful and prosperous.

92
00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:58.144
Rice exports worth half a
million Dutch guilders a year.

93
00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:03.749
By 1906, Bali had become a temptation

94
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:07.820
the Dutch Colonial Empire
could no longer resist.

95
00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.831
The Kakord's father was
then a young prince.

96
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.143
On September 14, 1906 three battalions

97
00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.746
of infantry, calvary, and artillery

98
00:09:06.746 --> 00:09:08.915
under the command of General Van Tonningen

99
00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:11.083
landed on the beaches of South Bali,

100
00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:14.587
and advanced towards the palace at Badung.

101
00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:20.626
Bali was to become a part of
the Dutch Colonial Empire.

102
00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.797
As the army marched inland,

103
00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:28.868
they found the villages
deserted and in flames.

104
00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:31.737
Small groups of Balinese
armed with swords attacked

105
00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.906
and were quickly killed.

106
00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:37.043
(artillery exploding)

107
00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:39.111
Several days later, Dutch
arrived at the gates

108
00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.614
of the palace at Badung.

109
00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.951
Two batteries of cannons
fired upon Bali's warriors,

110
00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:45.785
and the royal family,

111
00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:49.388
who were armed only
with swords and lances.

112
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.258
Within an hour,

113
00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:56.495
Dutch soldiers were
looting the smoking ruins.

114
00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:59.665
Every Balinese in the palace was dead.

115
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:06.072
For two years the Balinese fought back.

116
00:10:06.072 --> 00:10:08.641
Princes and their courts chose death,

117
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.243
rather than surrender.

118
00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:13.312
Finally the Dutch attacked Klungkung,

119
00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:16.682
the last and greatest royal court.

120
00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:21.520
Though defeat was certain,
Klungkung would not surrender.

121
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.255
The king and his entire court,

122
00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.524
dressed in their most elegant garments,

123
00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:28.694
purposefully marched into the gunfire.

124
00:10:29.629 --> 00:10:34.166
Those who were not shot,
stabbed themselves on the spot.

125
00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:36.736
Women disdainfully hurled
jewels at their assassins,

126
00:10:36.736 --> 00:10:40.506
cheating their enemy of
any sense of victory.

127
00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:43.976
The Balinese called this the puputan,

128
00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:44.877
the finish.

129
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.319
Yet the destruction of the great courts

130
00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:56.722
was not the end of Balinese civilization.

131
00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:03.796
It's real foundation lay in the temples.

132
00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:06.065
Thousands of temples survived the battles,

133
00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:09.735
here the floral offerings
have never ceased.

134
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:14.373
The Dutch ruled Bali until World War II

135
00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:17.376
when the Japanese navy drove them out.

136
00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:18.477
The Balinese fought for independence,

137
00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:20.746
and in 1947 became a province

138
00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:23.182
of the new nation of Indonesia.

139
00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.686
(airplane engine roaring)

140
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.589
In 1969 a more subtle invasion began

141
00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.427
with building an international airport.

142
00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:38.364
A few thousand tourists
arrived the first year.

143
00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.167
By 1979, they were coming at the rate

144
00:11:41.167 --> 00:11:44.170
of 1/3 of a million per year.

145
00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.706
There are only two million Balinese.

146
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.974
With the tourists came the technology,

147
00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.110
and the ideas of the West.

148
00:11:52.011 --> 00:11:54.246
(speaking foreign language)

149
00:11:54.246 --> 00:11:56.916
Igusti Kallair, Balinese priest.

150
00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:00.352
(chanting)

151
00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:59.411
The coexistence of the ancient and modern

152
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:01.647
may be less trouble to the Balinese

153
00:13:01.647 --> 00:13:05.784
because their idea of time
is very different than ours.

154
00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:09.255
We think of time as
moving in a straight line,

155
00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.923
from past to future.

156
00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:16.295
The Balinese see time as
many repeating cycles.

157
00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:21.600
These cycles represent
the rhythms of growth

158
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.369
in the natural world.

159
00:13:25.204 --> 00:13:29.241
For instance, a flower
is on a short time cycle.

160
00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:32.611
A log is on a much longer cycle.

161
00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:36.282
While human beings are
somewhere in between.

162
00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.151
Time cycles are repeated endlessly,

163
00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.921
so the past is never really gone.

164
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.291
Balinese calendars don't
measure the passage of years,

165
00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:50.029
but mark the way of different
time cycles intersect.

166
00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:52.298
This is one of the simplest
Balinese calendars,

167
00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:54.300
containing only two cycles as well as

168
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.403
the gods and demons that affect them.

169
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:02.441
Each day has a special quality,
depending on where it falls.

170
00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:05.978
The only example we have on our calendar

171
00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:07.813
representing cycles is when

172
00:14:07.813 --> 00:14:11.317
Friday falls on the 13th day of the month.

173
00:14:14.486 --> 00:14:16.722
Along the top are the gods.

174
00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.761
At the bottom, demons.

175
00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:31.303
Reading down, the days
of the five day cycle.

176
00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:38.644
Reading across, a seven day cycle.

177
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.454
This is the day of Dupat,
the free floating head.

178
00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:53.993
The goddess Dura has power over this day.

179
00:14:53.993 --> 00:14:56.996
As well as the buffalo-headed demon.

180
00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.703
This is 35 day calendar,
there are hundreds of others.

181
00:15:04.703 --> 00:15:09.475
Some calendars keep track
of cycles of 10,000 years.

182
00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:12.978
(exuberant music playing)

183
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.611
The temples, like calendars,
help to keep track of cycles.

184
00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.747
Most of the time each temple is empty

185
00:15:48.747 --> 00:15:50.616
until the day when it begins a new cycle

186
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.018
by holding festival.

187
00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.353
It is these festivals that control

188
00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:57.022
the flow of life in the village.

189
00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:03.996
<v ->Balinese believe that every 420 days,</v>

190
00:16:03.996 --> 00:16:06.198
the gods of the village,

191
00:16:06.198 --> 00:16:08.934
who are actually ancestors
who have gone up to Heaven,

192
00:16:08.934 --> 00:16:11.070
return to the village for
a period of three days

193
00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.138
in order to be worshiped by the people.

194
00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.709
The gods come down and
fly into these shrines,

195
00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:17.609
one by one.

196
00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.546
The living villagers
then come to the temple

197
00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:24.717
only on that day, in order
to worship their ancestors.

198
00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:28.954
This incense is the stairway to the sky

199
00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:31.757
upon which the gods descend.

200
00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:33.258
The holy water, this is ordinarily water

201
00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:34.994
taken from a sacred spring.

202
00:16:34.994 --> 00:16:38.030
For an instant, the priest becomes Siva.

203
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:42.201
Actually becomes the god and
turns this ordinary water

204
00:16:42.201 --> 00:16:44.870
into the waters of life.

205
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.672
The gods come to be worshiped,

206
00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:50.142
through music, poetry, and
then offerings like these,

207
00:16:50.142 --> 00:16:51.577
glapor offerings.

208
00:16:52.544 --> 00:16:53.979
The arts of Bali.

209
00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.616
But the demons come, hoping to be satiated

210
00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:59.451
with blood sacrifices.

211
00:17:02.388 --> 00:17:05.524
This is the gate to the
inner sanctum of the temple,

212
00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.926
protected by a spirit or a demon wall.

213
00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:10.562
The gods and then worshipers
pass freely through that door.

214
00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.965
But demons only travel in straight lines,

215
00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:15.367
so if a demon tries to come through here,

216
00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.137
he bangs his head against
that wall and is frustrated.

217
00:17:18.137 --> 00:17:22.040
But the gods and worshipers
pass freely around the side

218
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.543
and then in the inner sanctum.

219
00:17:30.048 --> 00:17:32.050
<v Narrator>Most villages</v>
have dozens of temples,

220
00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.019
so preparations for temple festivals

221
00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.654
seem to be going on all the time

222
00:17:35.654 --> 00:17:37.423
in some corner of the village.

223
00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:40.426
For three days, each temple
becomes an outdoor theater.

224
00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:41.894
It's in these performances,

225
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:45.731
that the ancient myths are
acted out and truly come rule,

226
00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.834
gaining the power to shape people's lives.

227
00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:52.471
(speaking foreign language)

228
00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:25.170
The cycles of time draw
three worlds together,

229
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.506
and art brings them to life.

230
00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.144
In a temple festival it's possible

231
00:18:32.144 --> 00:18:35.581
to pass through into the other worlds.

232
00:18:35.581 --> 00:18:38.851
(lively music playing)

233
00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:12.784
Gambu was a classical drama
at least 900 years old.

234
00:19:13.919 --> 00:19:17.656
Here a demon prince
searches for his enemies.

235
00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:46.218
Every muscle is perfectly controlled,

236
00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:48.120
even the dancer's eyes.

237
00:19:55.894 --> 00:19:59.064
These festivals are the
heart of village life.

238
00:19:59.064 --> 00:20:00.766
For at least the last 800 years,

239
00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:03.368
the people in the village have
been gathering in this temple

240
00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:06.705
and here they meet their
ancestors, their gods,

241
00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:10.876
their demons, all the forces
that created the total village.

242
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.015
(shouting)

243
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.826
Here, clowns interpret the
classical Gambu performance.

244
00:20:27.826 --> 00:20:30.829
They are a purely Balinese invention,

245
00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:33.732
as trilinguists translating
the ancient stories,

246
00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.835
and making them come alive for the people.

247
00:20:36.835 --> 00:20:40.505
(speaking foreign language)

248
00:20:58.457 --> 00:21:02.027
A village girl, Umahi,
becomes a Gambu princess,

249
00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:04.796
forced to marry against her will.

250
00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:20.112
In the poem Suma Sutaka,

251
00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.547
it is said when a woman wishes to die,

252
00:21:22.547 --> 00:21:25.350
she asks the gods to return her beauty

253
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.020
to that of the martika.

254
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.523
The loveliness of her hair,
to the rain bearing clouds.

255
00:21:31.523 --> 00:21:33.592
And her tears to the dew drops

256
00:21:33.592 --> 00:21:37.162
suspended from the tip
of a blade of grass.

257
00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:45.237
(singing in foreign language)

258
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:21.440
The older women dance close to
the shrine of the ancestors.

259
00:22:23.108 --> 00:22:25.644
Death for the Balinese is only a moment

260
00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.146
in an endless cycle of rebirths,

261
00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:31.550
that will bring them back to the village.

262
00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:45.664
(chanting)

263
00:22:55.874 --> 00:22:58.243
At the climax of the festival,

264
00:22:58.243 --> 00:23:02.381
everyone and everything is
blessed with holy water.

265
00:23:06.084 --> 00:23:08.386
The Balinese call their
religion Agama Tirtha,

266
00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:10.055
holy water religion.

267
00:23:14.393 --> 00:23:16.628
For them, water is the source of life,

268
00:23:16.628 --> 00:23:19.631
and water comes from the underworld.

269
00:23:30.509 --> 00:23:32.277
In a crater lake at the
center of the island,

270
00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:34.646
the temple Ulun Danu marks the spot

271
00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:36.014
where the waters of the underworld

272
00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:38.416
emerge into the middle world.

273
00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:42.521
Far below this crater lake,

274
00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:46.191
two great snakes lie
cold in the dark ocean.

275
00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:49.227
It is the thrashing of their bodies

276
00:23:49.227 --> 00:23:53.231
that forces the waters
of life up into the lake.

277
00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:00.672
This master temple
where the waters emerge,

278
00:24:00.672 --> 00:24:03.074
stands as a hub of a network of temples

279
00:24:03.074 --> 00:24:04.409
that organized the flow of water

280
00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:06.812
to the rice terraces of Bali.

281
00:24:14.319 --> 00:24:15.720
All along the irrigation canals,

282
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.690
there a temples like Ulun Danu.

283
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.694
Each one's responsible
for the fields around it.

284
00:24:27.632 --> 00:24:30.335
In tropical Bali, there are no seasons.

285
00:24:30.335 --> 00:24:32.838
Temples mark the flow of time.

286
00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:37.442
Every temple has its
own cycle of festivals,

287
00:24:37.442 --> 00:24:39.544
and it is these festivals
that tell the farmer

288
00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.246
when to plant and harvest,

289
00:24:41.246 --> 00:24:44.249
and when the fields must be flooded.

290
00:24:54.993 --> 00:24:56.761
Using this ancient and intricate system,

291
00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:59.097
there are fields in Bali
that have been producing

292
00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:02.334
two crops of rice a year for centuries.

293
00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:17.115
The temples make this system work,

294
00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:19.150
because they do something unique.

295
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.853
With their carefully worked
out schedule of festivals,

296
00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:26.024
they stagger the use of
Bali's limited water supply.

297
00:25:30.195 --> 00:25:33.064
This process begins when
a master water temple

298
00:25:33.064 --> 00:25:35.500
holds a major water festival.

299
00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.307
On the same day, the farmers from

300
00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:44.276
designated local water temples,

301
00:25:44.276 --> 00:25:47.679
begin to irrigate and plant their fields.

302
00:25:55.954 --> 00:25:58.156
Some time later, other assigned temples

303
00:25:58.156 --> 00:26:00.659
begin their planting cycles,

304
00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:01.493
while the previously flooded fields

305
00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:03.728
are drained for harvesting.

306
00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.770
On and on the opening and
closing of irrigation canals

307
00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.573
is repeated until every rice field

308
00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:18.310
in the master temple's
area has been flooded.

309
00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:29.387
While some fields are wet, others are dry,

310
00:26:29.387 --> 00:26:33.558
and the available water is used
evenly throughout the year.

311
00:27:43.128 --> 00:27:44.829
During part of its growing cycle,

312
00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:48.466
the rice field must become a still pond,

313
00:27:48.466 --> 00:27:51.636
so that the blue green algae can form.

314
00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:55.140
The algae has invisible powers,

315
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.709
drawing nitrogen directly from the air,

316
00:27:57.709 --> 00:27:59.811
and fertilizing the rice without depleting

317
00:27:59.811 --> 00:28:01.980
the nutrients in the soil.

318
00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:06.017
Later, ducks eat the fish and insects

319
00:28:06.017 --> 00:28:07.385
that attack the young rice,

320
00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:10.989
and fertilize the mud
with their droppings.

321
00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:13.391
Ducks and algae are just two factors

322
00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:15.226
that have been used by Balinese farmers

323
00:28:15.226 --> 00:28:19.264
to keep their ecological
balance for centuries.

324
00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:22.000
(ducks chirping)

325
00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:30.275
A few years ago, foreign
experts persuaded many farms

326
00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:34.212
to give up the temple system
of organizing agriculture.

327
00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:37.282
They argued that the ritual
calendar was irrational,

328
00:28:37.282 --> 00:28:40.885
so everyone planted rice as
fast and as often as possible

329
00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.555
and ignored the temple calendar.

330
00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:33.872
Three days before the harvesting begins,

331
00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.774
a special rite is held in the fields

332
00:29:35.774 --> 00:29:40.211
to warn the rice that its
time of sacrifice is near.

333
00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:42.547
And when its time is come,
the rice is harvested

334
00:29:42.547 --> 00:29:46.084
with a blade designed to be
concealed in the palm of hand

335
00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:50.255
so the transition from life
to death is not shocking.

336
00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:55.059
(workers chatting)

337
00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:12.010
The rice goddess, Daya Sri,
controls cycles of growth,

338
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.913
while demons bring death and decay.

339
00:30:16.681 --> 00:30:17.982
The struggles between gods and demons

340
00:30:17.982 --> 00:30:21.119
are usually invisible,
but can be made to appear

341
00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:24.489
through wayand, the
art of shadow puppetry.

342
00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:27.892
(poignant music playing)

343
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.401
(speaking foreign language)

344
00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:50.682
In Balinese, wayang is reflection,

345
00:30:50.682 --> 00:30:53.418
with 200 puppets and the
five languages drawn,

346
00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:56.187
wayang can begin to
reflect the full complexity

347
00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:58.456
of the Balinese world.

348
00:30:58.456 --> 00:31:00.892
Wayang is the most ancient Balinese art,

349
00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:03.194
and still the most popular.

350
00:31:03.194 --> 00:31:04.829
It is their theater, television,

351
00:31:04.829 --> 00:31:07.165
news stand, and school room.

352
00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.610
The Balinese believe
that the middle world,

353
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.679
we can not perceive reality directly.

354
00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:25.783
Our world is the world of illusion.

355
00:31:25.783 --> 00:31:29.220
But on a wayang screen, the
shadows of the true realities

356
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.390
that lie beyond our senses can appear.

357
00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:37.161
Wayang is a window into the other worlds.

358
00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:40.231
(bell music playing)

359
00:31:45.236 --> 00:31:47.472
Ewayan Wucha, a puppeteer,

360
00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:50.375
ritually cleanses himself
to become clear channel

361
00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:53.311
between the gods and his community.

362
00:31:54.712 --> 00:31:57.081
He asks the gods to
descend to his performance

363
00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:59.417
as though it were a temple.

364
00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.686
The divine power is in everything,

365
00:32:01.686 --> 00:32:05.823
even the letters of the poem
or the words of the puppeteer.

366
00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:20.271
In his hand is the kiyang, tree of life,

367
00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:23.308
which draws the energies of
the three worlds together,

368
00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:24.942
so the puppeteer can use them

369
00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:27.445
for the good of the community.

370
00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:38.189
(speaking foreign language)

371
00:32:39.023 --> 00:32:40.792
Patun is Wucha's sister,

372
00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:44.195
they belong to a family of puppeteers.

373
00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:45.697
A few works before this lesson,

374
00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:48.933
Patun's husband Madri was
killed in a motorcycle accident

375
00:32:48.933 --> 00:32:51.836
on his way home from a performance.

376
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.641
Madri was the greatest
puppeteer in all Bali.

377
00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:05.149
Now Patun has begun to study wayang,

378
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:08.553
something only two other women have done.

379
00:33:20.765 --> 00:33:24.435
(speaking foreign language)

380
00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:13.838
Eka Desa Rudra is the
supreme temple ceremony

381
00:36:13.838 --> 00:36:17.708
about to begin in Bali's
great master temple, Besakih.

382
00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:20.711
Here for an instant,
all the invisible worlds

383
00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:23.748
will be joined while the
forces of growth and decay

384
00:36:23.748 --> 00:36:27.718
struggle for possession
of the middle world.

385
00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:31.022
Eka Desa Rudra can happen
only once in 100 years.

386
00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:34.458
No one alive has ever seen this ceremony.

387
00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:36.427
It is created from a few fragments

388
00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:38.629
of ancient poetry on lontars,

389
00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.231
which state that even civilizations

390
00:36:40.231 --> 00:36:42.800
have cycles of growth and decay,

391
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.536
which must be kept under control.

392
00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:53.644
Eka Desa Rudra is a
ceremony of intense pride,

393
00:36:53.644 --> 00:36:55.813
but even more of defiance.

394
00:36:56.847 --> 00:36:59.083
It's a way for the
Balinese say to the world,

395
00:36:59.083 --> 00:37:02.553
we will not let the forces
of change overwhelm us.

396
00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:05.222
We will not let our civilization die.

397
00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:08.793
(dramatic drum music playing)

398
00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:09.894
This series of ceremonies

399
00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:12.330
is considered extremely dangerous.

400
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:14.432
It will culminate on the tenth day,

401
00:37:14.432 --> 00:37:16.667
at the moment the sentry returns,

402
00:37:16.667 --> 00:37:19.537
when the high priests will
try to transport Rudra,

403
00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:22.273
the most powerful demon of destruction,

404
00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.508
into Siva, the supreme god.

405
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.912
If the ceremony is not a success,

406
00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:30.014
it is believe the forces of decay

407
00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:33.584
will go out of control, and
the middle world, our world,

408
00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:35.086
will come to an end.

409
00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.688
(bell ringing)

410
00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:47.632
(speaking foreign language)

411
00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:51.068
(peaceful music playing)

412
00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:02.273
In 500 villages, preparations begin

413
00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:04.775
for the Eka Desa Rudra ceremonies.

414
00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:06.210
In the village of Sukawati,

415
00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.279
after days of collecting
all the ingredients,

416
00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:10.715
people are finally starting
to create the offerings

417
00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:13.217
which will entice the
demons to the ceremony.

418
00:39:13.217 --> 00:39:16.854
(speaking foreign language)

419
00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:55.659
The offerings for the
demons are extraordinary.

420
00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:57.428
They manage to make something beautiful

421
00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:59.697
out of things like pig fat.

422
00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.444
Now everything is ready for the journey,

423
00:40:13.444 --> 00:40:15.946
except for the truck to get the pasaki,

424
00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.848
which seems to be lost.

425
00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:07.798
Most outsiders never see the
most beautiful Balinese arts.

426
00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:10.201
They glitter in sunshine for a few hours,

427
00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:13.304
and then they're dismantled and burned.

428
00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:14.638
What is important for the Balinese,

429
00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:16.640
is not now how long something lasts,

430
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.976
but how close to perfection it comes,

431
00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:21.212
and perfection never lasts.

432
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:34.558
Now remains only to convince

433
00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:36.093
one of the less willing offerings

434
00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:38.429
to join the festive spirits.

435
00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:14.532
Besakih temple on the slopes
of the volcano Gunung Agung,

436
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:17.668
five days until Eka Dasa Rudra,

437
00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.403
and the beginning of a new century.

438
00:42:19.403 --> 00:42:23.073
(speaking foreign language)

439
00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:30.080
In Bali, demons are more
than a simple superstition.

440
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.282
The word for demon in Balinese

441
00:42:31.282 --> 00:42:34.251
comes from the Sanskrit word for element.

442
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:36.754
Eka Dasa Rudra symbolically
dissolves nature

443
00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:39.056
back into its raw elements,

444
00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:42.593
so gods can recombine into higher forms.

445
00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.128
Just as beautiful offerings are made

446
00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:46.764
from crude ingredients.

447
00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.766
The demon offerings from Sukawati

448
00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:51.568
have a very special destination
in a mountain shrine

449
00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:54.004
high above the main temple.

450
00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:56.307
This is where the demonic
Rudra first ascend,

451
00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:58.676
so that the Sukawati offerings will be

452
00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:01.745
the first ones that the demon tastes.

453
00:43:07.451 --> 00:43:09.320
But not all of the
preparations for Eka Dasa Rudra

454
00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.388
happen in the mountain temples.

455
00:43:11.388 --> 00:43:14.725
(festive music playing)

456
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.398
This morning begins the Melasti,

457
00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:23.100
the joining of three worlds.

458
00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:25.569
From every village temple in Bali,

459
00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.172
processions train for miles down to sea,

460
00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.774
carrying gods in mock chariots.

461
00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:39.617
(purposeful music playing)

462
00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:55.933
By noon they've reached a sea

463
00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:58.836
to await the arrival of the demons.

464
00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.239
Thousands of offerings are laid out,

465
00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:06.410
and high priests summon the
demons from beneath the seas.

466
00:44:18.522 --> 00:44:21.091
(bell ringing)

467
00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.580
The demons scream up from the black depths

468
00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.516
towards the beach to
feast on the offerings

469
00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:48.686
and to savor the delicious impurities.

470
00:44:55.926 --> 00:44:57.795
At the critical moment
when the ceremony ends,

471
00:44:57.795 --> 00:45:00.697
a great wave comes and
washes everything clean.

472
00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:02.966
(cheering)

473
00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:15.546
It's taken as a sign the
demons are not displeased.

474
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:18.115
A good sign for Eka Dasa Rudra.

475
00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:27.157
The Sati temple, it is now
one day until Eka Dasa Rudra.

476
00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:34.264
The offerings stream
in from all over Bali,

477
00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:38.368
to satisfy the gods most
are renewed twice a day.

478
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.377
Today is Mipatur, the
day for animal sacrifice.

479
00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:49.880
One representative of virtually

480
00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.050
every Balinese animal will be offered.

481
00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.554
Some, such as the jungle quail,

482
00:45:57.554 --> 00:46:00.124
are rarely seen by the Balinese.

483
00:46:00.124 --> 00:46:03.794
(speaking foreign language)

484
00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:09.166
There's even an eagle,

485
00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:12.336
which came on its own to the ceremony.

486
00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:19.743
(speaking foreign language)

487
00:46:19.743 --> 00:46:23.147
With colored ribbons, high
priests send the animals

488
00:46:23.147 --> 00:46:24.882
to the shrines of demons

489
00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.885
at the five cardinal
points of the compass.

490
00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:30.988
(speaking foreign language)

491
00:46:30.988 --> 00:46:33.924
Here, priests of the
South allows the incense

492
00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:35.959
to help him into his trance,

493
00:46:35.959 --> 00:46:38.262
in which he will he will first
lightly brush the animals

494
00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:40.564
with his sword, setting their souls free

495
00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:44.735
before their blood is actually
spilled by other priests.

496
00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:49.239
(dramatic music playing)

497
00:46:49.239 --> 00:46:53.677
Symbolically, their deaths
dissolve the elements of nature,

498
00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:57.848
so Siva can recombine them
to a more perfect order.

499
00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:22.773
The Balinese believe in reincarnation,

500
00:47:22.773 --> 00:47:24.875
and that death, whether
their own or another's,

501
00:47:24.875 --> 00:47:26.543
should hold no fear.

502
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:06.216
Barus, the wobbling dance
of the ancient warriors,

503
00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:08.252
greets Indonesia's President Suharto

504
00:48:08.252 --> 00:48:11.021
and a host of dignitaries.

505
00:48:11.021 --> 00:48:14.858
(dramatic bell music playing)

506
00:48:47.491 --> 00:48:48.892
The Presidential party was asked

507
00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:50.894
not to arrive by helicopter,

508
00:48:50.894 --> 00:48:55.065
for fear its passage would
annoy the descending Rudras.

509
00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.641
Suharto's arrival awakens dark memories

510
00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.810
of another Indonesian president,

511
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:08.645
and the disastrous attempt

512
00:49:08.645 --> 00:49:12.816
to interfere with the timing
of the Eka Dasa Rudra.

513
00:49:16.086 --> 00:49:18.922
In 1963, Indonesia was in turmoil.

514
00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:22.392
With the economy in ruins,

515
00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:25.929
President Sukarno faced
a major political threat.

516
00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:27.798
The Communists, the military,

517
00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.132
and the other political parties

518
00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:31.501
were scrambling for power.

519
00:49:31.501 --> 00:49:33.837
In an attempt to restore
the people's confidence

520
00:49:33.837 --> 00:49:37.107
in his regime, Sukarno
compelled Balinese priests

521
00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:40.077
to begin preparation for Eka Dasa Rudra,

522
00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:43.313
even though it was not the proper time.

523
00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:49.553
So over the objections
of Balinese priests,

524
00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:51.154
preparations began.

525
00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:53.990
Besakih temple is located halfway up

526
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:57.060
a great active volcano, Gunung Agung.

527
00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.430
When the priests went to
the mouth of the volcano

528
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.501
for holy water, they
found only smoke and ash.

529
00:50:04.501 --> 00:50:06.670
And Agung began to rumble.

530
00:50:10.307 --> 00:50:11.575
Edah Padang Agrisita was then

531
00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:14.845
the highest religious authority in Bali.

532
00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.080
It was his responsibility
to try to carry out

533
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:20.150
the Eka Dasa Rudra at the wrong time.

534
00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:01.091
(rumbling)

535
00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:06.163
By March 17, 1963, great rivers of lava

536
00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:08.532
were pouring down slopes of Agung

537
00:51:08.532 --> 00:51:11.401
in its first eruption in recorded history.

538
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.670
Smoke and volcanic ash blotted out the sun

539
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.505
over most of Bali,

540
00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:17.274
when the lava reached the plains,

541
00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:19.443
entire villages were wiped out.

542
00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:22.546
100,000 refugees were
driven from their homes,

543
00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:25.248
and many died of asphyxiation, burns,

544
00:51:25.248 --> 00:51:27.083
and later, starvation.

545
00:52:06.423 --> 00:52:08.692
(chanting)

546
00:52:54.204 --> 00:52:56.840
Today at high noon, the
11 Rudras will descend

547
00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.378
into the ceremonial enclosure
in front of the temple.

548
00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:04.948
It is to these platforms
at the noon time turning

549
00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:07.817
of the 100th cycle of the nine dark moon,

550
00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:11.955
that the Rudras will descend,
and hopefully be transformed.

551
00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:16.092
At each of the 11 shrines,
the high priests prepare

552
00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:18.161
for the demons' assembly.

553
00:53:21.164 --> 00:53:24.501
Gustin Agurabar is a
Balinese anthropologist,

554
00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:27.204
explaining to his students
the meaning of an event

555
00:53:27.204 --> 00:53:30.173
that will happen only
once in their lifetimes.

556
00:53:30.173 --> 00:53:33.843
(speaking foreign language)

557
00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:15.051
A messenger from Siva appears
in a wayang performance

558
00:54:15.051 --> 00:54:16.553
at Eka Dasa Rudra.

559
00:54:38.675 --> 00:54:40.110
The moment approaches when the priests

560
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:44.247
must face the Rudras, the
most powerful demons of all.

561
00:54:45.248 --> 00:54:47.550
Each priest must concentrate

562
00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.720
all of his powers into timed gestures.

563
00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:05.368
(bell ringing)

564
00:55:18.748 --> 00:55:23.019
Tempted by the offerings, one
by one the demons descend.

565
00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:26.256
(lively music playing)

566
00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:40.470
(bell ringing)

567
00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:45.375
And now is the time of greatest danger.

568
00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:49.546
The two supreme demons, Kala
and Rudra, must be faced.

569
00:55:51.614 --> 00:55:54.484
30 priests and half a million Balinese,

570
00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:58.655
focus their minds and wills on
bringing them under control.

571
00:56:14.337 --> 00:56:17.907
In a few moments, a
new century will begin.

572
00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:33.656
Noon, Eka Dasa Rudra is complete.

573
00:56:35.125 --> 00:56:38.394
Today the poetry on the
lontars still have power

574
00:56:38.394 --> 00:56:41.798
to draw an entire society together.

575
00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:45.034
It will be years before
any priest will dare say

576
00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:47.003
whether the ceremony was a success.

577
00:56:47.003 --> 00:56:49.038
Yet each person has confronted

578
00:56:49.038 --> 00:56:51.207
the forces of decay and destruction

579
00:56:51.207 --> 00:56:54.444
to restore balance of the middle world.

580
00:56:55.812 --> 00:56:57.347
The Balinese asked us to explain,

581
00:56:57.347 --> 00:57:00.550
that they do not do this
ceremony only for themselves,

582
00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.952
or for the Hindu people of the world,

583
00:57:02.952 --> 00:57:04.187
but for us all.

584
00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:14.664
(somber singing in foreign language)

585
00:58:13.623 --> 00:58:15.525
<v Narrator>Major funding for Odyssey</v>

586
00:58:15.525 --> 00:58:20.196
was provided by the National
Endowment for the Humanities.

587
00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:22.398
Additional funding was provided by

588
00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:26.536
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,

589
00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:28.972
and the Polaroid Corporation.

590
00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:35.078
(electronic jingle)
