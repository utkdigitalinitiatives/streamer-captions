00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.960
>> NARRATOR: They want to be
cool.
They are impressionable.
And they have the cash.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.230
They are corporate America's
$150 billion dream.
>> MAN: Teenagers have a lot of
disposable income; they want to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.600
go spend their money.
And, you know, we're more than
happy to make product that they
want to go spend money on.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.060
>> NARRATOR: MTV, Madison
Avenue, and the dream-makers of
Hollywood have targeted our
teenagers.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.460
>> MAN: They look at the teen
market as part of this massive
empire that they're colonizing.
Teens are like Africa.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.460
>> NARRATOR: They are the most
studied generation in history.
>> MAN: If you don't understand
and recognize what they're

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.860
thinking, what they're feeling,
you're going to lose.
You're absolutely going to lose.
>> NARRATOR: But what does this

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.860
relentless focus on the teenager
do to the culture?
>> MAN: They are going to do
whatever they think works the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.760
fastest and with the most
people, which means that they
will drag standards down.
>> NARRATOR: And to the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.760
teenagers themselves...
>> GIRL: I have to look good for
people.
I need to look good.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.430
>> NARRATOR: Tonight, author and
media critic Douglass Rushkoff
takes a journey through the
complex world of buying and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.300
selling cool.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.460
>> MAN: Okay, so I'm going to
take attendance here.
Christopher?
>> BOY: Here.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.700
>> MAN: Okay.
Hadad?
>> BOY: Here.
>> MAN: Right there, okay.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:58.560
Adam?
Okay.
You guys can all have a seat
right over here.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.660
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: Has
anybody ever done a focus group
before?
I mean, do you remember what you

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:16.360
talked about?
>> BOY: After-school sports.
>> DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: On a summer
afternoon, in a downtown New

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.400
York loft, corporate America is
on a very serious mission.
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: You know,
it's all going to be sort of,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.700
like, what you guys think.
You guys are sort of the experts
today, and it's going to really
be just you guys telling me your

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.900
opinions.
>> RUSHKOFF: These five boys
are here to be questioned about
what they wear, what they eat,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.960
what they listen to and watch.
For $125 each, they're expected
to answer.
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: Tell me

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.130
some of the things that are
really hot right now, some of
the things that are really big
right now, popular trends,

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.460
things that you sort of see
everywhere.
What's, like, going on?
What's hot right now?

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.600
Just shout them out.
>> RUSHKOFF: Okay, so they're no
more responsive than most
teenagers, but that's not going

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.860
to stop this market researcher,
because the information he's
looking for is worth an awful
lot of money.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.400
At 32 million strong, this is
the largest generation of
teenagers ever-- even larger
than their baby-boomer parents.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.900
Last year, teens spent more than
$100 billion themselves and
pushed their parents to spend
another $50 billion on top of

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.530
that.
They have more money and more
say over how they'll spend it
than ever before.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.200
>> BOB BIBB: Teens run today's
economy.
There's an innate feeling for
moms and dads to please the

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:40.760
teen, to keep the teen happy, to
keep the teen home, and I think
you can pretty much take that to
the bank.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.760
>> SHARON LEE: They're given a
lot of what we call guilt money.
"Here's the credit card.
Why don't you go online and buy

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.800
something because I can't spend
time with you?"
>> RUSHKOFF: I'm Douglas
Rushkoff, and tonight we'll tour

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.000
through a landscape that has
both attracted and repelled me
during the decade I've been
studying it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.530
It's the world in which our
teenagers are growing up, a
world made of marketing.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.900
For today's teens, a walk in the
street may as well be a stroll
through the mall.
Anywhere they rest their eyes,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.830
they'll be exposed to a
marketing message.
A typical American teenager will
process over 3,000 discrete

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:31.630
advertisements in a single day,
and ten million by the time
they're 18.
Kids are also consuming massive

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.600
quantities of entertainment
media.
75% of teens have a television
in their room; a third have

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:44.030
their own personal computer,
where they spend an average of
two hours a day online.
>> BRIAN GRADEN: I think one of

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.300
the great things about this
information age is with so many
channels you can say my business
is 12 to 15, or my business is

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.700
21 to 24.
As a result, you have the most
marketed-to group of teens and
young adults ever in the history

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.260
of the world.
>> RUSHKOFF: It's a blizzard of
brands, all competing for the
same kids.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.330
To win teens' loyalty, marketers
believe they have to speak their
language the best.
So they study them carefully, as

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:13.600
an anthropologist would an
exotic native culture.
>> ROB STONE: If you don't
understand and recognize what

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:23.600
they're thinking, what they're
feeling, and then be able to
take that in and come up with a
really precise message that

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:30.330
you're trying to reach these
kids with in<i> their</i> terms, you're
going to lose.
You're absolutely going to lose.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.800
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: Is there
anybody in your group of friends
in particular that is, you know,
always really following the

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.960
trends?
>> BOY: Not really.
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: No?
So it's just sort of all of you

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.330
together kind of keep each other
in check?
Okay, cool.
>> RUSHKOFF: What makes this

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.530
market so frustrating is that
they don't operate the same way
as the rest of us.
They're a stubborn demographic,

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:59.100
unresponsive to brands and
traditional marketing messages.
But there is one thing they do
respond to: cool.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.860
Only cool keeps changing.
So how do you map it, pin it
down?
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: As I'm

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.760
moving up, stop me when I get
to, like, two years ago.
>> RUSHKOFF: What is cool
anyway?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.200
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: Like right
here?
Okay.
>> RUSHKOFF: The search for this

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.100
elusive prize has its own name:
cool hunting.
>> MALCOLM GLADWELL: Cool
hunting is structured around

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.630
really a search for a certain
kind of personality and a
certain kind of player in a
given social network.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:28.600
For years and years on Madison
Avenue, if you knew where the
money was and where the power
was and where the big houses

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:35.200
were, then you knew what was
going to happen next.
And cool hunting was all about a
kind of revolution that sets

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:41.900
that earlier paradigm aside and
says, in fact, it has to do with
the influence held by those who
have the respect and admiration

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:49.130
and trust of their friends.
>> RUSHKOFF: Many companies
don't trust themselves to do
this kind of research, so they

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:54.430
hire experts who can find these
cool kids and speak their
language.
>> DEE DEE GORDON: We look for

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.000
kids who are ahead of the pack
because they're going to
influence what all the other
kids do.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.300
We look for the 20%, the
trendsetters, that are going to
influence the other 80%.
>> RUSHKOFF: Dee Dee Gordon is a

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:11.860
sought after cool hunter.
Just 30 years old, she commands
high fees as a consultant to
some of the largest corporations

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:18.030
in America and has been the
subject of a "New Yorker"
profile.
>> GLADWELL: How good is she?

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.430
I think she's as good as anyone
is at this game, and it's
something... it's a difficult
thing to quantify, of course;

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:29.260
it's not a science.
It's really a question
ultimately of, how much do you
trust the person who's doing the

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:36.100
interpretation and how good are
their instincts?
And I think, in both cases,
she's at the top of the field.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:42.600
>> RUSHKOFF: Three years ago,
Gordon and her partner, Sharon
Lee, left the small advertising
agency where they worked to

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.100
start their own business, Look-
Look.
>> GORDON: All the photos are
really busy, so somebody has to

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.760
shoot a skateboarder in the air
or a cyclist in the air...
>> RUSHKOFF: Gordon and Lee have
put together a team of what they

00:08:53.760 --> 00:09:01.700
call correspondents: all young,
all former cool kids themselves.
>> WOMAN: The Slipknot story
came in, and our writer did a

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.760
really good job.
>> RUSHKOFF: They're culture
spies, who penetrate the regions
of the teen landscape where

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:14.260
corporations aren't welcome.
>> WOMAN: Can I take your
picture for a street-culture web
site I work for?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.700
>> BOY: Go ahead.
>> WOMAN: I got to get your
piercings.
Can I get your tattoo?

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:25.200
>> GORDON: A correspondent is a
person who's been trained by us
to be able to find a certain
kind of kid-- a kid that we call

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.660
a trendsetter or an early
adopter.
This is a kid who's very forward
in their thinking, who looks

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:38.260
outside their own backyard for
inspiration, who is a leader
within their own group.
(<i> boy screaming</i> )

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:45.330
These kids are really difficult
to find.
So what this correspondent does
is they go out and they, like,

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:51.800
find and identify these trend-
setting kids.
They interview them.
They get them interested in what

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:57.760
we do.
They send all that stuff in.
We look at it; we compile it; we
look for trends or themes that

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:03.260
are happening through all the
information, and that's the
stuff that we put on our web
site.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:10.100
>> RUSHKOFF: For a subscription
fee of $20,000 each, companies
are granted access to the Look-
Look web site-- a Rosetta stone

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:17.430
of teen culture.
If companies can get in on a
trend or subculture while it is
still underground, they can be

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:22.830
the first ones to bring it to
market.
>> GORDON: And that's when the
mass consumer picks up on it and

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:29.260
runs with it and then eventually
kills it.
>> RUSHKOFF: And that's the
paradox of cool hunting: it

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:35.560
kills what it finds.
As soon as marketers discover
cool, it stops being cool.
>> GLADWELL: The faster you pick

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.800
up on these trends and blow them
out and show them to everybody
and reveal them to corporate
America, the more you force the

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:48.630
kind of person who starts them
and spreads them to move on and
find the next.
So you simply... there's no kind

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.800
of solution to this.
You can't ever solve the puzzle
permanently.
By... by having... by

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.460
discovering cool, you force cool
to move on to the next thing.
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: For those
of you who crossed out Madonna,

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.530
why did you cross out Madonna?
>> BILLY: She's old.
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: She's old?
>> RUSHKOFF: This creates a

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:08.530
problem for marketers.
Kids begin to see them as the
enemy.
So what do marketers do?

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:17.000
Market to kids without seeming
to do so, become cool
themselves, as Sprite did a few
years ago.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.700
>> MAN:<i> [music] I like the way</i>
<i>you make me laugh</i>
<i>[music] I like the funny things... [music]</i>
>> RUSHKOFF: In the early-'90s,

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:28.330
Sprite was an also-ran brand in
the competitive soft drink
category.
Their focus groups with

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.760
teenagers were designed to find
out what was wrong.
>> PINA SCIARRA: What we found
by talking to teens is that they

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:41.860
had seen so much advertising
that they were on overload and
became very cynical about that
traditional approach to

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:46.800
advertising.
>> BRAD HILL: Hi, I'm Brad Hill,
professional basketball player
for the Detroit Pistons.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.560
>> RUSHKOFF: Then they launched
this ad campaign aimed at teens,
which pokes fun at marketing
itself.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:00.700
>> HILL: Because it's the only
drink with that cool, crisp,
refreshing taste that satisfies
even my manliest thirst.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:07.500
>> SCIARRA: There was really no
one in the market at the time
that was saying, "Discount it
all.

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.960
Don't believe it.
It's all B.S., and we know that
you know that.
And you're smarter than everyone

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:19.600
else."
So, it put them in a position to
feel like we understood them so
that they were feeding back to

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:26.900
us, "You know, Sprite
understands me.
Sprite is one... you know, it's
really one of us."

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:31.400
>> RUSHKOFF: It worked for a
while.
But soon, Sprite's own focus
groups revealed that kids were

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:37.360
getting wise to this anti-
marketing marketing campaign.
>> BOY: They had Grant Hill
telling you not to listen to

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.730
some celebrity telling you to
drink a beverage.
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: Right.
>> BOY: Well, that's what you're

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.430
doing; you're listening to Grant
Hill telling you to drink
Sprite.
>> MARKET RESEARCHER: Right.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:50.330
>> BOY: I don't know how much
they probably paid all those
stars to come on and say, "Don't
listen to what a star says."

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:56.730
>> RUSHKOFF: So Sprite crossed
an entirely new threshold into
the innermost sanctum of teen
culture, where they cloaked

00:12:56.730 --> 00:13:03.700
themselves in genuine cool.
>> SCIARRA: Hip hop for us
became the sort of vehicle, or
the lens, for us to get to teens

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:10.630
and talk to them in a credible
way.
And the way we did that was to
develop relationships with

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:15.060
artists.
>> STONE: They all of a sudden
put their arm around that kid
that was drinking Sprite and

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:21.160
said, "We understand you; we
recognize you; we want to be
part of your life."
And not just, "Please drink our

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.460
product."
They didn't; they almost weren't
even selling the product.
They were selling the fact that

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:31.130
they understood the culture.
>> JON COHEN: They were selling
a lifestyle, and I think that's
why Sprite's been so successful

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:37.300
and one of the leaders in terms
of reaching youth.
>> RUSHKOFF: Former record
executives Jon Cohen and Rob

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:44.660
Stone run a New York marketing
firm called Cornerstone.
They're specialty is under-the-
radar marketing.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:53.500
For instance, Cornerstone hires
kids to log into chat rooms and
pose as just another fan of one
of their clients.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.860
>> MAN: And that's what the
focus group is about.
>> RUSHKOFF: They also recruit
incoming freshmen to throw

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:04.060
parties, where they pass out
promotional material to their
classmates.
>> MAN: If we're, you know...

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:11.560
maybe we've got a bunch of promo
Busta Rhymes CDs, and that would
be great to give out at the hip-
hop concert.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.330
>> RUSHKOFF: Cornerstone helped
Sprite tap a network of radio
deejays and hip-hop artists to
smuggle their message into the

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:24.000
world of kids.
>> STONE: The days of developing
cute campaigns or whatever
don't... they don't work

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.400
anymore.
You have to really get involved
in what their culture is.
You have to understand where

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.900
they're coming from.
You have to think how they
think.
>> RUSHKOFF: It worked.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:41.530
Thanks to the teens who buy it,
Sprite is now the fastest-
growing soft drink in the world.
Sprite invited us to a kick-off

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:49.100
party for their new web site,
Sprite.com.
Scores of kids were paid to show
up and revel in the sounds and

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:57.500
styles of urban authenticity.
While we were there, some of the
biggest acts in rap music
appeared on stage under the

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:04.960
company logo.
Here it was, the ultimate
marriage of a corporation and a
culture.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:12.530
Sprite and hip-hop had become
one and the same, each carrying
the other to its audience.
>> SCIARRA: Sprite has really

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:18.100
become an icon.
It's not just associated with
hip-hop.
It's really a part of it.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:26.960
As much as baggy jeans and
sneakers, Sprite has become an
icon in hip-hop culture.
>> RUSHKOFF: Is it nostalgic to

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:34.460
think that when we were young it
was any different, that the
thing we called youth culture
wasn't something that was just

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:41.800
being sold to us, it was
something that came from us-- an
act of expression not just of
consumption?

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.260
Has that boundary been
completely erased?
Today five enormous companies
are responsible for selling

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:58.860
nearly all of youth culture.
These are the true merchants of
cool: Rupert Murdoch's Newscorp,
Disney, Viacom, Universal

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:09.200
Vivendi, and AOL/Time Warner.
>> ROBERT McCHESNEY: The
entertainment companies, which
are a handful of massive

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.360
conglomerates that own four of
the five music companies that
sell 90% of the music in the
United States, those same

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:22.330
companies also own all the film
studios, all the major TV
networks, all the TV stations
pretty much in the ten largest

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:31.500
markets.
They own all or part of every
single commercial cable channel.
They look at the teen market as

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:36.900
part of this massive empire that
they're colonizing.
You should look at it like the
British empire or the French

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:40.660
empire in the 19th century.
Teens are like Africa.
You know, that's this range that
they're going to take over; and

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:47.360
their weaponry are films, music,
books, CDs, Internet access,
clothing, amusement parks,
sports teams.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:54.500
That's all this weaponry they
have to make money off of this
market.
>> RUSHKOFF: Of the five media

00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:04.100
giants, the coolest conglomerate
on the block is Viacom.
And Viacom's crown jewel, there
on the second floor, is MTV,

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:11.530
which last year earned the
company a billion dollars in
profits.
MTV launched 20 years ago with a

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:19.060
simple but brilliantly
commercial concept: use record
companies' promotional music
videos as creative programming.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:29.900
Since then, the cable channel
has grown into a youth-marketing
empire, but its basic business
model has remained the same.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.600
>> McCHESNEY: Everything on MTV
is a commercial; that's all that
MTV is.
Sometimes it's an explicit

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.530
advertisement paid for by a
company to sell a product.
Sometimes it's going to be a
video for a music company there

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:45.160
to sell music.
Sometimes it's going to be the
set that's filled with trendy
clothes and stuff there to sell

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:51.760
a look that will include
products on that set.
Sometimes it will be a show
about an upcoming movie paid for

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:57.030
by the studio, though you don't
know it, to hype a movie that's
coming out from Hollywood.
But everything's an infomercial.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:03.800
There is no non-commercial part
of MTV.
>> RUSHKOFF: This strategy keeps
MTV's airwaves filled with cheap

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.900
and easy content.
>> MAN: Now he's over there
doing his thing.
Let's check in with him.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.630
All right, let's do it over
there.
>> RUSHKOFF: Take MTV's daily
program "Direct Effects."

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:19.060
See anything familiar?
That's the Sprite.com party we
showed you earlier.
We didn't know it at the time,

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:26.400
but the cameras swirling over
our heads belonged to MTV.
>> MAN: Let's make it happen.
The Sprite.com launch party,

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.060
it's crazy.
And right now I've got two of
the hottest in hip-hop for you
right now.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:36.700
>> RUSHKOFF: So let's connect
the dots.
Sprite rents out the Roseland
Ballroom and pays kids 50 bucks

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:43.100
a pop to fill it up and look
cool.
The rap artists who perform for
this paid audience get a plug on

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:50.200
MTV's show "Direct Effects," for
which Sprite is a sponsor.
MTV gobbles up the cheap
programming, promoting the music

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:57.600
of the record companies who
advertise on their channel.
Everybody's happy.
But while this cross-promotional

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:05.260
free-for-all may maximize
returns for MTV and Viacom, it
also violates the first rule of
cool: don't let your marketing

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:13.160
show.
MTV learned this lesson the hard
way a few years ago when their
ratings began to slip.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:20.600
>> GRADEN: There was a
perception that MTV had lost its
way a bit with the young
consumer.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.100
Ratings were down somewhat.
Some of the trend studies said
that we were less cool, less
creative than before.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.200
>> RUSHKOFF: So MTV had the
humility to realize that cool
was not their birthright, that
it belongs to kids, and kids

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.960
keep changing.
If they wanted to stay cool,
they'd have to change right
along with them.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:42.130
>> DAVE SIRULNICK: MTV felt like
we needed to get a closer
connection to the audience.
We said, "If we know more about

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:48.830
them-- know more about their
lives, know more about who they
are, what they want, what they
don't want-- we can make a

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:55.200
better MTV that has a better
connection with the audience if
we talk to them and listen to
them a lot more."

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.900
>> GRADEN: We immersed ourselves
in research about the fall of
'97 and have been able to turn
that around to where now our

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:05.400
rankings, when it comes to
creative or original or funky or
anything you would care about
musically relevant, have went

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:10.300
way, way up, and our ratings are
their highest in their history.
>> MAN: Five, four, three, come
on!

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.460
(<i> applause</i> )
>> RUSHKOFF: The new MTV is all
about learning what kids really
want, then delivering it to

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:23.260
them.
Their signature show, "Total
Request Live," plays music
videos by popular demand.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:30.130
And every afternoon, mobs of
kids crowd into Times Square to
gaze up at the windows of the
"T.R.L." studio, to see

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:39.060
whichever megaband might be
making a guest appearance.
Today it's a "T.R.L." favorite,
rap metal artists Limp Bizkit,

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:44.900
whose videos are frequently
voted into the top ten.
More on them later.
>> SIRULNICK: It's really the

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.060
first time MTV was able to give
over the control of a show to
the viewers and say, "You know
what?

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.800
You tell us what you want to
hear, what you want to see, what
the videos are."
And they've been in control of

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.730
it since it went on the air.
So I think that's one of the
reasons that it's really
important to us.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:03.230
And it's really important to the
audience because there's that
real bond.
>> RUSHKOFF: To insure that bond

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:08.900
stays strong, MTV must
understand where teen culture is
moving.
Market research is the mantra,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:17.730
and its guru is Todd Cunningham.
>> TODD CUNNINGHAM: Some of this
music is dead on for exactly
what kind of stuff that our

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:23.000
audience is going to want.
The research efforts at MTV are
certainly legendary.
There's been a kind of feverish

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.860
addiction to research and
understanding young people, and
that's been embraced from the
very top down.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:37.360
>> RUSHKOFF: MTV let us in on
their techniques.
Todd Cunningham told us to meet
him at an address in the small

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:47.130
town of Iselin, New Jersey.
A short time after we arrived, a
black town car pulled up.
Cunningham, a former advertising

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:56.430
industry executive, emerged with
a member of his staff.
This little field trip,
Cunningham had explained, is

00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:04.260
called an ethnography study, in
which MTV market researchers
visit a typical fan in his home.
>> CUNNINGHAM: Hi.

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:11.030
Todd.
>> RUSHKOFF: Today MTV is
meeting John-- an ordinary kid
in every respect who was

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:19.030
carefully screened to make sure
he is just that.
It is hoped that by studying
John in his natural habitat, MTV

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:26.400
might gain insight into one of
the most valuable segment of
their viewing demographic: the
teenage male.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:32.160
>> CUNNINGHAM: I'd love to see,
like, clothes.
Like, what's your favorite thing
you have?

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.060
What's your favorite shirt?
>> JOHN: I don't know.
It's probably one of my
sweaters.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:40.230
They're in my drawers, if you
want to see them.
>> CUNNINGHAM: Okay, well, we
can look at that in a minute.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:44.900
What else... what else... what
other kind of things do you wear
usually?
Like, what's...?

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.560
>> JOHN: I wear a lot of, like,
khaki pants.
>> CUNNINGHAM: Yeah?
>> JOHN: Mm-hmm.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.660
And... I don't know, I have some
suits for church or whatever.
>> CUNNINGHAM: We shut the door
in their bedrooms and talk to

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.630
them about issues that they feel
like are really important to
them.
We talk with them about what

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:02.530
it's like to date today, what
it's like dealing with their
parents, what things stress them
out the most, what things are

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:10.030
like really on the hearts and
minds of them and their peers.
I'm just curious about, like,
things with, like-- you can have

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:14.760
a seat if you want-- just, like,
with your girlfriend and stuff
like that.
We always ask these kind of

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:22.160
questions about are you, like,
how long have you guys been
dating?
>> JOHN: Since June 1.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.800
>> CUNNINGHAM It's captured on
video.
So we have a camera crew, sound
and light crew there.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:34.360
We cut that videotape together,
put it to music, edit it in an
MTV-style way.
We then take that around and

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:41.360
show it to various department
meetings, share with them the
insights that we've learned.
>> RUSHKOFF: So what happens to

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:48.900
all this careful research, all
the hours and dollars that MTV
spends learning about who our
kids really are?

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:57.960
When all the tape is reviewed,
what portrait of the American
teenage male emerges?
>> BOY: Oh, God!

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:04.530
On my leg.
>> RUSHKOFF: His critics call
him the mook.
That's right, m-o-o-k.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:11.630
mook.
And you can find him almost any
hour of the day or night
somewhere on MTV.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:18.030
He's not real; he's a character:
crude, loud, obnoxious, and in-
your-face.
>> TOM GREEN: Nyah-nyah-nyah-

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:21.260
nyah.
Nyah-nyah-nyah.
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
>> RUSHKOFF: He's Tom Green of

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:27.960
the "Tom Green" show.
>> MAN: There's a sewage plant
in Mianus, and it stinks.
>> RUSHKOFF: And he's the

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:34.130
daredevils on "Jackass" who
indulge in dignity-defying feats
like poo diving.
>> MAN: All right, John.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:41.700
This is poo diving.
>> MAN: Oh, gross!
>> RUSHKOFF: He's those frat
boys and their whip-cream bikini

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:47.900
girlfriends on MTV's constantly
recurring Spring Break specials.
>> PHIL: Hey, Terrence, what
brand of pants am I wearing?

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:54.200
>> TERRENCE: Let me see.
>> RUSHKOFF: He has migrated to
MTV's sister network, Comedy
Central, where he's the cartoon

00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:00.500
cutouts of "South Park," or the
lads on the "Man Show."
>> MAN: The juggies look nice,
don't they?

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:06.530
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )
>> MAN: Eat those beans.
Eat those beans.
>> RUSHKOFF: The mook is perhaps

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:13.230
Viacom's most bankable creation.
Once programmers discovered his
knack with teenage boys, they
replicated him across the length

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:18.060
and breadth of their empire.
>> HOWARD STERN: Oh, my
goodness.
She's grabbing my ass.

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:24.060
She's grabbing my ass!
>> RUSHKOFF: Take Howard Stern,
perhaps the original and still
king of all mooks.

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:30.900
Look how Viacom leverages him
across their properties.
He is syndicated on 50 of
Viacom's Infinity radio

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:37.460
stations.
His weekly TV show is broadcast
on Viacom's CBS.
His number one best-selling

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:44.330
autobiography was published by
Viacom's Simon & Schuster, then
released as a major motion
picture by Viacom's Paramount

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:52.660
Pictures-- grossing $40 million
domestically and millions more
on videos sold at Viacom's
Blockbuster Video.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.930
>> STERN: Go ahead, tell me more
about me.
>> RUSHKOFF: So does the whole
teenage experience come down to

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:04.000
this?
Are our boys mooks?
Is John a mook?
I don't think so.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.560
Maybe all that research isn't
really about understanding John
as a person; it's about
understanding John as a

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:17.030
customer.
I mean, they don't call it human
research or people research;
they call it market research.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:22.300
>> MARK CRISPIN-MILLER: The MTV
machine does listen very
carefully to children.
When corporate revenues depend

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:28.730
on being ahead of the curve, you
have to listen, you have to know
exactly what they want and
exactly what they're thinking so

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:34.760
that you can give them what you
want them to have.
Now, that's an important
distinction.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.830
The MTV machine doesn't listen
to the young so it can make the
young happier.
It doesn't listen to the young

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:48.030
so it can come up with, you
know, startling new kinds of
music, for example.
The MTV machine tunes in so it

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:53.560
can figure out how to pitch what
Viacom has to sell.
>> GREEN: Crotch, crotch,
crotch.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.530
>> RUSHKOFF: There is no mook in
nature.
He is a creation designed to
capitalize on the testosterone-

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:04.700
driven madness of adolescence.
He grabs them below the belt and
then reaches for their wallets.
>> GREEN: Would you watch my

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.760
crotch?
>> McCHESNEY: What MTV is
struggling with is what's going
on with all our cultural

00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:15.300
industries.
We have fewer and fewer owners
but more and more choices, so
they have to desperately find

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.900
ways to keep people looking for
gimmicks, and they don't have a
huge time frame to establish an
identity.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:25.960
With the remote control, you
know, your shelf life of chances
to keep someone, to get them to
stay there, is very short.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.730
You can't develop a character
for six weeks.
They're going to be gone after
two minutes.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:37.700
So it puts pressure on
commercial culture providers,
like MTV, to try to find sort of
things that their research shows

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:44.300
will click right away,
recognizable things, and play on
those.
>> RUSHKOFF: It's funny to think

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:53.060
that the most advanced form of
marketing today comes in the
form of a 300-pound body slam.
>> MAN: Yeah!

00:27:53.060 --> 00:28:01.700
>> RUSHKOFF: Professional
wrestling is the most popular
form of entertainment among
teenage boys in America.

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:10.060
When I was a kid, wrestling was
an amusing little outpost of the
culture.
Today wrestling is sheer

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:15.700
spectacle, a magnificently honed
lure for the teenage male
channel-surfer.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:25.260
The wrestlers themselves have a
word for it: "pop."
>> PRO WRESTLER #1: "Pop" means
when that... when the crowd

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:29.060
pops, when then they react,
"Wow."
>> PRO WRESTLER #2: It's like a
shock reaction, you know.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.400
Something that, you know, they
didn't really expect it.
So you may get that big surprise
out of them, you know, just like

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.760
when you... you catch somebody
coming around the corner and you
jump out, and they go, "Whoa."
It's the same thing, you know?

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.130
>> PRO WRESTLER #1: When
Goldberg spears somebody, it's a
big pop.
You know, "Wow."

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:46.830
>> RUSHKOFF: And where there's
pop, there's money.
That's why wrestling has been
propagated across the entire

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:56.630
spectrum of teen media.
It's broadcast 15 hours a week
on five different networks and
is seen by 15 million people.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:03.300
Wrestling's violence doesn't
scare me; its ubiquity does.
>> GRADEN: It is huge with our
audience at sort of program

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:09.630
levels that I could of never
imagined.
It is the hottest thing going
among males 18 to 24, and in

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:15.260
fact among teen boys.
And so we felt like while we
don't want it to be the defining
element of our business, it was

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:20.030
okay to be in the game.
>> MAN: It was simply too big to
ignore.
>> GRADEN: That's what it was.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:26.730
>> CRISPIN-MILLER: When you've
got a few gigantic transnational
corporations, each one loaded
down with debt, competing madly

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:36.260
for as much shelf space and
brain space as they can take,
they are going to do whatever
they think works the fastest and

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:42.460
with the most people, which
means that they will drag
standards down.
>> CHRISTINA AGUILERA: [music] I can't

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.500
help myself... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: And girls get
dragged down there right along
with boys.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:54.360
The media machine has spit out a
second caricature.
Perhaps we can call this
stereotype the midriff.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.930
The midriff is no more true to
life than the mook.
If he is arrested in
adolescence, she is prematurely

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:07.700
adult.
If he doesn't care what people
think of him, she is consumed by
appearances.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.730
If his thing is crudeness, hers
is sex.
The midriff is really just a
collection of the same old

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:21.100
sexual cliches, but repackaged
as a new kind of female
empowerment.
"I am midriff, hear me roar."

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:29.260
"I am a sexual object, but I'm
proud of it."
>> BOY: Wait.
Wait.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:34.030
Wait, wait.
>> BRITNEY SPEARS: [music] Ooh,
yeah... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: The midriff

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:39.460
archetype is undoubtedly teenage
megastar Britney Spears, whose
latest album, "Oops I Did it
Again," has sold over eight

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:45.560
million copies.
>> SPEARS: [music] Show me how
you want it... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: She hit the scene

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:53.000
at 16 with "Baby, One More
Time," as a naughty Catholic
schoolgirl bursting out of her
uniform.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.860
When it came time for a spread
in "Rolling Stone," THE 17-year-
old self-professed virgin
Britney struck the classic

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:08.830
nymphet pose.
(<i> music playing</i> )
And at the Video Music Awards
last year, when Britney finally

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:15.900
and famously came out of her
clothes, she wasn't just
pleasing eager young boys; she
was delivering a powerful

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:24.630
missive to girls: your body is
your best asset, flaunt your
sexuality even if you don't
understand it.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:30.900
And that's the message that
matters most, because Britney's
most loyal fans are teenage
girls.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:38.430
>> SPEARS: [music] I'm not
that innocent. [music]
>> GIRLS: [music] I think I did it
again

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:45.460
[music] We're more
than just friends... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: We met Barbara and
her friends at the New York

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:51.100
Hilton, where they were
preparing for the opportunity to
step into the roles of midriffs
themselves.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:58.460
>> BARBARA: I want to be a
model; I want to be an actor.
I want people to notice me and
just be like, "Wow, she is

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:06.460
pretty."
I have to look good for people.
If... I<i> need</i> to look good.
Like, if I don't look good for

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:12.660
people, I'll be really upset,
and it'll, like, ruin my day.
So whenever I go out with
friends, like, even just over to

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:19.230
their house, I need to look
good.
>> RUSHKOFF: Barbara and
hundreds of other girls have

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:27.660
come here to the International
Model and Talent Association's
annual convention.
These girls have paid up to

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:37.000
4,000 bucks a pop for the chance
to be paraded before hundreds of
agents and talent scouts on the
lookout for new blood.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.530
There have always been starry-
eyed girls like this, but what's
new is their sophistication.
They've learned how a midriff

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:49.830
should talk, move, and sell
herself.
>> GIRL: Hello, my number is
7996.

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:54.800
Fruit of the Loom.
I bet you thought they were just
for men.
Well, now there's new Fruit of

00:32:54.800 --> 00:33:05.600
the Loom feminine style, because
girls know a good thing when
they see one.
Thank you.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:13.330
>> RUSHKOFF: Now it's time for
13-year-old Barbara to prove she
has what it takes.
>> WOMAN: Very good head shot.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:18.160
>> BARBARA: Thank you.
>> WOMAN: Barbara, what do you
feel that your age range is?
>> BARBARA: A lot of people say

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:27.460
I look 17.
>> WOMAN: What do you think it
is?
>> BARBARA: I am originally 13.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:34.960
I think I can range to 16 or 17.
>> WOMAN: You are 13?
>> BARBARA: Yeah.
>> WOMAN: You're 13 years old?

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.130
>> BARBARA: Yeah.
>> WOMAN: Whoa!
>> WOMAN: What do you want to
really do?

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:44.230
What are you interested in?
>> BARBARA: I would like to
become successful.
(<i> laughter</i> )

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:47.900
>> WOMAN: Good girl.
Good girl.
>> WOMAN: Okay, okay.
>> BARBARA: I want to land a

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.800
contract with someone or get an
agent.
>> MAN: Let's say that you go
through this convention and,

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:57.760
like, nothing happens and no
interest, then what?
>> BARBARA: For some reason I
know that if I keep trying, I

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.560
might get somewhere.
>> MAN: Yeah.
It was so nice to meet you.
Thanks, Barbara.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:06.600
Good luck.
>> BARBARA: It was nice to meet
you.
Thank you very much.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.530
>> RUSHKOFF: Barbara's just one
of hundreds in this season's
crop.
It's a bounty for Hollywood

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:15.800
talent agents, who have more
vacancies for new midriffs every
day.
Jeff Marrone has discovered some

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:22.500
of the hottest teen stars in the
business.
Perhaps his biggest discovery
was an unknown teenager named

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.760
Jessica Biel.
>> JEFF MARRONE: She was my
client for five years, and I
found her here.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.200
She was onstage.
She was 12 years old.
Most people here weren't
interested in her.

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.030
She didn't-- I don't think--
really win any awards.
And she was 12 years old, and
she was... she was, like, way

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.800
too tall for her age.
And she was singing the "Lullaby
of Broadway," and, I think,
doing fan kicks or something

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.330
like that, and I just went, "Oh,
my gosh!
There's a star."
>> RUSHKOFF: Jessica Biel's

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:54.860
first big part was on a
fledgling television network
devoted to the teenager: the WB.
She played a minister's daughter

00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:00.800
on the wholesome teen drama "7th
Heaven."
"7th Heaven" was part of the
WB's newly devised formula,

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:09.760
radical by the standards of teen
television: keep it clean.
>> BOB BIBB: Everyone else was
going to edgy route, so maybe we

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:13.960
ought to go completely
different.
And there was about a year
period where we went family-

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:19.830
friendly.
And I think our slogan was
"Where America's families can
watch television together."

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:25.060
>> WOMAN: You have done so well
at regaining your balance,
getting back on track with your
diet and exercise.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.700
I'm very proud of you.
>> BIBB: That was a novel
approach at the time because,
except for maybe "The Wonderful

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:36.360
World of Disney," families could
not watch television together.
So, you know, programming and
marketing met, and we thought

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:42.700
that's going to be our angle.
>> RUSHKOFF: But the WB's
family-friendly shows had to
compete against programming like

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:50.600
this-- the eye-grabbing sex
scenes of "Beverly Hills 90210"
and other risque teen dramas.
>> Girl: Let's take off all our

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:55.100
clothes.
>> RUSHKOFF: By its third
season, the WB made a course
change.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.400
>> Paula Cole: [music] I don't want
to wait for our lives
to be over... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: Their new

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:09.400
trajectory: "Dawson's Creek," a
show about a group of sex-
obsessed high school friends in
an idyllic Cape Cod town.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:16.060
On "Dawson's" first episode, one
of its lead characters, 14-year-
old Pacey, begins a sexual
affair with his teacher.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:21.960
>> WOMAN: I'm sorry.
>> BIBB: It had attractive
teens, and it spoke to
especially the female audience,

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.160
but at the same time the
"Newsweeks" and the "Time"
magazines were writing about
this rather risque show, where a

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:32.000
14-year-old boy was having a
romance with his teacher.
>> RUSHKOFF: You needed that
plot line to really give it a

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.330
bang.
>> BIBB: To give it a bang.
>> GIRL: So, Jen, you a virgin?
>> BOY: That's mature!

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:40.860
>> GIRL: Well, because Dawson is
a virgin, and two virgins really
makes for a clumsy first
encounter, don't you think?

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:47.230
>> RUSHKOFF: In bringing teen
sexual content to what had
always been network TV's 8:00
family hour, "Dawson's Creek"

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:54.630
and the WB made the headlines.
However reluctantly, they had
raised the sexual stakes even
further.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:37:02.730
What would teens come to expect
from TV now?
Who would top "Dawson's"?
MTV, that's who, by launching a

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:10.500
new nighttime soap unambiguously
entitled "Undressed."
Dispensing with plot almost
completely, its quick-cut,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:20.800
channel-surf-resistant vignettes
draw their characters so thinly
they nearly disappear.
>> WOMAN: Come here.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:27.460
>> RUSHKOFF: It's sex TV's
answer to wrestling-- stringing
together explosions of pop to
keep its teen audience hooked.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:33.760
>> GIRL: I'll give you something
you've been obsessing about ever
since our parents got married.
>> RUSHKOFF: Meanwhile, at the

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:41.630
Cineplex, amped-up efforts, like
"Cruel Intentions," were
bringing unprecedented sexual
sophistication to teen movies.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:47.630
One of the biggest teen hits of
1999, "Cruel Intentions" is the
story of two spoiled step-
siblings.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:52.830
She promises to sleep with him
if he will sexually humiliate
her rival.
>> GIRL: You can put it

00:37:52.830 --> 00:38:01.900
anywhere.
>> NEAL MORITZ: Right here the
audience will be freaking out.
>> RUSHKOFF: Neal Moritz, the

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:08.860
producer of "Cruel Intentions,"
is one of the most successful
teen impresarios in Hollywood.
>> MORITZ: I mean, I definitely

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.530
want to push the envelope with
my movies because, to me, if
you're making the same thing
that everybody else is making,

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.660
then you don't have much chance
of getting people to come to
your movies.
And for me, I love making

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:24.860
movies, and the only way I'm
going to get to be able to keep
making movies is by making
movies that do business.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:31.100
>> GIRL: Down, boy.
>> MORITZ: A movie like I have,
"Cruel Intentions," where we go
off and we make it for $12

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:36.060
million, we do $40 million here,
we do $60 million overseas.
There's $100 million in the box
office, plus all the ancillary

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:42.930
markets, whether it be
videocassette or cable or all
these other markets.
You know, there's tremendous

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:52.160
streams of revenue coming in.
(<i> boy screaming</i> )
>> RUSHKOFF: Moritz's films have
come under intense scrutiny for

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.700
their sex and violence.
One was even included in a
government investigation because
it was test-marketed to 11- and

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:06.260
12-year-olds.
Still, he makes no apologies
about going for the jugular.
>> MORITZ: I think what you

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.100
can't do is play down to
teenagers, play down to the
young people.
No teenager is going to be

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:14.860
satisfied with a PG-13-rated
horror film, okay?
They want to see the blood and
guts.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:19.430
That's what they want to do.
They want to see the slasher
element of those films.
And you can't do that the way

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:27.130
they want to see it and get a
PG-13 rating.
>> RUSHKOFF: But even those with
the best of intentions get

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:32.860
caught in the downward spiral of
sex and violence.
We noticed a kind of
schizophrenia on the set of

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:40.460
"Dawson's Creek."
At times, the show feels like
"The Waltons" injected with a
dose of "Beverly Hills 90210."

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:47.100
Two of its main characters are
staunch virgins into their
senior year of high school, but
as if to keep the show cool,

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:53.460
everyone around them is either
having sex or talking about it
incessantly.
>> BOY: Do you guys keep a

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.200
running tally of all the losers
you've dated?
>> GIRL: Only the ones we've
slept with.

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.830
>> SUSANNE DANIELS: What do you
think kids talk about?
What do you think teenagers talk
about?

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:06.660
Teenagers talk about sex.
Teenagers are consumed with sex.
It is my personal opinion that
teenagers should not be having

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:16.260
sex, but... but they are...
they're confronted with it in
terms of advertising, and they
see it on television in prime-

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:24.830
time shows and, in fact, in
daytime shows.
We have really taken sex
responsibly-- I feel that the WB

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:35.600
has-- and tried to portray
ramifications of it, why and how
and when and where to say no.
>> RUSHKOFF: "Dawson's" writers

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:41.230
and producers are aware that
this is treacherous terrain.
Here they are in a production
meeting, getting a lesson in

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:46.760
accountability from a team of
teen sex experts called the
Media Project.
>> WOMAN: Give me a good

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:54.060
comeback line if a guy says,
"Wearing a condom doesn't feel
good."
(<i> laughter</i> )

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.160
>> WOMAN: Oh, come on!
You're writers here!
>> MAN: Oh, I've got it.
I've got one.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:04.560
"Neither does herpes."
>> WOMAN: Ooh!
>> RUSHKOFF: 28-year-old Greg
Berlanti is executive producer

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:12.430
of "Dawson's Creek."
>> GREG BERLANTI: Why not lean
into the fact that these kind of
topics are being discussed?

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:20.860
Why not be aware of that, and
through that awareness help kids
to redefine and help people to
redefine how they deal with that

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:29.630
information, as opposed to
trying to put another finger in
the dam when it's going to bust?
>> RUSHKOFF: The makers of teen

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:35.800
TV argue that they're only
reflecting the real world.
Sex is a part of teens' lives,
so it better be in their media,

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.860
too.
Media is just a mirror, after
all.
Or is it?

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.260
>><i> RICKY MARTIN: [music] Shake</i>
<i>your bon-bon</i>
<i>[music] shake your bon-bon</i>
<i>shake your bon-bon... [music]</i>

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.960
>> WOMAN: It seemed everyone
wanted to show off their bum
last year.
>> RUSHKOFF: Take the annual

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.900
migration of college and high
school kids to spring break.
For the past 15 years, MTV has
packaged spring break into a

00:41:53.900 --> 00:42:01.100
staged television performance,
and then repackaged it through
the year on show after show.
>> JERRY SPRINGER: Hop on and

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:07.930
ride him around!
(<i> cheers and catcalls</i> )
>> RUSHKOFF: Kids are invited to
participate in sexual contests

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:13.130
on stage or are followed by MTV
cameras through their week of
debauchery.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:27.560
Sure, some kids have always
acted wild, but never have these
antics been so celebrated on TV.
So of course kids take it as a

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:34.760
cue, like here on the strip in
Panama Beach, Florida, where
high schoolers carry on in
public, as if they were on some

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:45.030
MTV sound stage.
Who is mirroring whom?
Real life and TV life have begun
to blur.

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:51.030
Is the media really reflecting
the world of kids or is it the
other way around?
The answer is increasingly hard

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:53.630
to make out.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:04.730
I'll never forget the moment
that 13-year-old Barbara and her
friends spotted our crew during
a party between their auditions.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:12.660
They appeared to be dancing for
us, for our camera, as if to
sell back to us, the media, what
we had sold to them.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:22.360
And that's when it hit me: it's
a giant feedback loop.
The media watches kids and then
sells them an image of

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:29.360
themselves.
Then kids watch those images and
aspire to be that mook or
midriff in the TV set.

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:35.760
And the media is there watching
them do that in order to craft
new images for them, and so on.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:45.900
Is there any way to escape the
feedback loop?
These kids believe they have.
Downtown Detroit on Halloween

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:51.560
night...
>> BOY: Juggaloes!
>> RUSHKOFF: A few thousand
mostly white young men have

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:59.300
gathered to hear a concert by
their favorite hometown band:
Insane Clown Posse.
I.C.P. helped found a musical

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:06.700
genre called rap metal or rage
rock, which has created a stir
across the country for its shock
lyrics and ridicule of women and

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:13.560
gays.
>> BOY: Yeah!
That's right motherf++ker!
Psychopathic bitch!

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.800
Yeah!
>> BOY: Who's going titty
f++king?
>> CROWD: We're going titty

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.200
f++king.
Who's going titty f++king?
We're going titty f++king!
Who's going titty f++king?

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:30.130
We're going titty f++king!
Right.
>> RUSHKOFF: Subcultures like
this are increasingly rare in

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:38.030
America, a true underground,
where kids feel spurned by
mainstream culture and like it.
A lot of people seem to... seem

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:42.360
to sense, like, anger coming off
Juggaloes, because there's a lot
of, like, middle finger stuff,
you know.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.230
I mean, who's the middle finger
to?
>> BOY: The middle finger is to
everybody who doesn't understand

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:50.330
what we're doing.
It's to the world.
>> BOY: To the mainstream.
>> BOY: It's to people who don't

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:54.430
understand, the people like
these people who drive by
honking their horns, drive by
laughing at us.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:58.560
We don't care, and that's who
the middle fingers and the f++k
yous are for.
>> BOY: F++k... I mean, to hell

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:03.000
with society, you know.
I mean, we worry about society
and what they think.
They control what goes on in our

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.500
bedroom, you know, what we dress
like, what our hair color is.
Why let it control it here?
This is where we have fun.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:20.200
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )
>> I.C.P.: [music] Dead bodies
dead bodies
all over the street

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:28.730
[music] 55, 65 bodies at least... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: Rock music has
always channeled rebellion, but
where it used to be directed

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:35.030
against parents, teachers, or
the government, today it is
directed against slick
commercialism itself, against

00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:45.830
MTV.
These fans feel loyalty to this
band and this music because they
experience it as their own.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:52.960
It hasn't been processed by
corporations, digested into
popular culture, and sold back
to them at the mall.

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.660
>> MAN: Everybody that likes our
music feels a super connection.
That's why all those Juggaloes
here, they feel so connected to

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:04.960
it because it's... it's
exclusively theirs.
See, when something's on the
radio, it's for everybody.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:09.000
You know what I mean?
It's everybody's song.
"Oh, this is my song."
That ain't your song.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.900
It's on the radio.
It's everybody's song.
But to listen to I.C.P., you
feel like you're the only one

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:19.260
that knows about it.
>> I.C.P.: [music] Man, f++k
that bitch... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: These are the

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:25.800
extremes to which teens are
willing to go to insure the
authenticity of their own scene.
It's the front line of teen

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:34.460
cultural resistance: become so
crude, so intolerable, and break
so many rules that you become
indigestible.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:41.730
>> I.C.P.: [music] Bitch, you's a ho
and, ho, you's a bitch
come on... [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: Rage rock is a

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:49.700
double-dog dare to the
mainstream marketing machine:
"just try to market this."
And the thing is, that's exactly

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:55.830
what they've done.
Consider the engineered rise of
Limp Bizkit.
Remember them?

00:46:55.830 --> 00:47:05.060
It turns out that the nastiest
expressions of youth culture are
manna to an industry ravenous
for anything authentic to sell.

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:12.960
Bizkit is a rage rock band that
leaves critics cold, but ignites
fans with incendiary lyrics.
America first got to know them

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:19.830
at Woodstock '99, rage rock's
coming-out party, as covered by
MTV.
>> LIMP BIZKIT: [music] It's just one

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:26.260
of those days... [music]
>> MAN: The heat burned on, and
conditions grew more
intolerable.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:31.260
And for some angry concertgoers,
songs like Limp Bizkit's "Break
Stuff" became a mantra.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:48:01.630
>> RUSHKOFF: How does a band
like them become superstars?
Follow this well tested recipe.
Always on the lookout for the

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:07.960
rawest of raw material, Jimmy
Iovine, the enormously
successful head of Interscope
Records, finds a controversial

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:15.560
band and packages them for the
mainstream, all the while
claiming he's just responding to
demand.

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:23.560
>> JIMMY IOVINE: There's no way
to stop a... a movement in
popular culture.
There's just no way to stop it.

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:29.900
It's going to happen with or
without you.
There's absolutely no way to
stop that train.

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:35.960
>> RUSHKOFF: But when an Oregon
radio station shied away from
the band's crass lyrics,
Interscope paid them to play one

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:44.330
of Bizkit's songs 50 times.
Then Interscope funded Bizkit's
first video, which was premiered
on MTV's nod to democracy,

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:50.460
"Total Request Live."
>> ANN POWERS: I mean, I guess
you could say "Total Request
Live" is democratic in the way

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:56.660
that, you know, this year's
election was democratic.
The candidates... the field of
candidates is very small, and

00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:04.330
there are organizations behind
them-- not unlike the Democratic
and Republican parties-- who are
deciding which candidates get

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:12.160
promoted.
So in other words, you can't
just be, you know, Joe Fabulous
who's releasing your little

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:18.330
indie record and get on "Total
Request Live."
>> RUSHKOFF: Having declared
them worthy of a slot on

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:25.000
"T.R.L.," MTV now also had a
stake in making Limp Bizkit
stars.
The network put the band on

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:34.460
their "Spring Break" special.
(<i> Limp Bizkit playing</i> )
>> MAN: When<i> Spring Break</i> aired,
you could see a sales change the

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:40.230
following week.
And that's the kind of reaction
that a killer performance at
spring break gives.

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:44.660
>> LIMP BIZKIT: [music] Get your ass
up! [music]
>> RUSHKOFF: One part authentic
rage, two parts marketing,

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:51.330
sprinkle with cash, and place in
a preheated oven called
Woodstock '99.
The night after Bizkit's

00:49:51.330 --> 00:49:59.560
performance, the festival
erupted in flames.
The band's goading of the crowd
was blamed, perhaps unfairly,

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:07.130
for the mayhem which ensued.
By the time the smoke had
cleared, four young women
reported being raped.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:12.400
But the band had made the big
time.
Bizkit's lead singer became a
senior vice president at

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:19.460
Interscope Records.
And the band's relationship with
MTV had become so cozy that they
put a picture of executive Dave

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:26.500
Sirulnick in their album liner
notes, and made casual drop-ins
at their old stomping grounds,
"T.R.L."

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.000
>> FRED DURST: I just happened
to be in Times Square.
"T.R.L." was going on.
I was, like, "Whoa, what time is

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.630
it?"
>> CARSON DALEY: I was using my
little two-way that day, and I
got it right before the show

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:38.730
started.
>> DURST: I two-wayed Carson.
He said, "Come on up."
>> RUSHKOFF: So when it came

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:43.630
time to release a new album,
Bizkit naturally turned to their
friends at "T.R.L." to help sell
it.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:50.300
And sell it did, faster than any
rock album in history.
>> DALEY: This is kind of an
important moment, you guys being

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:54.860
on "T.R.L."
At some point today, you know,
it's weird to say, millions of
kids will go out and buy this

00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:00.130
record.
>> RUSHKOFF: And thus a band is
made.
Of course, it's impossible to

00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:06.500
know what would have happened to
Limp Bizkit and rage rock were
MTV and Interscope Records not
behind them.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.160
>> DURST: Hey, what's up?
We're Limp Bizkit, and you're
watching "T.R.L." if you didn't
notice already.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:14.630
>> RUSHKOFF: Perhaps they would
have made it to the top on their
own merits.
But that's just the point.

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:21.300
No one can ever know, once MTV
and Interscope Records have
placed their bets.
The success of Limp Bizkit and

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:30.660
rage rock was all but
preordained.
The cool hunt ends here, with
teen rebellion itself becoming

00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:39.660
just another product.
>> CRISPIN-MILLER: Often there's
a kind of official and
systematic rebelliousness that's

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:48.430
reflected in, in media products
pitched at kids.
It's part of the official rock
video world view.

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:54.800
It's part of the official
advertising world view that
"your parents are creeps,
teachers are nerds and idiots,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:02.100
authority figures are laughable,
nobody can really understand
kids except the corporate
sponsor."

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:11.830
That huge authority has,
interestingly enough, emerged as
the sort of tacit superhero of
consumer culture.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:20.900
That's the coolest entity of
all.
>> RUSHKOFF: So is there
anywhere the commercial machine

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:32.130
won't go?
Is it leaving any room for kids
to create a culture of their
own?

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:40.830
Do they even have anything
that's theirs alone?
All eyes are on our kids.
They know they're being watched.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:49.730
But what or whom can they look
to themselves?
And what if they turn and fight?
The battle itself is sponsored,

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:53.660
packaged, and sold right back to
them.

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:07.930
Oh, and by the way, those rebels
in clown makeup from Detroit?
They've signed with a major
label, produced some slick music

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:16.130
videos, even got themselves on
World Championship Wrestling.
And lo and behold, their latest
album hit number 20 on the

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:20.700
charts.
Welcome to the machine.
