00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.070


2
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.400
Come now, what masques, what dances shall we have

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.230
to wear away the long age of three hours

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.170
between our after-supper and bed-time?

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.630
Where is our usual manager of mirth?

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.630
What revels are in hand?

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.770
Is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour?

8
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.900
Call Philostrate.

9
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.300
Here, mighty Theseus.

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.630
Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?

11
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.730
What masque?

12
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.100
What music?

13
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.530
How shall we beguile the lazy time, if not with some delight?

14
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.070
There is a brief how many sports are ripe.

15
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.900
Make choice of which your highness will see first.

16
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.130
"The battle with the Centaurs

17
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.700
to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp."

18
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.100
We'll none of that.

19
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.270
That have I told my love in glory of my kinsman Hercules.

20
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.070
"The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals

21
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.330
tearing the Thracian singer in their rage."

22
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.000
That is an old device, and it was played

23
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.900
when I from Thebes came last a conqueror.

24
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.830
"The thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning,

25
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.000
late deceased in beggary."

26
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.600
That is some satire, keen and critical,

27
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.800
not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.

28
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.400
"A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus and his love Thisbe,

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.630
very tragical mirth."

30
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.670
Merry and tragical.

31
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.800
Tedious and brief.

32
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.870
That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.

33
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.900
How shall we find the concord of this discord?

34
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.530
A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,

35
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.530
which is as brief as I have known a play.

36
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.070
But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,

37
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.530
which makes it tedious.

38
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.770
For in all the play, there is not one word apt,

39
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.130
one player fitted.

40
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.900
And tragical, my noble lord, it is.

41
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.770
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.

42
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530
Which, when I saw rehearsed,

43
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.730
I must confess made mine eyes water,

44
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.930
but more merry tears the passion of loud laughter never shed.

45
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200
What are they that do play it?

46
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.230
Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,

47
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.300
which never laboured in their minds till now

48
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.770
and now have toiled their unbreathed memories

49
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.100
with this same play against your nuptial.

50
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.170
And we will hear it.

51
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.330
No, my noble lord.

52
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.630
It is not for you.

53
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.300
I have heard it over, and it is nothing, nothing in the world.

54
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.100
Unless you can find sport in their intents,

55
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.670
extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain

56
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.270
to do you service.

57
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.970
I will hear that play, for never anything can be amiss

58
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.700
when simpleness and duty tender it.

59
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.300
Go, bring them in.

60
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.330
I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged

61
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.830
and duty in his service perishing.

62
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.030
Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.

63
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.900
He says they can do nothing in this kind.

64
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.000
The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.

65
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.400
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake.

66
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.230
And what poor duty cannot do,

67
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.970
noble respect takes it in might, not merit.

68
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.500
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed

69
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.100
to greet me with premeditated welcomes

70
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.370
where I have seen them shiver and look pale,

71
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.230
make periods in the midst of sentences,

72
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.570
throttle their practised accents in their fears,

73
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.600
and in conclusion, dumbly have broke off,

74
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.000
not paying me a welcome.

75
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.570
Trust me, sweet, out of this silence yet I picked a welcome.

76
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.030
And in the modesty of fearful duty,

77
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.130
I read as much as in the rattling tongue

78
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.500
of saucy and audacious eloquence.

79
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.630
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity

80
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.930
in least speak most to my capacity.

81
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.330
So please your grace, the Prologue is addressed.

82
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.430
Let him approach.

83
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.700
If we offend, it is with our good will.

84
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.430
That you should think we come not to offend,

85
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.370
but with good will

86
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.730
to show our simple skill.

87
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.300
Th--

88
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.670
That is the true beginning of our end.

89
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.100
Consider then we come but in despite.

90
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.170
We do not come as minding to content you.

91
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.630
Our true intent is all for your delight.

92
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.100
We are not here that you should here repent you,

93
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.200
The actors are at hand, and by their show,

94
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.530
you shall know all that you are like to know.

95
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.630
Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show.

96
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.470
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.

97
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.970
This man is Pyramus, if you would know.

98
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.600
This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.

99
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.070
This man, with lime and rough-cast,

100
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.130
doth present Wall,

101
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.130
that vile wall which did these lovers sunder.

102
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.830
And through Wall's chink, poor souls,

103
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.400
they are content to whisper.

104
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.530
At the which let no man wonder.

105
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.300
This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,

106
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.370
presenteth Moonshine;

107
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.630
For, if you will know, by moonshine

108
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.170
did these lovers think no scorn to meet at Ninus' tomb,

109
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.630
there, there to woo.

110
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.770
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,

111
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.500
the trusty Thisbe, coming first by night,

112
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.430
did scare away, or rather did affright.

113
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.470
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,

114
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.970
which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.

115
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.600
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall

116
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.870
and finds his trusty Thisbe's mantle slain.

117
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.500
Whereat, with blade, with bloody, blameful blade,

118
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.300
he bravely broached his boiling, bloody breast.

119
00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.030
And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,

120
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:04.030
his dagger drew and died.

121
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.800
For all the rest, let Lion, Moonshine, Wall,

122
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.170
and lovers twain at large discourse

123
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.100
while here they do remain.

124
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.600
In this same interlude, it doth befall that I,

125
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.970
one Snout by name, present a wall.

126
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.430
And such a wall, as I will have you think,

127
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.970
that had in it a crannied hole or chink

128
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.970
through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,

129
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.770
did whisper often very secretly.

130
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.070
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone

131
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.300
doth show that I am that same wall.

132
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.930
The truth is so, and this the cranny is,

133
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.230
right and sinister,

134
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.770
through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

135
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.800
Oh, grim-looked night.

136
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.930
Oh, night with hue so black.

137
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.800
Oh, night, which ever art when day is not.

138
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.230
Oh, night, Oh, night.

139
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.600
Alack, alack, alack,

140
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.270
I fear my Thisbe's promise is forgot.

141
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:12.300
And thou, oh, wall, oh sweet, oh, lovely wall

142
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.800
that standest between her father's ground and mine.

143
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.100
Thou wall, oh, wall, oh, sweet and lovely wall,

144
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.730
show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.

145
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.100
Thanks, courteous wall.

146
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.030
Jove shield thee well for this.

147
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.830
But what see I?

148
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.970
No Thisbe do I see.

149
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.570
Oh, wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss.

150
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.130
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me.

151
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.270
The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.

152
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.230
No, in truth, sir, he should not.

153
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.200
"Deceiving me" is Thisbe's cue.

154
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.830
She is to enter now, and I am to spy her through the wall.

155
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.400
You shall see, it will fall pat as I told you.

156
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.900
Oh, wall, full often hast thou heard my moans

157
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.370
for parting my fair Pyramus and me.

158
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.130
My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,

159
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.400
thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

160
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.600
I see a voice.

161
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.970
Now will I to the chink to spy.

162
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.700
An I can hear my Thisbe's face.

163
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.970
Thisbe.

164
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.130
My love, thou art my love, I think.

165
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.270
Think what thou wilt.

166
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.370
I am thy lover's grace.

167
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.570
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.

168
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.400
And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.

169
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.500
Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.

170
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.530
As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.

171
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:45.470
Oh, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.

172
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.570
I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.

173
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.830
Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?

174
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.600
'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.

175
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.030
Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so.

176
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:07.570
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.

177
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.100
This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.

178
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.500
The best in this kind are but shadows.

179
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.070
And the worst are no worse if imagination amend them.

180
00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.900
It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.

181
00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.700
If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves,

182
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.300
they may pass for excellent men.

183
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.030
Ladies, you whose gentle hearts

184
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.670
do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor

185
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.170
may now perchance both quake and tremble here

186
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.500
when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.

187
00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.270
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner,

188
00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:39.130
am a lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;.

189
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.100
For, if I should as Lion

190
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.830
come in strife into your place,

191
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.870
'twere pity on my life.

192
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.700
A very gentle beast of a good conscience.

193
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.100
Let us listen to the moon.

194
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.970
This lantern doth the horned moon,

195
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.870
the horned moon present.

196
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:04.530
Myself the man in the moon do seem to be.

197
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.700
This is the greatest error of all the rest.

198
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.530
The man should be put into the lantern.

199
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.730
How is it else the man in the moon?

200
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:12.700
He dare not come there for the candle.

201
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.430
For, you see, it is already in snuff.

202
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.370
I am aweary of this moon.

203
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.970
Would it would change.

204
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.400
It would appear, by his small light of discretion,

205
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.130
that he is in the wane.

206
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.470
But yet, in courtesy, in all reason,

207
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.430
we must stay the time.

208
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.870
Proceed, Moon.

209
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.070
All that I have to say

210
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:37.030
is to tell you that the lantern is the moon;

211
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.300
I, the man in the moon;

212
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.070
this thorn-bush, my thorn-bush;

213
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.800
and this dog, my dog.

214
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.830
This is old Ninny's tomb.

215
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.770
Where is my love?

216
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.600
ARR!!

217
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.470
Well roared, Lion.

218
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:03.970
Well run, Thisbe.

219
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.400
Well shone, Moon.

220
00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.330
Well moused, Lion.

221
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.230
And then came Pyramus.

222
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.700
And so the lion vanished.

223
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.230
Sweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.

224
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.100
I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright.

225
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.300
For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,

226
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:29.900
I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.

227
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.600
But stay, O spite.

228
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.130
But mark, poor knight, what dreadful dole is here.

229
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.000
Eyes, do you see?

230
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.170
How can it be?

231
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.170
Oh, dainty duck.

232
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.330
Oh, dear.

233
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:51.530
Thy mantle good, what, stained with blood!

234
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.670
Approach, ye Furies fell.

235
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.730
Oh, Fates, come, come.

236
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.070
Cut thread and thrum.

237
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.600
Quail, crush, conclude, and quell.

238
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.970
Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.

239
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.030
Oh, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lion's frame?

240
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:13.830
Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear,

241
00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.270
which is--

242
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.430
no, no--

243
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:18.970
which was the fairest dame

244
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.730
that lived, that loved, that liked,

245
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.200
that looked with cheer.

246
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:32.030
Come, tears, confound.

247
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:38.730
Out, sword, and wound the pap of Pyramus.

248
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:44.600
Ay, that left pap, where heart doth hop.

249
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:52.800
Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.

250
00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:57.730
Now am I dead,

251
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:01.570
Now am I fled.

252
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.930
My soul is in the sky.

253
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.500
Tongue, lose thy light.

254
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.300
Moon, take thy flight.

255
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.930
Now die...die...

256
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:26.100
die..die...die...

257
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.800
die.

258
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.370
How chance Moonshine is gone

259
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.530
before Thisbe comes back and finds her lover?

260
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:38.630
She will find him by starlight.

261
00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.870
Here she comes.

262
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.330
And her passion ends the play.

263
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.800
What, dead, my dove?

264
00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.470
O Pyramus, arise!

265
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.200
Speak, speak.

266
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.370
Quite dumb.

267
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.800
Dead, dead.

268
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.870
A tomb must cover thy sweet eyes.

269
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.830
These lily lips, this cherry nose,

270
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:08.570
these yellow cowslip cheeks are gone, are gone.

271
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:12.700
Oh, lovers, make moan.

272
00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.500
His eyes were green as leeks.

273
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.700
Oh, Sisters three, come, come to me.

274
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.700
With hands as pale as milk, lay them in gore

275
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.570
since you have shore with shears his thread of silk.

276
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.000
Tongue, not a word.

277
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.930
Come, trusty sword.

278
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:44.030
Come, blade, my breast imbrue.

279
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:50.600
And, farewell, friends.

280
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.170
Thus Thisbe ends.

281
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:03.670
Adieu, adieu, adieu.

282
00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.970
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.

283
00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:10.900
Ay, and Wall too.

284
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.130
No, I assure you;

285
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:15.470
the wall is down that parted their fathers.

286
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.770
Will it please you to see the epilogue

287
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:20.730
or to hear a Bergomask dance between our company?

288
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:22.400
Uh, no epilogue, I pray you,

289
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.400
for your play needs no excuse.

290
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.770
Never excuse,

291
00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:29.070
for when all the players are dead, there need none to be blamed.

292
00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.200
But come, your Bergomask.

293
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.500
Let your epilogue alone.

294
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.630
The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.

295
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.930
Lovers, to bed.

296
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.530
'Tis almost fairy time.

297
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:18.670
I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn

298
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.730
as much as we this night have over-watched.

299
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.700
This palpable-gross play

300
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.630
hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night.

301
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.400
Sweet friends, to bed.

302
00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:33.730
Now the hungry lion roars, and the wolf behowls the moon

303
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:36.000
whilst the heavy ploughman snores,

304
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.230
all with weary task fordone.

305
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.530
Now the wasted brands do glow,

306
00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.530
whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,

307
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.170
puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud.

308
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.230
Now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide,

309
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:53.730
every one lets forth his sprite,

310
00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.630
in the church-way paths to glide.

311
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.300
And we fairies, that do run by the triple Hecate's team

312
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.030
from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream

313
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.170
now are frolic.

314
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.170
Not a mouse shall disturb this hallowed house.

315
00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:09.200
I am sent with broom before

316
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.330
to sweep the dust behind the door.

317
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.300
Through the house, give gathering light.

318
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.970
By the dead and drowsy fire,

319
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.270
every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier.

320
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:21.130
And this ditty, after me, sing and dance it trippingly.

321
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:22.800
First, rehearse your song by rote

322
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.230
to each word a warbling note.

323
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.930
Hand in hand, with fairy grace, will we sing and bless this place.

324
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.700
Now, until the break of day, through this house each fairy stray.

325
00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.100
To the best bride-bed will we,

326
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.030
which by us shall blessed be.

327
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.030
And the issue there create ever shall be fortunate.

328
00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.970
So shall all the couples three ever true in loving be.

329
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.500
And the blots of Nature's hand shall not in their issue stand.

330
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.870
Never mole, hare lip, nor scar, nor mark prodigious,

331
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.670
such as are despised in nativity,

332
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.730
shall upon their children be.

333
00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:04.470
With this field-dew consecrate, every fairy take his gait.

334
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.300
And each several chamber bless, through this palace,

335
00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.670
with sweet peace.

336
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:14.630
And the owner of it blessed ever shall in safety rest.

337
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.030
Trip away.

338
00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:17.300
Make no stay.

339
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.100
Meet me all by break of day.

340
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.470
If we shadows have offended,

341
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.870
think but this, and all is mended,

342
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.930
that you have but slumbered here while these visions did appear.

343
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.800
And this weak and idle themeno more yielding but a dream.

344
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.500
Gentles, do not reprehend.

345
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.600
If you pardon, we will mend.

346
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:14.900
And, as I am an honest Puck, if we have unearned luck

347
00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.830
now to escape the serpent's tongue,

348
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.700
we will make amends ere long, else the Puck a liar call.

349
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.630
So, good night unto you all.

350
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.700
