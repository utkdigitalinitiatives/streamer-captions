00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.430


2
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.470
Now old desire doth in hisdeath-bed lie,

3
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.800
And young affection gapesto be his heir;

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.100
That fair for which lovegroan'd for and would die,

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.470
With tender Julietmatch'd, is now not fair.

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.370
Now Romeo is beloved andloves again,

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.370
Alike betwitched by thecharm of looks,

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.030
But to his foe supposed hemust complain,

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.830
And she steal love's sweetbait from fearful hooks:

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.230
Being held a foe, he maynot have access

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.170
To use those vows aslovers use to swear;

12
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.500
And she as much in love,her means much less

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.270
To meet her new-belovedany where:

14
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.100
But passion lends thempower, time means, to meet

15
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.430
Tempering extremities withextreme sweet.

16
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.970
Can I go forward when myheart is here?

17
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.300
Turn back, dull earth, andfind thy centre out.

18
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.530
My cousin Romeo!

19
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.300
Romeo!

20
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.470
He is wise;

21
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.830
And, on my life, hathstol'n him home to bed.

22
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.000
He ran this way, andleap'd that orchard wall:

23
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.470
Call, good Mercutio.

24
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.930
Nay, I'll conjure too.

25
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870
Romeo!

26
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.800
Humours!

27
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.670
Madman!

28
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.270
Passion!

29
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.870
Lover!

30
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.170
Appear thou in thelikeness of a sigh:

31
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.730
Speak but one rhyme, and Iam satisfied;

32
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.630
Cry but 'Ay me!' pronouncebut 'love' and 'dove;'

33
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.630
Speak to my gossip Venusone fair word,

34
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.200
One nick-name for herpurblind son and heir.

35
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.870
He heareth not, hestirreth not, he movethnot;

36
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.630
The ape is dead, and Imust conjure him.

37
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.430
I conjure thee byRosaline's bright eyes,

38
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.070
By her high forehead andher scarlet lip,

39
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.530
By her fine foot, straightleg and quivering thigh

40
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.200
And the demesnes thatthere adjacent lie,

41
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.400
That in thy likeness thouappear to us!

42
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.930
And if he hear thee, thouwilt anger him.

43
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.130
This cannot anger him:'twould anger him

44
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.030
To raise a spirit in hismistress' circle

45
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.070
Of some strange nature,letting it there stand

46
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.630
Till she had laid it andconjured it down;

47
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.300
That were some spite: myinvocation

48
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.800
Is fair and honest, and inhis mistress' name

49
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.470
I conjure only but toraise up him.

50
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.300
Come, he hath hid himselfamong these trees,

51
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.900
To be consorted with thehumorous night:

52
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.730
Blind is his love and bestbefits the dark.

53
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.970
If love be blind, lovecannot hit the mark.

54
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.770
Now will he sit under amedlar tree,

55
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.000
And wish his mistress werethat kind of fruit

56
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.170
That maids call medlars,when they laugh alone.

57
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:06.230
O, Romeo, that she were,O, that she were

58
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:15.700
An open et caetera, thou apoperin pear!

59
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:22.070
Romeo, good night: I'll tomy truckle-bed;

60
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.900
This field-bed is too coldfor me to sleep:

61
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.570
Come, shall we go?

62
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.530
Go, then; for 'tis in vain

63
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.430
To seek him here thatmeans not to be found.

64
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.570
He jests at scars thatnever felt a wound.

65
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.970
But, soft!

66
00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:03.100
What light through yonderwindow breaks?

67
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:11.370
It is the east, and Julietis the sun.

68
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.170
Arise, fair sun, and killthe envious moon,

69
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.400
Who is already sick andpale with grief,

70
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.230
That thou her maid art farmore fair than she:

71
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.500
Be not her maid, since sheis envious;

72
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.930
Her vestal livery is butsick and green

73
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.970
And none but fools do wearit; cast it off.

74
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.070
It is my lady,

75
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.630
O, it is my love!

76
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.300
O, that she knew she were!

77
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.800
She speaks yet she saysnothing: what of that?

78
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.030
Her eye discourses; I willanswer it.

79
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.800
I am too bold, 'tis not tome she speaks:

80
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.800
Two of the fairest starsin all the heaven,

81
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.000
Having some business, doentreat her eyes

82
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.700
To twinkle in theirspheres till they return.

83
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.730
What if her eyes werethere, they in her head?

84
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.430
The brightness of hercheek would shame thosestars,

85
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.930
As daylight doth a lamp;her eyes in heaven

86
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.370
Would through the airyregion stream so bright

87
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.200
That birds would sing andthink it were not night.

88
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.300
See, how she leans hercheek upon her hand!

89
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.170
O, that I were a gloveupon that hand,

90
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.370
That I might touch thatcheek!

91
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.000
Ay me!

92
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.230
She speaks: O, speakagain, bright angel!

93
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.430
For thou art

94
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.170
As glorious to this night,being o'er my head

95
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.030
As is a winged messengerof heaven

96
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.800
Unto the white-upturnedwondering eyes

97
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.800
Of mortals that fall backto gaze on him

98
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.800
When he bestrides thelazy-pacing clouds

99
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.500
And sails upon the bosomof the air.

100
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.370
O Romeo, Romeo!

101
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.030
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

102
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.400
Deny thy father and refusethy name;

103
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.330
Or, if thou wilt not, bebut sworn my love,

104
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:19.730
And I'll no longer be aCapulet.

105
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.070
Shall I hear more, orshall I speak at this?

106
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.300
'Tis but thy name that ismy enemy;

107
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.830
Thou art thyself, thoughnot a Montague.

108
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:31.400
What's Montague? it is norhand, nor foot,

109
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.100
Nor arm, nor face, nor anyother part

110
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.030
Belonging to a man.

111
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.600
O, be some other name!

112
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.500
What's in a name? thatwhich we call a rose

113
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.500
By any other name wouldsmell as sweet;

114
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.270
So Romeo would, were henot Romeo call'd,

115
00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.230
Retain that dearperfection which he owes

116
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:51.570
Without that title.

117
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.670
Romeo, doff thy name,

118
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.600
And for that name which isno part of thee

119
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.330
Take all myself.

120
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.200
I take thee at thy word:

121
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.130
Call me but love, and I'llbe new baptized;

122
00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.330
Henceforth I never will beRomeo.

123
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.300
What man art thou thatthus bescreen'd in night

124
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.900
So stumblest on mycounsel?

125
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:09.900
By a name I know not howto tell thee who I am:

126
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.770
My name, dear saint, ishateful to myself,

127
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.800
Because it is an enemy tothee;

128
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.270
Had I it written, I wouldtear the word.

129
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.830
My ears have not yet drunka hundred words

130
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.330
Of thy tongue's uttering,yet I know the sound:

131
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.800
Art thou not Romeo and aMontague?

132
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.870
Neither, fair maid, ifeither thee dislike.

133
00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.000
How camest thou hither,tell me, and wherefore?

134
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.970
The orchard walls are highand hard to climb,

135
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.970
And the place death,considering who thou art,

136
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.630
If any of my kinsmen findthee here.

137
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.870
With love's light wingsdid I o'er-perch thesewalls;

138
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:43.700
For stony limits cannothold love out,

139
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.670
And what love can do thatdares love attempt;

140
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.530
Therefore thy kinsmen areno stop to me.

141
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.130
If they do see thee, theywill murder thee.

142
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.000
Alack, there lies moreperil in thine eye

143
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.570
Than twenty of theirswords: look thou butsweet,

144
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.200
And I am proof againsttheir enmity.

145
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.270
I would not for the worldthey saw thee here.

146
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.800
I have night's cloak tohide me from their eyes;

147
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.730
And but thou love me, letthem find me here:

148
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.600
My life were better endedby their hate,

149
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.870
Than death prorogued,wanting of thy love.

150
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.200
By whose directionfound'st thou out thisplace?

151
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.830
By love, who first didprompt me to inquire;

152
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.500
He lent me counsel and Ilent him eyes.

153
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.970
I am no pilot; yet, wertthou as far

154
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.070
As that vast shore wash'dwith the farthest sea,

155
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.870
I should adventure forsuch merchandise.

156
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.070
Thou know'st the mask ofnight is on my face,

157
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.500
Else would a maiden blushbepaint my cheek

158
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.700
For that which thou hastheard me speak to-night.

159
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.270
Fain would I dwell onform, fain, fain deny

160
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.630
What I have spoke: butfarewell compliment!

161
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.830
Dost thou love me?

162
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.970
I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'

163
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.670
And I will take thy word:yet if thou swear'st,

164
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.600
Thou mayst prove false; atlovers' perjuries

165
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.500
They say, Jove laughs.

166
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.230
O gentle Romeo,

167
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.300
If thou dost love,pronounce it faithfully:

168
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.230
Or if thou think'st I amtoo quickly won,

169
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.900
I'll frown and be perversean say thee nay,

170
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.430
So thou wilt woo; butelse, not for the world.

171
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.670
In truth, fair Montague, Iam too fond,

172
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.000
And therefore thou maystthink my 'havior light:

173
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.900
But trust me, gentleman,I'll prove more true

174
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.130
Than those that have morecunning to be strange.

175
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.000
I should have been morestrange, I must confess,

176
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.270
But that thouoverheard'st, ere I wasware,

177
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.500
My true love's passion:therefore pardon me,

178
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.630
And not impute thisyielding to light love,

179
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:29.430
Which the dark night hathso discovered.

180
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.830
Lady, by yonder blessedmoon I vow

181
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.930
That tips with silver allthese fruit-tree tops--

182
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.270
O, swear not by the moon,the inconstant moon,

183
00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.230
That monthly changes inher circled orb,

184
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.630
Lest that thy love provelikewise variable.

185
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.100
What shall I swear by?

186
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.670
Do not swear at all;

187
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.430
Or, if thou wilt, swear bythy gracious self,

188
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.030
Which is the god of myidolatry.

189
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.800
If my heart's dear love--

190
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.730
Well, do not swear:although I joy in thee,

191
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.570
I have no joy of thiscontract to-night:

192
00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.170
It is too rash, toounadvised, too sudden;

193
00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:01.400
Too like the lightning,which doth cease to be

194
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.970
Ere one can say 'Itlightens.'

195
00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:06.330
Sweet, good night!

196
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.400
This bud of love, bysummer's ripening breath,

197
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.800
May prove a beauteousflower when next we meet.

198
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.600
Good night, good night! assweet repose and rest

199
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.800
Come to thy heart as thatwithin my breast!

200
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.400
O, wilt thou leave me sounsatisfied?

201
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.770
What satisfaction canstthou have to-night?

202
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.770
The exchange of thy love'sfaithful vow for mine.

203
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.570
I gave thee mine beforethou didst request it:

204
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:32.670
And yet I would it were togive again.

205
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.800
Wouldst thou withdraw it?For what purpose, love?

206
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.700
But to be frank, and giveit thee again.

207
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.200
And yet I wish but for thething I have:

208
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.970
My bounty is as boundlessas the sea,

209
00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.630
My love as deep; the moreI give to thee,

210
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.270
The more I have, for bothare infinite.

211
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.470
I hear some noise within;dear love, adieu!

212
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:55.000
Anon, good nurse!

213
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.430
Sweet Montague, be true.

214
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.100
Stay but a little, I willcome again.

215
00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:05.700
O blessed, blessed night!

216
00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.870
I am afeard,

217
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.230
Being in night, all thisis but a dream,

218
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:11.170
Too flattering-sweet to besubstantial.

219
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.170
Three words, dear Romeo,and good night indeed.

220
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.830
If that thy bent of lovebe honourable,

221
00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:18.030
Thy purpose marriage--

222
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.130
Yes.

223
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:20.430
send me word to-morrow,

224
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:22.370
By one that I'll procureto come to thee,

225
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.630
Where and what time thouwilt perform the rite;

226
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:27.470
And all my fortunes at thyfoot I'll lay

227
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.670
And follow thee my lordthroughout the world.

228
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:30.930
Madam!

229
00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.330
I come, anon.

230
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.730
But if thou mean'st notwell, I do beseech thee--

231
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.200
Madam!

232
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.900
By and by, I come:--

233
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.570
To cease thy suit, andleave me to my grief:

234
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:41.930
To-morrow will I send.

235
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.100
So thrive my soul.

236
00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.400
A thousand times goodnight!

237
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.870
A thousand times theworse, to want thy light.

238
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.900
Love goes toward love, asschoolboys from theirbooks,

239
00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:04.100
But love from love, towardschool with heavy looks.

240
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.770
Hist! Romeo, hist!

241
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.630
O, for a falconer's voice,

242
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.330
To lure this tassel-gentleback again!

243
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.400
Bondage is hoarse, and maynot speak aloud;

244
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.000
Else would I tear the cavewhere Echo lies,

245
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.370
And make her airy tonguemore hoarse than mine,

246
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.830
With repetition of myRomeo's name.

247
00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.000
Romeo!

248
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.500
It is my soul that callsupon my name:

249
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.330
How silver-sweet soundlovers' tongues by night,

250
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.630
Like softest music toattending ears!

251
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.800
Romeo!

252
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.400
My sweet.

253
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.930
At what o'clock to-morrowShall I send to thee?

254
00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.170
By the hour of nine.

255
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.170
I shall not fail: 'tistwenty years till then.

256
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.300
I have forgot why I didcall thee back.

257
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.800
Let me stand here tillthou remember it.

258
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.070
I shall forget, to havethee still stand there,

259
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.470
Remembering how I love thycompany.

260
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.030
And I'll still stay, tohave thee still forget,

261
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.570
Forgetting any other homebut this.

262
00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:03.130
'Tis almost morning; Iwould have thee gone:

263
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.130
And yet no further than awanton's bird;

264
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.800
That lets it hop a littlefrom her hand,

265
00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200
Like a poor prisoner inhis twisted gyves,

266
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.730
And with a silk threadplucks it back again,

267
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.400
So loving-jealous of hisliberty.

268
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.330
I would I were thy bird.

269
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.430
Sweet, so would I:

270
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.130
But I should kill theewith much cherishing.

271
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:28.670
Good night, good night!parting is such sweetsorrow,

272
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.670
That I shall say goodnight till it be morrow.

273
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:43.630
Sleep dwell upon thineeyes, peace in thy breast!

274
00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:50.270
Would I were sleep andpeace, so sweet to rest!

275
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:23.670
The grey-eyed morn smileson the frowning night,

276
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:26.570
Chequering the easternclouds with streaks oflight,

277
00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.500
And flecked darkness likea drunkard reels

278
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.700
From forth day's path andTitan's fiery wheels:

279
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.300
Now, ere the sun advancehis burning eye,

280
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.270
The day to cheer andnight's dank dew to dry,

281
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:43.770
I must up-fill this osiercage of ours

282
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:49.830
With baleful weeds andprecious-juiced flowers.

283
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:55.570
The earth that's nature'smother is her tomb;

284
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.800
What is her burying gravethat is her womb,

285
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.600
And from her womb childrenof divers kind

286
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.670
We sucking on her naturalbosom find.

287
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.100
O, mickle is the powerfulgrace that lies

288
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:15.500
In plants, herbs, stones,and their true qualities:

289
00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.070
For nought so vile that onthe earth doth live

290
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.670
But to the earth somespecial good doth give,

291
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.570
Nor aught so good butstrain'd from that fairuse

292
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:31.500
Revolts from true birth,stumbling on abuse.

293
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.270
Within the infant rind ofthis weak flower

294
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.270
Poison hath residence andmedicine power:

295
00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:48.530
For this, being smelt,with that part cheers eachpart;

296
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:54.970
Being tasted, slays allsenses with the heart.

297
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.870
Two such opposed kingsencamp them still

298
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:05.500
In man as well as herbs,grace and rude will;

299
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.170
And where the worser ispredominant,

300
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.400
Full soon the canker deatheats up that plant.

301
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.500
Good morrow, father.

302
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.030
Benedicite!

303
00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:20.970
What early tongue so sweetsaluteth me?

304
00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.300
Young son, it argues adistemper'd head

305
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:27.000
So soon to bid good morrowto thy bed.

306
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.100
Or if not so, then here Ihit it right,

307
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.530
Our Romeo hath not been inbed to-night.

308
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.600
That last is true; thesweeter rest was mine.

309
00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.330
God pardon sin! wast thouwith Rosaline?

310
00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:40.100
With Rosaline, my ghostlyfather?

311
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.670
No; I have forgot thatname, and that name's woe.

312
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.330
That's my good son: wherehast thou been, then?

313
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.830
I'll tell thee, ere thouask it me again.

314
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:54.300
I have been feasting withmine enemy,

315
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:56.430
Where on a sudden one hathwounded me,

316
00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.030
That's by me wounded: bothour remedies

317
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:01.970
Within thy help and holyphysic lies:

318
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.300
I bear no hatred, blessedman, for, lo,

319
00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.600
My intercession likewisesteads my foe.

320
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.570
Be plain, good son, andhomely in thy drift;

321
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.270
Riddling confession findsbut riddling shrift.

322
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:15.600
Then plainly know myheart's dear love is set

323
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.670
On the fair daughter ofrich Capulet:

324
00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:21.370
As mine on hers, so hersis set on mine;

325
00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.400
And all combined, savewhat thou must combine

326
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.300
By holy marriage: when andwhere and how

327
00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.100
We met, we woo'd and madeexchange of vow,

328
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.370
I'll tell thee as we pass;but this I pray,

329
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.430
That thou consent to marryus to-day.

330
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.900
Holy Saint Francis, what achange is here!

331
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.500
Is Rosaline, whom thoudidst love so dear,

332
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.200
So soon forsaken?

333
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.500
Young men's love then lies

334
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.970
Not truly in their hearts,but in their eyes.

335
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.400
Jesu Maria, what a deal ofbrine

336
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.230
Hath wash'd thy sallowcheeks for Rosaline!

337
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.330
How much salt water thrownaway in waste,

338
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.130
To season love, that of itdoth not taste!

339
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.900
Lo, here upon thy cheekthe stain doth sit

340
00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.370
Of an old tear that is notwash'd off yet:

341
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:05.100
If e'er thou wast thyselfand these woes thine,

342
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.200
Thou and these woes wereall for Rosaline:

343
00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.370
And art thou changed?

344
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.930
Pronounce this sentencethen,

345
00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:14.230
Women may fall, whenthere's no strength inmen.

346
00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.500
Thou chid'st me oft forloving Rosaline.

347
00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.400
For doting, not forloving, pupil mine.

348
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.770
And bad'st me bury love.

349
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.000
Not in a grave,

350
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.870
To lay one in, another outto have.

351
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.100
I pray thee, chide me not;her I love now

352
00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.070
Doth grace for grace andlove for love allow;

353
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:28.170
The other did not so.

354
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.470
O, she knew well

355
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.500
Thy love did read by rotethat could not spell.

356
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.470
But come, young waverer,come, go with me,

357
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.970
In one respect I'll thyassistant be;

358
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:43.800
For this alliance may sohappy prove,

359
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.630
To turn your households'rancour to pure love.

360
00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.100
O, let us hence; I standon sudden haste.

361
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.730
Wisely and slow; theystumble that run fast.

362
00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.970
Where the devil shouldthis Romeo be?

363
00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.370
Came he not home to-night?

364
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:06.370
Not to his father's; Ispoke with his man.

365
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:12.400
Ah, that same palehard-hearted wench, thatRosaline,

366
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.270
Torments him so, he willsure run mad.

367
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.600
Tybalt, the kinsman of oldCapulet,

368
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.430
Hath sent a letter to hisfather's house.

369
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.170
A challenge, on my life.

370
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.700
Romeo will answer it.

371
00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:30.670
Any man that can write mayanswer a letter.

372
00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.530
Nay, he will answer theletter's master,

373
00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.270
how he dares, being dared.

374
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.000
Alas poor Romeo! he isalready dead;

375
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
stabbed with a whitewench's black eye;

376
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.130
run through the ear with alove-song;

377
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:45.930
the very pin of his heartcleft

378
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:48.700
with the blind bow-boy'sbutt-shaft:

379
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.630
and is he a man toencounter Tybalt?

380
00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.600
Why, what is Tybalt?

381
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.900
More than prince of cats.

382
00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.700
O, he's the courageouscaptain of compliments.

383
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.970
He fights as you singprick-song,

384
00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:04.400
keeps time, distance, andproportion;

385
00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.400
rests me his minim rests,one, two,

386
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.500
and the third in yourbosom:

387
00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:14.200
the very butcher of a silkbutton,

388
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.170
a duellist, a duellist;

389
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:21.870
a gentleman of the veryfirst house,

390
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.370
of the first and secondcause: ah, the immortalpassado!

391
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:27.600
The punto reverso!

392
00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:28.700
The hay!

393
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:29.930
The what?

394
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.600
The pox of such antic,lisping, affectingfantasticoes.

395
00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.230
Water! Fresh well water!

396
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.070
These new tuners ofaccents!

397
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.200
By Jesu, a very goodblade!

398
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.100
A very tall man!

399
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.830
A very good whore!

400
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.230
Why, is not this alamentable thing,grandsire,

401
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.800
that we should be thusafflicted

402
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.970
with these strange flies,these fashion-mongers,

403
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.900
these pardone-moi's,

404
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.000
that stand so much on thenew form,

405
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.100
that they cannot sit atease on an old bench?

406
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:06.700
O, their bones, theirbones!

407
00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.400
Here comes Romeo.

408
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.270
Here comes Romeo.

409
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.930
Without his roe, like adried herring:

410
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.870
flesh, flesh, how art thoufishified!

411
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.730
Signor Romeo, bon jour!

412
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.870
There's a Frenchsalutation to your Frenchslop.

413
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:30.130
Good morrow to you both.

414
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.570
You gave us thecounterfeit fairly lastnight.

415
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.770
What counterfeit did Igive you?

416
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:37.030
The slip, sir, the slip;can you not conceive?

417
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.100
Pardon, good Mercutio, mybusiness was great;

418
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.170
and in such a case as minea man may strain courtesy.

419
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.370
That's as much as to say,such a case as yours

420
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:45.970
constrains a man to bow inthe hams.

421
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.070
Meaning, to court'sy.

422
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.770
Thou hast most kindly hitit.

423
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:50.000
A most courteousexposition.

424
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.100
Nay, I am the very pink ofcourtesy.

425
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.200
Pink for flower.

426
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.530
Right.

427
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.530
Why, then is my pump wellflowered.

428
00:22:55.530 --> 00:22:59.400
Come between us, goodBenvolio; my wit faints.

429
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:04.300
Why, is not this betternow than groaning forlove?

430
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.230
now art thou sociable, nowart thou Romeo;

431
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.300
now art thou what thouart, by art as well as bynature:

432
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.300
for this drivelling loveis like a great natural,

433
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.970
that runs lolling up anddown to hide his bauble ina hole.

434
00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.670
Stop there, stop there.

435
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.700
Oh, clumsy--

436
00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.670
Here's goodly gear!

437
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.230
A sail, a sail!

438
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.600
Two, two; a shirt and asmock.

439
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.730
Peter!

440
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:29.830
Anon!

441
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.430
My fan, Peter.

442
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.870
Good Peter, to hide herface; for her fan's thefairer .

443
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.770
God ye good morrow,gentlemen.

God ye good den, fairgentlewoman.

445
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.870
Is it good den?

446
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.570
It is no less, I tell you,

447
00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:47.800
for the bawdy hand of thedial is now upon the prickof .

448

Out upon you! what a manare you!

449
00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:52.430
One, gentlewoman,

450
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.870
that God hath made forhimself to mar.

451
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.800
By my troth, it is wellsaid; 'for himself tomar,' quoth a?

452
00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.030
Gentlemen, can any of youtell me

I am the youngest of thatname, for fault of aworse.

458

You say well.

459
00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.600
Yea, is the worst well?

If you be he, sir, Idesire some confidencewith you.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.200
She will indite him tosome supper.

463
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.230
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd!

464
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.600
So ho!

465
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:31.700
What hast thou found?

466
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.800
No hare, sir;

467
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:33.930
unless a hare, sir, in alenten pie,

468
00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.900
which is something staleand hoar ere it be spent.

469
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.730
An old hare hoar, And anold hare hoar,

470
00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.930
Is very good meat in lentBut a hare that is hoar

471
00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:44.300
Is too much for a score,When it hoars ere it bespent.

472
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.600
Romeo, will you come toyour father's?

I pray you, sir, whatsaucy merchant was this,

478
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.270
that was so full of hisropery?

479
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.230
A gentleman, nurse, thatloves to hear himselftalk,

480
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.030
and will speak more in aminute

481
00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.700
than he will stand to in amonth.

482
00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:13.130
An a' speak any thingagainst me, I'll take himdown,

Scurvy knave!

486
00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:30.100
I am none of hisflirt-gills; I am none ofhis skains-mates.

00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.400
And thou must stand bytoo,

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.630
and suffer every knave touse me at his pleasure?

489

491

494
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.430
and the law on my side.

495
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:51.430
Now, afore God, I am sovexed, every part about mequivers.

496
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:54.600
Scurvy knave!

497

Pray you, sir, a word: andas I told you,

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:12.030
into a fool's paradise, asthey say,

502

Bid her devise

504
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.370
Some means to come toshrift this afternoon;

And there she shall atFriar Laurence' cell

506
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.330
Be shrived and married.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.700
Be trusty, and I'll quitthy pains:

508
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.630
Farewell; commend me tothy mistress.

509

Now God in heaven blessyou, sir.

510
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.400
Hark you, sir;

511
00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.070
my mistress is thesweetest lady.

512
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.030
O Lord, Lord!

513
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.170
when 'twas a littleprating thing:--

514
00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.470
There is a nobleman intown, one Paris,

515
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:51.070
that would fain lay knifeaboard;

516
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.230
but she, good soul,

517
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.200
had as lief see a toad, avery toad, as see him.

518
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.130
I anger her sometimes andtell her

519
00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:01.300
that Paris is the propererman; but, Lord, when I sayso,

520
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.330
I'll warrant you, shelooks as pale

521
00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.400
as any clout in the versalworld.

522
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.630
Commend me to thy lady.

523
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:12.570
Ay, ay, a thousand times.

524
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.370
Peter!

525
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.630
Anon!

526
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.530
The clock struck nine whenI did send the nurse;

527
00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.830
In half an hour shepromised to return.

528
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:42.070
Perchance she cannot meethim: that's not so.

529
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.200
O, she is lame!

530
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.100
Love's heralds should bethoughts,

531
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.000
Which ten times fasterglide than the sun'sbeams,

532
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.930
Driving back shadows overlouring hills.

533
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.370
Now is the sun upon thehighmost hill

534
00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:57.270
Of this day's journey, andfrom nine till twelve

535
00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.100
Is three long hours, yetshe is not come.

536
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.630
Had she affections andwarm youthful blood,

537
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.600
She would be as swift inmotion as a ball;

538
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.770
My words would bandy herto my sweet love,

539
00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.700
And his to me:

540
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.730
But old folk, many feignas they were dead;

541
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:20.300
Unwieldy, slow, heavy andpale as lead.

542
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.970
O God, she comes!

543
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.600
O honey nurse, what news?

544
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:25.800
Hast thou met with him?

545
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.430
Send thy man away.

546
00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:30.430
Peter, stay at the gate.

547
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:36.770
Now, good sweet nurse,-- OLord, why look'st thousad?

548
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.900
Though news be sad, yettell them merrily;

549
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.830
If good, thou shamest themusic of sweet news

550
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.400
By playing it to me withso sour a face.

551
00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:49.100
I am a-weary, give meleave awhile:

552
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.800
Fie, how my bones ache!what a jaunt have I had!

553
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.030
I would thou hadst mybones, and I thy news:

554
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.970
Nay, come, I pray thee,speak; good, good nurse,speak.

555
00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:05.070
Jesu, what haste? can younot stay awhile?

556
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:08.000
Do you not see I am out ofbreath?

557
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.630
How art thou out ofbreath, when thou hastbreath

558
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.830
To say to me that thou artout of breath?

559
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:13.530
The excuse that thou dostmake in this delay

560
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:17.630
Is longer than the talethou dost excuse.

561
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:22.570
Is thy news good, or bad?answer to that;

562
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:25.630
Say either, and I'll staythe circumstance:

563
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.930
Let me be satisfied, is'tgood or bad?

564
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.870
Well, you have made asimple choice;

565
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.670
you know not how to choosea man: Romeo!

566
00:29:35.670 --> 00:29:40.870
no, not he; though hisface be better than anyman's,

567
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.370
yet his leg excels allmen's;

568
00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:46.400
and for a hand, and afoot, and a body,

569
00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.230
though they be not to betalked on,

570
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.630
yet are they past compare:

571
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:53.470
o, he's not the flower ofcourtesy,

572
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.630
yet I'll warrant as gentleas a lamb.

573
00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:00.330
Go thy ways, wench; serveGod.

574
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.670
What, have you dined athome?

575
00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.870
No, no: but all this did Iknow before.

576
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:07.330
What says he of ourmarriage? what of that?

577
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:13.400
O Lord, how my head aches!what a head have I!

578
00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.730
It beats as it would fallin twenty pieces.

579
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.100
My back o' t' otherside,-- O, my back, myback!

580
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.200
Beshrew your heart forsending me about,

581
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.200
To catch my death withjaunting up and down!

582
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.300
I' faith, I am sorry thatthou art not well.

583
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:33.100
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse,tell me, what says mylove?

584
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.730
Your love says, like anhonest gentleman,

585
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:43.970
and a kind, and acourteous, and a handsome,

586
00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.530
and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

587
00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.600
Where is my mother! why,she is within;

588
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.000
Where should she be?

589
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.900
How oddly thou repliest!

590
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.400
'Your love says, like anhonest gentleman,

591
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.530
Where is your mother?'

592
00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.530
O God's lady dear!

593
00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.400
Are you so hot? marry,come up, I trow;

594
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.430
Is this the poultice formy aching bones?

595
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.700
Henceforward do yourmessages yourself.

596
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:15.370
Here's such a coil! come,what says Romeo?

597
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.970
Have you got leave to goto shrift to-day?

598
00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.400
I have.

599
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.100
Then hie you hence toFriar Laurence' cell;

600
00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.070
There stays a husband tomake you a wife:

601
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:33.300
Now comes the wanton bloodup in your cheeks,

602
00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.830
They'll be in scarletstraight at any news.

603
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.030
Hie you to church; I mustanother way,

604
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:41.270
To fetch a ladder, by thewhich your love

605
00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.470
Shall climb a bird's nestsoon when it is dark:

606
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.430
I'm the drudge and toil inyour delight,

607
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.630
But you shall bear theburden soon at night.

608
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.300
Go; I'll to dinner: hieyou to the cell.

609
00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.500
Hie to high fortune!Honest nurse, farewell.

610
00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:01.930
So smile the heavens uponthis holy act,

611
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:06.130
That after hours withsorrow chide us not!

612
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.200
Amen, amen! but come whatsorrow can,

613
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.930
It cannot countervail theexchange of joy

614
00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.330
That one short minutegives me in her sight:

615
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:14.200
Do thou but close ourhands with holy words,

616
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.530
Then love-devouring deathdo what he dare;

617
00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:18.630
It is enough I may butcall her mine.

618
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.030
These violent delightshave violent ends.

619
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:25.030
Therefore love moderately;long love doth so.

620
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.970
Here comes the lady: O, solight a foot

621
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.100
Will ne'er wear out theeverlasting flint:

622
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.800
A lover may bestride thegossamer

623
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.370
That idles in the wantonsummer air,

624
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:40.830
And yet not fall; so lightis vanity.

625
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.300
Good even to my ghostlyconfessor.

626
00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.730
Romeo shall thank thee,daughter, for us both.

627
00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:58.900
Come, come here to me, andwe will make short work;

628
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.900
For, by your leave, youshall not stay alone

629
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.570
Till holy churchincorporate two in one.

630
00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.830
Deus Israel...

631
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.500
