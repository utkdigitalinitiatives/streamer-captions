00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:46.430



00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.630

        The Himalayas, they're known as
        the rooftop of the world.
      

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.100

        This is the largest mountain
        range on the planet.
      

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.760

        Surrounded by peaks 7000 and
        8000 meters tall, this area is
      

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.230

        completely frozen
        and inaccessible
      

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.480

        for most of the year.


00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.390



00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.930

        The air here is so thin that
        it is hard to breathe.
      

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.250



00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.890

        This barren valley of ice hides
        the beginning of the
      

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.950

        holiest river in India.


00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.520

        Ancient myths describe the river
        as so intensely pure
      

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.930

        that just one drop of it's
        waters cures disease
      

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.100

        and wipes away sin.


00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.560

        This is because the Ganges is
        not just a mere river, but one
      

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.800

        of the most powerful Goddesses,
        supernatural and
      

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.370

        indestructible in
        her greatness.
      

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.120



00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.820

        This is the story of the
        millions who depend on her for
      

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.450

        their spiritual, as well as
        physical, sustenance.
      

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.110



00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.650

        The Ganges begins near India's
        border with Tibet and Nepal.
      

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.830

        From here, the river runs from
        west to east, flowing more
      

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.710

        than 2500 kilometers across
        India, from the Himalayas to
      

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.960

        the Bay of Bengal.


00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.000



00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.970

        Ganga, as the river is called in
        India, emerges from beneath
      

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.020

        an ice glacier that has
        been melting for
      

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.080

        thousands of years.


00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.480

        It is necessary to get an
        experienced guide to reach
      

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.570

        Gaumukh, which is the
        source of the river.
      

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.630

        It is here at Gaumukh that you
        can see the first drops of ice
      

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.280

        become the river, Ganges.


00:02:46.280 --> 00:03:13.030



00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.410

        Here in India, people believe
        the Ganges is so pure that
      

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.380

        it's impossible to pollute
        her waters.
      

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.630

        You can almost see how they
        could believe this, high up in
      

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.240

        the mountains where everything
        is so clean, and people are so
      

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.060

        rare that the animals
        practically ignore you.
      

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.670

        But the truth is, the river is
        far from indestructible.
      

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.190

        It is in grave danger.


00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.230

        Pollution is rapidly
        killing it.
      

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.310

        And if something is not done
        very soon, it will be
      

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.780

        destroyed by the very people
        who come to worship it.
      

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.630



00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.700

        The glacier that feeds the
        Ganges is quickly receding,
      

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.480

        and no one is sure how long it
        will be until it is gone.
      

00:03:58.480 --> 00:05:15.550



00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.070

        Because the glacier is
        disappearing, each year it
      

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.470

        takes longer and longer for
        pilgrims to make the trek from
      

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.470

        the nearest village to
        the river's source.
      

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.350

        Today this trip takes about
        15 hours, but this must be
      

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.520

        divided over two days
        because there are so
      

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.770

        few hours of daylight.


00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:43.310



00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.640

        India's population has
        more than doubled
      

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.500

        over the past 50 years.


00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.020

        And today over 1 billion people
        call this country home,
      

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.480

        from the top of the
        mountains to the
      

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.460

        city's down in the plains.


00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.530

        Sewage, garbage and other
        pollutants are all
      

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.530

        going into the river.


00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.290

        And global warming is affecting
        it as well.
      

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.040

        Nature seems to be on a race
        with time as each day brings
      

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.110

        more and more danger
        to the river.
      

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.020



00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.500

        This is the village
        of Gangotri.
      

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.140

        Before the glacier started
        receding, the source of the
      

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.000

        river was located here.


00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.880

        The exact spot where the Goddess
        was believed to have
      

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.160

        first touched the Earth.


00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.250

        Ever since.


00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.600

        it's been a place where
        Hindus come to send
      

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.850

        prayers to the Goddess.


00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.960



00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.100

        According to legend, Ganga was
        a Goddess in heaven who came
      

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.110

        down to earth because of the
        prayers of an Indian chief
      

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.270

        named Bhagirath.


00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.410

        He needed her waters to wash
        away the ashes of his
      

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.170

        ancestors in order to bring
        them eternal peace.
      

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.350

        Bhagirath prayed for so long
        that the God, Brahma, took
      

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.800

        pity on him and ordered Ganga
        to come down to Earth.
      

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.610

        In order for this powerful
        Goddess not to destroy
      

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.520

        everything in her path as she
        washed down from the heavens,
      

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.280

        the God, Shiva, absorbed Ganga
        into his matted locks to
      

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.850

        cushion the impact.


00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.840

        The few drops of water that
        escaped and fell to Earth
      

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.090

        became the river Ganges.


00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.450



00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:25.070

        A huge rock in the middle of the
        river marks the exact spot
      

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.320

        where the Goddess is said
        to have landed.
      

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:34.940

        The main village temple was
        built right next to it.
      

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.660

        Gangotri is a temporary
        settlement.
      

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.450

        It was built so that pilgrims
        have shelter and food when
      

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.670

        they come to pray
        to the river.
      

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.580

        The village is cold
        and isolated.
      

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.440

        So most people only
        stay a few days.
      

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.240

        The only people who live so far
        up in the mountains are
      

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.310

        religious seekers called
        sadhus or babas.
      

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.100



00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.100

        Babas are a special class of
        people in India who have
      

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.290

        renounced their lives in order
        to devote their time to prayer
      

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.540

        and meditation.


00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.640



00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.710

        Babas are sort of like monks,
        but they have no formal
      

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:12.910

        hierarchies.


00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.660

        There are many kinds of babas,
        but since there is a general
      

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.610

        link between the river Ganges
        and that God Shiva, many babas
      

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.760

        who live along the river's
        banks are his followers.
      

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.700

        Babs are considered
        completely apart
      

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.340

        from the rest of society.


00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.980

        And until about 100 years ago,
        they couldn't even be
      

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.790

        prosecuted under Indian law.


00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.310



00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.200

        Today, most babas still separate
        themselves from
      

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.370

        society, often living in caves
        or tents, far away from the
      

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.130

        rest of the world.


00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.560

        The peculiar aspect
        of their lives, is
      

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.180

        that babas don't work.


00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.380

        They're productive time is spent
        meditating, and it is up
      

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.790

        to the rest of society to
        support them as their
      

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.040

        spiritual guides.


00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.450



00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.390

        Babas who are Shiva's followers,
        use marijuana on a
      

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.840

        religious basis because it is
        said that Shiva ate hashish
      

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.600

        cakes as a holy sacrament.


00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.960

        This is an acceptable practice
        among Indian mystics who have
      

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.390

        been using the plant for
        religious purposes for
      

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:20.640

        thousands of years.


00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:29.750



00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.560

        Marijuana has been nicknamed
        ganja after the river Ganges,
      

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.380

        because it first grew here.


00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.860



00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.330

        These babas imitate Shiva
        in a lot of ways.
      

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.850

        For example, they mat their
        hair, they carry a warrior's
      

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.000

        trident, and they go around
        practically naked.
      

00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:40.350



00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.460

        For thousands of years of Indian
        history people lived in
      

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.730

        villages, and villages
        were small.
      

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.840

        This ancient way of life is
        still visible in remote
      

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.070

        agricultural communities in
        the Himalayas where people
      

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.680

        still live on what the land
        itself can provide.
      

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.080

        One of these villages is
        Gangnani, which is known
      

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.070

        throughout the region
        for its hot spring.
      

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:08.000

        Gangnani has very
        little contact
      

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.090

        with the outside world.


00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.670

        There is no road, and the only
        access is a mountain path 1/2
      

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.220

        a kilometer up the steep
        mountainside.
      

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.400



00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.190

        This is the final day of the
        Durga Puja festival in
      

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.020

        Gangani, the most important
        celebration of the year.
      

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.220



00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.030

        Traditionally, all the villagers
        gather together in
      

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:36.240

        the middle of the village where
        music and dancing idols
      

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:38.380

        are used to bless the food.


00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.600

        Then everyone sits in a giant
        circle and eats together, men
      

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.540

        first, then women,
        and children.
      

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.140

        The most common meal is rice
        and lentils, along with
      

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.940

        whatever vegetables the
        villagers can grow.
      

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.080

        And everything is cooked
        over an open fire.
      

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.840

        Traditionally, all the food is
        eaten with the hands, while
      

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.550

        the water comes straight from
        the mountain spring that flows
      

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:02.800

        into the Ganges.


00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.690



00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:08.660

        After the meal, it is customary
        to tie a red string
      

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.790

        around the wrist of each
        participant to signify that
      

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.450

        the prayers have
        been performed.
      

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:20.490



00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.490

        Villagers use the river for
        drinking, washing, and
      

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.380

        irrigating their fields.


00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.900

        This arrangement seems idyllic
        in many ways, but villagers
      

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.580

        like this also use the river
        to carry away their waste.
      

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:37.440

        As times change, and villages
        turn into bustling cities, you
      

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.700

        can imagine the resulting
        effect on the river.
      

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:53.940



00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.250

        From its source in Gaumukh and
        past the holy village of
      

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.820

        Gangotri, the Ganges turns
        down the mountains past a
      

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.350

        number of smaller towns and
        villages until it reaches
      

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.800

        Rishikesh in the foothills
        of the Himalayas.
      

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.880



00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.670

        In Rishikesh, you start to get
        hints of the vast population
      

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.940

        and the faster pace of life
        that exists in the plains
      

00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.780

        further south.


00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:23.740

        The horns of many cars and
        rickshaws are deafening,
      

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.990

        exhaust fills the air.


00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.970



00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.980

        Everything is a lot dirtier than
        it was further up in the
      

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.990

        mountains, but the
        river itself is
      

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.000

        still relatively clean.


00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.060

        This is good for the countless,
        religious retreat
      

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.600

        centers that are popular with
        the many Indians and
      

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.850

        foreigners who end up here.


00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.380



00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:50.400

        Rishikesh is also known as the
        yoga capital of the world.
      

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.140

        And every year, thousands of
        yoga enthusiasts travel here
      

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.230

        to learn from the masters.


00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:57.540

        [INTERPOSING] quite
        difficult thing.
      

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.960

        According to the yoga system
        there exists secondary chakras
      

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.260

        at the level of the joints
        of the limbs.
      

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.630

        That means, like inside in
        the middle at the level--
      

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.250

        It's a little ironic that today,
        the most popular yoga
      

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.080

        teacher in Rishikesh
        is a Westerner.
      

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.180

        Swami Vivekananda was born in
        Romania and educated as an
      

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.710

        engineer before he turned
        to learning the secrets
      

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.960

        of yoga full time.


00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.300



00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.160

        Usually, when I talk to my
        pupils about yoga, I prefer to
      

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.660

        tell them what yoga does.


00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.360

        I mean, I speak about
        the effects of yoga.
      

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.500

        What can you get through
        the practice of yoga?
      

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.630

        Then it is up to you to decide
        what yoga is, if it's a
      

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.070

        philosophical system, if it's
        a way of life, if it is--
      

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.620

        I don't know what else
        you can call it.
      

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.910

        I mean, they have been given
        a lot of dry or colorful
      

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.360

        explanations.


00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.930

        That yoga is a path
        to ecstasy.
      

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.300

        That yoga is a path to
        self realization.
      

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.880

        That it is this and that.


00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.630

        But I think it is best defined
        through its own actions, that
      

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.920

        is, through what it delivers,
        through what it gives to the
      

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:06.820

        human beings.


00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.020

        Many people are familiar with
        yoga as an exercise or a
      

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:13.610

        relaxation technique, but this
        is only part of an entire
      

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.910

        philosophical system.


00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:17.880

        While many books have been
        written on different
      

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.100

        approaches to yoga, most masters
        will tell you the
      

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.640

        books contain only a
        small portion of
      

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.890

        the complete teaching.


00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:29.120



00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.750

        There are many schools of yoga
        and each teaches a different
      

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.830

        technique or philosophy.


00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.690

        Yoga is an elite thing.


00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.720

        For the time being, yoga
        is not a mass thing.
      

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.340

        It is this thing for initiates,
        for the few, chosen
      

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.090

        disciples who get to know the
        secret forces of nature.
      

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:55.110



00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:58.840

        The thing which is special in
        India is not about Ganga.
      

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.700

        The thing which is special
        in India is about
      

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.080

        people's belief or faith.


00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.170

        That is, the river Ganga is what
        it is, because so many
      

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.540

        millions of people so
        fanatically believe in it.
      

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.100

        And yes, there is a power of
        belief, especially when it is
      

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.220

        geared in hundreds of
        millions of people.
      

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.000

        It produces a measurable
        effect.
      

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.250

        Scientists apparently have
        measured in the river Ganga
      

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.020

        all kind of amazing things.


00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.690

        And it is sterile, bacteria
        free in spite of all the
      

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.440

        garbage which is dumped into it,
        and all kinds of things.
      

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.640

        That the river Ganga has some
        amazing properties today,
      

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.420

        significantly, less and less
        people believe in this, and
      

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.980

        the Ganga, at the same time,
        becomes more and more normal.
      

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:43.910

        It is chemically polluted and
        that has nothing to do with
      

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.790

        bacteria and germs. So, more
        and more people actually
      

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.790

        believe now, OK, Ganga, you
        cannot really drink the water
      

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.980

        from the Ganga or whatever,
        because it
      

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:55.080

        starts getting dangerous.


00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.890

        Still peasants do it big time.


00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.570

        It's the [UNINTELLIGIBLE], the
        belief, the faith which they
      

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.940

        have. In a climate like India,
        where currents get dried up,
      

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.580

        and water is a problem,
        and some, of course--
      

00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.250

        when June when everything is
        boiling, and I don't know how
      

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.660

        many degrees under the sunshine,
        Ganga's the only
      

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.230

        place where they can go and feel
        a moment of coolness in
      

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:20.690

        the night and take a dip in its
        clouded water and finally
      

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.020

        get refreshed.


00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.270

        Without Ganga this place would
        be scorched, simply.
      

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.340

        So of course, Ganga is like the
        source of life throughout
      

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.220

        India, through the plains of
        India, and wherever you go.
      

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.980

        And without Ganga they
        wouldn't exist
      

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.950

        and they know this.


00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:38.830

        So in this way, it 's like
        a kind of cult of nature.
      

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.120

        It's like being grateful to
        the forces of nature.
      

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.030

        It is why the sacredness of
        Ganga is actually hidden in
      

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:50.010

        the sacredness of
        the human heart.
      

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.270

        It is the human heart
        which is sacred.
      

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.990

        And the belief, the pure belief
        of so many people,
      

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.430

        makes Ganga special.


00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:05.700



00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:07.410

        Yoga is not the only
        thing that draws
      

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.350

        foreigners to Rishikesh.


00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:13.390

        Back in the 1960s the Beatles
        came here to meditate, write
      

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.130

        music, and relax from
        the rigors of fame.
      

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.500

        The band joined a Maharishi
        Mahesh Yogi Ashram on the
      

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.750

        banks of the Ganges.


00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.190

        Many of the bungalows in this
        Ashram were built using the
      

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.300

        stones found in the river bed.


00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.470

        And many people believe that
        they are especially conducive
      

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:34.720

        to deep meditation.


00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.200



00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.640

        The Ashram was very popular at
        the time, but it has since
      

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.890

        been left in ruin.


00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:47.870



00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.590

        The Beatles didn't last
        long in Rishikesh.
      

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.020

        But George Harrison did
        eventually become a Hari
      

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.420

        Krishna, and his ashes were
        buried in the Ganges
      

00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:24.120

        when died in 2002.


00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.370

        [EXTENDED CHANTING/SINGING
        OF "HARE KRISHNA"]
      

00:19:25.370 --> 00:20:25.150



00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.580

        The next city along the
        Ganges is Haridwar.
      

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.670

        It's only 20 kilometers away
        from Rishikesh, so to get
      

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:36.060

        here, many pilgrims
        travel by bus.
      

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.930

        The ride costs under a dollar,
        but this is still a lot of
      

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.070

        money for most Indians, and
        haggling over the ticket price
      

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.540

        is quite common.


00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.380

        The buses are usually extremely
        crowded, and almost
      

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.120

        always play music full-blast.
        Pilgrims dress in their very
      

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.070

        best clothes, and often carry
        flowers with them to use later
      

00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:00.390

        in prayers to the river.


00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:03.190



00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.610

        Haridwar is said to be the exact
        spot where the Ganges
      

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.840

        emerges from the Himalayas and
        begins its journey through the
      

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.490

        plains of northern India.


00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:17.320

        Hindus believe that ceremonial
        purity is guaranteed when a
      

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.180

        believer bathes in one of
        India's holy rivers.
      

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.080

        And the river Ganges confers a
        special purity, because it is
      

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.940

        considered the most
        holy river of all.
      

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.700



00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.090

        Haridwar is a place so popular
        with Hindus for religious
      

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.410

        observances that the local
        government diverted the river
      

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:42.270

        into a special canal to support
        the huge number of
      

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:43.860

        worshippers that gather here.


00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.490



00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:49.230

        The water in the canal goes
        by extremely fast, and
      

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.310

        worshippers have to be really
        careful not to be swept away
      

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.560

        as they bathe.


00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.630



00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.740

        The narrow banks of the
        river are extremely
      

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.920

        crowded day and night.


00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.810

        During the dry season, the
        city's merchants gather to
      

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.410

        sell everything from hats, to
        jewelry, to chillums, which
      

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.080

        are special pipes for smoking
        tobacco and hashish.
      

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.230



00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:15.920

        Since space is limited indoors,
        vendors cook food on
      

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.380

        the street to sell to
        restaurants and passers-by.
      

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:26.730



00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.110

        Flowers to use in prayers
        are also for sale.
      

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.600

        And workers turn tobacco into
        traditional hand-wove bidis,
      

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.030

        which are leaves of
        tobacco rolled-up
      

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.520

        and tied with a string.


00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:40.190

        They are small but
        quite strong.
      

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:43.690

        You can also find a great
        variety of fruit, as well as
      

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.280

        herbs and spices for use in
        traditional medicines.
      

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.790



00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.750

        At night, the city
        is transformed.
      

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.170

        Weddings are a particularly
        interesting event in India,
      

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.760

        since each celebration
        is as ostentatious as
      

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.720

        the family can afford.


00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.640



00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.810

        In this particular case, the
        groom is covered in flowers
      

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.130

        and carried to the ceremony in a
        shiny horse driven carriage.
      

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.620



00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.610

        A band plays loudly, and people
        have been hired to
      

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.270

        accompany the wedding party
        carrying special lights on
      

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.520

        their heads.


00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:36.580



00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.470

        They have to carry a generator
        with them for the lights to
      

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:41.570

        work, and it gets its own
        special carriage.
      

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.560



00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.570

        Drums, bells and trumpets fill
        the air with noise as the
      

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.570

        groom in his shiny carriage
        disappears into the night.
      

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:57.040



00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.670

        As darkness falls, the banks of
        the river take on a whole
      

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.530

        new look as pilgrims crowd
        for evening prayers.
      

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.300

        During prayer time, only members
        of the Brahmin caste
      

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.830

        are allowed to lead
        the worshippers.
      

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:14.450

        You have to be born a Brahmin,
        there is no movement within
      

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.820

        the caste system.


00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.220

        However, this system is dying
        out, especially since the
      

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.410

        Indian government has outlawed
        discrimination based on caste.
      

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:27.320

        So far as my knowledge goes,
        the caste system is perhaps
      

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:33.460

        very much peculiar to India,
        in the sense that it is
      

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:37.390

        practiced not only among the
        Hindus, but it has an impact
      

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:41.810

        on other religions also.


00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:47.210

        But the caste system has
        influenced rather in a
      

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.780

        negative sense these
        religions also.
      

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.200

        Actually, there is nothing
        wrong with the
      

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.660

        caste system as such.


00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.890

        The only evil associated with
        the caste system may be the
      

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:06.810

        denial of basic human rights
        and fundamental freedoms to
      

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:10.420

        any individual on the
        basis of caste.
      

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.630

        Fortunately, our constitution,
        our law prohibits
      

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.490

        discrimination on the
        grounds of caste.
      

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.590

        But it will take some time
        before the caste system is
      

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.310

        abolished altogether
        from this land.
      

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:28.710



00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:32.620

        As the evening begins, the
        Brahmins welcome the many
      

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.540

        pilgrims who have come to
        offer their prayers.
      

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.430

        These prayers are often
        accompanied with
      

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:40.520

        offerings to the river.


00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.820

        Gifts to the Goddess
        traditionally include flower
      

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.230

        petals set on a boat of leaves,
        sometimes with sweets
      

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.400

        or incense set on top.


00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.940

        Fire is important as well, so
        that each offering includes
      

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.130

        the four main elements of
        the Hindu world, earth,
      

00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.390

        water, air and fire.


00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.540

        Worshippers place these gifts
        into the flowing river, often
      

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:06.960

        while reciting a mantra.


00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.530

        A mantra is a word or syllable
        chanted or silently repeated
      

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:14.100

        in meditation to help clear
        and focus the mind.
      

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.300

        The word, Om, is an example
        of a mantra.
      

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.620



00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.420

        Experts estimate that there
        are over 400 million Gods
      

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.220

        recognized within
        the Hindu fold.
      

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.350

        And single Gods are worshipped
        in many different forms with
      

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.600

        different names.


00:26:31.600 --> 00:27:05.570



00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:09.700

        This myriad of Gods and beliefs
        makes Hinduism unique
      

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.950

        among the world's religions.


00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:15.890



00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.860

        The prayers' of thousands of
        pilgrims are carried with the
      

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:24.720

        river as it travels past the
        rich plains of northern India.
      

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:28.060

        The city of Allahabad is located
        at the delta of two
      

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.490

        great Indian rivers, the
        Ganges and the Yamuna.
      

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.270

        Despite its size, the Ganges
        doesn't have regular boat
      

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:40.710

        travel, so you have to travel
        by bus or train.
      

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:45.310

        Allahabad itself, is a large,
        dirty, overcrowded city
      

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.890

        without much interest
        to outsiders.
      

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.660

        It is an important Hindu
        pilgrimage spot, but the city
      

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.280

        center is a good
        five kilometers
      

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.190

        away from the river.


00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.000

        Rickshaw is the best way to
        get there, and the ride
      

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.610

        usually takes about
        45 minutes.
      

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.230

        Once you reach the river there
        is usually an upbeat
      

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.960

        atmosphere here, with people
        dancing, temples, and other
      

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.030

        festivities a regular
        part of the day.
      

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.600



00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:20.570

        This holy spot is called Sangha,
        place where three holy
      

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.580

        rivers are said to converge.


00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.350

        Where the rivers meet you can
        literally see the waters
      

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.340

        mixing, since the Ganges
        is brown while
      

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.130

        the Yamuna is green.


00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.350

        The third river, the Saraswathi,
        is mythical, and
      

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:37.300

        can be seen only by the Gods.


00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.890



00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.990

        Pilgrims take boats to get to
        the exact spot where the
      

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.750

        rivers mix, and ritual
        bathing is the main
      

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.210

        activity of the day.


00:28:49.210 --> 00:29:24.650



00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.780

        This is a beautiful spot.


00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.990

        But the truth is that for
        several years now, scientists
      

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.730

        have declared the Yamuna
        to be a dead river.
      

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:39.040

        The waste of Delhi, Agra, and
        many other big cities flows
      

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.810

        directly into the Ganges here,
        at this sacred location.
      

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:50.080



00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.250

        As we leave our Allahabad and
        travel down the river, we
      

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.270

        reach the most fascinating and
        legendary sight along the
      

00:29:56.270 --> 00:29:58.420

        banks of the Ganges.


00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.220

        The ancient city of Varanasi has
        been India's religious and
      

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.960

        cultural center for
        over 3000 years.
      

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:10.570

        It is situated between two
        tributaries to the Ganges, the
      

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.100

        Varuna to the north and
        the Assi to the south.
      

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.470



00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.310

        As Mark Twain put it, when he
        visited the city, Varanasi is
      

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:23.670

        older than history, older than
        tradition, even older than
      

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.900

        myth, and looks twice as a old
        as all of them put together.
      

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.680



00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.750

        It is especially important for
        Hindus to bathe here in
      

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.640

        Varanasi toward the end of
        their lives, in order to
      

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.690

        purify themselves
        before they die.
      

00:30:40.690 --> 00:31:03.510



00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.580

        The center of all this activity
        is the city ghats.
      

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:13.940



00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.960

        Ghat is another word
        for cave or pier.
      

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.740

        In India, ghats are cement
        steps that lead from the
      

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:23.200

        city's edge to the river.


00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.920

        They allow pilgrims easy
        access to the water.
      

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.240

        There are a number of different
        ghats in Varanasi.
      

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.540

        Each is roughly a 50 meter piece
        of land, sponsored by a
      

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.450

        particular person or
        religious group.
      

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.590



00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.310

        Different ghats have different
        functions.
      

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:46.050

        Some are used for religious
        purposes, and others serve
      

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.300

        more practical needs.


00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.900



00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.040

        Many locals bring their work
        down to the ghats, so it is
      

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.270

        common to see people bathing,
        fishing, or washing clothes.
      

00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:00.300



00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.630

        The ghats are a popular place to
        water the local buffalo, so
      

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.370

        you can also see people
        gathering buffalo dung.
      

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.780

        Indians mix it with straw, and
        then they pat it into bricks.
      

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:15.910



00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.760

        Once dried, these bricks are
        used for cooking and heating
      

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.830

        in the place of wood, since most
        trees in India were cut
      

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.880

        down for fuel hundreds
        of years ago.
      

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.850



00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.810

        The ghats of Varanasi
        are extremely
      

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.570

        important to all Hindus.


00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:55.740



00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.160

        But there are two ghats along
        Varanasi's shoreline that are
      

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.380

        very special.


00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.210

        Manikarnika and Harish Chandra
        ghats are used exclusively for
      

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:09.340

        cremating the bodies of pilgrims
        who come here to die.
      

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.600

        Legend has it that the God Shiva
        is physically present at
      

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.800

        Manikarnika ghat at all times.


00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:19.390

        That means, that if a person is
        cremated here Shiva himself
      

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.670

        takes that spirit to heaven.


00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.590

        This will release the person's
        soul from the cycle of birth
      

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.740

        and death and guarantee
        eternal happiness.
      

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.370



00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.880

        Pilgrims from all over India
        come to Varanasi toward the
      

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.020

        ends of their lives in hopes
        that Shiva will personally
      

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.660

        guide their spirits to heaven.


00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.480

        If they are successful in their
        quest to die here, there
      

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.930

        is a special ritual for each
        burning that takes place.
      

00:33:45.930 --> 00:36:58.070



00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:01.580

        The air is filled with smoke,
        but it actually doesn't smell
      

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:04.040

        as bad as you would expect.


00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.770

        Maybe it's because of the wood
        that's used, or maybe it's the
      

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.080

        myriad of other smells around.


00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.260

        But the most unique part of the
        cremation process involves
      

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.600

        the babas that live here
        at the cremation ghats.
      

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:24.100



00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.810

        These babas actually eat
        the cremated bodies
      

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.060

        on a religious basis.


00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:39.970



00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.340

        Aghori babas are intimately
        connected with the cremation
      

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.790

        process that is ongoing
        in Varanasi.
      

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:50.550

        A aghori babas often live near
        the creation fires, because
      

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:54.650

        their prasad, or holy sacrament,
        is the very flesh
      

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.330

        the fires consume.


00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:00.870

        They believe that after being
        touched by the holy fire, the
      

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:05.040

        bodies are holy themselves, and
        to eat the flesh of these
      

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.530

        bodies makes you pure.


00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:11.630



00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.880

        Boom Boom Baba is an aghori baba
        that lives at the Harish
      

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.590

        Chandra cremation ghat.


00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.620

        He is a well known figure
        in Varanasi.
      

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.400

        People all along the ghats fear
        respect him, and come to
      

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.650

        him for his blessing.


00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.230



00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.380

        While his mysticism is uniquely
        Indian, Boom Boom
      

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.620

        Baba shares his teachings with
        Indians and foreigners alike.
      

00:38:33.620 --> 00:39:33.420



00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.470

        In spite of their unconventional
        practices, or
      

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.760

        perhaps because of them,
        aghori babas are highly
      

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.370

        respected within
        Indian culture.
      

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.790

        A lot of people believe that
        they have a special kind of
      

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.400

        black magic.


00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.870

        They often carry the ashes of
        cremated bodies with them for
      

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.880

        use in spells and ceremonies as
        well as implements, such as
      

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:58.530

        monkey bones or human skulls,
        which they use to drink the
      

00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.910

        holy water of the Ganges.


00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:33.410



00:40:33.410 --> 00:41:04.480

        what


00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.320

        In order for a Hindu soul to
        attain peace, their bodies
      

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.870

        have to be cremated
        not buried.
      

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.740



00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:15.360

        But wood is expensive, so many
        bodies do not get burned all
      

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.900

        the way before the
        wood runs out.
      

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.790

        Also some people, like
        children, do not
      

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.630

        get burned at all.


00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:26.300

        Their bodies are considered
        naturally pure, so they are
      

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.520

        rowed out to the middle
        of the river and
      

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:32.500

        dumped without any burning.


00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.670

        These well established cultural
        traditions have begun
      

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.530

        to have a really bad effect
        on the river.
      

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:42.340

        The city's garbage collects
        in the sacred ghats.
      

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:46.440

        Untreated sewage flows directly
        into the river.
      

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.500

        Cows are considered sacred
        animals in India, and they are
      

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.190

        left to the Ganges
        when they die.
      

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:56.880

        The decomposed bodies of many
        different animals wash up on
      

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.810

        the city's banks.


00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:03.800

        Packs of wild dogs roam the
        unpopulated stretches of the
      

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.220

        river, scavenging
        on the bodies.
      

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.560

        Partially burned and rotting
        human corpses also
      

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.930

        pile up on the shore.


00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:16.730



00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:20.520

        Scenes like these are common in
        places like Varanasi, and
      

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.920

        no one is particularly
        offended by them.
      

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.100

        But the people's faith in the
        basic purity of the river
      

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.350

        leads many to believe that
        despite the contamination, the
      

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.890

        river is still, essentially,
        clean.
      

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:37.270

        There are efforts under way to
        clean the ghats at ritual
      

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.960

        bathing spots to get rid of the
        most obvious garbage, but
      

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.100

        there's nowhere else for
        the waste to go.
      

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.390

        Because trash cans are not
        widely used in India, people
      

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.510

        through their garbage
        everywhere.
      

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:51.670

        And a lot of it ends
        up in the river.
      

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.990

        There are people in Varanasi who
        take the time to pick up
      

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:58.370

        the worst of the trash from the
        shoreline, mostly a wide
      

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:02.210

        variety of plastic bags, but the
        idea is simply to make the
      

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:04.420

        ghats look nice, not
        to actually do
      

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:06.080

        anything about the problem.


00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:09.180

        The garbage that's removed is
        just rode over to the other
      

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.870

        side of the river and dumped.


00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.560

        When the monsoon season begins,
        the flood takes this
      

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.140

        garbage and washes it downstream
        to pollute the next
      

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:18.390

        city downriver.


00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:21.230



00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.160

        While this would be disastrous
        enough in any culture, the
      

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.380

        specific ways the Indians
        interact with and depend on
      

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.510

        the Ganges for activities such
        as bathing and drinking,
      

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:33.020

        literally make this
        contamination life
      

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.880

        threatening.


00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.590

        In Varanasi, which is located
        downstream from large
      

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.540

        industrial cities such as
        Delhi and Agra, these
      

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.890

        supposedly purifying
        practices are
      

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.810

        becoming physically dangerous.


00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.820

        Can the Ganges be saved?


00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:53.640

        And if so, will Indians be able
        to keep bathing in it and
      

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.720

        drinking it as they have been
        for thousands of years?
      

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.970

        Only time will tell.


00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:59.460



00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.570

        For millennia, Indians were able
        to throw their waste into
      

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.740

        the river with minimal
        environmental impact, because
      

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.150

        the population remained small,
        and enough air and land were
      

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.740

        available to absorb and
        disperse wastes.
      

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:14.530



00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:17.980

        But today, as the country
        grows, the pollution has
      

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.640

        gotten out of control.


00:45:19.640 --> 00:46:10.030



00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:14.500

        As night falls on the city,
        the evening puja begins.
      

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.270

        The main ghat in Varanasi is
        host to the most sacred ritual
      

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.270

        that takes place on
        the river's banks.
      

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:27.570



00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:32.380

        Pilgrims crowd the ghats as
        Brahmins lead the ceremony.
      

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:36.710

        Dedicated to Brahma and Shiva,
        this tradition has been taking
      

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:41.590

        place for thousands of years
        here along the river's shores.
      

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.560

        Soon after beginning, the
        noise is deafening.
      

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:49.000

        Bells, drums, and song are all
        part of the ritual, but
      

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.520

        participation, rather
        than harmony is
      

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.510

        what is most important.


00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:59.070

        Will the Ganges survive into
        the next century, with luck
      

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:02.710

        the Goddess will hear these
        special prayers.
      

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:05.770

        There's much to be done to
        save the river and the
      

00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:08.060

        traditions that are
        connected with it.
      

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:18.120



00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.070

        As darkness falls, the banks
        of the river take
      

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.830

        on a whole new look.


00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.530



00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:30.520

        The cremation fires continue
        burning into the night.
      

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.120

        The souls of the lucky ones
        who are cremated here are
      

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:36.990

        purified by the Lord
        Shiva, who releases
      

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.470

        them from all sin.


00:47:38.470 --> 00:48:10.930



00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:16.190

        The sacredness of Ganga is
        actually hidden in the same
      

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:17.880

        sacredness of the human heart.


00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.990

        It is the human heart
        which is sacred.
      

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:24.720

        And the belief, the pure belief
        of so many people,
      

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.990

        makes Ganga special.


00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:32.400



00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.410

        In India, according to the
        principle of reincarnation,
      

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:41.130

        the end of one, marks the
        beginning of another.
      

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.320

        Born among the snow capped peaks
        of the Himalayas, the
      

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.640

        Ganges began as a mountain
        of ice melting into
      

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.830

        the river of water.


00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:55.370

        Now, as the Ganges comes to an
        end, it joins the vast waters
      

00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:59.450
