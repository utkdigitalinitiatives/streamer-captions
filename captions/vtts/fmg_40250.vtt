00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.600
female narrator:
The preservation of food

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.900
has been a practice
in every human society

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.460
since the dawn of time.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.830
To survive in ancient times,

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.360
people had to harness nature

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.400
and quickly learn
how to preserve food.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.100
In frozen climates,
meat was kept in the ice.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.060
And in tropical climates,
food was dried in the sun.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.400
Food by its very nature
begins to spoil

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.900
almost as soon
as it is harvested.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.230
If it isn't consumed
or preserved,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.360
it quickly becomes useless.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.230
The preservation of foods
allowed mankind

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.860
to make roots
and create a society

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.130
by remaining in one location

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.000
and living off the foods
they harvested and preserved.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.160
Each culture preserved
their local food sources

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.900
using the same basic methods
of food preservation

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.000
such as drying,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.900
freezing,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.930
fermenting,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.530
pickling,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560
and curing.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.130
But within cultures,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.660
the preservation of food
isn't strictly for sustenance.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.860
There are also cultural aspects.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.530
All across the world,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.700
there are many religious
and celebratory occasions

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.200
where the preservation of foods

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.730
now has a social
and customary meaning.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.900
The approach is now taken

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.060
that we preserve food
because we want to

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.030
rather than because we have to.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.330
Food processing and preservation

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.800
is a set of methods
and techniques used

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.100
to transform raw ingredients
into food

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.860
so that they may be safely
consumed by humans and animals.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.430
This process takes
raw ingredients such as meats,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.330
vegetables, and fruits

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.830
and converts them
into safe, edible,

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.700
and more palatable foodstuffs.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.330
Without these methods,
it would be almost impossible

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
to sustain the needs
of many urban populations

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.130
due to the fact that by the time
the food is transported

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.600
to its destination,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600
it would have
already been spoiled.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.300
If food processing
and preservation didn't exist,

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.600
the choices of food available
to families

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.530
would be dramatically decreased.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.200
We would also be subjected

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.700
to only what is in season
at any given time of year.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.000
There are many benefits
of processing and preservation,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.460
including toxin removal,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.200
pathogen elimination,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.230
food safety,

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.160
the improvement of flavor,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.030
and maintaining
food consistency.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.960
Modern processing
and preservation

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.830
also improves
the quality of life

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.000
for people with allergies,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.600
diabetics,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.660
and other people
who cannot consume

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.700
common certain food elements.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.100
But there are also a few
drawbacks to processed foods.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.260
Food processing can lower
the nutritional value of foods,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.760
as they tend
to contain additives,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.300
such as flavorings and textures,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.530
which have little or no
nutritional value.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.800
And the preservatives
added during processing,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.500
such as nitrites or sulphites,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.230
may cause
adverse health effects.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.030
But it is widely believed
that drawbacks such as these

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.260
are only minor when compared
to the potential risk

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.700
of contamination
of unprocessed foods by bacteria

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.430
such as salmonella and other
pathogenic microorganisms.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.960
Almost every food that you eat

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.260
undergoes some form
of processing

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.600
before it is ready
to be consumed.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.500
It can be as simple as washing
an apple before you eat it...

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.700
Through to processes
as complicated as prepping meat

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.230
and transporting it
to a local supermarket.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.500
Simply combining foods
to create a recipe

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.730
is also considered
a form of food processing.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.230
The most traditional
methods include

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.800
peeling or skinning,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.930
chopping and slicing,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.660
mincing,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.900
liquidization,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.000
emulsification,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.300
mixing,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.600
gas,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.160
proofing,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.600
spray drying,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.030
pasteurization,

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.360
and cooking.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.930
The peeling or skinning
of unwanted layers

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.900
on such fruits
as oranges or bananas

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.160
makes the edible part
of the fruit more accessible.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.760
The chopping or slicing
of potato chips...

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.600
Diced carrots and onions

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.830
is a process that allows food
to be mixed, handed,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.500
and easily ingested.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.700
The liquidization of fruits
into juice

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.660
like apple juice,
orange juice,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.930
or any type of fruit
or vegetable juice,

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.260
for that matter,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.600
makes food
into a drinkable liquid.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.000
Emulsification is the mixture
of two unblendable substances

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.500
such as oil and vinegar.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.800
Naturally, these two substances
will separate from one another

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.960
and need to be shaken
before use.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.800
Any time herbs and spices
are added to a food product,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.060
it is also considered
to be food processing.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.830
This form of food processing
is generally used

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.060
to make the food more flavorsome

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.600
and, by extension,
make it more enjoyable.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.160
There are many foods
which require the use

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.500
of air entrapment or aeration
in order to be produced,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.830
such as in the process
of making bread

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.530
or the gasification
of soft drinks.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.960
Without this process,
products such as breads,

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.130
doughnuts, or biscuits
wouldn't exist.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.100
Proofing is another step
in creating yeast breads

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.600
and baked goods where the yeast
is allowed to leaven the dough.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.100
It is this step in which allows
dough to rise.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.300
Spray drying
is a commonly used method

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.560
of drying a liquid
through hot gas.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.260
This is common in powdered foods
and milk powders.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.960
Pasteurized products,
such as eggs and milk,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.500
all go through
a pasteurize process,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.960
which involves heating

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.960
for the purpose of destroying
viruses and harmful organisms

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.360
such as bacteria, protozoa,
and molds.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.800
This process isn't aimed

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.200
at killing the microorganisms
in the food.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.130
Instead it reduces their numbers

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.430
so that they are unlikely
to cause disease.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:21.830
Cooking via any type of heat
encompasses a vast range

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.000
of methods, tools,
and combinations

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.930
such as boiling,

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.830
broiling,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.460
frying,

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.260
grilling,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.900
or deep frying

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.230
are all very common types
of food processing,

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.160
and they generally,
although not always,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.900
chemically transform it,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.800
changing its flavor, texture,
and appearance.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.900
As of the beginning
of the 20th century,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.660
these different methods
of food processing

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.130
have become commonplace
in our society.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.260
Food preservation
is a part of everyday life.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.700
Almost every product

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.400
in a supermarket
or convenience store

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.460
has undergone some type
of preservation process.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.130
Food preservation is the method
in which the treating

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:19.660
and handling of food
helps to slow down spoilage

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.860
and prevent food-borne illness
such as fungi, bacteria,

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.960
and other microorganisms

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.360
as well as inhibit
the natural aging process

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.100
of foods such as
fruits and vegetables.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.130
There are many different methods
of food preservation

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.360
that range from being
rudimentary to quite advanced.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:46.360
Drying is primarily used
to preserve meats and fruits.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.830
It is one of the oldest forms
of preservation,

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.600
in which the water content
of the food is greatly reduced.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.230
Smoking is a combination
of using heat

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.630
to dry foods
without cooking it.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.800
It is commonly used
in fish and meats

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.500
and ensures that the flavor
is not lost during the process.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.130
One of the most common
methods used

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.700
for commercial enterprises
such as supermarkets

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.030
is freezing.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.730
By freezing foodstuffs
and products,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.630
the shelf life of foods
such as vegetables and fruits

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.960
can be greatly extended,

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.430
and the nutritional loss
is minimal.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.700
Vacuum packaging is generally
used for foods such as nuts.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.900
By storing food
in a vacuum-like environment

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.360
such as an airtight bag
or bottle,

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.930
it eliminates the air needed
for the survival

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.830
of most bacteria
and other microorganisms.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.560
Similar to the process
of drying,

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.030
salting draws the moisture
out of the meats

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.360
through the method of osmosis,

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.000
although this process
of food preservation

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.700
draws the nutrients
out of the meats.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.660
Primarily, sugar is used
to preserve fruits

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.160
such as apricots, peaches,
plums, and apples.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.400
This process is also used

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.730
to preserve certain types
of alcohol that contain fruits

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.830
such as brandy
or other fruit-based spirits.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:16.130
Most pickling processes involve
the heating or boiling of foods

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:20.660
such as corned beef,
vegetables, and cabbage.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.160
The foods are usually saturated
in a preserving liquid

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.160
such as vinegar, ethanol,
or vegetable oil,

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.230
which, when combined with heat,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.030
kills any bacteria
that may form.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.430
Many kinds
of fruits and vegetables

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:38.230
can be kept for many years

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:42.060
by storing them
in cans or bottles.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.800
In the case of canning,

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.400
the foods are stored
in airtight containers

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.260
and then heated to a temperature

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.900
that destroys
any remaining microorganisms.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.800
This is an extremely effective
way to transport foods

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.160
to underdeveloped
and remote parts of the world.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.860
Irradiation is food processing

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.030
that involves
ionizing radiation.

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.830
This can be achieved
by either high-energy electrons

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.200
or a certain type of X-ray

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.730
and is sometimes referred to
as cold pasteurization,

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.560
where the food is not heated,
but it is not chilled either.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.730
Salad type foods are generally
difficult to preserve.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.960
But when placed
in an atmosphere

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.600
with a reduced
oxygen concentration

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.130
and sealed in bags,

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.800
their shelf life
is greatly extended

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.900
and the nutrients retained.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.500
As you can see, there are many
different ways to preserve food.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.100
All the techniques
which we have covered

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:50.030
are in use every day
all over the world.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.860
The process of food preserving
and processing

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.600
at times can be
a complicated one.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.630
When people purchase
a food product,

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.260
they expect it to be
of a certain safe quality

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.900
and standard.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.930
With the various methods
of processing and preserving,

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:18.360
manufacturers must adhere to
many quality assurance policies

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.100
to ensure that through
the handling, preparation,

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.730
and storage of food

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.530
that food-borne illness
will not occur.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.760
When at home,
the method of processing food

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.960
to avoid bacterial infection
can be a relatively easy task

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.930
but also a crucial one.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:40.060
There are a few simple rules
you should always remember.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:45.600
Always wash your hands
before handling food.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.560
Wash all fruit and vegetables
with water,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.830
especially if they are uncooked.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.330
Keep all work surfaces,
cooking utensils,

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.860
and plates
clean and dry.

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.800
Also try not to prepare food
when you are sick

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.230
or just recovering
from an illness.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.760
You could spread the illness
to other people,

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.830
or it could stunt
your own recovery.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.600
But what do you do when buying
food that is preprepared?

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.360
How can you be sure that it's
been through all the processing

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.800
and preservation
safety precautions?

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.800
During the 1960s,
a system was put in place

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.460
by the National Aeronautic
and Space Administration

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.560
to prevent food safety hazards
for astronauts whilst in space.

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.160
The idea of an astronaut
becoming sick

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.930
whilst in zero gravity

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.130
was too catastrophic
to imagine for NASA,

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:49.430
so they implemented a strict
program of quality assurance

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.960
to ensure that it would
never be an issue.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.730
That very same program
has been adopted

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.500
by food companies
around the world

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.460
to help control
the food production process.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.560
This program is now known
as HACCP.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.860
This stands for Hazard Analysis
Critical Control Point.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.800
Basically,
what the HACCP program means

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.730
is finding out
where the serious problems occur

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.260
in processing and preservation,

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.500
monitoring those steps
for problems,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.830
and fixing any if they occur.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.500
There are seven key steps
to the HACCP program.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.760
Hazard analysis.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.730
Hazards are factors that
the processes cannot control.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:41.860
Usually these are elements
found in foods

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.600
before processing begins.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.130
Producers, suppliers,
and transporters

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.230
use quality assurance

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.860
to eliminate and reduce
these hazards

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.030
before they take
any further steps.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:15:00.660
Identify the critical
control points.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.300
Common critical control points
are sanitation

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.700
and temperature control

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:09.200
used to eliminate
any further hazards.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.860
Critical limits.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.060
It is important
to set critical limits

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:16.730
for each critical control point.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.960
These are usually
temperature-orientated.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.260
A good example of this would be

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.660
if the chilling
or cooking temperature

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:28.500
goes under or over
the critical limit.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.460
If it does, there could be
a serious problem.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.930
Monitoring.

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.200
All the critical control points
need to be monitored

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.930
to see if all the targets
are being met.

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.760
And also, you can see instantly
if something goes wrong.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.800
Establish corrective actions.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.930
These are actions and procedures
set in place

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.200
in the event
that something goes wrong.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.800
This ensures that the problem
can be quickly resolved.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.900
Correct system operations.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.330
Having a HACCP system
is imperative.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.900
But what good is it

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.530
if you don't know
if it's working correctly?

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:13.930
The system needs to be
constantly tested

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:17.060
in order to know
that the results you are getting

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.230
are the results you want.

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.860
Set up records.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:25.460
It is imperative
that accurate records be kept

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.700
in order
to regulate performance.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:34.060
Precise records are also helpful
in the event of an audit.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.900
The HACCP system
is constantly in evolution

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.260
as it changes with the needs
of customers

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.930
who are always expecting
higher standards

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.300
in food quality control.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.930
It is a means of preventing
problems in the first place,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:52.160
being proactive
about food safety

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.360
rather than reactive.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.400
Let's look at an example
of the processes involved

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.560
with one food product:
milk.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:13.400
We'll cover how it is harvested,
processed, and preserved

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.000
from the time
cows are on the farm

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.500
through to it being delivered
onto our supermarket shelves.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.430
On the farm,
cows tend to spend their time

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.300
in eight-hour increments.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.760
They eat for eight hours a day,

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.960
spend eight hours ruminating,
or chewing their cud,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.160
and about eight hours sleeping.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.130
In the morning,
after they are milked,

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.030
they are provided with a fresh
paddock of grass to graze

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.330
and another fresh paddock
in the evening.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.960
Sometimes they are fed grain,
hay, or silage

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.660
but only if there is
not enough grass available.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.100
Typically, cows are milked
twice a day,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:05.100
normally around 6:00 a.m.
and then again around 5:00 p.m.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:08.800
It takes around five minutes
to milk each cow,

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.860
depending on the type
of robotic dairy

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.930
that the farm is using

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:16.200
and the amount of milk
that the cow is producing.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.600
Most robotic dairies
have the capability

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.160
to milk up to 40 cows
at any given time,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.560
which reduces
the cows' waiting time.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:29.060
These robotic dairies
have milking machines

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.460
which mimic the action
of young calves,

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.300
creating a pulsating vacuum
around the teat,

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:40.700
which in turn causes the milk
to be released from the udder.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.460
The milk that is harvested
from the cows

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:48.360
is then stored in massive vats
or silos at 4 degrees Celsius

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.700
for no longer than 48 hours.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.730
The milk is collected
from the farms

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.600
every 24 to 48 hours,

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.500
then transported
in stainless steel tankers

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.860
which are heavily insulated

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.730
to keep the milk
at a low temperature.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.860
All of
the transportation drivers

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.130
are accredited milk graders
and constantly monitor

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.530
the quality and temperature
of the milk

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:18.430
before, during, and after
the transfer.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.330
Samples are taken
and tested for protein,

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:25.330
bulk milk cell count,
and bacteria

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:30.100
before the milk enters
the factory processing area.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.730
If the milk does not meet
a high standard,

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.660
it will be rejected.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.030
Farmers are accountable
for the rejected milk,

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.360
and since they are paid
on the quality

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.430
and composition of their milk,

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.130
it is important
that these samples

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.930
are collected
and stored correctly.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.430
Once the transported milk
has passed the testing process,

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.760
it is only then accepted
into the processing plant

00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.960
and stored in other
temperature-controlled silos.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.100
The next step
is the pasteurization process.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.700
Pasteurization involves heating
every particle of the milk

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:13.830
to a specific temperature
for a precise amount of time

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.800
and then cooling it again

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.630
to prevent remaining bacteria
from growing to levels

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.060
that could cause premature
spoilage such as souring.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.360
Its purpose is to ensure
that all milk products

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.700
are safe
for human consumption

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:31.060
by destroying
all the bacteria

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.960
that may be harmful
to our health.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.530
The next step
is homogenization.

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.560
This involves the pushing
of raw milk through an atomizer,

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:45.230
which disperses the fat evenly
throughout the milk

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:49.030
and stops the fat from floating
to the top of the container.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:55.160
A separate process
to pasteurization is called UHT,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.030
or ultra-high temperature
process.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:03.230
This creates a shelf-stable
product with a long life.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:08.030
Both pasteurized and UHT milk
can then be cartoned

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:10.360
using aseptic packaging,

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.760
a method that transfers
a heat-processed liquid

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.260
into a package
without allowing contamination.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.300
After all the stages
are complete,

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.800
the milk is then shipped off
to the stores,

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.930
ready for human consumption.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.530
Today we have a wider variety
of food products available

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.200
than ever before.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:42.160
And there are many, many ways
to process and preserve foods.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.660
Some of them are very old

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.360
and date back
thousands of years.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.360
And some of them are on
the cutting edge of technology,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.130
an edge which is constantly
developing and evolving.
