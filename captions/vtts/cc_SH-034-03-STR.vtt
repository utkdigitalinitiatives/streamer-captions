00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.670


2
00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:06.000
Hear me, grave fathers, noble tribunes, stay.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.170
For pity on mine age, whose youth was spent

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.730
in dangerous wars whilst you securely slept;

5
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.730
for all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed,

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.830
for all the frosty nights that I have watched,

7
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.130
and for these bitter tears, which now you see

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.500
filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks,

9
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.270
be pitiful to my condemned sons,

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.430
whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.

11
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.900
For two and twenty sons I never wept,

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.530
because they died in honor's lofty bed.

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.970
For these, tribunes, in the dust I write

14
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.030
my heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears.

15
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.130
Let my tears staunch the earth's dry appetite.

16
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.730
My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.

17
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.600
O, earth, I will befriend thee more with rain

18
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.130
than youthful April shall with all his showers.

19
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.170
In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still.

20
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.600
In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow

21
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.100
and keep eternal springtime on thy face,

22
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.700
so thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

23
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.370
O, reverend tribunes, gentle aged men,

24
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.330
unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death,

25
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.230
and let me say that never wept before,

26
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.930
my tears are now prevailing orators.

27
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.400
O, noble father, you lament in vain.

28
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.930
The tribunes hear you not.

29
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.430
No man is by, and you recount your sorrows to a stone.

30
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.170
Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.

31
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.530
Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you.

32
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.330
My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.

33
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.230
Why, 'tis no matter, man.

34
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.970
If they did hear, they would not mark me.

35
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.400
If they did mark, they would not pity me.

36
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.030
Yet plead I must, and bootless unto them.

37
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.200
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones,

38
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.730
who though they cannot answer my distress,

39
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.970
yet in some sort, they are better than the tribunes,

40
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.800
for that they will not intercept my tale.

41
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.100
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet

42
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.370
receive my tears and seem to weep with me.

43
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.470
And were they but attired in grave weeds,

44
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.200
Rome could afford no tribunes like to these.

45
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.500
A stone is soft as wax, tribunes more hard than stones.

46
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.900
A stone is silent and offendeth not,

47
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.670
and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.

48
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.900
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?

49
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.970
To rescue my two brothers from their death,

50
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.370
for which attempt the judges have pronounced

51
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.430
my everlasting doom of banishment.

52
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.900
O, happy man, they have befriended thee.

53
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.100
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive

54
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.800
that Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?

55
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.200
Tigers must prey,

56
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.400
and Rome affords no prey but me and mine.

57
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.500
How happy art thou then,

58
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.000
from these devourers to be banished?

59
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.400
But who comes with my brother Marcus here?

60
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.830
Titus, prepare thine aged eyes to weep

61
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.270
or, if not so, thy noble heart to break.

62
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.770
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.

63
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.330
Will it consume me?

64
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.870
Let me see it, then.

65
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.900
This was thy daughter.

66
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.300
Why, Marcus, so she is.

67
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.000
Ay me; this object kills me.

68
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.030
Fainthearted boy, arise and look on her.

69
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.300
Speak, Lavinia!

70
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.400
What accursed hand

71
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.300
hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?

72
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.230
What fool hath added water to the sea

73
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.000
or brought a fagot to bright-burning Troy?

74
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.270
My grief was at the height before thou came'st,

75
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.330
and now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds.

76
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.800
Give me a sword; I'll chop off my hands too,

77
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.100
for they have fought for Rome, and all in vain,

78
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.100
and they have nursed this woe in feeding life.

79
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.730
In bootless prayer have they been held up,

80
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.030
and they have served me to effectless use.

81
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.770
Now all the service I require of them

82
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.030
is that the one may help to cut the other.

83
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.900
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands,

84
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.430
for hands to do Rome service is but vain.

85
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.170
Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyred thee?

86
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.100
O, that delightful engine of her thoughts

87
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.000
that blabbed them with such pleasing eloquence

88
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.400
is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,

89
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.170
where like a sweet, melodious bird,

90
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.030
it sang sweet, varied notes, enchanting every ear.

91
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.100
O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?

92
00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.600
O, thus I found her straying in the park,

93
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.670
seeking to hide herself as doth the deer

94
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.470
that hath received some unrecuring wound.

95
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.900
It was my deer, and he that wounded her

96
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.300
hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead;

97
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.830
for now I stand as one upon a rock

98
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.800
environed with a wilderness of sea

99
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.670
who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,

100
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.600
ever expecting when some envious surge

101
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.200
will in his brinish bowels swallow him.

102
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.330
This way to death my wretched sons are gone.

103
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.870
Here stands my other son, a banished man,

104
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.230
and here my brother, weeping at my woes.

105
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.430
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn

106
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.130
is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.

107
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.930
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,

108
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.270
it would have madded me.

109
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.170
What shall I do, now I behold thy lifely body so?

110
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.530
Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears,

111
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.470
nor tongue to tell me who hath martyred thee.

112
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.930
Thy husband, he is dead, and for his death

113
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.430
thy brothers are condemned and dead by this.

114
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.430
O, Marcus.

115
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.430
O, son Lucius, look on her.

116
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.770
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears

117
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.370
stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey dew

118
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.970
upon a gathered lily almost withered.

119
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.570
Perchance she weeps because they killed her husband;

120
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.900
perchance because she knows them innocent.

121
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.800
If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful,

122
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.730
because the law hath taken revenge on them.

123
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.070
No, no; they would not do so vile a deed.

124
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.100
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.

125
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:58.170
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips,

126
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.700
or give some sign how I may do thee ease.

127
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.370
Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius

128
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.300
and thou and I sit round about some fountain,

129
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.930
looking all downwards to behold our cheeks,

130
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.300
how they are stained, like meadows yet not dry

131
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.170
with miry slime left on them by a flood?

132
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.500
And in that fountain shall we gaze so long,

133
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.000
till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness

134
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.970
and made a brine pit with our bitter tears?

135
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.300
Or shall we cut away our hands like thine?

136
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.030
Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows

137
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.170
pass the remainder of our hateful days?

138
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.830
What shall we do?

139
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.870
Let us that have our tongues plot some device

140
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.800
of further misery to make us wondered at in time to come.

141
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.630
Sweet father, cease your tears,

142
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.230
for at your grief see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.

143
00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.930
Patience, dear niece.

144
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:04.930
Good Titus, dry thine eyes.

145
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.900
O, Marcus, brother Marcus,

146
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.230
well I wot thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,

147
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.630
for thou, poor man, hath drowned it with thine own.

148
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.670
Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.

149
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.000
Mark, Marcus, mark.

150
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.130
I understand her signs.

151
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.830
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say that

152
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.070
to her brother which I said to thee.

153
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.370
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,

154
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.330
can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.

155
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:50.970
O, what a sympathy of woe is this,

156
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.430
as far from help as Limbo is from bliss.

157
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.100
Titus Andronicus,

158
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.700
my lord, the emperor, sends thee this word:

159
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.830
that if thou love thy sons, let Marcus, Lucius,

160
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.270
or thyself, old Titus, or any one of you,

161
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:13.830
chop off your hand and send it to the king.

162
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.170
He for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive,

163
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.900
and that shall be the ransom for their fault.

164
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.970
O, gracious emperor.

165
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.230
O, gentle Aaron.

166
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.000
Did ever raven sing so like a lark

167
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.400
to bring sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?

168
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.430
With all my heart, I'll send the emperor my hand.

169
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.600
Good Aaron, will thou help to chop it off?

170
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.530
Stay, father, for that noble hand of thine

171
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.970
that hath thrown down so many enemies shall not be sent.

172
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.470
My hand will serve the turn.

173
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.230
My youth can better spare my blood than you,

174
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.270
and therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.

175
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.970
Which of your hands hath not defended Rome

176
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.600
and reared aloft the bloody battle-ax,

177
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.370
writing destruction on the enemy's castle?

178
00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:47.830
O, none of both but are of high desert.

179
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.370
My hand hath been but idle.

180
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:51.930
Let it serve to ransom my two nephews from their death.

181
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:53.630
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.

182
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.330
Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,

183
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.970
for fear they die before their pardon come.

184
00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.070
My hand shall go.

185
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.170
By heaven, it shall not go.

186
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.600
Sirs, strive no more.

187
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.370
Such withered herbs as these are meet for plucking up,

188
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.570
and therefore mine.

189
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.270
Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,

190
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:08.970
let me redeem my brothers both from death.

191
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.330
And for thy father's sake and mother's care,

192
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.300
now let me show a brother's love to thee.

193
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.970
Agree between you; I will spare my hand.

194
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.070
Then I'll go fetch an ax.

195
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.270
I will use the ax.

196
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.600
Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both.

197
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.900
Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.

198
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.030
If that be called deceit, I will be honest

199
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.200
and never whilst I live deceive men so.

200
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.970
But I'll deceive thee in another sort,

201
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.870
and that thou say ere half an hour pass.

202
00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.700
Now strive no more!

203
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.270
What shall be is dispatched.

204
00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.700
Good Aaron, send His Majesty my hand.

205
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.230
Tell him it was a hand

206
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.200
that warded him from thousand dangers.

207
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.770
Bid him bury it.

208
00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.500
More hath it merited; that let it have.

209
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.000
As for my sons, say I account of them

210
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.770
as jewels purchased at an easy price,

211
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.770
and yet dear too, because I bought mine own.

212
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.630
I go, Andronicus, and for thy hand

213
00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.900
look by and by to have thy sons with thee.

214
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.700
Their heads, I mean.

215
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.470
O, how this villainy doth fat me

216
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:48.870
with the very thoughts of it.

217
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:54.270
Let fools do good and fair men call for grace.

218
00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:58.400
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.

219
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:05.930
O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven

220
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.200
and bow this feeble ruin to the earth.

221
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.100
If any power pities wretched tears, to that I call!

222
00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.900
What, wouldst thou kneel with me?

223
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.800
Do, then, dear heart,

224
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.670
for heaven shall hear our prayers.

225
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.700
Or with our tears, we'll breathe the welkin dim

226
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.600
and stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds

227
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.870
when they do hug him in their melting bosoms.

228
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:34.970
O, brother, speak with possibility,

229
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.530
and do not break into these deep extremes.

230
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.970
Are not my sorrows deep?

231
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:44.070
Having no limit, be then my passions limitless with them.

232
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.400
But yet let reason govern thy lament.

233
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.200
If there were reason for these miseries,

234
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.100
then into limits could I bind my woes.

235
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.170
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?

236
00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:01.300
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,

237
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.600
threatening the welkin with his big-swollen face?

238
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.330
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?

239
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.600
I am the sea!

240
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.700
Hark how her sighs do blow.

241
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.270
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth.

242
00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:23.070
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs.

243
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.230
Then must my earth with her continual tears

244
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.800
become a deluge, overflowed and drowned.

245
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.730
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,

246
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.670
but like a drunkard must I vomit them.

247
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:46.000
Then give me leave, for losers will have leave

248
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.870
to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

249
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.470
Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid

250
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.670
for that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.

251
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:05.930
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons,

252
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:13.070
and here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back

253
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:18.100
thy grief their sports, thy resolution mocked,

254
00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:21.330
that woe is me to think upon thy woes,

255
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.070
more than remembrance of my father's death.

256
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.770
Now let hot Etna cool in Sicily,

257
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.170
and be my heart an ever-burning hell.

258
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.630
These miseries are more than may be borne.

259
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.630
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal,

260
00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.500
but sorrow flouted at is double death.

261
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:05.230
Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,

262
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.600
and yet detested life not shrink thereat.

263
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.800
That ever death should let life bear his name

264
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.200
where life hath no more interest but to breathe.

265
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.570
Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless

266
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.300
as frozen water to a starved snake.

267
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:29.970
When will this fearful slumber have an end?

268
00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.170
Now farewell, flattery.

269
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.700
Die, Andronicus.

270
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.200
Thou dost not slumber.

271
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.500
See thy two sons' heads, thy warlike hand,

272
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.200
thy mangled daughter here, thy other banished son

273
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.470
with this dear sight struck pale and bloodless,

274
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.770
and thy brother, I,

275
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.070
even like a stony image, cold and numb.

276
00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.830
Ah! Now no more will I control thy griefs.

277
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.730
Rent off thy silver hair, thy other hand

278
00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.230
gnawing with thy teeth, and be this dismal sight

279
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.830
the closing up of our most wretched eyes.

280
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.470
This is a time to storm!

281
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.130
Why art thou still?

282
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.500
Ha, ha, ha.

283
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.630
Why dost thou laugh?

284
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.470
It fits not with this hour.

285
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:16.800
Why, I have not another tear to shed.

286
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:25.170
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy

287
00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.570
and would usurp upon my watery eyes

288
00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.470
and make them blind with tributary tears.

289
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:34.700
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?

290
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:39.470
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,

291
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.030
and threat me, I shall never come to bliss

292
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.900
till all these mischiefs be returned again,

293
00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.600
even in their throats which have committed them.

294
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.270
Come, let me see what task I have to do.

295
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.100
You heavy people, circle me about,

296
00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.070
that I may turn me to each one of you

297
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:08.170
and swear upon my soul to right your wrongs.

298
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.300
The vow is made.

299
00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:39.270
Marcus, take thou a head,

300
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:43.170
and in this hand the other will I bear.

301
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.030
Lavinia, thou shalt be employed in this.

302
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:50.470
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.

303
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.730
As for thee, boy, go, get thee from my sight.

304
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.100
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay.

305
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.770
Hie to the Goths and raise an army there.

306
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:06.130
And if you love me and I think it so

307
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:10.830
let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.

308
00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.200
Farewell, Andronicus, my noble father,

309
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.500
the woefullest man that ever lived in Rome.

310
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.730
Farewell, proud Rome, till Lucius come again.

311
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:43.170
He loves his pledges dearer than his life.

312
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.930
Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister.

313
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.630
O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been.

314
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:57.400
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives

315
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.470
but in oblivion and hateful griefs.

316
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.670
If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs

317
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:09.030
and make proud Saturnine and his empress

318
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.970
beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen.

319
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.130
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power

320
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.970
to be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.

321
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.330
So so, now sit.

322
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.000
And look you eat no more

323
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.500
than will preserve just so much strength in us

324
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.630
as will revenge these bitter woes of ours.

325
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.400
Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot.

326
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.930
Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands

327
00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.670
and cannot passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms.

328
00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.200
This poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize

329
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.730
upon my breast, who, when my heart,

330
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.170
all mad with misery, beats in the hollow prison

331
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:30.870
of this flesh, then thus I thump it down.

332
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.000
Thou map of woe that thus must talk in signs.

333
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.200
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,

334
00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.600
thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.

335
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:49.870
Wound it with sighing, girl; kill it with groans,

336
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.770
or get some little knife between thy teeth

337
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:54.500
and just against thou heart make thou a hole,

338
00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.630
that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall

339
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.870
may run into that sink and, soaking in,

340
00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.770
drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.

341
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.430
Fie, brother, fie!

342
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.970
Teach her not thus to lay such violent hands

343
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.600
upon her tender life.

344
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.630
How now; has sorrow made thee dote already?

345
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.130
Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.

346
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.370
What violent hands can she lay on her life?

347
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.030
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,

348
00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.570
lest we remember still that we have none.

349
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.030
Fie, fie, how frantically I shape my talk,

350
00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.830
as if we could forget we have no hands

351
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.700
if Marcus did not name the word of hands.

352
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.430
Come, let's fall to.

353
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.570
Gentle girl, eat this.

354
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.570
Here is no drink.

355
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.900
Hark, Marcus, what she says.

356
00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.400
I can interpret all her martyred signs.

357
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.130
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,

358
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.930
brewed with her sorrows, meshed upon her cheeks.

359
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.330
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought.

360
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:10.730
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect

361
00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.130
as begging hermits at their holy prayers.

362
00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:16.400
Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,

363
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.930
nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,

364
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.330
but I of these will wrest an alphabet

365
00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.530
and by still practice learn to know thy meaning.

366
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.400
Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments.

367
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.070
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.

368
00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.770
Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,

369
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.000
doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.

370
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.100
Peace, tender sapling.

371
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.870
Thou art made of tears,

372
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.870
and tears will quickly melt thy life away.

373
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.070
What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?

374
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.700
At that that I have killed, my lorda fly.

375
00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.830
Out on thee, murderer; thou kill'st my heart!

376
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:03.570
Mine eyes are cloyed with view of tyranny.

377
00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.470
A deed of death done on the innocent

378
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.700
becomes not Titus' brother.

379
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.800
Get thee gone.

380
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.370
I see thou art not for my company.

381
00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.930
Alas, my lord, I have but killed a fly.

382
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:17.530
But how if that fly had a father and mother?

383
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.800
How would he hang his slender gilded wings

384
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.730
and buzz lamenting doings in the air.

385
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:27.800
Poor harmless fly that with his pretty buzzing melody

386
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.870
came here to make us merry, and thou hast killed him.

387
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.230
O, pardon, sir; it was a black, ill-favored fly,

388
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.700
like to the empress' Moor; therefore I killed him.

389
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:50.630
O, then pardon me for reprehending thee,

390
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:52.900
for thou hast done a charitable deed.

391
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.800
Give me thy knife; I will insult on him,

392
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.800
flattering myself as if it were the Moor

393
00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.630
come hither purposely to poison me.

394
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.370
There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.

395
00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.130
Ah, sirrah!

396
00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.500
Yet, I think, we are not brought so low

397
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.500
but that between us we can kill a fly

398
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.770
that comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.

399
00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.530
Alas, poor man; grief has so wrought on him,

400
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.630
he takes false shadows for true substances.

401
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.330
Come, take away.

402
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.230
Lavinia, go with me.

403
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.530
I'll to thy closet and go read with thee

404
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.470
sad stories chanced in the times of old.

405
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.030
Come, boy, and go with me.

406
00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.100
Thy sight is young,

407
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:05.900
and thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.

408
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:24.970
