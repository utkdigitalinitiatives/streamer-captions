00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:03.130
(music and voices incelebration)

3
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:26.770
(music and voices incelebration)

4
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.270
Make way for the Duke!

5
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.200
Stand back!

6
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.530
Proceed, Solinus, toprocure my fall

7
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.470
And by the doom of deathend woes and all.

8
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:32.570
(drumming)

9
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.030
Merchant of Syracuse,plead no more;

10
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.000
I am not partial toinfringe our laws:

11
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.900
The enmity and discordwhich of late

12
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.800
Sprung from the rancorousoutrage of your duke

13
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.530
To merchants, ourwell-dealing countrymen,

14
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.670
Who wanting guilders toredeem their lives

15
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.170
Have seal'd his rigorousstatutes with their bloods,

16
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.330
Excludes all pity from ourthreatening looks.

17
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.430
For, since the mortal andintestine jars

18
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.530
'Twixt thy seditiouscountrymen and us,

19
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.830
It hath in solemn synodsbeen decreed

20
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.300
Both by the Syracusiansand ourselves,

21
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.900
To admit no traffic to ouradverse towns Nay, more,

22
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.430
If any born at Ephesus beseen

23
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.600
At any Syracusian martsand fairs;

24
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.870
Again: if any Syracusianborn

25
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.500
Come to the bay ofEphesus, he dies,

26
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.070
His goods confiscate tothe duke's dispose,

27
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.370
Unless a thousand marks belevied,

28
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.830
To quit the penalty and toransom him.

29
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.800
Thy substance, valued atthe highest rate,

30
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.130
Cannot amount unto ahundred marks;

31
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.270
Therefore by law thou artcondemned to die.

32
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.100
Yet this my comfort: whenyour words are done,

33
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.570
My woes end likewise withthe evening sun.

34
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:13.130
Well, Syracusian, say inbrief the cause

35
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.570
Why thou departed'st fromthy native home

36
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.470
And for what cause thoucamest to Ephesus.

37
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.230
A heavier task could nothave been imposed

38
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.070
Than I to speak my griefsunspeakable:

39
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.100
Yet, that the world maywitness that my end

40
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.900
Was wrought by nature, notby vile offence,

41
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.330
I'll utter what my sorrowsgive me leave.

42
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.800
In Syracusa was I born,and wed

43
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.900
Unto a woman, happy butfor me,

44
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.700
And by me, had not our hapbeen bad.

45
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.000
With her I lived in joy;our wealth increased

46
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.730
By prosperous voyages Ioften made

47
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.530
To Epidamnum; till myfactor's death

48
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.100
And the great care ofgoods at random left

49
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.270
Drew me from kindembracements of my spouse:

50
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.730
From whom my absence wasnot six months old

51
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.800
Before herself, almost atfainting under

52
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.570
The pleasing punishmentthat women bear,

53
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.900
Had made provision for herfollowing me

54
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.370
And soon and safe arrivedwhere I was.

55
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.200
There had she not beenlong, but she became

56
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.100
A joyful mother of twogoodly sons;

57
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.570
And, which was strange,the one so like the other,

58
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.270
As could not bedistinguish'd but by names.

59
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.600
That very hour, and in theself-same inn,

60
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.870
A meaner woman wasdelivered

61
00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.270
Of such a burden, maletwins, both alike:

62
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.870
Those,--for their parentswere exceeding poor,--

63
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.870
I bought and brought up toattend my sons.

64
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.470
My wife, not meanly proudof two such boys,

65
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:18.000
Made daily motions for ourhome return:

66
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.700
Unwilling I agreed. Alas!too soon,

67
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.270
We came aboard.

68
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.470
A league from Epidamnumhad we sail'd,

69
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.370
Before the alwayswind-obeying deep

70
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.770
Gave any tragic instanceof our harm:

71
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.970
But longer did we notretain much hope;

72
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.730
For what obscured lightthe heavens did grant

73
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.100
Did but convey unto ourfearful minds

74
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.370
A doubtful warrant ofimmediate death;

75
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.830
Which though myself wouldgladly have embraced,

76
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.930
Yet the incessant weepingsof my wife,

77
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.530
Weeping before for whatshe saw must come,

78
00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.430
And piteous plainings ofthe pretty babes,

79
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.230
That mourn'd for fashion,ignorant what to fear,

80
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.170
Forced me to seek delaysfor them and me.

81
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.230
And this it was, for othermeans was none:

82
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.070
The sailors sought forsafety by our boat,

83
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.600
And left the ship, thensinking-ripe, to us:

84
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.670
My wife, more careful forthe latter-born,

85
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.030
Had fasten'd him unto asmall spare mast,

86
00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.570
Such as seafaring menprovide for storms;

87
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.400
To him one of the othertwins was bound,

88
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.400
Whilst I had been likeheedful of the other:

89
00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.770
The children thusdisposed, my wife and I,

90
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:55.570
Fixing our eyes on whomour care was fix'd,

91
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.300
Fasten'd ourselves ateither end the mast;

92
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.230
And floating straight,obedient to the stream,

93
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.900
Was carried towardsCorinth, as we thought.

94
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.670
At length the sun, gazingupon the earth,

95
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.330
Dispersed those vapoursthat offended us;

96
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.030
And by the benefit of hiswished light,

97
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:22.700
The seas wax'd calm, andwe discovered

98
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.570
Two ships from far makingamain to us,

99
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.600
Of Corinth that, ofEpidaurus this:

100
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.730
But ere they came,--O, letme say no more!

101
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.430
Gather the sequel by thatwent before.

102
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.170
Nay, forward, old man; donot break off so;

103
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.600
For we may pity, thoughnot pardon thee.

104
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.200
O, had the gods done so, Ihad not now

105
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.700
Worthily term'd themmerciless to us!

106
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.630
For, ere the ships couldmeet by twice five leagues,

107
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.000
We were encounterd by amighty rock;

108
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.070
Which being violentlyborne upon,

109
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.400
Our helpful ship wassplitted in the midst;

110
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.570
So that, in this unjustdivorce of us,

111
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.300
Fortune had left to bothof us alike

112
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.800
What to delight in, whatto sorrow for.

113
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.130
Her part, poor soul!seeming as burdened

114
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.570
With lesser weight but notwith lesser woe,

115
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.100
Was carried with morespeed before the wind;

116
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.170
And in our sight theythree were taken up

117
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.500
By fishermen of Corinth,as we thought.

118
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.600
At length, another shiphad seized on us;

119
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.370
And, knowing whom it wastheir hap to save,

120
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.270
Gave healthful welcome totheir shipwreck'd guests;

121
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.430
And would have reft thefishers of their prey,

122
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.570
Had not their bark beenvery slow of sail;

123
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:56.100
And therefore homeward didthey bend their course.

124
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:08.670
Thus have you heard mesever'd from my bliss;

125
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.900
That by misfortunes was mylife prolong'd,

126
00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.270
To tell sad stories of myown mishaps.

127
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.170
And for the sake of themthou sorrowest for,

128
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.000
Do me the favour to dilateat full

129
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.670
What hath befall'n of themand thee till now.

130
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.500
My youngest boy, and yetmy eldest care,

131
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.730
At eighteen years becameinquisitive

132
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.570
After his brother: andimportuned me

133
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.300
That his attendant--so hiscase was like,

134
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.870
Reft of his brother, butretain'd his name--

135
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:45.430
Might bear him company inthe quest of him:

136
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.070
Whom whilst I labour'd ofa love to see,

137
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.000
I hazarded the loss ofwhom I loved.

138
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.200
Five summers have I spentin furthest Greece,

139
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.830
Roaming clean through thebounds of Asia,

140
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.230
And, coasting homeward,came to Ephesus;

141
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:11.200
Hopeless to find, yetloath to leave unsought

142
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.400
Or that or any place thatharbours men.

143
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.430
But here must end thestory of my life;

144
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.000
And happy were I in mytimely death,

145
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.900
Could all my travelswarrant me they live.

146
00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:51.830
Hapless AEgeon, whom thefates have mark'd

147
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.200
To bear the extremity ofdire mishap!

148
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.130
Now, trust me, were it notagainst our laws,

149
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.700
Against my crown, my oath,my dignity,

150
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.700
Which princes, would they,may not disannul,

151
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.770
My soul would sue asadvocate for thee.

152
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.870
But, though thou artadjudged to the death

153
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.370
And passed sentence maynot be recall'd

154
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.070
But to our honour's greatdisparagement,

155
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:20.000
Yet I will favour thee inwhat I can.

156
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:27.230
Therefore, merchant, I'lllimit thee this day

157
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:31.100
To seek thy life bybeneficial help:

158
00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.130
Try all the friends thouhast in Ephesus;

159
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.670
Beg thou, or borrow, tomake up the sum,

160
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.800
And live; if no, then thouart doom'd to die.

161
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.500
Gaoler, take him to thycustody.

162
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.370
I will, my lord.

163
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.230
Hopeless and helpless dothAEgeon wend,

164
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.230
But to procrastinate hislifeless end.

165
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:09.330
(clock chimes)

166
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:15.700
(clock chimes)

167
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.700
Therefore give out you areof Epidamnum,

168
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.030
Lest that your goods toosoon be confiscate.

169
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:46.770
This very day a Syracusianmerchant

170
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.600
Is apprehended for arrivalhere;

171
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.800
And not being able to buyout his life

172
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.400
According to the statuteof the town,

173
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.270
Dies ere the weary sun setin the west.

174
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.230
There is your money that Ihad to keep.

175
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.300
Go bear it to the Centaur,where we host,

176
00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.270
And stay there, Dromio,till I come to thee.

177
00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.500
Within this hour it willbe dinner-time:

178
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.630
Till that, I'll view themanners of the town,

179
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.370
Peruse the traders, gazeupon the buildings,

180
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.570
And then return and sleepwithin mine inn,

181
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.270
For with long travel I amstiff and weary.

182
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.230
Get thee away.

183
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.030
Many a man would take youat your word,

184
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.000
And go indeed, having sogood a mean.

185
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.130
A trusty villain, sir,that very oft,

186
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:26.870
When I am dull with careand melancholy,

187
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:29.900
Lightens my humour withhis merry jests.

188
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.230
What, will you walk withme about the town,

189
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.870
And then go to my inn anddine with me?

190
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.270
I am invited, sir, tocertain merchants,

191
00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.070
Of whom I hope to makemuch benefit;

192
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:41.030
I crave your pardon. Soonat five o'clock,

193

Please you, I'll meet withyou upon the mart

194
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.400
And afterward consort youtill bed-time:

195
00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.600
My present business callsme from you now.

196
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.100
Farewell till then: I willgo lose myself

197
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.430
And wander up and down toview the city.

198
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:54.870
Sir, I commend you to yourown content.

199
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.730
He that commends me tomine own content

200
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.300
Commends me to the thing Icannot get.

201
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.530
I to the world am like adrop of water

202
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.800
That in the ocean seeksanother drop,

203
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.330
Who, falling there to findhis fellow forth,

204
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:16.170
Unseen, inquisitive,confounds himself:

205
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.000
So I, to find a mother anda brother,

206
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.870
In quest of them, unhappy,lose myself.

207
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.430
Here comes the almanac ofmy true date.

208
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.170
What now? how chance thouart return'd so soon?

209
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.930
Return'd so soon! ratherapproach'd too late:

210
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:40.270
The capon burns, the pigfalls from the spit,

211
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.970
The clock hath struckentwelve upon the bell;

212
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:44.330
My mistress made it oneupon my cheek:

213
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.230
She is so hot because themeat is cold;

214
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.430
The meat is cold becauseyou come not home;

215
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.470
You come not home becauseyou have no stomach;

216
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.370
You have no stomach havingbroke your fast;

217
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:54.100
But we that know what 'tisto fast and pray

218
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.200
Are penitent for yourdefault to-day.

219
00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.770
Stop in your wind, sir:tell me this, I pray:

220
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.500
Where have you left themoney that I gave you?

221
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.870
O,--sixpence, that I hado' Wednesday last

222
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.600
To pay the saddler for mymistress' crupper?

223
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.100
The saddler had it, sir; Ikept it not.

224
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.870
I am not in a sportivehumour now:

225
00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.470
Tell me, and dally not,where is the money?

226
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.530
We being strangers here,how darest thou trust

227
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.370
So great a charge fromthine own custody?

228
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.270
I pray you, air, as yousit at dinner:

229
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.200
I from my mistress come toyou in post;

230
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.870
If I return, I shall bepost indeed,

231
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.470
For she will score yourfault upon my pate.

232
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.670
Methinks your maw, likemine, should be your clock,

233
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.270
And strike you homewithout a messenger.

234
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.130
Come, Dromio, come, thesejests are out of season;

235
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:38.730
Reserve them till amerrier hour than this.

236
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:41.370
Where is the gold I gavein charge to thee?

237
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:44.600
To me, sir? why, you gaveno gold to me.

238
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.100
Come on, sir knave, havedone your foolishness,

239
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.530
And tell me how thou hastdisposed thy charge.

240
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.530
My charge was but to fetchyou from the mart

241
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.470
Home to your house, thePhoenix, sir, to dinner:

242
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.330
My mistress and her sisterstays for you.

243
00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.870
Now, as I am a Christian,answer me

244
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.600
In what safe place youhave bestow'd my money,

245
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.930
Or I shall break thatmerry sconce of yours

246
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.570
That stands on tricks whenI am undisposed:

247
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:10.270
Where is the thousandmarks thou hadst of me?

248
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.600
I have some marks of yoursupon my pate,

249
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.070
Some of my mistress' marksupon my shoulders,

250
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.900
But not a thousand marksbetween you both.

251
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.400
If I should pay yourworship those again,

252
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.230
Perchance you will notbear them patiently.

253
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.630
Thy mistress' marks? whatmistress, slave, hast thou?

254
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.070
Your worship's wife, mymistress at the Phoenix;

255
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.270
She that doth fast tillyou come home to dinner,

256
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.100
And prays that you willhie you home to dinner.

257
00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.970
What, wilt thou flout methus unto my face,

258
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:42.530
Being forbid? There, takeyou that, sir knave.

259
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.700
What mean you, sir? forGod's sake, hold your hands!

260
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.630
Nay, and you will not,sir, I'll take my heels.

261
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:50.530
Upon my life, by somedevice or other

262
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.500
The villain is o'er-raughtof all my money.

263
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.930
They say this town is fullof cozenage,

264
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.630
As, nimble jugglers thatdeceive the eye,

265
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.770
Dark-working sorcerersthat change the mind,

266
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.870
Soul-killing witches thatdeform the body,

267
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.470
Disguised cheaters,prating mountebanks,

268
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:12.700
And many such-likeliberties of sin:

269
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.130
If it prove so, I will begone the sooner.

270
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.470
I'll to the Centaur, to goseek this slave:

271
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.130
I greatly fear my money isnot safe.

272
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.970
