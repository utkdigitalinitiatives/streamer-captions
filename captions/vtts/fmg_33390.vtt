WEBVTT

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
NARRATOR:
 FROM THE WINDOW OF HIS HOME

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
IN EXILE
 ON THE CHANNEL ISLANDS,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
VICTOR HUGO COULD SEE
 THE COAST OF HIS NATIVE FRANCE.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
HERE, ON THE WINDSWEPT
 ISLE OF GUERNSEY,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
HUGO WOULD RISE
 AT 6:00 EVERY MORNING

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
AND SIT DOWN TO WORK.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
IT WAS THE DAILY ROUTINE OF
 A PRODIGIOUSLY PROLIFIC WRITER

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
WHO NOT ONLY FOUND
 SUCCESS IN POETRY,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
NOVELS, AND ON THE STAGE,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
BUT ALSO HELPED DEFINE
 A LITERARY TRADITION

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
AND CHANGE THE POLITICAL
 FACE OF HIS COUNTRY.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER
 AS A WRITER,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
HE NEVER TOOK
 HIS EYE OFF OF FRANCE.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
THE LIFE OF VICTOR HUGO,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
ONE OF THE GIANTS
 OF FRENCH LITERATURE,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
IS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
HE WAS BORN
 INTO HUMBLE CIRCUMSTANCES

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
AND YET DURING HIS YOUTH,
 HE WAS A STAUNCH MONARCHIST.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
IN HIS ADULT LIFE HE BECAME
 A POLITICAL LIBERAL

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
AND A SUPPORTER
 OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
BUT ALSO ACCEPTED
 THE TITLE OF PEER OF FRANCE

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
FROM KING LOUIS PHILLIPE.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
HE LIVED IN EXILE
 FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
BECAUSE OF HIS OPPOSITION
 TO NAPOLEON III,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
WHOSE NOMINATION TO
 THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
HE HAD ONCE SUPPORTED.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
LIKE THE MAN HIMSELF,
 HUGO'S WORKS ARE A DIZZYING

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
KALEIDOSCOPE OF CONTRASTS.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
VICTOR-MARIE HUGO WAS BORN
 ON FEBRUARY 26TH, 1802,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
IN BESANçON,
 IN THE SOUTHEAST OF FRANCE.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
HIS MOTHER, SOPHIE TRéBUCHET,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
WAS A MONARCHIST
 AND A FERVENT CATHOLIC,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
VALUES WHICH SHE INSTILLED
 IN HER THREE SONS.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
HIS FATHER,
 JOSEPH-LéOPOLD-SIGISBERT HUGO,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
WAS A GENERAL OF THE FRENCH
 EMPIRE WHO WAS ALSO A LIBERAL

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
AND AN ENTHUSIASTIC
 REPUBLICAN.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
THE FAMILY MOVED CONSTANTLY,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
AS YOUNG VICTOR'S FATHER
 PURSUED HIS MILITARY CAREER.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
HUGO ALSO WITNESSED
 SEVERAL PUBLIC EXECUTIONS

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
DURING HIS BOYHOOD,
 EVENTS HE FOUND SO TRAUMATIC

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
THAT WERE TO REMAIN INDELIBLY
 IMPRINTED UPON HIS PSYCHE.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
IN 1812, MADAME HUGO
 SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
AND MOVED WITH HER SONS TO
 THE CONVENT OF FEUILLANTINES,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
WHERE VICTOR LIVED FOR
 THE REST OF HIS BOYHOOD YEARS.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
HE AND HIS BROTHERS PLAYED
 IN THE CONVENT'S GARDEN.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
AND THIS IDYLLIC SETTING
 UNDOUBTEDLY INFORMED

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
HIS LOVE OF NATURE
 AND HIS POETIC IMAGINATION.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
"THE GARDEN WAS LARGE, DEEP,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
"MYSTERIOUS, CLOSED IN BY
HIGH CURIOUS LOOKING WALLS,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"SOWN WITH FLOWERS
OPENING LIKE EYELIDS,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
"AND RUBY-RED INSECTS
RUNNING ALONG THE STONES.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"IT WAS FULL OF BUZZINGS
AND CONFUSED VOICES;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
"IN THE MIDDLE, ALMOST A FIELD,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
"AT ITS HEART,
ALMOST A FOREST."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
HUGO FELT THE CALL
 OF A LIFE OF LETTERS EARLY.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
AT THE AGE OF 14, HE WROTE:

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
"I WANT TO BE
 CHATEAUBRIAND OR NOTHING."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
HE ATTENDED THE LYCéE
 LOUIS-LE GRAND IN PARIS,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
AND IN EARLY ADOLESCENCE
 BEGAN WRITING VERSE TRAGEDIES

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
POETRY, AND TRANSLATING
 VIRGIL.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
"AT TIMES,
WHEN EVERYTHING SLEEPS,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
"I SIT AND EXALT
OUR BROWS ABLAZE

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
"UNDER THE VAST
AND STARRY VAULT;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
"I LISTEN TO SEE IF SOME NOISE
FALLS FROM THE HEIGHTS;

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
"AND THE HOUR VAINLY
STRIKES ME WITH ITS WING

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
"WHEN I CONTEMPLATE,
MOVED BY THIS ETERNAL THING

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
"THAT THE SHINING HEAVENS
GIVE TO THE WORLD AT NIGHT."

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
AT THE AGE OF 17,
 VICTOR HUGO FELL MADLY IN LOVE

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
WITH HIS CHILDHOOD FRIEND,
 ADéLE FOUCHER.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
HIS MOTHER OPPOSED
 THE UNION, HOWEVER,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
AND OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS
 ADéLE AND VICTOR

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
MET FURTIVELY AND EXCHANGED
 OVER 150 LETTERS.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
VICTOR DEVOTED HIMSELF
 TO HIS LITERARY WORK

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
WITH EQUAL PASSION.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
TOGETHER WITH HIS BROTHERS
 HE FOUNDED A JOURNAL,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
THE CONSERVATEUR LITTéRAIRE,
 WHICH BECAME

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
A SEMINAL PUBLICATION
 OF FRENCH ROMANTICISM.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
HE ALSO WON A NUMBER
 OF AWARDS FOR HIS POETRY,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
INCLUDING TWO "MENTIONS"
 FROM THE ACADéMIE FRANçAISE.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
ON JUNE 27TH, 1821
 HIS MOTHER DIED.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
WITHOUT HER OBJECTIONS
 TO HOLD HIM BACK,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
VICTOR WAS FREE AT LAST
 TO MARRY ADéLE FOUCHER.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
THE SAME YEAR
 THAT HE AND ADéLE MARRIED,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
HIS LITERARY CAREER TOOK OFF.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
ON JUNE 8TH, 1822,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
HE PUBLISHED
 HIS FIRST COMPILATION,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
ODES AND VARIOUS POEMS,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
WHICH EARNED A ROYAL PENSION
 FROM LOUIS XVIII.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
HIS APARTMENT
 ON THE RUE DE CHAMPS

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
BECAME A HOTBED
 OF THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
ROMANTICISM, WHICH SPREAD
 THROUGH EUROPE IN THE 1820s,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
REJECTED THE DOGMATIC FORMULAS

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
OF LATE 18TH-CENTURY
 NEOCLASSICISM.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
THE ROMANTICS PRIZED
 IMAGINATION OVER REASON,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
EMOTION OVER LOGIC,
 INTUITION OVER SCIENCE,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
AND NATURE OVER ARTIFICE.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
IN 1827,
 HUGO PUBLISHED "CROMWELL,"

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
A POETIC DRAMA
 THAT HE HOPED WOULD TAKE

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
THE STAGE BY STORM
 FOR THE GLORY OF ROMANTICISM.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
IN HIS FOREWORD TO THE PLAY,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
HE CALLED
 FOR A LIBERATED THEATRE,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
FREE FROM THE RESTRICTIONS
 OF CLASSICISM.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
THIS TEXT WAS, IN EFFECT,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
THE FIRST PAMPHLET
 OF FRENCH ROMANTICISM.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
IN 1830,
 HE REALIZED HIS DREAM

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
OF CONQUERING
 THE FRENCH COMEDY,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
UNTIL THEN THE BASTION
 OF THE CLASSICISTS,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
WITH HIS PLAY, HERNANI.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
ON OPENING NIGHT,
 YOUNG HUGO PARTISANS

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
AND ANTAGONISTIC CLASSICISTS
 PACKED THE THEATRE

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
AND THE PLAY
 BECAME A BOISTEROUS,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT
 REFERENDUM ON ROMANTICISM.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
A LITERARY REVOLUTION WAS BORN,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
AND POLITICAL CHANGE
 WAS NOT FAR BEHIND.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
AT THE AGE OF 28,
 VICTOR HUGO'S FAME IS SECURED.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
HE HAS BECOME
 ONE OF THE MAIN SPOKESMEN

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
OF THE YOUNG ROMANTIC GUARD.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
ALONG WITH HIS
 THEATRICAL SUCCESSES,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
HUGO ALSO EXCELLED
 IN POETRY AND PROSE.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
IN 1829, HE PUBLISHED

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
"THE LAST DAY
 OF A CONDEMNED MAN,"

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
A NOVEL THAT ADVOCATES
 FOR THE ELIMINATION

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
OF THE DEATH PENALTY,
 AND "ORIENTAL POEMS,"

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
WHICH TAPS INTO THE ERA'S
 FASCINATION WITH THE FAR EAST.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
"THE MOON WAS CALM,
AND FLECKED THE OCEAN STREAMS.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
"THE CASEMENT OPENS
FREELY TO THE BREEZE;

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
"WHILE THE SULTANA WATCHES,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
"BREAKING SEAS
WEAVE THE BLACK ISLES

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
"BELOW WITH SILVER SEAMS."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
HUGO WAS NOT YET 30,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
AS HE ENTERED ONE OF THE MOST
 PRODUCTIVE PERIODS IN HIS LIFE.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
FROM 1830 TO 1843,
 HE DEVOTED HIMSELF

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
TO UNINTERRUPTED
 LITERARY CREATION.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
HIS FAMILY ALSO GREW,
 AS HE AND ADéLE

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
WELCOMED THE BIRTH
 OF THEIR FOURTH DAUGHTER.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
THEIR MARRIAGE,
 HOWEVER, WAS WEAKENED

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
BY ADéLE'S
 ROMANTIC ENTANGLEMENT

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
WITH THE WRITER
 AND CRITIC, SAINTE-BEUVE.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
VICTOR FOUND CONSOLATION
 IN JULIETTE DROUET,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
ONE OF THE ACTRESSES IN
 HIS PLAY, "LUCREZIA BORGIA."

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
 OF A RELATIONSHIP WHICH,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
THROUGH NUMEROUS RUPTURES
 AND RECONCILIATIONS,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
WOULD LAST A LIFETIME.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
DESPITE THESE
 AND OTHER INFIDELITIES,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
VICTOR AND ADéLE REMAINED
 MARRIED TO EACH OTHER

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
DESPITE HIS ENORMOUS
 POPULAR SUCCESS,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
VICTOR STILL LONGED
 FOR OFFICIAL RECOGNITION.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
IN 1841, AFTER MANY
 UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
HE ACHIEVED HIS DREAM
 OF BEING ELECTED

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
TO THE ACADéMIE FRANçAISE.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
HE HAD FINALLY REACHED
 THE PINNACLE OF HIS CAREER,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
BUT MISFORTUNE WAS
 JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
IN MARCH 1843,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
HIS EPIC DRAMA
 "THE BURGRAVES"

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
WAS BOOED AT ITS
 OPENING NIGHT PERFORMANCE.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
HUGO QUIT THE WORLD
 OF THEATRE IN FRUSTRATION.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
SOME MONTHS LATER, HIS BELOVED
 19 YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
LéOPOLDINE,
 DROWNED IN THE SEINE.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
HUGO WAS DEVASTATED,
 AND WOULD NOT VISIT HER GRAVE

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
UNTIL THREE YEARS LATER.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
"SINCE, FROM MY SOUL
ALL HOPE HAS PASSED AWAY...

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
"SINCE, IN THIS MONTH
OF FRAGRANCE AND THE ROSE,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
"MY CHILD! I WISH TO SHARE
THY DARK REPOSE;

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
"SINCE, DEAD MY HEART,
TOO LONG IN LIFE I STAY."

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
AT A TURNING POINT IN HIS LIFE,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
HUGO DECIDED TO EXPLORE
 HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
HE ABANDONED THE MONARCHISM
 OF HIS EARLY YOUTH

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
AND SUPPORTED LOUIS PHILIP'S
 CONSTITUTIONAL MONARCHY.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
IN 1845,
 THE KING REWARDED HUGO

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
BY NAMING HIM
 A PEER OF FRANCE.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
IN 1848,
 THE MONARCHY COLLAPSED

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
UNDER THE WEIGHT
 OF A POPULAR REVOLT.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
HUGO COMMITTED HIMSELF
 TO A POLITICAL STRUGGLE

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
THAT WOULD
 EVENTUALLY TRANSFORM HIM

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
INTO A RESOUNDING VOICE
 OF THE POOR AND THE OPPRESSED.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
HE WAS ELECTED
 TO THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
WHERE HE SUPPORTED
 FREE EDUCATION,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE FOR MEN,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
AND OTHER
 DEMOCRATIZING MEASURES.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
WHEN LOUIS NAPOLEON,
 NAPOLEON BONAPARTE'S NEPHEW,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
CAME ON THE POLITICAL SCENE,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
HE PRESENTED HIMSELF
 AS A LIBERAL SOCIAL REFORMIST,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
AN EXPERIENCED MILITARY MAN

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
AND A STRONG PROMOTER
 OF AGRICULTURAL

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
HUGO SUPPORTED
 HIS CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
OF THE NEW FRENCH REPUBLIC.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
LOUIS NAPOLEON WON BY
 AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
HOWEVER, IN 1851,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
HE STAGED A COUP D'ETAT
 AND ABOLISHED THE REPUBLIC.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
HUGO TRIED IN VAIN TO RALLY

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
THE WORKERS OF PARIS
 AGAINST NAPOLEON.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
ENCOURAGED BY HIS
 BROAD POPULAR SUPPORT,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
LOUIS NAPOLEON TRANSFORMED
 THE SECOND REPUBLIC

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
INTO THE SECOND EMPIRE,
 AND HIMSELF INTO NAPOLEON III.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
HIS AUTHORITARIAN REGIME
 WOULD RULE FRANCE

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
FOR THE FOLLOWING TWO DECADES.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
HUGO FLED TO BRUSSELS,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
WHERE HE WROTE AND PUBLISHED
 A FEROCIOUS SATIRE ENTITLED,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
"NAPOLEON THE LITTLE."

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
THE PUBLICATION OF THIS TEXT
 FORCED HIM TO LEAVE BELGIUM,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
A SMALL COUNTRY THAT
 WAS UNDERSTANDIBLY ANXIOUS

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
ABOUT NAPOLEON III'S
 IMPERIALIST INTENTIONS.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
HUGO FLED AGAIN, THIS TIME
 TO THE UNITED KINGDOM.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
IN AUGUST 1852,
 HE SETTLED WITH HIS FAMILY

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
ON THE ISLE OF JERSEY.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
WHILE LIVING ON JERSEY,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
HUGO GATHERED SUPPORTERS
 FOR HIS REPUBLICAN VIEWS,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
WHICH LED
 THE ISLE'S AUTHORITIES

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
TO EXPEL HIM
 THREE YEARS LATER.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
HE RELOCATED TO THE
 NEIGHBORING ISLE OF GUERNSEY,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
WHERE HE LIVED
 FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
DURING HIS EXILE,
 VICTOR HUGO THREW HIMSELF

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
INTO PHILOSOPHICAL
 AND LYRICAL POETRY.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
FAR FROM HIS HIGH-PROFILE
 PUBLIC LIFE IN PARIS,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
HE COULD NOW
 DEVOTE HIMSELF EXCLUSIVELY

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
TO HIS VOCATION AS A WRITER.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
HE WROTE "CONTEMPLATIONS,"

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
CONSIDERED HIS
 LYRICAL MASTERPIECE,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
AND "PUNISHMENTS," A COLLECTION
 OF POEMS THAT DENOUNCED

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
THE ABUSES
 OF THE NAPOLEONIC EMPIRE.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
HIS IS AMONG
 THE MOST VARIED

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
AND POWERFUL POETRY
 OF THE 19TH CENTURY.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
IN 1859, NAPOLEON III GRANTED
 AMNESTY TO POLITICAL EXILES.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
HUGO COULD HAVE RETURNED
 TO FRANCE, BUT HE REFUSED.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
HE DECLARED, "I SHALL RETURN
 WHEN FREEDOM RETURNS."

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
ON AUGUST 27TH, 1858,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
HIS WIFE ADéLE
 DIED IN BRUSSELS.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
VICTOR HUGO MARCHED
 WITH THE FUNERAL PROCESSION

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
UP TO THE BORDER
 WITH FRANCE

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
AND THEN RETURNED TO GUERNSEY
 ALONE, WHERE THE EVER FAITHFUL

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
JULIETTE DROUET
 WAS WAITING FOR HIM.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
ADéLE WAS BURIED IN FRANCE

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
NEXT TO HER DAUGHTER
 LéOPOLDINE.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
IN 1862 HUGO WROTE
 "LES MISERABLES,"

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
A NOVEL WITH A STRONG
 SOCIAL AGENDA,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
CONDEMNING THE EVERYDAY MISERY
 OF THE COMMON FOLK IN FRANCE.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
"IN PRUNING SEASONS
HE EARNED 18 SOUS A DAY,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
"THEN HE HIRED OUT
AS A HAY-MAKER,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
"AS LABORER, AS NEAT-HERD
ON A FARM, AS A DRUDGE.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
"HE DID WHATEVER HE COULD.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
"HIS SISTER WORKED ALSO,
BUT WHAT COULD SHE DO

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
"WITH SEVEN LITTLE CHILDREN?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
"IT WAS A SAD GROUP
ENVELOPED IN MISERY,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
"WHICH WAS BEING
GRADUALLY ANNIHILATED.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
"A VERY HARD WINTER CAME.
JEAN HAD NO WORK.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
"THE FAMILY HAD NO BREAD.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
"NO BREAD LITERALLY.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
"SEVEN CHILDREN!"

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
HIS 20 YEARS IN EXILE
 WOULD PROVE TO BE

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
VICTOR HUGO'S
 MOST FRUITFUL PERIOD.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
HE SAID, "MY PROSCRIPTION
 IS GOOD AND I THANK FATE."

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
"GO TO THE WOODS!
GO TO THE BEACH!

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
"COMPOSE YOUR CANTOS INSPIRED
BY THE SONG OF THE FOLIAGE

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
"AND THE HYMN
OF THE AZURE WAVES!

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
"GOD AWAITS YOU IN SOLITUDES;

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
"GOD IS NOT IN THE MULTITUDES;

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
"MAN IS PETTY,
UNGRATEFUL AND VAIN.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
"IN THE FIELDS EVERYTHING
VIBRATES AND SIGHS.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
"NATURE IS THE GREAT LYRE,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
"THE POET IS THE DIVINE BOW."

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
AFTER A PERIOD OF UPHEAVAL,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
NAPOLEON III'S
 EMPIRE COLLAPSED,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
AND ON SEPTEMBER 4TH, 1870,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
THE THIRD REPUBLIC
 WAS PROCLAIMED.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
THE NEXT DAY, VICTOR HUGO
 BEGAN HIS JOURNEY HOME.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
HAVING BEEN SECLUDED
 IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
IN SIGHT OF, BUT OUT OF TOUCH
 WITH HIS COUNTRY,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
HE WAS UNAWARE OF HOW IMMENSELY
 POPULAR HE HAD BECOME.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
YET AS HE TRAVELED BACK HOME,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
CHEERING THRONGS AWAITED HIM
 AT EACH TRAIN STATION.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
WHEN HE REACHED PARIS, HE WAS
 GRANTED A HERO'S WELCOME.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
HE IS THE TOAST OF THE TOWN,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
ATTENDED ON BY
 THE MOST PROMINENT FIGURES

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
IN POLITICS, LITERATURE,
 AND THE ARTS.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
HIS VERSES
 WERE RECITED EVERYWHERE.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
DESPITE HIS TRIUMPHANT RETURN,
 HUGO DECLARED THIS

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
THE "ANNéE TERRIBLE,"
 THE HORRIBLE YEAR.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
FRANCE SUFFERED
 A HUMILIATING DEFEAT

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
AT THE HANDS
 OF THE PRUSSIAN ARMY,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
AND PARISIANS ENDURED
 A CRUEL SIEGE.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
IN THE WAKE OF THE SIEGE,
 PARIS EXPLODED IN VIOLENCE

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
AS REVOLUTIONARIES PROCLAIMED
 THE BIRTH OF THE PARIS COMMUNE.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
HUGO SHARED THEIR IDEAS
 BUT CONDEMNED THEIR TACTICS.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
THIS COMPLICATED DYNAMIC
 INSPIRED

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
THE POEMS OF
 "THE TERRIBLE YEAR."

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
ON MARCH 13TH, 1871,
 HUGO'S SON CHARLES DIED.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
HUGO TRAVELED
 TO BRUSSELS TO TAKE CHARGE

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
OF HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW
 AND TWO GRANDCHILDREN.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
FROM BELGIUM, HE OFFERED ASYLUM
 TO SUPPORTERS OF THE COMMUNE.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
KING LEOPOLD II OF BELGIUM
 DID NOT WANT TO STIR UP

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
BAD FEELINGS WITH
 THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
AND SIGNED A DECREE EXPELLING
 HUGO FROM THE COUNTRY.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
THE FOLLOWING MORNING, VICTOR
 HUGO LEFT BELGIUM FOREVER.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
IN FRANCE THE VIOLENCE
 CONTINUED UNABATED.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
HUGO WAS ALMOST 70 YEARS-OLD,
 AND HE WAS TIRED.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
AFTER A BRIEF STAY IN PARIS,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
HE RETURNED TO HIS HOME IN
 EXILE, ON THE ISLE OF GUERNSEY.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
GRADUALLY, HE WITHDREW
 FROM POLITICS.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
HE CONTINUED WRITING, BUT
 THE PACE WAS NEVER THE SAME.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
TRAGEDY FOLLOWED HIM
 RELENTLESSLY.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
IN 1872, HIS DAUGHTER ADéLE

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
WAS COMMITTED
 TO A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
IN 1873, HIS SON
 FRANCOIS-VICTOR DIED.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
DEVASTATED,
 HUGO CAST ABOUT FOR A WAY

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
TO RECOVER
 HIS FIGHTING SPIRIT.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
HE DECIDED TO RETURN TO PARIS,
 AND TO POLITICS.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
IN 1876, HE WAS ELECTED
 SENATOR FOR PARIS.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
HE CONSISTENTLY VOTED
 WITH THE LEFT-WING,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
CONTINUING HIS FIGHT
 AGAINST INJUSTICE,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
INEQUITY,
 AND THE DEATH PENALTY.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
HUGO BECOMES THE NATION'S
 MORAL TOUCHSTONE.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
HE GAVE HOPE
 TO A GENERATION THAT WITNESSED

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
TREMENDOUS UPHEAVAL
 AND UNSPEAKABLE VIOLENCE,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
AND HE IS RESPECTED
 THROUGHOUT THE NATION.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
FRANCE TURNED VICTOR HUGO

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
INTO A LIVING SYMBOL
 OF THE REPUBLIC.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
ON MAY 11TH, 1883,
 HIS LIFELONG LOVER,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
JULIETTE DROUET, DIED.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
HUGO OUTLIVED HER
 FOR ONLY TWO YEARS.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
AS PER HIS REQUEST, HE WAS
 LAID OUT IN A PAUPER'S COFFIN.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
THE COFFIN WAS PLACED
 UNDER THE ARC DE TRIOMPHE

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
AND THEN TRANSPORTED
 TO THE PANTHEON,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
WHERE HIS EPITAPH READS:

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
"TO THE GREAT MEN,
 THE MOTHERLAND IS GRATEFUL."

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
TWO MILLION PEOPLE
 ATTENDED HIS FUNERAL.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
A POEM THAT HUGO HAD
 WRITTEN FOR HIS DAUGHTER

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
CAPTURED
 THE FEELINGS OF MANY...

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
"AT DAWN TOMORROW,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
"AS THE COUNTRYSIDE
GROWS BRIGHT I SHALL LEAVE.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
"YOU SEE, I KNOW
THAT YOU AWAIT ME.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
"I'LL CROSS THE FOREST, AND I'LL
SCALE THE MOUNTAIN'S HEIGHT.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
"I CANNOT STAND TO BE
APART FROM YOU LATELY.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
"I'LL WALK ALONG, MY EYES
INTENT UPON MY THOUGHTS,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
"NOT HEARING ANY SOUND,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
"NOR SEEING ANY SIGHT;

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
"ALONE, UNKNOWN,
MY BACK IS BENT,
