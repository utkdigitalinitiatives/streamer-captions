00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:15.570


2
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.400
Old John of Gaunt,

3
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.100
time-honored Lancaster,

4
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.070
hast thou, according to thy oath and band,

5
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.670
brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,

6
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.130
here to make good the boisterous late appeal,

7
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.970
which then our leisure would not let us hear,

8
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.700
against the duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

9
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.870
I have, my liege.

10
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.000
Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him

11
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.570
if he appeal the duke on ancient malice,

12
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.100
or worthily, as a good subject should,

13
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.030
on some known ground of treachery in him?

14
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.870
As near as I could sift him on that argument,

15
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.870
on some apparent danger seen in him aimed at Your Highness.

16
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.500
No inveterate malice.

17
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.300
Then call them to our presence.

18
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.100
Face to face and frowning brow to brow,

19
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.070
ourselves will hear the accuser and the accused freely speak.

20
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.670
High-stomached are they both and full of ire,

21
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.770
in rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.

22
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.900
Many years of happy days befall my gracious sovereign,

23
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.300
my most loving liege.

24
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.400
Each day still better other's happiness

25
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.470
until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,

26
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.570
add an immortal title to your crown.

27
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.400
We thank you both.

28
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.830
Yet one but flatters us, as well appeareth by the cause you come,

29
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.570
namely to appeal each other of high treason.

30
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.300
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object

31
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.400
against the duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?

32
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.200
First, heaven be the record to my speech.

33
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.770
In the devotion of a subject's love,

34
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.200
tendering the precious safety of my prince

35
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.470
and free from other misbegotten hate,

36
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.230
come I appellant to this princely presence.

37
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.630
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,

38
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.170
and mark my greeting well,

39
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.070
for what I speak my body shall make good upon this earth

40
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.730
or my divine soul answer it in heaven.

41
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.830
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,

42
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.130
too good to be so and too bad to live,

43
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.470
since the more fair and crystal is the sky,

44
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.030
the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.

45
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.170
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,

46
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.170
with a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat

47
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.970
and wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,

48
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.370
what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.

49
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.730
Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.

50
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.530
'Tis not the trial of a woman's war.

51
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.130
The bitter clamor of two eager tongues

52
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.430
can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain.

53
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.230
The blood is hot that must be cooled for this,

54
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.070
yet can I not of such tame patience boast

55
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.000
as to be hushed and naught at all to say.

56
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.670
First, the fair reverence of Your Highness curbs me

57
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.070
from giving reins and spurs to my free speech,

58
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.970
which else would post until it had returned

59
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.430
these terms of treason doubled down his throat.

60
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.430
Setting aside his high blood's royalty

61
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.970
and let him be no kinsman to my liege,

62
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.130
I do defy him, and I spit at him,

63
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.730
call him a slanderous coward and a villain,

64
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.470
which to maintain I would allow him odds and meet him

65
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.200
were I tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the Alps

66
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.970
or any other ground inhabitable,

67
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.830
wherever Englishman durst set his foot.

68
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.730
Meantime let this defend my loyalty.

69
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.770
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.

70
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.770
Pale, trembling coward,

71
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.130
there I throw my gage,

72
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.000
disclaiming here the kindred of the king,

73
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.600
and lay aside my high blood's royalty,

74
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.570
which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.

75
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.730
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength

76
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.530
as to take up mine honor's pawn,

77
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.170
then stoop.

78
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.870
By that and all the rites of knighthood else

79
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.400
will I make good against thee,

80
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.230
arm to arm, what I have spoke,

81
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.470
or thou canst worse devise.

82
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.100
I take it up, and by that sword

83
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.500
I swear which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,

84
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.600
I'll answer thee in any fair degree

85
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.230
or chivalrous design of knightly trial.

86
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.570
And when I mount, alive may I not light

87
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.230
if I be traitor or unjustly fight.

88
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.930
What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?

89
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.700
It must be great that can inherit us so much

90
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.330
as of a thought of ill in him.

91
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.330
Look what I speak.

92
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.830
My life shall prove it true

93
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.870
that Mowbray hath received 8,000 nobles

94
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.870
in name of lendings for Your Highness' soldiers,

95
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.670
the which he hath detained for lewd employments

96
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.100
like a false traitor and injurious villain.

97
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.230
Besides I say and will in battle prove or here or elsewhere

98
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.970
to the furthest verge that ever was surveyed by English eye,

99
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.000
that all the treasons for these 18 years

100
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.300
complotted and contrived in this land

101
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.600
fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.

102
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.930
Further I say and further will maintain

103
00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.070
upon his bad life to make all this good,

104
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.530
that he did plot the duke of Gloucester's death,

105
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.530
suggest his soon-believing adversaries,

106
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.800
and consequently, like a traitor coward,

107
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.170
sluiced out his innocent soul with streams of blood,

108
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.330
which blood, like sacrificing Abel's,

109
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.100
cries even from the tongueless caverns of the earth

110
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.900
to me for justice and rough chastisement.

111
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.400
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,

112
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.670
this arm shall do it or this life be spent.

113
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.470
How high a pitch his resolution soars.

114
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.330
Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?

115
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.000
Oh, let my sovereign turn away his face

116
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.970
and let his ears a little while be deaf

117
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.170
till I have told this slander of his blood

118
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.970
how God and good men hate so foul a liar.

119
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:26.000
Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears

120
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.430
were he my brother-- nay, my kingdom's heir.

121
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.630
As he is but my father's brother's son,

122
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.030
now, by my scepter's awe, I make a vow.

123
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.570
Such neighbor nearness to our sacred blood

124
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.070
should nothing privilege him

125
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.100
nor partialize the unstooping firmness of my upright soul.

126
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.570
He is our subject, Mowbray.

127
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.070
So art thou.

128
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.070
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.

129
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.130
Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,

130
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.300
through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.

131
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.770
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais

132
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.570
disbursed I duly to His Highness' soldiers.

133
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.500
The other part reserved I by consent,

134
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.830
for that my sovereign liege

135
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.170
was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account,

136
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.800
since last I went to France to fetch his queen.

137
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.700
Now swallow down that lie.

138
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.270
For Gloucester's death, I slew him not,

139
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.800
but to my own disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case.

140
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.800
For you, my noble lord of Lancaster,

141
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.300
the honorable father to my foe,

142
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.070
once did I lay an ambush for your life,

143
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.230
a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul.

144
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.030
But ere I last received the sacrament, I did confess it

145
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.770
and exactly begged Your Grace's pardon,

146
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.570
and I hope I had it.

147
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:56.370
This is my fault.

148
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.700
As for the rest appealed,

149
00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.830
it issues from the rancor of a villain,

150
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.270
a recreant and most degenerate traitor,

151
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.070
which in myself I boldly will defend

152
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.930
and interchangeably hurl down my gage

153
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.870
upon this overweening traitor's foot

154
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.770
to prove myself a loyal gentleman

155
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.870
even in the best blood chambered in his bosom.

156
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.330
In haste whereof,

157
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.900
most heartily I pray Your Highness

158
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.500
to assign our trial day.

159
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.470
Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me.

160
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.870
Let's purge this choler without letting blood.

161
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.070
This we prescribe, though no physician.

162
00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.170
Deep malice makes too deep incision.

163
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.870
Forget, forgive, conclude, and be agreed.

164
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.530
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.

165
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.300
Good Uncle, let this end where it begun.

166
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.400
We'll calm the duke of Norfolk, you your son.

167
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.070
To be a make-peace shall become my age.

168
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.430
Throw down, my son, the duke of Norfolk's gage.

169
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:50.730
And, Norfolk, throw down his.

170
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.470
When, Harry, when?

171
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.400
Obedience bids I should not bid again.

172
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.830
Norfolk, throw down, we bid.

173
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.370
There is no boot.

174
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.300
Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.

175
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:04.200
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame.

176
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.570
The one my duty owes,

177
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.630
but my fair name,

178
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.730
despite of death that lives upon my grave,

179
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.600
to dark dishonor's use thou shalt not have.

180
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.070
I am disgraced, impeached, and baffled here,

181
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.570
pierced to the soul with slander's venomed spear,

182
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.070
the which no balm can cure

183
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.730
but his heart blood which breathed this poison.

184
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.070
Rage must be withstood.

185
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.270
Give me his gage.

186
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.170
Lions make leopards tame.

187
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.200
Yea, but not change his spots.

188
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.470
Take but my shame and I resign my gage.

189
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:39.870
My dear, dear lord,

190
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.530
the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation.

191
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:51.030
That away, men are but gilded loam or painted clay.

192
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.630
A jewel in a ten-times barred up chest

193
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:56.470
is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.

194
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.730
Mine honor is my life.

195
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.900
Both grow in one.

196
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.500
Take honor from me, and my life is done.

197
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.870
Then, dear my liege, mine honor let me try.

198
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:10.170
In that I live, and for that will I die.

199
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:13.770
Cousin, throw up your gage.

200
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.430
Do you begin.

201
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.730
Oh, God, defend my soul from such deep sin.

202
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.200
Shall I seem crestfallen in my father's sight?

203
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.400
Or with pale beggar fear impeach my height

204
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.000
before this outdared dastard?

205
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.800
Ere my tongue shall wound my honor with such feeble wrong

206
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.030
or sound so base a parle,

207
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.930
my teeth shall tear the slavish motive of recanting fear

208
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:46.400
and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,

209
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.270
where shame doth harbor, even in Mowbray's face.

210
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.470
We were not born to sue but to command.

211
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.400
Since which we cannot do to make you friends,

212
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.000
be ready, as your lives shall answer it,

213
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.770
at Coventry upon Saint Lambert's day.

214
00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.030
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate

215
00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.470
the swelling difference of your settled hate.

216
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.600
Since we can not atone you,

217
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.130
we shall see justice design the victor's chivalry.

218
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:19.400
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms.

219
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.430
Be ready to direct these home alarms.

220
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.170
Alas, the part I had in Gloucester's blood

221
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.200
doth more solicit me than your exclaims

222
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.670
to stir against the butchers of his life.

223
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.300
But since correction lieth

224
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.970
in those hands which made the fault which we cannot correct,

225
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.470
put we our quarrel to the will of heaven,

226
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.900
who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,

227
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.900
will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.

228
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.930
Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?

229
00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.730
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?

230
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.300
Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,

231
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.030
were as seven vials of his sacred blood

232
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.000
or seven fair branches springing from one root.

233
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.600
Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,

234
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.170
some of those branches by the destinies cut.

235
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.800
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,

236
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.570
one vial full of Edward's sacred blood,

237
00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.270
one flourishing branch of his most royal root,

238
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.800
is cracked,

239
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:26.030
and all the precious liquor spilt is hacked down

240
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:29.000
and his summer leaves all faded

241
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.530
by envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.

242
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.900
Ah, Gaunt,

243
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.800
his blood was thine.

244
00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.100
That bed, that womb, that metal, that self-mold

245
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.270
that fashioned thee made him a man.

246
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.530
And though thou livest and breathest,

247
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.100
yet art thou slain in him.

248
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.670
Thou dost consent in some large measure to thy father's death

249
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:56.170
in that thou seest thy wretched brother die,

250
00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.270
who was the model of thy father's life.

251
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.230
Call it not patience, Gaunt.

252
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.270
It is despair.

253
00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.470
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughtered,

254
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.970
thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,

255
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.570
teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.

256
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.800
That which in mean men we entitle patience

257
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.670
is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.

258
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.470
What shall I say?

259
00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.630
To safeguard thine own life,

260
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.500
the best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.

261
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.130
God's is the quarrel,

262
00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.830
for God's substitute, his deputy anointed in His sight,

263
00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.200
hath caused his death,

264
00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.270
the which if wrongfully, let heaven revenge,

265
00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.270
for I may never lift an angry arm against His minister.

266
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.630
Where then, alas, may I complain myself?

267
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.370
To God, the widow's champion and defense.

268
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.600
Why, then, I will.

269
00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.030
Farewell, old Gaunt.

270
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.370
Thou goest to Coventry,

271
00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.070
there to behold our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.

272
00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.500
Oh, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear

273
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.030
that they may enter butcher Mowbray's breast.

274
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.070
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,

275
00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.230
be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom

276
00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:15.800
that they may break his foaming courser's back

277
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.600
and throw the rider headlong in the lists,

278
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.300
a caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford.

279
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:26.670
Farewell, old Gaunt.

280
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.470
Thy sometimes brother's wife

281
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.530
with her companion grief must end her life.

282
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:34.870
Sister, farewell.

283
00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.800
I must to Coventry.

284
00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.830
As much good stay with thee as go with me.

285
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.530
Yet one word more.

286
00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.200
Grief boundeth where it falls

287
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.430
not with the empty hollowness but weight.

288
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.270
I take my leave before I have begun,

289
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.500
for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.

290
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.370
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.

291
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:06.530
Lo, this is all.

292
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.730
Nay, yet depart not so.

293
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.770
Though this be all, do not so quickly go.

294
00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:14.870
I shall remember more.

295
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:15.970
Bid him--

296
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.700
ah, what?

297
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.470
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.

298
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:30.000
Alack, and what shall good old York there see

299
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:33.630
but empty lodgings and unfurnished walls,

300
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.670
unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?

301
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:40.730
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?

302
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.900
Therefore commend me.

303
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:47.970
Let him not come there

304
00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.830
to seek out sorrow that dwells everywhere.

305
00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:01.100
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die.

306
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.330
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

307
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.600
My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford armed?

308
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.670
Yea, at all points and longs to enter in.

309
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.830
The duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,

310
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.530
stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.

311
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.700
Why, then, the champions are prepared

312
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.970
and stay for nothing but His Majesty's approach.

313
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.770
Marshal, demand of yonder champion

314
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.930
the cause of his arrival here in arms.

315
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.500
Ask him his name

316
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.070
and orderly proceed to swear him in the justice of his cause.

317
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.770
In God's name and the king's,

318
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.030
say who thou art

319
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.070
and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,

320
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.670
against what man thou comest,

321
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.100
and what thy quarrel.

322
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.230
Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath,

323
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.800
and so defend thee heaven and thy valor.

324
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.670
My name is Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk,

325
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:20.030
who hither come engaged by my oath--

326
00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:22.530
which God defend a knight should violate--

327
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:24.530
both to defend my loyalty and truth

328
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.470
to God, my king, and my succeeding issue

329
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.170
against the duke of Hereford that appeals me,

330
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:33.030
and, by the grace of God and this mine arm, to prove him,

331
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.170
in defending of myself,

332
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.930
a traitor to my God, my king, and me.

333
00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:40.530
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven.

334
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.530
Marshal, demand of yonder knight in arms both who he is

335
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.930
and why he cometh hither thus plated in habiliments of war,

336
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.200
and formally, according to our law,

337
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.670
depose him in the justice of his cause.

338
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.770
What is thy name, and wherefore comest thou hither

339
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.270
before King Richard in his royal lists?

340
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.370
Against whom comest thou, and what's thy quarrel?

341
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.830
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven.

342
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:14.600
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby am I,

343
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.530
who ready here do stand in arms

344
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.670
to prove, by God's grace and my body's valor,

345
00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.400
in lists on Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk,

346
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.630
that he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,

347
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.930
to God of heaven, King Richard, and to me.

348
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.300
And as I fight, defend me heaven.

349
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.700
On pain of death,

350
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.470
no person be so bold or daring-hardy

351
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.230
as to touch the lists

352
00:19:43.230 --> 00:19:46.230
except the marshal and such officers appointed

353
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:48.930
to direct these fair designs.

354
00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.230
Lord marshal,

355
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.400
let me kiss my sovereign's hand

356
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.800
and bow my knee before His Majesty,

357
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.170
for Mowbray and myself

358
00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.830
are like two men that vow a long and weary pilgrimage.

359
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.630
Then let us take a ceremonious leave

360
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.870
and loving farewell of our several friends.

361
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.700
The appellant in all duty greets Your Highness

362
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.230
and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.

363
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.370
We will descend and fold him in our arms.

364
00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.130
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,

365
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.670
so be thy fortune in this royal fight.

366
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.970
Farewell, my blood, which if today thou shed,

367
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.670
lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.

368
00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:42.000
Oh, let no noble eye profane a tear for me

369
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.700
if I be gored with Mowbray's spear.

370
00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.630
As confident as is the falcon's flight against a bird

371
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:49.100
do I with Mowbray fight.

372
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.470
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;

373
00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.400
of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle.

374
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.470
Not sick, although I have to do with death,

375
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.570
but lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.

376
00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.230
Lo, as at English feasts,

377
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:15.670
so I regreet the daintiest last to make the end most sweet.

378
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.500
Oh, thou, the earthly author of my blood,

379
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.170
whose youthful spirit in me regenerate,

380
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.900
doth with a twofold vigor lift me up

381
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.930
to reach at victory above my head.

382
00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.530
Add proof unto mine armor with thy prayers,

383
00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.770
and with thy blessings steel my lance's point

384
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:36.230
that it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat

385
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.000
and furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,

386
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.230
even in the lusty havior of his son.

387
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.200
God in thy good cause make thee prosperous.

388
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.270
Be swift like lightning in the execution

389
00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.500
and let thy blows, doubly redoubled,

390
00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.330
fall like amazing thunder

391
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.470
on the casque of thy adverse pernicious enemy.

392
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.530
Rouse up thy youthful blood.

393
00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.800
Be valiant, and live.

394
00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.400
Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive.

395
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.700
However God or fortune cast my lot, there lives or dies,

396
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.300
true to King Richard's throne,

397
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.670
a loyal, just, and upright gentleman.

398
00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.770
Never did captive with a freer heart

399
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.270
cast off his chains of bondage

400
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.630
and embrace his golden uncontrolled enfranchisement

401
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.470
more than my dancing soul doth celebrate

402
00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.300
this feast of battle with mine adversary.

403
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:29.570
Most mighty liege and my companion peers,

404
00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:32.130
take from my mouth the wish of happy years.

405
00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.970
As gentle and as jocund as to jest go I to fight.

406
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.470
Truth hath a quiet breast.

407
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.230
Farewell, my lord.

408
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.930
Securely I espy virtue with valor couched in thine eye.

409
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.600
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.

410
00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.900
Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,

411
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.170
receive thy lance and God defend the right.

412
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.030
Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.

413
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:10.600
Go bear this lance to Thomas, duke of Norfolk.

414
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:19.400
Herald Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby

415
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:24.030
stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,

416
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.030
on pain to be found false and recreant,

417
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.330
to prove the duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray

418
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.870
a traitor to his God, his king, and him,

419
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.870
and dares him to set forward to the fight.

420
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.470
Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, duke of Norfolk,

421
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.000
on pain to be found false and recreant,

422
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.270
both to defend himself

423
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.930
and to approve Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby

424
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.370
to God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal,

425
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.400
courageously and with a free desire,

426
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.730
attending but the signal to begin.

427
00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:03.630
Sound trumpets and set forward, combatants.

428
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.670
Stay!

429
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.600
The king hath thrown his warder down.

430
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.370
Let them lay by their helmets and their spears

431
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:19.400
and both return back to their chairs again.

432
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.470
Withdraw with us.

433
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.900
And let the trumpets sound

434
00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.070
while we return these dukes what we decree.

435
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.470
Draw near

436
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.300
and list what with our council we have done.

437
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:37.530
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soiled

438
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.000
with that dear blood which it hath fostered,

439
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.970
and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect

440
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.200
of civil wounds ploughed up with neighbors' sword,

441
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.300
and for we think the eagle winged pride

442
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.130
of sky aspiring and ambitious thoughts,

443
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.300
with rival hating envy, set on you to wake our peace--

444
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.630
which in our country's cradle

445
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.270
draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep--

446
00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:02.000
which so roused up with boisterous, untuned drums,

447
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.730
with harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray

448
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.370
and grating shock of wrathful iron arms,

449
00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.870
might from our quiet confines fright fair peace

450
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:14.770
and make us wade even in our kindred's blood.

451
00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.000
Therefore, we banish you our territories.

452
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.430
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,

453
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.970
till twice five summers have enriched our fields

454
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.930
shall not regreet our fair dominions

455
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.300
but tread the stranger paths of banishment.

456
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.130
Thy will be done.

457
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.330
This must my comfort be:

458
00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.400
that sun that warms you here shall shine on me,

459
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.530
and those his golden beams to you here lent

460
00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.430
shall point on me and gild my banishment.

461
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.770
Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,

462
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.500
which I with some unwillingness pronounce.

463
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.730
The sly, slow hours shall not determinate

464
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.430
the dateless limit of thy dear exile.

465
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.370
The hopeless word of "never to return"

466
00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.730
breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.

467
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.300
A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,

468
00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:16.230
and all unlooked for from Your Highness' mouth.

469
00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:17.570
A dearer merit,

470
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:20.570
not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air,

471
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.800
have I deserved at Your Highness' hands.

472
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.970
The language I have learned these 40 years,

473
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.730
my native English, now I must forego.

474
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.800
And now my tongue's use

475
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.370
is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp

476
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.400
or like a cunning instrument cased up or, being open,

477
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.730
put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony.

478
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.530
Within my mouth you have enjailed my tongue,

479
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.730
doubly portcullised with my teeth and lips,

480
00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.870
and dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance

481
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.900
is made my jailer to attend on me.

482
00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.200
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,

483
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.070
too far in years to be a pupil now.

484
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:58.230
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,

485
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.970
which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?

486
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.270
It boots thee not to be compassionate.

487
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.500
After our sentence, plaining comes too late.

488
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.570
Then thus I turn me from my country's light

489
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:15.500
to dwell in solemn shades of endless night.

490
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.300
Return again,

491
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.800
and take an oath with thee.

492
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:22.700
Lay on our royal sword your banished hands.

493
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.830
Swear by the duty that you owe to God--

494
00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.000
our part therein we banish with yourselves--

495
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.270
to keep the oath that we administer.

496
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.830
You never shall, so help you truth and God,

497
00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:37.130
embrace each other's love in banishment;

498
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.600
nor never look upon each other's face;

499
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.030
nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile

500
00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.300
this louring tempest of your homebred hate;

501
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.830
nor never by advised purpose meet

502
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:52.170
to plot, contrive, or complot any ill

503
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:56.770
against us, our state, our subjects, or our land.

504
00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:57.970
I swear.

505
00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.830
And I, to keep all this.

506
00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.730
Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy,

507
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:09.570
by this time, had the king permitted us,

508
00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.100
one of our souls had wandered in the air,

509
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.830
banished this frail sepulcher of our flesh,

510
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.230
as now our flesh is banished from this land.

511
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:21.530
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm.

512
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.330
Since thou hast far to go,

513
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.500
bear not along the clogging burthen of a guilty soul.

514
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:28.530
No, Bolingbroke.

515
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.630
If ever I were traitor,

516
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.470
my name be blotted from the book of life,

517
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.270
and I from heaven banished as from hence.

518
00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:39.430
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know.

519
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:43.300
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.

520
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.130
Farewell, my liege.

521
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.930
Now no way can I stray.

522
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.830
Save back to England, all the world's my way.

523
00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.930
Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes

524
00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:04.070
I see thy grieved heart.

525
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:07.300
Thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banished years

526
00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.830
plucked four away.

527
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:11.230
Six frozen winter spent,

528
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:14.800
return with welcome home from banishment.

529
00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.200
How long a time lies in one little word.

530
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.570
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word.

531
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.900
Such is the breath of kings.

532
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.730
I thank my liege that, in regard of me,

533
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.500
he shortens four years of my son's exile.

534
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.230
But little vantage will I gain thereby,

535
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.930
for, ere the six years that he has to spend

536
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.330
shall change their moons and bring their times about,

537
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:44.130
my oil dried lamp and time bewasted light

538
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:48.500
shall be extinct with age and endless nights.

539
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.130
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,

540
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.830
and blindfold death not let me see my son.

541
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.570
Why, Uncle, thou hast many years to live.

542
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.370
But not a minute, King, that thou canst give.

543
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:05.170
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow

544
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.070
and pluck nights from me,

545
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.400
but not lend a morrow.

546
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.030
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,

547
00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.200
but stop no wrinkle of his pilgrimage.

548
00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.730
Thy word is current with him for my deaths.

549
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.530
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.

550
00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:23.630
Thy son is banished upon good advice,

551
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.370
whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave.

552
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.870
Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?

553
00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:33.330
Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.

554
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.870
You urged me as a judge,

555
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:39.530
but I had rather that you had bid me argue like a father.

556
00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:43.000
Oh, had it been a stranger, not my child,

557
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.570
to smooth his fault I would have been more mild.

558
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.570
Alas, I looked when some of you should say,

559
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.170
I was too strict to make mine own away.

560
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.930
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue

561
00:30:55.930 --> 00:31:00.200
against my will to do myself this wrong.

562
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.400
Cousin, farewell.

563
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.300
And, Uncle, bid him so.

564
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.430
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.

565
00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.030
Cousin, farewell.

566
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.800
What presence must not know,

567
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:18.600
from where you do remain let paper show.

568
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.100
My lord, no leave take I,

569
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.030
for I will ride, as far as land will let me, by your side.

570
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.970
Oh, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words

571
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.800
that thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?

572
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.530
I have too few to take my leave of you,

573
00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.330
when the tongue's office should be prodigal

574
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.200
to breathe the abundant dolor of the heart.

575
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.570
Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.

576
00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:41.930
Joy absent.

577
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:43.570
Grief is present for that time.

578
00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.730
What are six winters?

579
00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.030
They are quickly gone.

580
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.430
To men in joy.

581
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.470
But grief makes one hour ten.

582
00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.800
Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.

583
00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.430
My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,

584
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:56.800
which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.

585
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.770
The sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil

586
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.500
wherein thou art to set

587
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.500
the precious jewel of thy home return.

588
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.770
Nay.

589
00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:10.300
Rather, every tedious stride I make will but remember me

590
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.900
what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love.

591
00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.330
Must I not serve

592
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:20.170
a long apprenticehood to foreign passages,

593
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:22.430
and in the end, having my freedom,

594
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:26.400
boast of nothing else but that I was a journeyman to grief?

595
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.300
All places that the eye of heaven visits

596
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:32.500
are to a wise man ports and happy havens.

597
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:35.200
Teach thy necessity to reason thus.

598
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.530
There is no virtue like necessity.

599
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:42.170
Think not the king did banish thee, but thou the king.

600
00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:43.500
Woe doth the heavier sit

601
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.730
when it perceives it is but faintly borne.

602
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.300
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honor

603
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.670
and not that the king exiled thee.

604
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:55.900
Or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air,

605
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.870
and thou art flying to a fresher clime.

606
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.670
Look what thy soul holds dear.

607
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:07.200
Imagine it to lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest.

608
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.170
Suppose the singing birds musicians,

609
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.530
the grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strewn,

610
00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.770
the flowers fair ladies,

611
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:20.970
and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance.

612
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.430
For gnarling sorrow hath less power

613
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:27.900
to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light.

614
00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.730
Oh, who can hold a fire in his hand

615
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.800
by thinking on the frosty Caucasus?

616
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.830
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite

617
00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.530
by bare imagination of a feast?

618
00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.000
Or wallow naked in December snow

619
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.230
by thinking on fantastic summer's heat?

620
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.800
Oh, no.

621
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.630
The apprehension of the good

622
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.800
gives but the greater feeling to the worse.

623
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:53.630
Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more

624
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:56.430
than when he bites but lanceth not the sore.

625
00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:57.930
Come, come, my son.

626
00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.730
I'll bring thee on thy way.

627
00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:03.670
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.

628
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.630
Then, England's ground, farewell.

629
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.300
Sweet soil, adieu,

630
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.830
my mother and my nurse that bears me yet.

631
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.870
Where'er I wander, boast of this I can:

632
00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.970
though banished, yet a trueborn Englishman.

633
00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:43.700
We did observe.

634
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.830
Cousin Aumerle, how far brought you high Hereford on his way?

635
00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.130
I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,

636
00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.800
but to the next highway,

637
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.870
and there I left him.

638
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:53.830
And say, what store of parting tears were shed?

639
00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:55.670
Faith, none for me,

640
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.030
except the northeast wind,

641
00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.570
which then blew bitterly against our faces,

642
00:34:58.570 --> 00:34:59.800
awaked the sleeping rheum,

643
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.230
and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear.

644
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:05.630
What said our cousin when you parted from him?

645
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.600
"Farewell."

646
00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:09.830
And, for my heart disdained

647
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.800
that my tongue should so profane the word,

648
00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.370
that taught me craft

649
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:14.800
to counterfeit oppression of such grief

650
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.630
that words seemed buried in my sorrow's grave.

651
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.030
Marry, would the word "farewell"

652
00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.000
have lengthened hours and added years to his short banishment,

653
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.830
he should have had a volume of farewells.

654
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:29.470
But since it would not, he had none of me.

655
00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.400
He is our cousin, cousin.

656
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.300
But 'tis doubt, when time shall call him home from banishment,

657
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.000
whether our kinsman come to see his friends.

658
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.570
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green

659
00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:44.170
observed his courtship to the common people,

660
00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.470
how he did seem to dive into their hearts

661
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.000
with humble and familiar courtesy.

662
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.670
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,

663
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:55.730
wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles

664
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.170
and patient underbearing of his fortune,

665
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.530
as 'twere to banish their affects with him.

666
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:04.970
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench.

667
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.930
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well

668
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.030
and had the tribute of his supple knee,

669
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:13.230
with "Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends,"

670
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:16.300
as were our England in reversion his,

671
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.730
and he our subjects' next degree in hope.

672
00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:26.600
Well, he's gone, and with him go these thoughts.

673
00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.270
Now, for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,

674
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.530
expedient manage must be made, my liege,

675
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.500
ere further leisure yield them further means

676
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.970
for their advantage and Your Highness' loss.

677
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:41.030
We will ourself in person to this war.

678
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.600
And, for our coffers,

679
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:46.730
with too great a court and liberal largess,

680
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.330
are grown somewhat light.

681
00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:51.200
We are enforced to farm our royal realm.

682
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.400
The revenue whereof shall furnish us

683
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.530
for our affairs in hand.

684
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.200
If that come short,

685
00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.600
our substitutes at home shall have blank charters.

686
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.430
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,

687
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.800
they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold

688
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.330
and send them after to supply our wants,

689
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.370
for we will make for Ireland presently.

690
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.900
Bushy, what news?

691
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.800
Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord, suddenly taken,

692
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.470
and hath sent post haste

693
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.400
to entreat Your Majesty to visit him.

694
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.400
Where lies he?

695
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.730
At Ely House.

696
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:28.530
Now put it, God, in the physician's mind

697
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.270
to help him to his grave immediately.

698
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.800
The lining of his coffers shall make coats

699
00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.830
to deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.

700
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.070
Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him.

701
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:44.900
Pray God, we may make haste

702
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.730
and come too late.

703
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.570
Amen.

704
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:50.800
Will the king come

705
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.600
that I may breathe my last in wholesome counsel

706
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.470
to his unstaid youth?

707
00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:56.500
Vex not yourself

708
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.300
nor strive not with your breath,

709
00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:01.000
for all in vain comes counsel to his ear.

710
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.070
Oh, but they say the tongues of dying men

711
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:06.370
enforce attention like deep harmony.

712
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:10.130
When words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,

713
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:15.230
for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.

714
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.870
He that no more must say is listened more

715
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.470
than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose.

716
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:27.630
More are men's ends marked than their lives before.

717
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:31.270
The setting sun and music at the close,

718
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:35.870
as the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,

719
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:40.770
writ in remembrance more than things long past.

720
00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.830
Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,

721
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.930
my death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.

722
00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:50.500
No, for it is stopped with other flattering sounds,

723
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.330
as praises of whose taste the wise are fond;

724
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.530
lascivious meters, to whose venom sound

725
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.830
the open ear of youth doth always listen.

726
00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:01.200
Reports of fashions in proud Italy,

727
00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.070
whose manners still our tardy, apish nation limps after

728
00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.330
in base imitation.

729
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.970
Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--

730
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.930
so it be new, there's no respect how vile--

731
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.200
that is not quickly buzzed into his ears?

732
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.430
Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,

733
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:17.570
where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.

734
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:20.000
Direct not him whose way himself will choose.

735
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.970
'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.

736
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.400
Methinks I am a prophet new inspired

737
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:29.030
and thus expiring do foretell of him.

738
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.970
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,

739
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:35.600
for violent fires soon burn out themselves.

740
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.030
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short.

741
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:44.270
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes.

742
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:48.000
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder.

743
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.300
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant, consuming means

744
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.100
soon preys upon itself.

745
00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.700
This royal throne of kings;

746
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.130
this sceptered isle;

747
00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:06.370
this earth of majesty;

748
00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.570
this seat of Mars;

749
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:11.570
this other Eden; demi-paradise;

750
00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.630
this fortress built by nature for herself

751
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.130
against infection and the hand of war;

752
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:18.370
this happy breed of men;

753
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:20.300
this little world;

754
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.270
this precious stone set in the silver sea,

755
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.070
which serves it in the office of a wall

756
00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.170
or as a moat defensive to one house

757
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.930
against the envy of less happier lands;

758
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.200
this blessed plot; this earth;

759
00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.430
this realm; this England;

760
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:37.430
this nurse;

761
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:40.730
this teeming womb of royal kings,

762
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.670
feared by their breed and famous by their birth,

763
00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.970
renowned for their deeds as far from home

764
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.600
for Christian service and true chivalry

765
00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.630
as is the sepulcher in stubborn Jewry

766
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.530
of the world's ransom;

767
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:55.000
blessed Mary's Son;

768
00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.530
this land of such dear souls;

769
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.630
this dear, dear land--

770
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.400
dear for her reputation through the world--

771
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:08.470
is now leased out--

772
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:11.300
I die pronouncing it--

773
00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.400
like to a tenement or pelting farm.

774
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.500
England, bound in with the triumphant sea

775
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.400
whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of watery Neptune,

776
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.300
is now bound in with shame,

777
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.670
with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds.

778
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:33.270
That England that was wont to conquer others

779
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:36.730
hath made a shameful conquest of itself.

780
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:45.200
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,

781
00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:51.700
how happy then were my ensuing death.

782
00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:55.570
The king is come.

783
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:57.170
Deal mildly with his youth,

784
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.070
for young, hot colts being raged do rage the more.

785
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.300
How fares our noble Uncle Lancaster?

786
00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.700
What comfort, man?

787
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.700
How is't with aged Gaunt?

788
00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:11.430
Oh, how that name befits my composition.

789
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:15.400
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old.

790
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:18.900
Within me grief has kept a tedious fast.

791
00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.830
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?

792
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.730
For sleeping England long time have I watched.

793
00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:26.600
Watching breeds leanness.

794
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.030
Leanness is all gaunt.

795
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.730
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon is my strict fast.

796
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:35.800
I mean my children's looks.

797
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:40.030
And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt.

798
00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:43.130
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,

799
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:45.830
whose hollow womb inherits naught but bones.

800
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.600
Can sick men play so nicely with their names?

801
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:52.200
No, misery makes sport to mock itself.

802
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.570
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,

803
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:57.670
I mock my name, great King, to flatter thee.

804
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.730
Should dying men flatter with those that live?

805
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.430
No, men living flatter those that die.

806
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.530
Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.

807
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.870
Oh, no, thou diest, though I the sicker be.

808
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:07.430
I am in health.

809
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:09.700
I breathe and see thee ill.

810
00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:12.900
Now He that made me knows I see thee ill,

811
00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:17.200
ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill.

812
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.370
Thy deathbed is no lesser than thy land

813
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.270
wherein thou liest in reputation sick.

814
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.430
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,

815
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:28.370
commit'st thy anointed body

816
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:32.870
to the cure of those physicians that first wounded thee.

817
00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.270
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,

818
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.300
whose compass is no bigger than thy head.

819
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.170
And yet, encaged in so small a verge,

820
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.170
the waste is no whit lesser than thy land.

821
00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:49.400
Oh, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye

822
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:53.530
seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,

823
00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.070
from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,

824
00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.800
deposing thee before thou wert possessed,

825
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.500
which art possessed now to depose thyself.

826
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.600
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,

827
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:11.030
it were a shame to let this land by lease.

828
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:12.930
And for thy world enjoying but this land,

829
00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:17.200
is it not more than shame to shame it so?

830
00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:19.300
Landlord of England art thou now,

831
00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.770
not king.

832
00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:22.870
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law.

833
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:23.870
And thou--

834
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.530
A lunatic, lean-witted fool,

835
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.970
presuming on an ague's privilege,

836
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.570
darest with thy frozen admonition make pale our cheek,

837
00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:34.500
chasing the royal blood with fury

838
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.870
from his native residence.

839
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.330
Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,

840
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.230
wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,

841
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.870
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head

842
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.200
should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.

843
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:51.200
Oh, spare me not, my brother Edward's son.

844
00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:55.730
For that I was his father Edward's son.

845
00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:02.230
That blood already, like the pelican,

846
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:05.670
hast thou tapped out and drunkenly caroused.

847
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.470
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,

848
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.630
whom fair befall in heaven amongst happy souls,

849
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.800
may be a precedent and witness good

850
00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.630
that thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood.

851
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.370
Joined with the present sickness that I have,

852
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:31.770
and thy unkindness be like crooked age

853
00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.030
to crop at once a too long withered flower.

854
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.770
Live in thy shame,

855
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.370
but die not shame with thee.

856
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:47.600
These words hereafter thy tormentors be.

857
00:45:53.630 --> 00:46:00.100
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave.

858
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:10.130
Love they to live that love and honor have.

859
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.670
And let them die that age and sullens have,

860
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:23.830
for both hast thou, and both become the grave.

861
00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.170
I do beseech Your Majesty.

862
00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.270
Impute his words to wayward sickliness and age in him.

863
00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.270
He loves you, on my life,

864
00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.330
and holds you dear as Harry, duke of Hereford,

865
00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:33.330
were he here.

866
00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:34.430
Right, you say true.

867
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.600
As Hereford's love, so his.

868
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.130
As theirs, so mine.

869
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.630
And all be as it is.

870
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:44.530
My liege, old Gaunt commends him to Your Majesty.

871
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:45.630
What says he?

872
00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:47.700
Nay, nothing.

873
00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.830
All is said.

874
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.400
His tongue is now a stringless instrument.

875
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:58.000
Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.

876
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.600
Be York the next that must be bankrupt so.

877
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.700
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.

878
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.870
The ripest fruit first falls,

879
00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.970
and so doth he.

880
00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:15.770
His time is spent.

881
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.830
Our pilgrimage must be.

882
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.270
So much for that.

883
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.000
Now for our Irish wars.

884
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.500
We must supplant those rough, rugheaded kerns,

885
00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:29.000
which live like venom

886
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:31.730
where no venom else but only they have privilege to live.

887
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:34.770
And for these great affairs do ask some charge.

888
00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:37.000
Towards our assistance we do seize to us

889
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.900
the plate, coin, revenues, and moveables

890
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.970
whereof our Uncle Gaunt did stand possessed.

891
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:43.000
How long must I be patient?

892
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.100
Ah, how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?

893
00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:48.870
Not Gloucester's death,

894
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.270
nor Hereford's banishment, not Gaunt's rebukes,

895
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:52.830
nor England's private wrongs,

896
00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.100
nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke about his marriage,

897
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.100
nor my own disgrace,

898
00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:58.100
have ever made me sour my patient cheek

899
00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.670
or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.

900
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.870
I am the last of noble Edward's sons,

901
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:07.730
of whom thy father, prince of Wales, was first.

902
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:10.430
In war was never lion raged more fierce,

903
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:12.630
in peace was never gentle lamb more mild,

904
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:17.030
than was that young and princely gentleman.

905
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.500
His face thou hast,

906
00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:20.500
for even so looked he,

907
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.130
accomplished with the number of thy hours.

908
00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:23.300
But when he frowned,

909
00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.330
it was against the French and not against his friends.

910
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.770
His noble hand did win what he did spend

911
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:28.800
and spent not that

912
00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.800
which his triumphant father's hand had won.

913
00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.000
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,

914
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.300
but bloody with the enemies of his kin.

915
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.830
Oh, Richard.

916
00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:40.730
York is too far gone with grief,

917
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.400
or else he never would compare between.

918
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.470
Why, Uncle, what's the matter?

919
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:46.700
Oh, my liege.

920
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:49.930
Pardon me, if you please.

921
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.370
If not, I, pleased not to be pardoned,

922
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.930
am content withal.

923
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.230
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands

924
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.730
the royalties and rights of banished Hereford?

925
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.970
Is not Gaunt dead,

926
00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:00.530
and doth not Hereford live?

927
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.600
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?

928
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.870
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?

929
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.170
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?

930
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:10.030
Take Hereford's rights away

931
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:14.400
and take from time his charters and his customary rights,

932
00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.200
let not tomorrow then ensue today,

933
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.630
be not thyself.

934
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:21.670
For how art thou a king but by fair sequence and succession?

935
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:25.030
Now, afore God-- God forbid I say true--

936
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.070
if you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,

937
00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.670
call in the letters patent that he hath

938
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.270
by his attorneys general to sue his livery,

939
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:32.770
and deny his offered homage,

940
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:35.200
you pluck a thousand dangers on your head.

941
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.900
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts

942
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.930
and prick my tender patience

943
00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:42.600
to such thoughts as honor and allegiance cannot think.

944
00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.600
Think what you will.

945
00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.030
We seize into our hands

946
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:47.470
his plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.

947
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.970
I'll not be by the while.

948
00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.200
My liege, farewell.

949
00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.330
What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell.

950
00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.470
But by bad courses may be understood

951
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:05.030
that their events can never fall out good.

952
00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:10.800
Go, Bushy, to the earl of Wiltshire straight.

953
00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.830
Bid him repair to us to Ely House to see this business.

954
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.900
Tomorrow next we will for Ireland,

955
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.200
and 'tis time, I trow.

956
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.300
And we create, in absence of ourself,

957
00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:24.170
our Uncle York lord governor of England,

958
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:29.530
for he is just and always loved us well.

959
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.700
Come on, our queen.

960
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:33.100
Tomorrow must we part.

961
00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:35.270
Be merry,

962
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:37.900
for our time of stay is short.

963
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:50.930
