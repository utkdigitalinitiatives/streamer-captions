00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.230
The team had chanced

"PICKFORD: When I found
it, all you could see
was the head like that."

The erosion had removed the
sediment from around it

could see this break here,"

"and see the crack, so I dug
carefully and I found this bit,"

and then there was a third bit,"

unfortunately, was missing--"

"but unfortunately,
it was not there"

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.760
and we dug all this trench to...

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.760
"looking for the rest of
it, but never got it."

"Like the teeth, it appeared
to be uncannily human."

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.830
Might the fossils
be from a hominid--

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.600
an early prehuman ancestor?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.360
"Brigitte was searching
through the rock nearby,"

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.430

breakthrough.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.200
"She found a humerus,
or upper arm bone."

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.560
"I was working here,
and... in the sun."

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.760
"It was lunch time, we were
going back to the camp."

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.160
And sticking out of this area

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.530
"was a little piece
of bone, like that."

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.800
"And I picked it up,"

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.500
and it was obvious to
me from the morphology

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.130
it was piece of a humerus.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.360
And it took me about a week to
stick all the pieces together.

But the real headline was

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.300
that these bones seemed
to be far more ancient

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.760

would embrace a local fable.

christened scientifically

"about the original
inhabitant of this region,"

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.260

"So this name was suggested
to us by the local people,"

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.260
and we thought it was
quite a pleasant name.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.460
"Of course, ""aurore""
in French is ""dawn"","

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.660

fairly appropriate.

is not so good.

official scientific name

or the genus,"

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:09.860

relates to one of the great
puzzles of evolution--

"why do humans
walk on two feet,"

"It is the time-honored

equatorial Africa was
covered with thick forest.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.160
But then tectonic activity
in the earth's crust

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:05.260
caused the land in
the east to rise.

"As the land became higher,"

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.100
"rainfall in the
region was reduced,"

"and the forest
began to die out,"

eventually becoming
open savanna.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.730
The theory goes
that upright walking

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.700
"must have appeared in
response to the open land,"

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.900

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.360
"because it was noontime,
it was 110, 115 degrees,"

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.600
"and I was thinking
about taking a shower,"

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.260
going for a swim in the river.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.060
And as I looked over my shoulder

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.160
"I saw a tiny, little
piece of arm bone"

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.660
that was the first signal

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.860
"that there was something unique
here, something different."

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.100
"And as I kneeled down to
look at it and pick it up,"

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.660
"my graduate student said,"

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.530
"""What makes you think it's
from a human ancestor?"""

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.660
"And I said, ""I think it goes
with those pieces of skull"

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.800
"next to your hand."""

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.460
"And as we looked
up this slope,"

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:37.360
"we could see, glistening
in that noonday sun,"

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.500
"pieces of ribs,
pieces of a pelvis,"

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.400
"parts of an arm,
bits of a leg,"

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.430
"a piece of a jaw, and all
of a sudden it clicked."

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.030
"Here was an associated
specimen, an associated
skeleton,"

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.230
more than three
million years old.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.730
This was going to turn
out to be important.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.530
I think what made
Lucy so special

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.660
was a combination
of her antiquity--

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:06.500
the fact that she was
3.2 million years old--

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.900
that she was roughly
40% complete...

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.630
"The combination of a skeleton
that old, that complete,"

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.630
caught everybody's attention
in anthropological circles.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.430
"I mean, she became
an instant hit."

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.730
SCHREIBER: Lucy's age was
staggering at the time--

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.160
3.2 million years old.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.260
"Time, on such a large scale,
is hard to comprehend,"

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:44.300
but it is possible to put
into a human perspective.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.460
Take a single modern human
and place a parent behind him

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.500
"and then a parent
behind that, and so on."

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.960
"Generation after generation
stretches into the past,"

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:04.360
forming a line of
spectacular proportions.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.860
"The first of our kind,
modern Homo sapiens,"

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.760
"are 100,000 years old,"

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:14.830
and first appear about
three miles down this line.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.930
To find a species
like Homo habilis--

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.500
which lived more than
two million years ago--

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:36.830
requires a 60-mile
journey back in time.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.500
"Traveling even further back
into our ancestral past,"

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.030
there are fewer and
fewer landmarks.

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:49.100
"96 miles down the line and 3.2
million years into prehistory,"

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:58.360
we eventually find... Lucy.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.200
What made Lucy so important

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.100
"is the fact that her skeleton
clearly shows she was a biped,"

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.230
that she walked on two feet.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.200
"Because of her age and her
bipedalism, Lucy fit perfectly"

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.800
into the established picture
of bipedal evolution--

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.730
an upright-walking ancestor

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.530
"that lived around 3.2
million years ago,"

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:24.300
"at the time of the
expanding savanna,"

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.830
well after the deforestation
of East Africa had begun.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:34.400
"But now that theory, and
Lucy's place within it,"

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.300
are being challenged.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.000
"For if Orrorin really is a
six-million-year-old hominid,"

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.200
"we will be taken deeper
into the past than ever,"

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.760
"to a time when the
conventional wisdom has
not even been tested,"

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.700
let alone applied.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.730
JOHANSON: This is
a period of time

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.830
from which we have
three or four fossils

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.230
that you could fit into
the palm of your hand.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.060
And anything that would be
found in this time period

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.530
"of five, six million
years, has to be important."

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.330
"SHREIBER: The bones'
lasting significance
will depend, however,"

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.300
"not just on their age,"

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.000
but on where they are placed on
the human evolutionary tree.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.760
PICKFORD: We're really dealing
with an infinitesimally small--

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.200
and we hope representative--
part of the fossil record

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.500
and trying to draw out
details about human evolution

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.260
from those few remains.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.630
"SHREIBER: It is
a daunting task,"

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.830
for although there is
only one surviving species

00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.760
"of humans today,"

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.060
"our evolution was
a convoluted one,"

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.460
for evolution is
about populations--

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:43.030
"populations that sometimes
split to form new species,"

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:47.100
"and other times, die off
in evolutionary dead ends."

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.160
Determining any single
fossil's place in this chaos

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.460
is an immense challenge.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:56.860
"For a long time,
anthropologists have, uh..."

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.660
"speculated that the
recent ancestor,"

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:04.030
"or the common ancestor, to
both the living African apes"

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.300
and those branches that
evolved into hominids

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.560
was to be found somewhere

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.100
between six and ten million
years ago in Africa.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:18.330
SHREIBER: The map
of human evolution is
constantly being redrawn

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:22.230
as new discoveries fill
in holes in the record.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.630
But scientists generally agree

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:29.200
that hominids split from apes
over six million years ago.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.600
Was Orrorin present
when the split occurred?

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.460
Martin and Brigitte believe

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.060
that Orrorin really is a
six-million-year-old hominid

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.200
and that it has the
potential to revolutionize

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:49.560
our understanding
of human evolution.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.900
But are they jumping the gun?

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:55.360
Are the bones really
as old as they believe?

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.760
PICKFORD: We can't
actually date the fossils

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.630
"directly themselves,"

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.300
but what we can do is date the
strata in which they occur

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.860
and then extrapolate
that date to the fossil.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.660
SHREIBER: The geology
of this region helps.

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:14.560
"The area is known as
the Lukeino formation,"

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.460
an ancient lake basin
formed by a giant lava flow

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.160
that poured from one of
the massive volcanoes

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.700
scattered across Eastern Africa.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.800
PICKFORD: That
lava flow is huge.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.800
It extends for 50 or 60
kilometers north/south

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.300
"and about 60, 70
kilometers east/west."

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.630
And it formed the floor
of this lake basin

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.900
where these sediments-- the
Lukeino formation-- accumulated.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.630
SHREIBER: This bottom layer
of lava is called trachite.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:48.300
The sediment containing
Orrorin's bones

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:53.560
collected above it.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.060
Then a second flow
of basalt lava

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.700
created the icing on the
geological layer cake.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.130
"Both lava layers can be dated,"

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:05.700
so the bones found in
the middle can be placed

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.430
within a well-defined
slice of prehistoric time.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.860
So we're basically
in a kind of sandwich

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.700
with trachite dated at
6.2 million years below

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.930
and these basalt lavas at
5.65 covering the sediments.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:22.830
SHREIBER: So Orrorin lies
somewhere in between.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.930
To try and get a more exact date

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.330
"for the top and
bottom layers of lava,"

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.800
the team calls in a
group of scientists

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:37.230
from the University
of Shimane in Japan.

00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.960
The scientists will use

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.230
the shifting properties of
the earth's magnetic field

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:44.230
to determine the
date of the lava

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:48.560
that lies above
and below Orrorin.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.530
"When this rock was
in its molten state,"

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.600
tiny magnetic crystals
formed within it.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.660
"As the lava cooled, the
crystals all came to rest"

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.600
pointing in the same direction

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.760
"along the earth's
magnetic field,"

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.460
just like the
needle of a compass.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.960
"Every few thousand
years, however,"

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.030
the earth's magnetic
poles reverse.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:11.700
"When this happens,"

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.030
a compass needle would point
in the opposite direction.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:17.830
The crystals in the
corresponding layers of rock

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:20.300
do the same.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.400
These different layers--

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.130
each with its own
crystalline fingerprint--

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.600
can be sequenced and turned
into a geological timeline.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.460
The results are encouraging.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.830
The rocks in which
Orrorin was found

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:40.230
are between 5.8 and
6.1 million years old.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.400
"But even though the rock
samples have been firmly dated,"

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.600
there is still a small chance

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:53.300
that the bones may not be from
the same period as the rock.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.130
"PICKFORD: I actually
had nightmares for the
next... about two weeks,"

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.500
"thinking, you know, are
these things really as old"

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.030
as six million years?

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.000
"There has been histories
of discoveries,"

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.730
"in Kenya in particular, but
elsewhere in the world,"

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.630
"where the discoverers claimed
they were very ancient,"

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.760
and they turned out
to be much younger.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.060
"SHREIBER: Because the site
is a dried up watercourse,"

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.430
it is possible that the bones
had simply washed there

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:24.860
out of much younger rocks.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:31.460
This would put the value
of the find in jeopardy.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.600
The specter of displaced bones

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.300
"is one that haunts
all fossil hunters,"

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.030
but there is a way
to be almost certain

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:39.360
that the fossils do come

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.330
from the sediments in
which they were found.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.730
The team looks at
the huge variety

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.860
of other fossilized creatures

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.360
that accompanied
Orrorin's remains.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.700
( conversing in French )

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.400
"PICKFORD: In the
Lukeino formation where
we found Orrorin,"

00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.130
"we also found other mammals
such as elephants, horses,"

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.200
"hippopotamus, pigs and so on."

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.660
"And by the evolutionary
stage of those creatures,
those fossils,"

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.860
we can also guess the age.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:11.130
"And as soon as
we found Orrorin,"

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.000
"we looked around and
found other fossils,"

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.400
"and we could say
straight away,"

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:16.900
"yeah, this is late
Miocene in age,"

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:22.160
so it's got to be around
about six million years.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.500
SCHREIBER: Because
the fossilized remains
of ancient animals

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.160
have already been
accurately dated

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.200
"to six million years
old at other sites,"

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:34.130
their presence alongside
Orrorin is further confirmation

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:39.460
that Orrorin is from
the same period.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.060
"In addition, all the fossils,
including Orrorin's,"

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.260
"are encrusted with a coating
derived from freshwater algae,"

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.630
indicating that they
are from the same site.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.000
There is now little doubt

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.800
"about the date of the bones
Martin and Brigitte have found,"

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.260
little doubt that they are in
fact six million years old.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.030
PICKFORD: You're
seeing a picture which
nobody ever saw before.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.760
"Previously, the oldest
known hominid was"

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.560
"about 4.2, and now
we're at six million."

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.800
This discovery is
very significant

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.560
in terms of its chronology

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.830
because it is
getting back in time

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.000
very close to that period

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.730
when we think there
was a common ancestor

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:26.200
to the modern African
apes and ourselves.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.360
"SCHREIBER: So what
was this six-million-
year-old creature like,"

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.430
"and more importantly,"

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.830
how can we be sure it
really was an early hominid?

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:37.960
The accepted wisdom is

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.360
"that bipedalism is
the defining factor of
early human evolution,"

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.060
so Martin and Brigitte
will need to show

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.600
that Orrorin really
did walk upright.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.900
Doing so would not only suggest

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.160
that Orrorin is our
earliest known ancestor;

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.630
it would also indicate that
upright walking itself

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.930
is far older than scientists
had previously realized.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.500
Making the claim that any animal
this age was walking upright

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.660
is an incredibly
important conclusion

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.260
for paleoanthropology.

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.960
It's a very important issue.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.730
So we'd like to have
the entire skeleton

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.630
or at least a good
portion of the lower limb

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.360
to be able to... to
make this conclusion.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.930
"Unfortunately, for
the Orrorin remains,"

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.830
we don't have the knee joint.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.730
SCHREIBER: The lack of the
knee joint is a setback

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.300
because the knee is
the easiest way to tell

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:36.560
if an animal walked
on two legs or four.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.960
"Because humans walk upright,
our knees are specially adapted"

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.900
to give us a smooth
and efficient stride.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.200
"Apes, on the other hand,
have their knees far apart,"

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.430
and this difference shows up
in the shapes of the bones.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:56.230
"If you imagine a human
standing there like I am now,"

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.260
you've got your body weight
coming down onto your hips.

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.430
It's going down
into your thighbones

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.460
"which are angled into the
knee bone, the knee joint,"

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.600
and then straight
down to the floor.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.300
And this is important because
it makes for smooth walking.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:14.430
"Rather than walking
like a chimp with a lot
of lateral movement,"

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.830
a human can walk with almost
no movement of his hips.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.730
So you've got the whole of
your body weight coming down

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.500
through two joints into the
knees and straight down.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.230
"And for that to happen,"

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.100
the thighbones have to
be angled in humans.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.260
SCHREIBER: This angle is seen

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:34.360
when the knee joint is
placed on a flat surface.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:38.130
"If the bone leans outwards,
like this human bone does,"

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:43.960
the animal is certain to
have walked on two feet.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.700
"But with the knee missing,"

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.430
this crucial test cannot
be applied to Orrorin.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.800
The team will have to
look elsewhere for clues.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.230
RICHMOND: Bone is very
much a living tissue.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.530
It's very dynamic.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:00.960
"So in a bone, there's
a little bit of history"

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.560
of the activity of what
happened in that animal.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.600
And that's what we'd like
to get at eventually is

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.800
to look inside these
bones for clues

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.830
as to how these
bones were loaded

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:15.600
when the animal was alive.

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.930
SCHREIBER: One particular detail
on the surface of the thighbone

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:20.560
provides just such an insight.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.630
"SENUT: This is a
femur of Orrorin,"

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:27.030
"and there is one
feature which has been
linked with bipedalism,"

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.830
"is this groove here,
very well marked,"

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.230
for one of the ligaments
of one of the muscles

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:36.130
which helps to keep
the leg towards...

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:44.830
bring the legs towards the body.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:49.060
SCHREIBER: This muscle runs
from the back of the thighbone

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:52.030
and connects to the
front of the pelvis.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.900
"In a four-legged animal,
it has a straight path,"

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.900
"but in a biped, the
joint is extended"

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.500
so that the muscle
becomes stretched

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.160
"and is wrapped around
the neck of the femur,"

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.730
creating a groove in the bone.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:10.730
"JOHANSON: If that groove is
present as it is in Orrorin,"

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:15.360
there is a suggestion there
that the hip acted in a way

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:22.800
"very similar to our
own, meaning that this
creature was bipedal."

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.400
The groove is a sign

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.560
"that Orrorin might
have walked upright,"

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.300
but alone it is not enough.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.230
"Other primates,
such as gorillas,"

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.260
can also have this groove.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:41.800
So more convincing proof of
bipedalism must be found.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.660
"Fortunately, modern medical
technology can examine"

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.800
parts of the six-million-
year-old bones

00:26:48.800 --> 00:27:04.530
that are invisible
to the human eye.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:07.400
"Since we bear our
weight on the hip joint,"

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.760
"that weight causes
the neck to bend down,"

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.500
creating stress on the top
and the bottom of the neck.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:20.260
"But there's also a muscle that
pulls on this bone right here,"

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.900
"and that reduces the
stress at the top,"

00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.300
but adds more stress
at the bottom.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.060
"SCHREIBER: In a
bipedal animal,"

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.930
the underside of the
neck becomes thicker

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.930
to support the extra weight.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.160
It is this hidden feature that
can provide the critical answer

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.260
to how Orrorin walked.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.560
So if Orrorin has thick
bone on the bottom

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.200
"and thin bone on the top,"

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.500
then it would provide
really good evidence

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.530
that this thing
walked on two legs.

00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.000
That inside of the bone
and that pattern tells us

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.500
what the animal was actually
doing with its limbs

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.160
while it was alive.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.830
"Now, we can't see that
with the fossil itself."

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.100
We'll to have see X
rays or C.T. scans

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:05.730
of the inside of the
neck to be able to tell.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:09.930
"SCHREIBER: The fossils
are brought to a hospital
in Toulouse, France."

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.700
"Here, a C.T., or Computer
Tomography scanner--"

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.430
a device normally used

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:16.830
to diagnose illness
in living people--

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:18.630
will produce a
three-dimensional image

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:29.730
that shows the ancient
bone's hidden structure.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.530
These are consecutive slices

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.260
through the top of
the fossilized bone.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.600
"First they show the
ball-like head of the femur,"

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.800
which appears as a circle.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.900
"Then as they descend
into the neck,"

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.160
the amazing level of detail
in this ancient thighbone

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.530
becomes apparent.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:59.800
Every hollow and ridge
is clearly visible.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.530
"The computer builds a
three-dimensional model,"

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.930
which can then be
sectioned off to reveal

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:15.730
the thickness of the bone
in the critical neck area.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:19.100
"At last, the vital
evidence has been found:"

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.500
thicker bone on the
underside of the neck--

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.230
there to support the
weight of an early hominid

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:30.900
as it walked on two feet.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.860
PICKFORD: Orrorin is something
apart from the apes.

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.400
"Walking, running,
standing was a major part"

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:43.730
"of the repertoire of this
animal or this creature,"

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.560
and it shows in the bones.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.960
"It was adapted for
that kind of behavior,"

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.830
and it shows that
adaptation in its bones.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.730
SCHREIBER: The discovery proves

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.660
"that bipedalism
is much older than has
generally been thought,"

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.660
for the accepted wisdom claimed

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.500
that our ability to walk
upright only evolved

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:11.530
around the time that Lucy's kind
walked on the open savanna.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.300
"But if bipedalism occurred
before the forests receded,"

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.600
what could have compelled our
earliest ancestors to stand up?

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.900
"What drove us to begin
to walk on two feet,"

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:26.660
rather than on the four
we had been using as apes

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.430
for millions of years?

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.230
The reason for the
emergence of bipedalism

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:36.300
is one of the great
mysteries of human evolution.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.530
RICHMOND: B pedalism
is a very rare thing

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.100
"to see in mammals, even
in animals as a whole."

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:42.860
"We know birds
walk on two legs,"

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.930
but there's a very
compelling reason:

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.660
"They have wings, and
their upper limbs, then,"

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.700
are so specialized that
they can't use those limbs

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.460
"for weight support, so
they walk on two legs."

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.000
"If humans had wings,"

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.560
"then we would have the answer
right there, but we don't."

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.200
So there must be some other
very compelling reason

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:07.100
for humans to have begun
walking on two legs.

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:11.530
"SCHREIBER: So, why did
our earliest ancestors
become bipedal?"

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.760
What advantages could
bipedalism have granted

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:24.400
to an evolving species?

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.360
Marc Raibert is an
expert in robotics.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.030
He believes we can gain much
insight into animal locomotion

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:36.330
by analyzing the
way his robots move.

00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.960
RAIBERT: We're very interested

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.400
"in the relationship between the
robots we build and biology,"

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.100
"how people and animals
work when they locomote,"

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.800
and the relationship between
those has two parts.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.360
There's what looking at the
knowledge about animals tells us

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.000
"when we're trying
to design robots,"

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.700
but there's also an opportunity

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.000
to use what we learn
about building robots

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:08.060
to help in understanding how
people and animals work.

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.800
"SCHREIBER: Based at
MIT, Marc has built"

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:14.900
some of the most extraordinary
striding robots ever seen.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:22.600
They come in all
shapes and sizes.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.530
His experiments help illustrate

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:27.060
what advantages a
two-legged creature has

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:37.860
over a four-legged one.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.930
RAIBERT: One of the
things we found out is
that it was much easier

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.260
to build a robot with fewer
legs than with more legs.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.760
So a biped was much easier
to develop and to make work

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.200
"than a quadruped,"

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.860
largely because the complexity
of coordinating the legs

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.230
"was reduced, the mechanical
complexity was reduced"

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:03.030
by not having all the additional
mechanisms and actuators.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:05.930
SCHREIBER: Just as a bipedal
robot is more efficient

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.560
"than a robot with four legs,"

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:10.430
a two-legged animal is in
many ways more efficient

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:12.330
than a four-legged one.

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:14.200
"With fewer limbs to control,"

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.960
"a biped can transport
itself successfully,"

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.930
yet use less of its body
to achieve the task.

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.330
It can use its natural
instability to its advantage

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:28.000
when moving.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.460
Bipeds are highly maneuverable
and extremely agile.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.030
"But perhaps most importantly,"

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.960
walking on two legs
liberates the other limbs

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.300
and frees up the
hands for other uses.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.160
Raibert's robots demonstrate

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.160
"efficiency, flexibility
and maneuverability--"

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.800
all advantages that
an ape would possess

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:58.360
if it became bipedal.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:01.460
But doing so would
have been no easy task.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:05.030
"In order to reap the
benefits of upright walking,"

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:09.130
an exceptional sense of balance
would have become vital.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.860
"RAIBERT: In order
to achieve that, you have
to have a control system"

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.330
that can maintain its balance

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.130
"when just two feet
are on the ground,"

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.630
"or one foot is on the ground,"

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.630
"and when it's running, when
no feet are on the ground,"

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:24.060
and so that's a big challenge.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:28.500
SCHREIBER: Learning to balance
and walk upright would have been

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.300
immensely difficult for
our earliest ancestors.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.360
It is a process that has
never been fully explained

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.700
by the savanna hypothesis.

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.300
Anatomist Robin
Crompton has been trying

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.860
to come up with a
viable explanation.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:45.430
He has been using computers

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:48.000
to try and determine
how the shift occurred.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.960
There's been a
long-running debate

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.630
between two different groups

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:54.530
who are analyzing exactly
the same fossil remains

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:58.130
"but in two very different and,
up to now, incompatible ways."

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.860
SCHREIBER: One group held

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.200
that early hominids
would have walked upright

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.560
"in an erect,
straight position."

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.360
Others claimed our ancestors
would first have moved

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.560
"with a slouching,
bent-knee, bent-hip gait."

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.900
CROMPTON: We made a computer
model based on our information

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.500
from the literature and
from other scientists

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.460
and gave them body builds
of different kinds of apes.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.630
SCHREIBER: Robin tested
the two walking styles:

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.160
"upright and erect
like modern humans,"

00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.030
then the bent-knee walk.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:40.660
CROMPTON: What we
did discover is that the
mechanical energy cost--

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:43.600
"that is, the work that
the muscles must do"

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.500
to sustain the motion-- was
approximately twice as high

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.730
"in the model which is walking
in a bent-knee, bent-hip gait."

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:55.460
SCHREIBER: The inefficiency of
the bent-knee gait raises doubts

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:58.230
about whether or not it
ever actually occurred

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.560
in early hominids.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.400
Perhaps there is a
better explanation

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:09.860
for our evolution
from four legs to two.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.330
Robin believes that one creature
alive today may hold the answer.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:26.930
It is one of the rarest
animals in the world...

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.660
the orangutan.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.700
"CROMPTON: For us the orangutan
is a fascinating animal,"

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.160
"not only attractive but
scientifically fascinating,"

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.930
"because it may, of
all the great apes, be"

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:43.560
our best model for the
origins of bipedality.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.660
"SCHREIBER: The name
""orangutan"" means ""forest
man"" in Indonesia,"

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.960
and while they don't
come from Africa

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.830
"and they are not our
closest living relatives,"

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.360
they do display
behavior and adaptations

00:36:55.360 --> 00:37:09.200
that may hint at how we
developed bipedalism.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:12.700
"Here at Chester Zoo
in the United Kingdom,"

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:16.300
Robin had been using special
high-speed video cameras

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.330
"to film these animals'
unique way of walking,"

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:25.030
"which, unlike chimpanzees', is
remarkably similar to ours."

00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.900
CROMPTON: The hip
joint is very extended;

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.600
"that is, the leg
goes behind the body,"

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.330
and you won't see a
chimpanzee do that.

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.860
And this is linked
to their behavior

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:38.630
in the high levels
of the forest canopy

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:43.260
"gathering... gathering
fruit and moving
on fairly small vines,"

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.860
and using their
body rather like...

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.260
almost like a spider

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:51.230
"to reach out for branches,
to reach out for food."

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.660
"SCHREIBER: In the wild,"

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.760
"these animals hardly ever
come down to the ground,"

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.300
preferring to spend
almost all their time

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.360
200 feet up in
the forest canopy.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.000
Yet they often support
almost all their weight

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.530
"on their hind legs,"

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:08.000
and their habitat supplies them
with the perfect environment

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:26.100
in which to develop an
acute sense of balance.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.130
CROMPTON: The trees are
perhaps the ideal nursery

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.630
"for the evolution
of human walking,"

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:34.130
because they enable an
animal to balance itself.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:36.760
They can reach out
in any direction.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.730
"Everywhere-- below them, above
them, to the side of them--"

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:44.000
they'll find branches
which they can touch.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.600
"For me, then, the evidence
is increasingly strong"

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:52.760
"that bipedalism did not
arise on the ground,"

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:58.130
but arose in the trees.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.730
PICKFORD: A creature that
is basically arboreal

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:04.000
that needs to cross from patch
of trees to patch of trees--

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.260
"if they're bipedal,
they have an advantage."

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.730
They don't have to change
their body too much.

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.330
"They come down to the ground,"

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:13.130
"their bodies are
already upright from
being in the trees,"

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:14.660
"they cross the ground upright,"

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.330
and they climb up the next
patch of trees to get food.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:21.400
They don't have to modify
their body too much.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.100
"SCHREIBER: The evidence
is beginning to add up,"

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.900
and Robin's research seems
to cast further doubt

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.360
on the belief that
bipedalism only evolved

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:35.900
after the emergence
of the open savanna.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.630
"Instead, the orangutans,
the robots and now Orrorin"

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:43.030
are pointing towards a
much earlier transition

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:49.430
to upright walking in
a more wooded setting.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.630
The discovery of Orrorin's
bones is forcing us

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.200
to reexamine our understanding

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:59.600
"of when, why and how upright
walking first occurred."

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.560
Our perceptions are being
turned on their head.

00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:05.600
"JOHANSON: One thing
that's emerging now,"

00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.500
"and Orrorin, the discovery of
Orrorin really reinforces this,"

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.000
is the idea that
bipedalism is an adaptation

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.230
that arose in a more
forested environment

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.260
and was a pre-adaptation
in many ways

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:24.760
to when they did move out
onto the savanna grasslands.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.930
"SCHREIBER: So if bipedalism
really did emerge in the trees,"

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:32.660
the iconic image
of human evolution

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.530
may need some revision.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:36.460
PICKFORD: The sort
of classic image

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:38.730
"of quadrupedal
apelike creatures,"

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:42.700
"such as a chimp, for example,
gradually becoming upright,"

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.530
going through all the
stages of tottering

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:47.800
and up to become fully upright--

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.560
I think that's... has to be
thrown in the wastebasket.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.830
"I may be wrong, but I susp..."

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.030
I really think that
idea should be removed

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:05.430
from the list of hypotheses
about hominid origins.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:09.160
"SCHREIBER: Rather than the
typical portrayal of evolution,"

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.630
this would be a more
accurate picture.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:22.300
Our ancestors have been upright
for at least six million years.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.760
"But in order to be sure that
the new picture is correct,"

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.930
Martin and Brigitte
must have proof

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:31.400
that the area where Orrorin
was found really was wooded

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.560
six million years ago.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.260
"Once again, their confirmation
comes from the large number"

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.730
of other fossils that have
been excavated at the site.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.200
Most were from animals that
lived in or near a forest.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.700
"Monkeys and small antelope
were particularly common,"

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.800
and there was plenty of water.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.700
"PICKFORD: You've got
lots of impala, and quite
a lot of colobus monkeys."

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:58.600
"SENUT: Mind you, we've got a
lot of hippos as well, huh?"

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.260
"PICKFORD: Well, there's hippos"

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:03.030
and there's crocs and snails--
there's freshwater snails here.

00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:05.600
SCHREIBER: The remains
paint a picture

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.000
of a region that was at
least partially forested.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.400
But what evidence is there

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.330
of Orrorin's place
within this ecosystem?

00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:16.430
How did this early hominid split
its time between the trees

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:26.460
and the ground?

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.900
"Back in Paris, Martin
and Brigitte can infer"

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:34.230
quite a few details from the
bones they have collected.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.460
"It's about the size of
a chimp, a modern chimp,"

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.230
but its legs were probably
longer than a chimp's legs.

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:44.630
"If you see one walking around
or in this environment,"

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:48.400
"you wouldn't have
said, ""Ah, there's a
man,"" or ""a woman."""

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.400
"You'd have said,
""There's something"

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:54.000
"a little bit like a human, but
not really like a modern one."""

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.330
SCHREIBER: Creating an overall
picture of an extinct animal

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:01.600
is an immense challenge.

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.030
But there are many
characteristics

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:07.000
that can be deduced.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.830
"The teeth are an
excellent starting point,"

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.060
for they reveal
vital information

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:16.060
about a creature's
life and diet.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.530
"Gary Schwartz, from
Georgetown University,"

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:20.860
is an expert on ancient teeth.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.560
SCHWARTZ: One of the really
interesting things about teeth

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.800
is that they are the only
part of the skeletal system

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:30.760
that comes into contact with the
outside world on a daily basis.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:35.060
Now what's interesting
about the Orrorin find

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.700
is the back teeth
tend to have features

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.760
"that seem to resemble the
modern human condition,"

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.500
while the front teeth
tend to have features

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.630
which resemble
modern chimpanzees.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.030
( chimp screaming )

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:50.760
"SCHREIBER: In a
six-million-year-old animal,"

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.160
"scientists would expect all
the teeth to be apelike,"

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.900
but Orrorin's back teeth are
surprisingly similar to our own.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.360
( X ray beam sizzles )

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.330
"The C.A.T. scan shows that,
just like ours, they are small,"

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:09.600
and have a thick
layer of enamel--

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:17.160
the tough outer coating.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.960
The shape of teeth
tells you a lot

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.830
about the food that that
particular animal is eating.

00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:23.600
An animal that
eats mostly leaves

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.830
"tends to have teeth that
are very sharp and crested,"

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.230
and those sharp crests

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:31.200
tend to slice through
the tough leafy material.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.660
"On the other hand,"

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.130
"animals that eat lots of
tough, hard nuts and seeds"

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.530
have low flat teeth
which are used

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:45.160
to pulverize and...
and crush those seeds.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.430
"SCHREIBER: Orrorin's teeth are
of this low, pulverizing type,"

00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:52.630
"and so, like us, it was
probably an omnivore,"

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:55.500
"eating nuts, berries,
fruit and insects."

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.500
"Given the similarity
to human teeth,"

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.230
it might have also eaten meat.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:04.700
( grunts )

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:11.200
SCHREIBER: But what other
behaviors did Orrorin exhibit?

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.300
"JOHANSON: These discoveries of
Orrorin are... are very fresh,"

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.760
they're very recent.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.500
We don't know much about
the.... the broader picture

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.800
"in terms of how they lived, and
how they made their living,"

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.130
but I suspect that they
weren't solitary creatures.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.530
I suspect that they lived
in some sort of a group--

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:40.100
"probably in multimale,
multifemale groups."

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:44.530
SCHREIBER: The likelihood that
they lived in mixed-sex groups

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.500
comes from the study
of our modern cousins.

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.930
Virtually every living primate

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:50.230
"displays a similar sort
of social behavior,"

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.100
and researchers are only
just beginning to understand

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:57.830
the complex societies
formed by the higher apes.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:01.100
"But with communal living so
prevalent in modern primates,"

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.930
it stands to reason that the
development of the behavior

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:08.800
is not recent.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.130
"Orrorin was almost
certainly a social beast,"

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:18.460
even if it had yet to
develop in other ways.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.460
"JOHANSON : This is
certainly a long, long time"

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.930
"before the manufacture
of stone tools,"

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.460
which don't really appear
in the archaeological record

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:28.660
until about 2.5
million years ago.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:34.530
So these... these are prestone
toolmakers by a... a long shot.

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:37.930
"SCHREIBER: Although
they did not use tools,
there is evidence"

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:41.700
that Orrorin was well adapted
for movement in the trees.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:46.130
"This humerus, or arm
bone, shows that Orrorin
was a good climber."

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:47.830
The large flare at its lower end

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:50.600
provides the attachment for
the powerful arm muscles

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.660
that a tree-dwelling
animal needs.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.560
And the finger bone is curved--

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.130
"a feature that all
modern apes share,"

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.260
because permanently curved hands

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.800
are better for holding
on to branches.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.060
JOHANSON: I suspect it might not
have been unreasonable to think

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:11.160
that they may have made nests
and slept in the trees.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.360
"Chimpanzees certainly do that,
and being off the ground"

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.000
would have added an
additional element of safety.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
SCHREIBER: But even
this precaution

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.360
would not have put
Orrorin out of danger.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.930
"There is evidence that fierce
predators were on the prowl,"

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:28.730
and often successful.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:31.830
"These shallow depressions
are tooth marks,"

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:37.660
probably from an ancient
species of big cat.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:41.460
( growling )

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.800
PICKFORD: It looks as
though the Orrorin fell prey

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.060
to some carnivore on a
reasonably regular basis.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:50.030
We found the finger bones
of a large carnivore

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:52.930
which are slightly
larger than a leopard.

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.760
"And then we found...
one of the teeth,"

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:58.400
"one of the... the
carnassial tooth,"

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.700
which is the razorlike tooth

00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:06.700
that is used for shearing flesh.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.230
( squeals )

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:14.630
( growls )

00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:17.000
PICKFORD: A carnivore like a
leopard would fit the bill

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.400
"because it's not only preying
on ground animals like impalas,"

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.460
"but it's also getting Colobus
monkeys from the trees,"

00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:36.930
and maybe Orrorin from the
trees or from the ground.

00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:38.930
( hominid screams )

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:40.800
( roaring )

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.830
"BICKFORD: Then bringing
them to a central place,"

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.430
"maybe to its favorite tree
where it stores its prey up,"

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.560
"hanging the prey
up in the trees,"

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.630
and that's why there's
such a concentration there.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:49:02.730
( thunder cracks )

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.800
"SCHREIBER: By gathering
its prey to one location,"

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.400
the ancient predator
unwittingly provided us

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.000
with the remains of
a prehuman ancestor.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.500
"And also with clues
about how, when and where"

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:24.330
this bipedal creature
evolved from the apes.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.900
The evidence is compelling.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:31.000
Orrorin moved and lived both
on the ground and in the trees

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.500
six million years ago.

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:41.360
Yet Martin and Brigitte
have an even bolder claim.

00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.330
They believe that Orrorin is
actually more similar to humans

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:47.500
than Don Johanson's
famous find--

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:56.100
that Orrorin is more directly
related to us than Lucy is.

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:59.100
"Although there is disagreement
among the experts,"

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.530
some believe that
more than one species

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.930
"of early humans existed
simultaneously,"

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:10.960
much like Neanderthals and
modern humans did more recently.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.630
Ian Tattersall has
spent much of his life

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:19.260
studying the diversity
of early hominids.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:21.860
Traditionally we have
envisaged evolution

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:24.800
"as a sort of linear
process, a gradual process"

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.830
of modification of single
lineages of organisms

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.700
over long periods of time.

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:31.930
Now we realize that the process

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.730
"actually is much more
complex than this,"

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.730
and it very much involves the
production of new species;

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:41.730
that is to say new
reproductive entities

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:45.930
which can be formed in
relatively short periods of time

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:51.300
and which will then
compete with each other.

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:55.360
SCHREIBER: Martin and
Brigitte believe this
was exactly the case

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.830
"when Lucy was alive, and
that it was not her species,"

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.300
but rather a
descendant of Orrorin's

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.430
that gave rise to modern humans.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:11.100
They turn to a comparison of
the bones for verification.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:15.760
"This is a mandible of a modern
human, and as you can see"

00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:20.360
"from the third molar, second
molar and the first molar,"

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:23.030
the teeth are small and square.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.400
Now if we compare

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.160
"the modern human mandible
and Lucy's mandible,"

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:30.230
it's obvious that she is
bigger in terms of teeth--

00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:31.760
and she's a young adult--

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.760
and the teeth are
more elongated.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.460
"It's interesting to
see that Orrorin,"

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.900
by the morphology
of its teeth...

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.260
the teeth are closer to humans.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:45.730
"If I want to compare Orrorin
with Lucy, we can clearly see"

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:49.360
"that the teeth in Orrorin
are small and square,"

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:53.000
"and Lucy's are more
elongated, more rectangular."

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.100
When we compare
Lucy with Orrorin

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.700
there's other landmarks
which tells us

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.400
that Lucy was not the
same biped as Orrorin.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.000
SCHREIBER: The other
main landmark is the
shape of the two femurs.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
The short neck and
head of Orrorin's

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
appears to be more similar to a
human femur than Lucy's does.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.700
The problem would be
that you would have to go

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:21.100
"from small humanlike molars
to large Lucy-like molars,"

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.000
back to small humanlike molars.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.230
"So, you're getting a kind
of zigzag in the evolution."

00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:30.060
You'd have to do the
same with the leg bones--

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:33.030
"more humanlike leg
bones in Orrorin,"

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:37.400
"less humanlike in Lucy,
back to humanlike in humans."

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.860
"And you're getting a kind of
yo-yo effect in evolution,"

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:43.630
"and we don't like that,
generally speaking."

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:47.700
"It's not impossible, but if you
have it not only in the teeth"

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.460
"but also in the leg bones,"

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.200
then you're getting two yo-yos--
makes it very unlikely.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.330
You would certainly prefer

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:58.400
that in creating a
scheme of evolution

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.130
for a group such as the hominids

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:03.800
that you didn't
have to backtrack

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.960
more times than necessary.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.960
It doesn't mean that no
backtracking ever occurred.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.930
SCHREIBER: But Martin and
Brigitte are confident
with their claim

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:16.860
that Lucy's kind became extinct.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.100
Lucy may well be
on a side branch.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.830
She's definitely hominid in
the sense of being a biped.

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:26.560
She's part of this bushiness
that we're talking about--

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.600
the family tree being bushy--

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:32.900
"but I'm afraid that her kind
eventually became extinct,"

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:37.330
whereas the Orrorin type of
morphology carried on through

00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:41.660
and eventually gave
rise to modern humans.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.430
That's what I think it means.

00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:45.300
Whether I'm right or not is...

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.260
( chuckling ): we'll only
find out in the future.

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:52.560
"SCHREIBER: Until the fossil
record is more complete,"

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.830
scientists will
continue to debate

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:56.960
whether Lucy and her kind

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.400
"gave rise to every
one of us alive today,"

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:02.760
or whether she was from an
unfortunate side branch

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.460
that eventually died out.

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:06.900
As for Orrorin...

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:08.500
"Hey, Brigitte, regarde."

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:11.060
"SCHREIBER: The team continues
to search for more bones,"

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.630
hoping to come up with as
much of a complete skeleton

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:14.630
as possible.

00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:18.300
( laughter )

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:22.730
( all speaking local language )

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.230
SCHREIBER: For only
with more evidence

00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:28.530
can Martin and Brigitte
conclusively put to rest

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:31.600
all reservations about
Orrorin's true place

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:36.530
at the very base of the
human evolutionary tree.

00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:39.960
"As time goes by, we will learn
more about the remarkable set"

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.460
of geological and
evolutionary coincidences

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:48.660
that set this ancient creature
on the long road to humanity.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.500
"But for now, we have been
given a first glimpse"

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.700
of our most distant past.
