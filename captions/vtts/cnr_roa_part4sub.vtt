00:01:08.968 --> 00:01:12.839
(radio sounds)

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:15.208
Narrator:
Nightmares, flashbacks,

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:19.846
-vigilance, depressi
sudden rages,

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:22.982
sudden sadness, mood swings...

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.685
(distant artillery fire,
gunshots)

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.554
Once the public knew little

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.989
about post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.788
It was seeing what happened
to our soldiers,

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.894
in the terrible trauma of war-

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.464
and the anguish that
followed them home,

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.966
disrupting their physical
and mental health

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.701
and affecting loved ones-

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:45.661
that brought the term
PTSD to public awareness.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.710
But we know now
it's not just our soldiers

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.882
whose lives can be overwhelmed
by the symptoms of PTSD.

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:58.585
Young people living
in impoverished,

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.488
urban neighborhoods
across America

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:04.821
too-often suffer through
similar stressors.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.362
Man:
The first time I got shot,

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.499
I thought I was going
to really, really die.

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.023
Woman:
And I looked, and it was

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.838
actually a body in the street,
and for my kids to see that...

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.467
They messed up my whole

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.946
Young Woman:
I have, like, high anxiety,

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:30.746
and I just feel paranoid
all the time.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.585
Man:
For the young people

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.253
in the inner city

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.889
we actually see
the full-blown syndrome

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.859
of post-traumatic stress
disorder or PTSD,

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.262
every bit the same syndrome
that we see

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.930
in returning combat veterans

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.194
from places like Iraq
and Afghanistan.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.537
Narrator:
Children and young people

00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.540
growing up in pockets
of concentrated poverty

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.531
can often be exposed
to violence...

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:58.244
(gunshots)

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:02.815
...personal conflict, extreme
anxiety, and other adversities

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.546
as disturbing as some war zones.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.154
Rich:
If we believe that behaviors

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.056
are shaped
out of experience-

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:12.825
and we know that's how
the brain develops-

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.495
then we should expect
that people will behave

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:20.300
based on their experiences,
and they sometimes are reacting

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.063
because those experiences
were traumatic.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:26.673
If these young people
have been harmed or injured

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.408
by the stress in their lives,

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.706
then what they really
need is healing.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.847
We have two choices.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.950
We can ask ourselves,
"What's wrong with this person?"

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.544
or we can ask,
"What happened to this person?"

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.329
Narrator:
In 2012, The New York Times

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.097
ranked Oakland, California

00:03:51.097 --> 00:03:53.566
the fifth most
desirable destination

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.934
to visit in the world,

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:59.973
between number four, London
and number six, Tokyo.

00:03:59.973 --> 00:04:03.943
This city is also one
of the nation's most dangerous.

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:05.812
The number of
shootings in Oakland

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:07.046
has risen in recent years,

00:04:07.046 --> 00:04:13.886
from 869 in 2009,
to over 1,500 in 2011.

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.789
These shootings are
overwhelmingly concentrated

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.985
in two of its most
impoverished neighborhoods,

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:22.228
East Oakland
and West Oakland.

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:26.299
The city's economic renaissance
with its new high-tech jobs

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:31.499
trendy boutiques, and pricey
condos doesn't reach that far.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.843
Young Woman:
I heard hella gunshots.

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:39.479
I've never heard gunshots
that close tome...

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.215
Narrator:
Caheri Gutierrez, age 23,

00:04:42.215 --> 00:04:43.983
grew up in
deep East Oakland

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:46.816
and is now a counselor
at Youth Alive!.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.389
Raise your hand
if you know somebody

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.724
who's been affected
by gun violence...

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:52.992
Narrator:
She's a violence prevention

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:56.596
educator, teaching teens
about conflict resolution

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.029
and other safety issues.

00:04:58.865 --> 00:05:01.231
The teens she trains
become leaders

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.569
who go on to teach
younger kids.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:05.705
One of the dudes
from the gang...

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:07.573
Narrator:
Caheri uses her own experience

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:10.543
to explore how exposure
to trauma can trigger

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.945
dramatic changes in moods
and behaviors.

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:15.248
Caheri:

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:18.851
I must have been a sophomore
or freshman in high school...

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:23.523
It was when I saw my brother
get shot in the head.

00:05:23.523 --> 00:05:24.888
He was a gang member.

00:05:26.225 --> 00:05:28.428
I didn't have a dad in my life.

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:30.596
So this was my role model,

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:33.099
my father figure, my
best friend.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.904
He had a huge bullet hole
in his head...

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:43.069
And I put my hand on the,
you know, hole, and...

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.111
hella blood was
just coming out,

00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:47.613
and the blood was so warm.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.950
Like I vividly remember that...
blood was hellawarm...

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.319
Narrator:
Amazingly, her brother, Gustavo

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.554
survived the shooting,

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:58.791
but that didn't mean Caheri's
own problems were over.

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.059
Caheri:
I left Highland Hospital

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:05.298
with a whole different attitude,
like a straight bitch.

00:06:05.298 --> 00:06:10.136
I don't give a fuck, da-da-da...
that attitude...

00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:15.975
smoking hella weed,
yeah, drinking, too...

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:17.944
Rich:
There's a cascade of things

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.979
that happen after trauma.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.683
Many young people turn
to alcohol or marijuana

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:25.318
in order to treat
their symptoms.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.453
Man, I had some good-ass
grades in high school.

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:30.857
I was playing volleyball
for the state of California.

00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:33.826
I couldn't focus,
I just couldn't.

00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:36.829
The teacher's talking
about biology and the cells

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.097
and da-da-da-da-da,

00:06:38.097 --> 00:06:41.334
and I'm just thinking
about images of my brother

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:44.099
getting shot again,
and again, and again.

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:48.641
Woman:
A child in that state

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:52.845
cannot sit comfortably
and calmly in a seat

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:56.349
and take in information
about world geography.

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:00.445
They can't doit.
Our minds don't work that

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:04.524
Narrator:
Caheri struggled hard

00:07:04.524 --> 00:07:07.652
to keep her life together
after Gustavo was shot.

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:11.397
A year later,
on a November night,

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:19.639
Caheri was on her way
with a friend to help out

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.841
the driver starts screaming,

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.809
"We're shot! We're shot!
We're shot!"

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.815
When he looked at me,
I just saw a look on his face

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:31.851
that was like he saw a ghost.

00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:34.854
So, the bullet came in
through the back window,

00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:40.092
and it struck me
on my right mandible,

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:44.497
came out of my mouth,
knocked down, you know,

00:07:44.497 --> 00:07:47.990
a lot of my front teeth
and back teeth.

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:52.038
Into the guy's arm.
Same bullet.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:56.075
(heart monitor beeping)

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:57.376
Narrator:
Caheri doesn't know

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:58.711
who shot her.

00:07:58.711 --> 00:08:01.447
The perpetrator
was never arrested.

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:05.017
Over time, she would
endure five surgeries

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:06.849
to rebuild her face.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.256
Caheri:
I woke up in the hospital.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:11.958
From the moment
I opened my eyes,

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.757
I knew that things
had changed.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.965
Narrator:
We know that people

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:20.132
who've suffered trauma

00:08:20.132 --> 00:08:22.869
are often left not
only with physical

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:26.239
but also psychological injuries.

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.866
Caheri:

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.043
I was paranoid...

00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:32.378
I had nightmares...

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:36.549
nightmares so much that
I did not want to sleep...

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.050
Rich:
We often see young people

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.586
who are hyper-vigilant
or hyper-aroused.

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:43.890
That means if you clap your
hands or make a noise,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.826
these young people will jump
out of their skin.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.394
If someone will come
from behind me

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:49.462
and be like, "Hey, Caheri,"

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:50.930
I'd be like, "Oh sh...l"

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:52.894
Like that.

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:59.098
And then just start crying
because I felt like I'm crazy.

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:04.010
Narrator:
For people suffering

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.680
with PTSD, the natural
fight-or-flight response

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.749
doesn't really turn off.

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.149
Their brain continues
releasing chemicals

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:15.955
which trigger feelings of
fear, anxiety, anger

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:19.823
or depression even when
the danger is long gone.

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:25.331
(unintelligible baby talk)

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:29.869
Across town, 23-year-old
Antonio Carter also suffers

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:32.038
with similar symptoms
of trauma

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:34.941
brought on by a pile-up
of adversities...

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:38.069
though getting shot himself
wasn't one of them.

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:44.450
Where's the cars at?
Ahh, the city fell, Tony...

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.518
It fell?

00:09:45.518 --> 00:09:46.917
Yeah, got to pick it
back up...

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.652
Narrator:
The problems came on early.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:57.964
Cancer took his mother
when he was twelve years old.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:00.533
Antonio:
And my dad, like,

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:02.201
we asked him
to take care of us.

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:04.534
But he couldn't do it.

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:09.875
With us not having
a father figure around,

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.411
it was like life or death,
every man for they-self,

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:13.208
you know what I mean?

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.416
Narrator:
Now, mostly on his own,

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:20.019
without trusted adults
to help him,

00:10:20.019 --> 00:10:22.722
Antonio found tensions
in the neighborhood

00:10:22.722 --> 00:10:24.314
could be overwhelming.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:26.525
Antonio:
We were sitting together,

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:28.494
and we were all in a circle,

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:30.162
and him and my friend,
my other friend,

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:35.123
started arguing, and my other
friend just pulled out a gun

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.536
and shot him right there,
like right in front me.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:40.972
Like right here...
I was just looking, like...

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.409
Make it bigger then.

00:10:43.409 --> 00:10:46.045
How big are you gonna
make it then?

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.847
Antonio:
After seeing so much blood

00:10:47.847 --> 00:10:51.017
and so many people dying
for so long...

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:53.417
it only makes you crazy.

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.424
Narrator:
Today there are new worries,

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:01.894
like completing his Emergency
Medical Technician certification

00:11:01.894 --> 00:11:05.131
and keeping
two-year-old Tony, Jr. safe

00:11:05.131 --> 00:11:08.401
in the same
Oakland streets.

00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:09.969
Antonio:
Right now, I don't even

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:13.272
let him go outside to the front,
to play in the front yard...

00:11:13.272 --> 00:11:15.832
because I know
what could happen.

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:19.578
One of my worst
fears is, like,

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:21.313
walking down the street
with my son,

00:11:21.313 --> 00:11:23.949
and you know what I mean,
like, and all of a sudden,

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:26.714
like, shots just start...

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:31.223
I wouldn't know what
to doit I lose him because,

00:11:31.223 --> 00:11:34.853
like, him and his mom,
he's all I got.

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.932
Narrator:
As it turns out,

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:41.934
such worry over safety

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:45.271
is only one of an unending
stream of stressors

00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.138
which many young people
and children face.

00:11:58.017 --> 00:12:01.153
South Africa, 1987.

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:04.590
Psychologist Gill Straker
was struggling to describe

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.692
the traumatic stress
and adversity

00:12:06.692 --> 00:12:11.831
faced by black townships
under apartheid.

00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:16.469
She coined the term, Continuous
Traumatic Stress Syndrome.

00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:18.971
Continuous, because for
these young people,

00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:23.476
there was neither pre-trauma
nor post-trauma.

00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:27.780
They were living lives
of unrelenting adversity...

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.148
As many young people do
in our own cities.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:34.019
Chicago...

00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:35.855
Washington, DC...

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:39.125
Omaha... Baltimore...

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:40.490
New Orleans...

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:43.896
St. Louis... Detroit...

00:12:43.896 --> 00:12:45.159
Los Angeles...

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:50.836
In cities across America,
many young people are living,

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:55.207
from birth, in neighborhoods
exposed not only to violence

00:12:55.207 --> 00:13:00.346
but also entrenched poverty
and social isolation.

00:13:00.346 --> 00:13:03.315
the result of decades of
business flight,

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:06.774
government neglect, and
residential segregation.

00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.489
Woman:
So, there are entire communities

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:13.492
in America
that are disconnected

00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:16.996
generationally from
labor markets.

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:20.232
They don't have a job.
Their parents didn't have a

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:23.536
Their grandparents might
have been underemployed

00:13:23.536 --> 00:13:24.837
or unemployed.

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:27.840
Those communities are
black and brown communities

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.444
separated very much
from communities that are white.

00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:33.746
Rich:
There's a stress

00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.347
that goes with poverty.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:37.116
(sirens)

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:44.857
Noise, lack of safe housing,
lots of vacant lots...

00:13:44.857 --> 00:13:50.696
The police actually might
be perceived as enemies to you.

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:53.232
The stress that comes
from being

00:13:53.232 --> 00:13:54.995
low down on
the social ladder...

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:58.637
Caheri:
A lot of our kids,

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:01.440
a lot of our youth,
they live in these homes

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.944
where they've been neglected
since they were young...

00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:08.080
If you guys ever had therapy
raise your hand...

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.817
Maybe they haven't slept, you
know, maybe they haven't eaten.

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:16.121
Their parents might not have
a job, there's constant stress.

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.990
There's drug dealers.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:21.827
All the time they're under
this stress, hyper-arousal.

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.263
Rich:
It used to be we thought

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:27.600
about trauma as someone
being in a plane crash,

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.103
or someone having
a gunshot wound.

00:14:31.103 --> 00:14:33.138
Those are types of trauma.

00:14:33.138 --> 00:14:36.008
But more generally, we can
talk about trauma

00:14:36.008 --> 00:14:38.911
as that when the
strengths inside you and

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:42.081
the resources around you can't
respond to a threat,

00:14:42.081 --> 00:14:44.106
that is an experience of trauma.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.352
Man:
It doesn't necessarily

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:49.088
have to be from an injury

00:14:49.088 --> 00:14:52.324
that occurred to them,
but it could be over the course,

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:55.194
over their life course,
how they've been exposed

00:14:55.194 --> 00:15:00.996
to various types of stress,
adversity, and trauma.

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.969
Narrator:
Dr. Ted Corbin practices

00:15:03.969 --> 00:15:04.970
emergency medicine

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.974
at Hahnemann University
Hospital in Philadelphia...

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:13.445
another city where the class
divide can be dramatic.

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:17.850
Neighborhoods run the gamut
from comfortable historic homes

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.952
to some of the most
economically distressed

00:15:19.952 --> 00:15:21.476
communities in the country.

00:15:23.222 --> 00:15:27.181
Researchers suggest the PTSD
rate among the urban poor

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:30.990
in Philadelphia could be
a shocking forty percent.

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:35.968
The city's corrosive
history of race-based politics

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:40.139
of economic exclusion undermined
many non-white neighborhoods,

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:43.409
leaving them without jobs,
infrastructure,

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:44.603
or affordable housing.

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:51.684
The poverty rate in 2011 was
34% for African Americans,

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:53.675
42% for Latinos.

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:57.022
More than one in three
children in Philadelphia

00:15:57.022 --> 00:16:00.225
grow up in poverty.

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:04.530
From birth they are swimming
against a stream of stressors.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.366
Over-crowded or
run-down housing.

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:12.071
Family worries about job loss,
making rent and paying bills.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:13.906
Having enough to eat.

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:16.875
Substance abuse.
Domestic conflict.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.707
Neighborhood safety.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.948
Y'all walk with me...

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:23.849
Narrator:
Twenty-four-year-old

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:25.951
Christine Henry can relate.

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:29.046
She's been bringing up her
children in North Philadelphia.

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:33.292
Three-year-old Key-yon
loves trucks.

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:35.728
Older brother Izayah
is four years old

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:39.131
and excited about going
to kindergarten next year.

00:16:39.131 --> 00:16:42.328
Six-week-old Christian
is the new family member.

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:45.137
Like all loving parents,

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.073
Christine and her partner,
Tracy, work hard

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:51.276
to provide the safe, stable
and nurturing environment

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:55.047
that all children
need to strive.

00:16:55.047 --> 00:16:56.048
No car coming!

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:56.913
You sure?

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.818
Narrator:
It isn't easy.

00:16:59.818 --> 00:17:03.789
Christine recalls what happened
after one family outing.

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.958
Christine:
It's like, within a blink

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:09.728
of an eye, all you heard was
pow, pow, pow, pow...

00:17:09.728 --> 00:17:11.924
and it was like,
extremely close.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.100
Narrator:
Four-year-old Izayah

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.969
was with her at the time.

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:18.070
Christine:
I grabbed him

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:23.275
but I actually hid him
and I used myself to cover him.

00:17:23.275 --> 00:17:27.913
So I did everything in my power
to keep his eyes away from it,

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:30.816
to keep him away from it,
to cover his ears,

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:32.147
everything to just try

00:17:32.251 --> 00:17:35.020
and take some of that fear
away from him,

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.286
because instantly
he just tensed up.

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:42.594
When we finally got into the
home and everything was over

00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:45.764
and everything was done with,
he was really scared,

00:17:45.764 --> 00:17:47.061
he didn't want anybody
to touch him.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.935
Narrator:
After the incident,

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:54.673
Christine went to 11th Street
Family Health Services for help.

00:17:54.673 --> 00:17:57.476
It's her North Philadelphia
health center,

00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:00.172
serving a sometimes
dangerous neighborhood.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.182
We gotta go...

00:18:03.182 --> 00:18:04.316
Narrator:
At Eleventh Street,

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:07.019
social worker
Aisha Coul son-Walters

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:10.682
was able to provide Christine
with counseling and support.

00:18:12.891 --> 00:18:17.062
Aisha could also see the
incident had affected Izayah.

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:18.330
Aisha:
He was crying,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.865
he would get, like, angry.
He just seemed fearful.

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:21.733
he would get, like, angry.
He just seemed fearful.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:24.670
Like, he would jump;
he would, you know,

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:28.902
have moments of hesitation, and
just look like he was afraid.

00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:32.010
Narrator:
But how many of our children

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.206
grow up facing
similar stressors?

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:40.352
On the same side of town,
Dr. Dan Taylor recounts a study

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:44.389
of seven-year-old children
exposed to street violence.

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:46.758
He practices at St.
Christopher's Hospital

00:18:46.758 --> 00:18:49.161
for Children, serving
residents in this

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.830
North Philadelphia neighborhood.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.433
Taylor:
75% of those seven-year-olds

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.668
heard gunshots
in this neighborhood.

00:18:56.668 --> 00:19:00.205
61% of those kids,
seven-year-olds, were worried

00:19:00.205 --> 00:19:03.008
that they would get shot
and killed themselves...

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:06.111
An incredible 10% of kids

00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:08.947
in this neighborhood
saw a dead body,

00:19:08.947 --> 00:19:11.850
someone being shot, or stabbed.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:14.453
Some people talk about
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.688
but unfortunately, in a lot
of these families,

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:18.090
there is no "post."

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.092
It's continuous.
It's always there.

00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:22.761
It's on the street.
It's in the home.

00:19:22.761 --> 00:19:25.230
We have a lot of mothers
who don't let their children

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:28.100
ever outside,
because of the stress

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.735
and the potential
danger outside.

00:19:29.735 --> 00:19:31.403
We have some moms
who even say,

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:33.472
"I let my kid play
on the block."

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:34.973
And then we say,
"Up and down the block?"

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:36.839
And she says, "No,
just on the block

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:38.877
"of cement in front of my house.

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.878
I don't let him go
anywhere else."

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:46.916
Look! This! This!

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.221
Christine:
I wanted to just do whatever

00:19:49.221 --> 00:19:51.590
necessary to make sure
that this isn't the life

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.892
that my kids think is normal...

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:55.394
Come on,
give me your hand.

00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:57.930
Christine:
...because it's not.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.956
Because it's far
from normal to me.

00:20:03.135 --> 00:20:04.736
Narrator:
Today Christine has come

00:20:04.736 --> 00:20:06.972
to Eleventh Street Family
Health Services

00:20:06.972 --> 00:20:08.940
for baby Christian's
six-week check-up.

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:13.812
Oh, he's so gorgeous...

00:20:13.812 --> 00:20:15.247
Narrator:
Eleventh Street was developed

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:18.444
with the community, as a
community partnership

00:20:18.517 --> 00:20:21.086
to provide a wide range
of services.

00:20:21.086 --> 00:20:24.189
Everything from pre-natal care
and dentistry

00:20:24.189 --> 00:20:29.027
to counseling, art therapy,
and even urban farming.

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:30.963
You can't see something this
scrumptious

00:20:30.963 --> 00:20:32.157
and just let him sit...

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:36.969
Hey, why you picking
that baby up?

00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:39.137
This is your baby?

00:20:39.137 --> 00:20:43.342
Yes! I don't want you
pick that baby up!

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.277
Aisha:
Izayah has become

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:47.879
very protective
of his middle brother

00:20:47.879 --> 00:20:49.648
as well as his younger brother

00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:51.316
and you know,
wanted to make sure

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:54.653
everybody who was interacting
kind of knew,

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:57.145
like, "Listen.
I'm their bodyguard."

00:20:58.557 --> 00:21:00.423
It was really cute
to see, like,

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:03.328
a big brother express
himself like that

00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:06.331
but at the same time,
maybe the protectiveness

00:21:06.331 --> 00:21:08.834
that he's displaying
is the result

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:11.003
of what he has experienced

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:14.461
in that traumatic event
that he was exposed to.

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.844
Narrator:
The stressors many children face

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:21.880
day to day in
neglected communities

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.180
like North Philadelphia
can be relentless.

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:35.855
(sirens)

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:38.664
Man:
We can really manage

00:21:38.664 --> 00:21:40.198
a lot of stressors.

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:43.201
If we are crossing the street
and we see that a truck

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:44.703
is coming at us...

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:47.939
(truck horn)

00:21:47.939 --> 00:21:50.409
...we can manage
that situation,

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:54.046
get scared, jump,
and move quickly.

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:57.683
Unfortunately, many children
in our society

00:21:57.683 --> 00:22:01.920
feel like a truck is coming
at them all daylong,

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.221
for more days than not,
and this really takes a toll.

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:11.930
Narrator:
We know from anew body

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.134
of research that exposure to
chronic stress early in life

00:22:16.134 --> 00:22:21.606
can lead to actual changes
in brain architecture.

00:22:21.606 --> 00:22:22.974
Bloom:
A child's development

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:25.777
is affected by chronic stress.

00:22:25.777 --> 00:22:28.313
The impact of the chemicals that

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:31.083
are released as a
result of stress,

00:22:31.083 --> 00:22:34.753
that kind of unrelenting
drip-drip-drip

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:39.458
that affects, then, the way
the brain develops.

00:22:39.458 --> 00:22:42.894
So language functions,
the ability to think clearly,

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:45.997
the ability to focus,
to organize thoughts-

00:22:45.997 --> 00:22:50.958
allot that is being laid down
in very early childhood.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.240
When a child is exposed
to toxic stress

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.800
then the brain is not connecting
the way it should.

00:22:59.344 --> 00:23:01.747
Narrator:
Especially toxic for children

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:05.547
can be exposure to conflict
or violence in the home.

00:23:05.617 --> 00:23:06.277
Woman:
I remember having

00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:09.521
a little two-ish,
three-ish year-old child

00:23:09.521 --> 00:23:11.523
who was hitting
their baby doll.

00:23:11.523 --> 00:23:14.426
Well, they didn't make that up.

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:16.928
Even if they weren't
in the room

00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:18.864
when the domestic
violence occurred

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:20.799
or when the physical
violence occurred,

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:23.928
they still feel those effects
very, very deeply.

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.705
Bloom:
They are perceiving the world

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:32.110
as dangerous all the time and
defending against those feelings

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.945
by becoming aggressive.

00:23:33.945 --> 00:23:36.948
They may have the history
of what happened,

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:39.618
they may have feelings
about what happened -

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:41.219
fear, sadness, anger.

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:43.155
They may have no words
for these feelings,

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:45.021
and then they have
these behaviors.

00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:50.061
But they really do not
connect all of them.

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.564
They don't know that
because this happened,

00:23:52.564 --> 00:23:56.835
I developed these feelings,
that make me behave this way.

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:59.404
It's not mine!

00:23:59.404 --> 00:24:00.572
Narrator:
And for many of us

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:03.803
who serve children, we don't
make those connections either.

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:11.216
A 2005 study reported
the number of children

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:14.653
expelled from preschool
for behavioral problems

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:18.851
at three times the expulsion
rate for K to 12 students.

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:25.897
In 2012, in Connecticut alone,
2,000 children

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:27.432
years and under-

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:29.867
overwhelmingly black
and Latino-

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:33.572
were suspended from
kindergarten and preschool,

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:35.540
dramatically increasing
their risk of

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.636
dropping out later and
being sent to prison.

00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:45.951
Instead of labeling them as
bad kids, why don't we see them

00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:49.216
as children facing adversities
that other children don't?

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:53.959
Why are we re-traumatizing
young people

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:55.927
who are already
traumatized?

00:24:56.728 --> 00:24:59.731
Bloom:
We've become so blaming

00:24:59.731 --> 00:25:02.968
that whenever somebody strays,

00:25:02.968 --> 00:25:05.027
it's their fault and
they should be punished.

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:10.603
Narrator:
In the mid-90's,

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:13.278
doctors Vincent Felitti
and Robert Anda

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:15.647
published groundbreaking
research,

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:18.383
assessing the links
between childhood adversity

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:20.408
and adult health
and well-being.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.257
In the original Adverse
Childhood Experiences Study,

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.992
known as the ACE Study,

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:31.463
17,000 mostly white,
mostly middle class adults

00:25:31.463 --> 00:25:34.956
were asked about ten different
types of childhood adversity.

00:25:36.935 --> 00:25:38.470
When you were a child,

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:40.605
were you physically or
psychologically

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:42.407
abused by parents?

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:45.744
Did you live with someone
who abused drugs?

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:47.012
Were you neglected?

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:51.016
Was there domestic violence?
Did anyone go to prison?

00:25:51.016 --> 00:25:53.576
Was someone in your home
mentally ill?

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:57.956
Respondents were assigned
one ACE for each

00:25:57.956 --> 00:26:01.459
of the ten types
of adversity experienced.

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:04.296
Surprisingly, more than
one in five

00:26:04.296 --> 00:26:06.698
of this mostly middle
class population

00:26:06.698 --> 00:26:10.268
reported three or more ACEs.

00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:12.871
But even more eye-opening
was the correlation

00:26:12.871 --> 00:26:15.974
between childhood adversity
and adult mental

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:17.169
and physical health.

00:26:18.843 --> 00:26:20.612
Bloom:
The higher the ACE score,

00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:23.448
the more likely people were
to suffer from things like

00:26:23.448 --> 00:26:25.984
heart disease, liver disease,

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:32.057
lung disease,
depression, suicide,

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:35.727
I-V drug abuse
and alcoholism.

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:40.365
What it said was, we've got
a common causality

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:45.136
for allot our major health
and social problems,

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:48.673
and it was all related to
what had happened to them

00:26:48.673 --> 00:26:50.300
as children.

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:53.979
Narrator:
But researchers

00:26:53.979 --> 00:26:57.649
like Dr. Roy Wade could see
the ACE Study didn't take

00:26:57.649 --> 00:27:01.219
into account economic
distress, let alone hunger,

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:03.888
housing insecurity,
and other hardships

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:06.057
in low-income
neighborhoods.

00:27:06.057 --> 00:27:07.759
Wade:
When I came to Philadelphia,

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:10.829
and I saw the huge
amount of blight,

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.664
the community violence,

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:16.362
the episodes of racism
and discrimination-

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:18.300
those are stressors, too.

00:27:19.571 --> 00:27:21.439
Narrator:
When Philadelphia researchers

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:25.276
expanded the ACE survey
to add questions about racism,

00:27:25.276 --> 00:27:28.947
neighborhood safety and
violence outside the home,

00:27:28.947 --> 00:27:33.051
they discovered that while 14%
of the general population

00:27:33.051 --> 00:27:35.120
reported four or more ACES,

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.426
in Philadelphia that number
was a startling 37%.

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:43.061
Wade:
Poverty is an adverse childhood

00:27:43.061 --> 00:27:46.464
experience that gets
under your skin.

00:27:46.464 --> 00:27:50.235
Living in economic distress
can actually translate

00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:53.571
into long-term negative
health outcomes

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:56.268
even for the most
resilient individuals.

00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.048
Narrator:
Across the country,

00:28:03.048 --> 00:28:06.251
physicians, therapists,
teachers-

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:09.587
and even some police
departments and prosecutors

00:28:09.587 --> 00:28:12.223
are recognizing how
acknowledging trauma

00:28:12.223 --> 00:28:17.059
as a form of injury
opens up the path... to healing.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:19.964
Corbin:
Trauma-informed care

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:23.935
is extremely important
because it gives a perspective

00:28:23.935 --> 00:28:28.640
on how children and families
live in environments.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.743
And also recognizes
what happened to them

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:32.844
and what
they're going through.

00:28:32.844 --> 00:28:35.914
They may have been
profoundly affected in ways

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:37.849
that helped to explain

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:41.808
a lot of what the person
is struggling with today.

00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:48.093
Well, as you guys know me, I've
been through a lot of violence.

00:28:48.093 --> 00:28:52.291
I could have been dead
when I was 16 years old.

00:28:53.498 --> 00:28:56.000
Narrator:
Javier Arango is 24 years old

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.003
and a counselor at Catholic
Charities of the East Bay

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:01.005
in Oakland.

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:05.844
Before that, he was he was
a gang leader of the 9400 Boys.

00:29:05.844 --> 00:29:08.972
He was shot and paralyzed
when he was 17.

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:13.151
Rich:
Feeling unsafe, they may

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:17.555
take actions like getting
weapons or even joining gangs

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.224
that put them at risk

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:21.852
for greater injury
in the future.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.461
Everybody that is
around me...

00:29:23.461 --> 00:29:25.997
Narrator:
Now Javier counsels young people

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:28.633
as part of a
trauma-informed approach

00:29:28.633 --> 00:29:31.970
at the heart of the work
of Catholic Charities.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:33.872
They provide
not only counseling

00:29:33.872 --> 00:29:35.573
and therapy initiatives,

00:29:35.573 --> 00:29:38.009
but also Restorative
Justice programs

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:41.880
for schools, housing for at-risk
youth, and assistance

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.983
for refugees and immigrants,

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:48.353
recognizing how violence
and social inequality

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:49.820
affect young people.

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:55.260
This morning in the check-in
circle, the staff considers

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.762
some of the challenges
faced by the young people

00:29:57.762 --> 00:30:00.031
and families they support.

00:30:00.031 --> 00:30:00.999
Javier:
My little sister, ever since

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:04.068
she was 8, she already know
when you hear pow-pow-pow,

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:08.873
she knows...
On the floor.

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:11.042
My kids moved the beds
away from the windows.

00:30:11.042 --> 00:30:12.032
Yeah.

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:13.945
Millie:
I'd never seen kids

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.880
talk about how they
wanted their funeral.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.716
I'd never seen kids
go to a cemetery

00:30:18.716 --> 00:30:22.520
to visit 10,15 graves
of their friends.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.722
You know,
this is a new normality

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:28.523
where their mortality
is part of their identity.

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:31.596
If we don't acknowledge
the grief,

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:33.598
if we don't acknowledge
the trauma,

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.967
it's more normalization.

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:37.268
And amongst
the young people,

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:40.104
there's a real clear
underlying rage.

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:42.073
They have a real
clear sense

00:30:42.073 --> 00:30:45.176
that their lives are
supposed to be valued.

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.711
It shouldn't be this way,

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.947
because we're the most
richest, wealthiest country

00:30:48.947 --> 00:30:52.250
that ever existed and
this stuff's happening here?

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.885
One young man said,

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:56.321
"I was worried about
getting killed this summer."

00:30:56.321 --> 00:30:57.922
We went around,
we found out that

00:30:57.922 --> 00:31:00.225
that was at the core
of everybody's concern.

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:02.727
One of these summers
is going be the one

00:31:02.727 --> 00:31:05.663
where everybody's got
my name R.I.P.

00:31:05.663 --> 00:31:08.132
And, that struck me,

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:12.804
this sense of inevitability
of violence.

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:13.938
Aarif:
Children would show up

00:31:13.938 --> 00:31:16.074
the first day of school and
our expectation would be

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:19.310
for them to come in prepared
to learn, ready to work,

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:21.679
and we didn't know
how many bodies

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.081
they had stepped over,
over the summer.

00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:24.947
We didn't how many
loved ones they had lost.

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:30.989
Narrator:
Javier has become a friend

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:34.993
and mentor to Kenny Ray
Johnson, who was 14 years old

00:31:34.993 --> 00:31:37.862
when he was shot
two years ago.

00:31:37.862 --> 00:31:38.920
Throw over here.
I'm gonna1 punch it...

00:31:41.866 --> 00:31:44.202
Kenny Ray:
It happened so fast.

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:46.838
I got shot, ten shots.

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:49.607
I felt like I was in the movie,
and I was just thinking

00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:51.142
to myself when that happened,

00:31:51.142 --> 00:31:53.011
this can't be
happening right now

00:31:53.011 --> 00:31:55.810
because I have so much
stuff ahead of me.

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:59.684
Nobody can never wear that
number again at that school.

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.990
Kenny Ray has never been
involved in gangs.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:09.620
Always been a pretty
good student, athlete.

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:12.330
Narrator:
Kenny's injuries left him

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:16.234
wheelchair-bound, learning
to stand with crutches.

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:18.970
The shooting had
a devastating psychological

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:21.973
as well as financial impact
on the family.

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:23.708
Mother:
Me and Dad stayed

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:25.810
at the hospital day and night,

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.545
and I couldn't keep
taking off work.

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:30.648
I didn't have no seniority.
I had to stop working.

00:32:30.648 --> 00:32:32.016
So that shattered us.

00:32:32.016 --> 00:32:36.754
We had to basically start
over from scratch.

00:32:36.754 --> 00:32:38.056
So, we couldn't go back there.

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:39.424
It just wasn't the same
to go back there.

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.159
It wasn't home, no more.

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.728
I didn't even want to come
down to West Oakland.

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:47.065
I hated even going around
the corner where he got shot at.

00:32:47.065 --> 00:32:51.536
Also, where Keshad's
classroom was at,

00:32:51.536 --> 00:32:52.870
he could look
out the window

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:53.894
and see where his brother
got shot at.

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.943
Narrator:
Catholic Charities stepped in

00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:01.379
to help solve housing
and financial problems

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:04.007
that threatened to
overwhelm the family.

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:07.852
And they sent counselors,
including Javier.

00:33:10.955 --> 00:33:11.856
Javier:
These new guys

00:33:11.856 --> 00:33:14.092
being put into wheelchairs,

00:33:14.092 --> 00:33:16.094
giving them that
little sense of hope,

00:33:16.094 --> 00:33:17.962
that there is a life
to continue,

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:22.934
that gives me more hope,
for me myself

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:25.562
to continue doing
what I'm doing.

00:33:28.072 --> 00:33:29.374
Bloom:
Trauma-informed care

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:32.502
begins with,
how do you make people safe?

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:39.817
How do you create
safe zones in schools

00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:42.253
and in playgrounds
and in communities

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:44.278
for kids to just be kids?

00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:50.228
Narrator:
That's the approach

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.997
that inspires Harold Reed
and the staff

00:33:52.997 --> 00:33:55.500
of the Boys and Girls Club
at Wilson Park,

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.933
in South Philadelphia.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.972
Reed:
Wilson Park, there's an element

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:03.908
of tension that you can
pretty much cut.

00:34:03.908 --> 00:34:06.644
And it plays a big role
on the development

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:09.204
of some of the young people
in this community.

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:15.319
So you can't be judgmental.

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.455
They need help,
you help them.

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:20.720
If somebody is cut,
you fix the cut.

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:28.599
The Boys and Girls Club
of Wilson Park

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:31.831
is a refreshing glass of water
for some of these young people.

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:35.873
Narrator:
Reed and his staff

00:34:35.873 --> 00:34:39.277
provide a safe
and supportive place

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:41.979
with tutoring, sports,
counseling,

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:43.948
and other activities.

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:48.319
Wade:
Oftentimes folks like me

00:34:48.319 --> 00:34:51.189
come in, and we come in
as the authorities saying,

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:52.490
"This is what
you have to do."

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:57.695
And we don't tap into
the leadership and the talent

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.897
that's in the community.

00:34:59.897 --> 00:35:01.632
Individuals like Harold,

00:35:01.632 --> 00:35:03.568
who are leaders
within the community

00:35:03.568 --> 00:35:08.306
who have the respect
and the skills to navigate

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:10.638
some of the challenges
within the communities.

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.411
Reed:
Philadelphia is known

00:35:13.411 --> 00:35:16.881
to be the capital
of high school drop-outs.

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.816
In our community,
when we first got here,

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:21.652
a lot of people didn't
finish high school.

00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:23.054
It's very frustrating to know

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:26.724
that they're building
a $400 million prison

00:35:26.724 --> 00:35:29.827
when the schools
are suffering.

00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:33.320
Programs, social programs
for young people are suffering.

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:38.102
And I'm proud of the fact
that my young people

00:35:38.102 --> 00:35:43.074
are graduating middle school,
graduating high school...

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:45.804
and thinking about
going to college...

00:35:54.852 --> 00:35:55.853
Caheri:
It's been five years

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:57.588
since the incident.

00:35:57.588 --> 00:36:02.860
I've had extensive therapy
and I thought I overcame.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.365
But I've realized that
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:11.700
traumatic experiences-
it's a lifelong thing.

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.039
Narrator:
Extensive therapy

00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:16.768
through the help
of Youth Alive!

00:36:16.874 --> 00:36:19.110
intervention specialist
Tammy Cloud

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.811
brought Caheri
to the place

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:23.948
where she could use
the experience of her ordeal

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:26.484
to reach out to other
young people in Oakland.

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:30.154
What they did to me was
hella detrimental...

00:36:30.154 --> 00:36:31.889
Narrator:
It's one of the many things

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:34.158
Caheri does for the teens
she counsels.

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:35.993
Caheri:

00:36:35.993 --> 00:36:37.828
with my kids,

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:40.932
"Check it out,
we're in the same boat.

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:41.999
"I've been there.

00:36:41.999 --> 00:36:44.168
"I know what
you're going through.

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:45.295
Let me help you out."

00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:48.973
A lot of us kids
who go through this

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:51.943
don't know that there
are resources out there,

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:53.444
and a lot of parents
don't know

00:36:53.444 --> 00:36:57.248
that when something so traumatic
like this happens to your child,

00:36:57.248 --> 00:37:00.616
you need to connect them
with resources.

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:04.989
Narrator:
At Eleventh Street

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:07.491
Family Health Services
in North Philadelphia,

00:37:07.491 --> 00:37:09.927
no matter who patients
speak with,

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:13.598
they will be asked questions
about their day-to-day lives

00:37:13.598 --> 00:37:18.302
that help identify
distress and adversity.

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:21.872
Christine Henry found vital
support here for her family

00:37:21.872 --> 00:37:22.999
in difficult times.

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:26.010
Things are better now.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.713
She's moved to
a different neighborhood

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:31.882
and has a new job
at a department store.

00:37:31.882 --> 00:37:35.114
But Eleventh Street is still
her family health center.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.889
...by how fast you move.

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:40.057
Gotta move quick!

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:40.922
I'm telling you!

00:37:42.526 --> 00:37:44.328
You trying to stretch out?

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:45.921
Put this over it...

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:47.365
Gotta happen...

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:48.633
how many rooms?

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:49.834
Two.

00:37:49.834 --> 00:37:51.402
Aisha:
The families who come

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:53.404
through Eleventh Street

00:37:53.404 --> 00:37:56.841
want more than the best
for their child.

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:59.674
They want things to change.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.052
Narrator:
Healing the hurt of young people

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:12.223
begins with asking not,
"What's wrong with you?"

00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:13.952
but, "What happened to you?"

00:38:15.493 --> 00:38:19.096
It also means confronting
the racial segregation,

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:23.363
disinvestment and lack of jobs
and decent, safe housing,

00:38:23.434 --> 00:38:26.504
which generate suffering
rather than hope

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:29.667
for so many American
children and families.

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.545
Simmons:
We've all heard the adage

00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:36.247
that "Hurt people hurt people."

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:37.680
And it's true.

00:38:38.849 --> 00:38:42.019
Violence is not the problem.

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.919
It's the symptom
of the problem.

00:38:44.955 --> 00:38:49.060
The people with the greatest
need have the least resource.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.594
Have the least
skilled teachers.

00:38:50.594 --> 00:38:53.130
The least outdoor space.
The least music.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.965
The least recreation.
The least art.

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:57.868
The least of all of it, when
they have the greatest need.

00:38:57.868 --> 00:39:00.269
And they know that other
people have it and they don't.

00:39:05.042 --> 00:39:08.546
We can't have whole
communities of people

00:39:08.546 --> 00:39:11.582
locked out of
economic opportunity,

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:16.153
undereducated, under-
and unemployed,

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:21.492
and believe that we can
continue to thrive,

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:24.723
because it's just not possible.

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:31.102
Bloom:
It's time for all Americans

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:35.272
to recognize that we're
suffocating the abilities

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:37.002
of millions of children.

00:39:39.443 --> 00:39:44.949
We won't really endorse
real family values,

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:48.078
which mean you
take care of families...

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:51.217
What's... this one?

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:53.023
Ten!

00:39:53.023 --> 00:42:27.946
Yeah!
