00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:03.030


2
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.430
To sing a song that old was sung,

3
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.500
From ashes ancient Gower is come;

4
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Assuming man's infirmities,

5
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.430
To glad your ear, and please your eyes.

6
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.430
It hath been sung at festivals,

7
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.730
On ember-eves and holy days;

8
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.130
And lords and ladies in their lives

9
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.100
Have read it for restoratives:

10
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.630
The purchase is to make men glorious;

11
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.070
Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.

12
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.700
If you, born in these latter times,

13
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.530
When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.

14
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.400
And that to hear an old man sing

15
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.970
May to your wishes pleasure bring

16
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.770
I life would wish, and that I might

17
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.670
Waste it for you, like taper-light.

18
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.870
This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great

19
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.030
Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:

20
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.470
The fairest in all Syria,

21
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.000
I tell you what mine authors say:

22
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.500
This king unto him took a fere,

23
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.730
Who died and left a female heir,

24
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.830
So buxom, blithe, and full of face,

25
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.900
As heaven had lent her all his grace;

26
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.930
With whom the father liking took,

27
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.830
And her to incest did provoke:

28
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.370
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own

29
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.600
To evil should be done by none:

30
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.170
But custom what they did begin

31
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.170
Was with long use account no sin.

32
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.730
The beauty of this sinful dame

33
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.670
Made many princes thither frame,

34
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.200
To seek her as a bed-fellow,

35
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.470
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:

36
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.230
Which to prevent he made a law,

37
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.370
To keep her still, and men in awe,

38
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.300
That whoso ask'd her for his wife,

39
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.100
His riddle told not, lost his life:

40
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.170
So for her many a wight did die,

41
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.370
As yon grim looks do testify.

42
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.670
What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye

43
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.330
I give, my cause who best can justify.

44
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.430
Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received

45
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.170
The danger of the task you undertake.

46
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.000
I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul

47
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.230
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,

48
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.970
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.

49
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.630
Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,

50
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.270
For the embracements even of Jove himself;

51
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.030
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,

52
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.600
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,

53
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.600
The senate-house of planets all did sit,

54
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.800
To knit in her their best perfections.

55
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.670
(â™ª Music)

56
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.430
See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,

57
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.230
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king

58
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.130
Of every virtue gives renown to men!

59
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.900
Her face the book of praises, where is read

60
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.600
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence

61
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.630
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath

62
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.300
Could never be her mild companion.

63
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.470
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,

64
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.070
That have inflamed desire in my breast

65
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.170
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,

66
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.030
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,

67
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.970
As I am son and servant to your will,

68
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.070
To compass such a boundless happiness!

69
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.930
Prince Pericles,--

70
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.200
That would be son to great Antiochus.

71
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.230
Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,

72
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.400
With golden fruit, yet dangerous to be touch'd;

73
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:20.430
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:

74
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.300
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view

75
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.570
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;

76
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.700
And which, without desert, because thine eye

77
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.370
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.

78
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.330
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,

79
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.770
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,

80
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.470
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,

81
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.670
That without covering, save yon field of stars,

82
00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:00.170
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;

83
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.870
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist

84
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.670
For going on death's net, whom none resist.

85
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.800
Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught

86
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.930
My frail mortality to know itself,

87
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.570
And by those fearful objects to prepare

88
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.270
This body, like to them, to what I must;

89
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.870
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,

90
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.630
Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.

91
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.570
I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do

92
00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.830
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,

93
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.830
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;

94
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.600
So I bequeath a happy peace to you

95
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.200
And all good men, as every prince should do;

96
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.500
My riches to the earth from whence they came;

97
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.400
But my unspotted fire of love to you.

98
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.170
Thus ready for the way of life or death,

99
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.970
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.

100
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:07.900
Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:

101
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:15.300
Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,

102
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:20.130
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.

103
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.570
Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!

104
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.700
Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!

105
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.930
Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,

106
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.830
Nor ask advice of any other thought

107
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.430
But faithfulness and courage.

108
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.730
I am no viper, yet I feed

109
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:56.100
On mother's flesh which did me breed.

110
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:57.870
I sought a husband, in which labour

111
00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:02.600
I found that kindness in a father:

112
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.400
He's father, son, and husband mild;

113
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.130
I mother, wife, and yet his child.

114
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.500
How they may be, and yet in two,

115
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.230
As you will live, resolve it you.

116
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:24.030
Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers

117
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:28.630
That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,

118
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.830
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,

119
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.900
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?

120
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:53.730
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,

121
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.230
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:

122
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.070
But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt

123
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.000
For he's no man on whom perfections wait

124
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.170
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.

125
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.230
You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;

126
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.400
Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,

127
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.070
Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:

128
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.770
But being play'd upon before your time,

129
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:27.130
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.

130
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:33.030
Good sooth, I care not for you.

131
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:35.800
Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.

132
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.200
For that's an article within our law,

133
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.530
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:

134
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.930
Either expound now, or receive your sentence.

135
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.830
Great king,

136
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.730
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;

137
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.030
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.

138
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.570
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,

139
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.200
He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:

140
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.100
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.

141
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.970
Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;

142
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.070
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,

143
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.470
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:

144
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.100
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts

145
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.170
Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd

146
00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:25.770
By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.

147
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.630
Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's their will;

148
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.530
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?

149
00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.170
It is enough you know; and it is fit,

150
00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.530
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.

151
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.000
All love the womb that their first being bred,

152
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.030
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.

153
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.230
Would that I had thy head!

154
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.600
He has found the meaning:

155
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.230
But I will gloze with him.--

156
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.930
Young prince of Tyre,

157
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.100
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,

158
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.930
Your exposition misinterpreting,

159
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.230
We might proceed to cancel of your days;

160
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.300
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree

161
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:17.330
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:

162
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.900
Forty days longer we do respite you;

163
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.530
If by which time our secret be undone,

164
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.930
This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:

165
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.000
And until then your entertain shall be

166
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.170
As doth befit our honour and your worth.

167
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.330
How courtesy would seem to cover sin,

168
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.100
When what is done is like an hypocrite,

169
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.800
The which is good in nothing but in sight!

170
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800
If it be true that I interpret false,

171
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.570
Then were it certain you were not so bad

172
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:03.270
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;

173
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:09.230
Where now you're both a father and a son,

174
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.900
By your untimely claspings with your child,

175
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.930
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;

176
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.930
And she an eater of her mother's flesh,

177
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.970
By the defiling of her parent's bed;

178
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.170
And both like serpents are, who though they feed

179
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:34.200
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.

180
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:40.000
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men

181
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.100
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,

182
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:45.100
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.

183
00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.070
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;

184
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.170
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:

185
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.900
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,

186
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.130
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:

187
00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.500
Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,

188
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.370
By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.

189
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.270
He hath found the meaning, for which I mean

190
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.200
To have his head.

191
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.400
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,

192
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.970
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin

193
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.630
In such a loathed manner;

194
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.170
And therefore instantly this prince must die:

195
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:34.300
For by his fall my honour must keep high.

196
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.400
Who attends us there?

197
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.070
Doth your highness call?

198
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.230
Thaliard,

199
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.070
You are of our chamber Thaliard, and our mind partakes

200
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.670
Her private actions to your secrecy;

201
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.570
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.

202
00:13:53.570 --> 00:14:02.230
Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;

203
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.430
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:

204
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:07.900
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,

205
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.630
Because we bid it. Say, is it done?

206
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.170
My lord,

207
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.770
'Tis done.

208
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.730
Enough.

209
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.070
Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.

210
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.530
My lord, prince Pericles is fled.

211
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.070
As thou wilt live, fly after:

212
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.070
and like an arrow shot

213
00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.700
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark

214
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.570
His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return

215
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.770
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'

216
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:39.970
My lord,

217
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.500
If I can get him within my pistol's length,

218
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.270
I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.

219
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:51.300
Thaliard, adieu!

220
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.900
Till Pericles be dead,

221
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.370
My heart can lend no succor to my head.

222
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:09.870
(â™ª music)

223
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.870
Let none disturb us.--

224
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:36.230
Why should this change of thoughts,

225
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.670
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,

226
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.930
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,

227
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.830
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,

228
00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:53.230
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?

229
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:59.470
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,

230
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.570
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,

231
00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.230
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:

232
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.800
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,

233
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.070
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.

234
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:19.100
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,

235
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.470
That have their first conception by mis-dread,

236
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.370
Have after-nourishment and life by care;

237
00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.970
And what was first but fear what might be done,

238
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.930
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.

239
00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:35.800
And so with me: the great Antiochus,

240
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.700
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,

241
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.630
Since he's so great can make his will his act,

242
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.970
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;

243
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.130
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.

244
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:50.530
If he suspect I may dishonour him:

245
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.370
And what may make him blush in being known,

246
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.300
He'll stop the course by which it might be known;

247
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:00.770
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,

248
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.770
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,

249
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.930
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;

250
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.470
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,

251
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:14.800
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:

252
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.030
Which care of them, not pity of myself,

253
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.900
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,

254
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.570
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,

255
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:33.430
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,

256
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:38.430
And punish that before that he would punish.

257
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.600
Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!

258
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.570
And keep your mind, Peaceful and comfortable!

259
00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.200
Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.

260
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.030
They do abuse the king that flatter him:

261
00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.370
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;

262
00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.170
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,

263
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.030
Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.

264
00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.130
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,

265
00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:08.100
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.

266
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.700
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;

267
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.630
I cannot be much lower than my knees.

268
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.600
All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook

269
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.430
What shipping and what lading's in our haven,

270
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:21.100
And then return to us.

271
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.370
Helicanus, thou Hast moved us:

272
00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:25.670
what seest thou in our looks?

273
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.170
An angry brow, dread lord.

274
00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.070
If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,

275
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.270
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?

276
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.400
How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence

277
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:34.070
They have their nourishment?

278
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.800
Thou know'st I have power

279
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.930
To take thy life from thee.

280
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:37.400
I have ground the axe myself;

281
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:44.370
Do you but strike the blow.

282
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.470
Rise, prithee, rise.

283
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.500
Sit down: thou art no flatterer:

284
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.330
I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid

285
00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:00.230
That kings should let their ears hear their faults hid!

286
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.030
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,

287
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:08.030
Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,

288
00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.770
What wouldst thou have me do?

289
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.170
To bear with patience

290
00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:14.370
Such griefs as you do lay upon yourself.

291
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.030
Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,

292
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.230
That minister'st a potion unto me

293
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.400
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.

294
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:29.030
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,

295
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.530
Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,

296
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.600
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.

297
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.030
From whence an issue I might propagate,

298
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:40.130
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.

299
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:47.600
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;

300
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:57.630
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:

301
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:05.100
The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:

302
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.630
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father

303
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.370
Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou know'st this,

304
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:14.170
'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.

305
00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:15.430
Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,

306
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:17.130
Under the covering of a careful night,

307
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.600
Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,

308
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:25.530
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.

309
00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.770
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears

310
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.470
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:

311
00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.930
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,

312
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.030
That I should open to the listening air

313
00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:39.170
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,

314
00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.130
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,

315
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:46.270
To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,

316
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.470
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:

317
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:54.370
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,

318
00:20:54.370 --> 00:21:01.730
Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:

319
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.970
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,

320
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.430
Who now reprovest me for it,--

321
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.530
Alas, sir!

322
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.800
Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,

323
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.300
Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts

324
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.400
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;

325
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.170
And finding little comfort to relieve them,

326
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.200
I thought it princely charity to grieve for them.

327
00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:31.000
Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.

328
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.570
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,

329
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.470
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,

330
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.370
Who either by public war or private treason

331
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.070
Will take away your life.

332
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.370
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,

333
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.900
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,

334
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.670
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.

335
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:59.770
Your rule direct to any; if to me.

336
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.100
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.

337
00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.100
I do not doubt thy faith;

338
00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.430
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?

339
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.730
We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,

340
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:16.830
From whence we had our being and our birth.

341
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:27.400
Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus

342
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.870
Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;

343
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:33.670
And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.

344
00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:35.770
The care I had and have of subjects' good

345
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.530
On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.

346
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.000
I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:

347
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.330
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:

348
00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.330
But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,

349
00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.670
That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,

350
00:22:54.670 --> 00:23:01.830
Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.

351
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:19.600
(â™ª music)

352
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:36.100
So, this is Tyre, and this the court.

353
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.900
Here must I kill  King Pericles;

354
00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:58.330
and if I do it not, I am sure to be hanged at home:

355
00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:04.700
'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive

356
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.970
he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,

357
00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.670
being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired

358
00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:17.070
he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he

359
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.300
had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a

360
00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.070
villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to

361
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.500
be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.

362
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.300
You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,

363
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.730
Further to question me of your king's departure:

364
00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.400
His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,

365
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:43.330
Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.

366
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:44.800
How! the king gone!

367
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.500
If further yet you will be satisfied,

368
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.800
Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,

369
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.030
He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.

370
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:56.000
Being at Antioch--

371
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.230
What from Antioch?

372
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.070
Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--

373
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:04.100
Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:

374
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.770
And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,

375
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.870
To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;

376
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.500
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,

377
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.600
With whom each minute threatens life or death.

378
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.700
Well, I perceive

379
00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.270
I shall not be hang'd now,

380
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:23.930
But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:

381
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.130
He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.

382
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:34.300
I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!

383
00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.830
Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.

384
00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:38.670
From him I come

385
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.030
With message unto princely Pericles;

386
00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:44.530
But since my landing I have understood

387
00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:49.870
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,

388
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.600
My message must return from whence it came.

389
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.800
We have no reason to desire it,

390
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.930
Commended to our master, not to us:

391
00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.870
Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,

392
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:06.570
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.

393
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:17.300
(â™ª music)

394
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.300
My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,

395
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.800
And by relating tales of others' griefs,

396
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.570
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?

397
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.130
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;

398
00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.630
For who digs hills because they do aspire

399
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.830
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.

400
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:11.930
O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;

401
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.830
Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,

402
00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.670
But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.

403
00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.130
O Dionyza,

404
00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.100
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,

405
00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.000
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?

406
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.170
Our tongues and sorrows force us to sound deep

407
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:33.170
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,

408
00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:37.000
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;

409
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.600
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,

410
00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.270
They may awake their helps to comfort them.

411
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:53.730
I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,

412
00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:58.400
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

413
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.300
I'll do my best, sir.

414
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.830
This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,

415
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.300
A city on whom plenty held full hand,

416
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.470
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;

417
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:18.430
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,

418
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:21.230
And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;

419
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:25.000
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,

420
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.070
Like one another's glass to trim them by:

421
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.830
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,

422
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.700
And not so much to feed on as delight;

423
00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:39.870
All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,

424
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.170
The name of help grew odious to repeat.

425
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.470
O, 'tis too true.

426
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.300
But see what heaven can do! By this our change,

427
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.870
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,

428
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.030
Were all too little to content and please,

429
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.900
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,

430
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.670
As houses are defiled for want of use,

431
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.200
They are now starved for want of exercise:

432
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.630
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,

433
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.570
Must have inventions to delight the taste,

434
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.970
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:

435
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:14.930
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,

436
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.070
Thought nought too curious, are ready now

437
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:20.530
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.

438
00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.170
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife

439
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:27.130
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:

440
00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.470
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;

441
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.170
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall

442
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:38.270
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.

443
00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.970
Is not this true?

444
00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.470
Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.

445
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.500
O, let those cities that of plenty's cup

446
00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.070
And her prosperities so largely taste,

447
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:57.870
With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!

448
00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:02.400
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.

449
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.270
Where's the lord governor?

450
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:09.400
Here.

451
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.300
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,

452
00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.630
For comfort is too far for us to expect.

453
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.270
We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,

454
00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.030
A portly sail of ships make hitherward.

455
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.530
I thought as much.

456
00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:24.730
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,

457
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.970
That may succeed as his inheritor;

458
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:30.370
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,

459
00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.270
Taking advantage of our misery,

460
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.970
Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,

461
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.630
To beat us down, the which are down already;

462
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:46.800
And make a conquest of unhappy me,

463
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.100
That's the least fear; for, by the semblance

464
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.530
Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,

465
00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.800
And come to us as favourers, not as foes.

466
00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.230
Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:

467
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.030
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.

468
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.770
But bring they what they will and what they can,

469
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.170
What need we fear?

470
00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:12.300
The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.

471
00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.230
Go tell their general we attend him here,

472
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.500
To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,

473
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.730
And what he craves.

474
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.330
I go, my lord.

475
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:25.000
Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;

476
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.400
If wars, we are unable to resist.

477
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:35.800
(â™ª music)

478
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:40.530
Lord governor, for so we hear you are,

479
00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.570
Let not our ships and number of our men

480
00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:46.000
Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.

481
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.830
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,

482
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:53.900
And seen the desolation of your streets:

483
00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.300
Nor come we to add sorrow to your hearts,

484
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:59.300
But to relieve them of their heavy load;

485
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.130
And these our ships, you happily may think

486
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.470
Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within

487
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:06.470
With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,

488
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.970
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,

489
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:14.570
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.

490
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.800
The gods of Greece protect you!

491
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.700
And we'll pray for you.

492
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:32.930
Arise, I pray you, rise:

493
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.570
We do not look for reverence, but for love,

494
00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.130
And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.

495
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:48.170
The which when any shall not gratify,

496
00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.630
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,

497
00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:59.630
Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,

498
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:04.170
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!

499
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.370
Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--

500
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:13.500
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.

501
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.830
Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,

502
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:22.600
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

503
00:33:23.730 --> 00:33:27.970
(â™ª music)

504
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.500
