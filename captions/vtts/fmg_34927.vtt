WEBVTT

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
THE MORE THE MERRIER,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
BUT WHAT IF IT'S NOT
 JUST TWINS BUT TRIPLETS
 AND EVEN MORE?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
TODAY,
 THE FRUSTRATIONS...

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I FEEL SO SORRY
FOR YOUR HUSBAND.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
HE MUST BE SUCH
AN UNLUCKY MAN.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
...AND FASCINATIONS
 OF RAISING MULTIPLES.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
THE BEST PART IS HAVING
TWO BABIES TO LOVE.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
KALA, I JUST--
SHE'S LITTLER.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
DON'T KEEP PUSHING HIM
TO CATCH UP.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Narrator:
 BRAZELTON ON PARENTING.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
OF THE WONDERFUL ADVANCES
IN REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
TO HAVE BABIES

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
WHEN THEY OTHERWISE
COULDN'T CONCEIVE.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
HOWEVER, THE INCREASED USE
OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
IS RESULTING
IN AN INCREASE

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
IN THE RATE
OF MULTIPLE BIRTHS--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
TWINS, TRIPLETS,
AND EVEN MORE.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
THERE ARE LOTS OF UNIQUE
ISSUES A PARENT FACES
WITH MULTIPLES,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A LOOK AT SOME OF THEM,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
STARTING WITH A PORTRAIT
OF A CUTTING-EDGE
HOSPITAL UNIT

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
THAT SPECIALIZES IN CASES

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
WHERE THERE'S
MORE THAN ONE.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
WE'RE AT NORTH SHORE
 UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
 ON LONG ISLAND, NEW YORK,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
THE CENTER
 FOR MULTIPLE BIRTHS.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
HOW ARE WE DOING TODAY?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
DR. VICTOR KLEIN
 HEADS A NEONATAL
 INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
DEVOTED TO MULTIPLES.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
EVERY BIRTH IS A MIRACLE,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
AND MULTIPLE BIRTHS
ARE MULTIPLE MIRACLES.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Brazelton:
 CARING FOR MULTIPLES
 PRESENTS UNIQUE PROBLEMS.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
FIRST OF ALL, THEY ARE
 USUALLY BORN PRE-TERM

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
AND HAVE ALL THE USUAL
 PREEMIE ISSUES.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
BUT THE CHALLENGES
 OF MULTIPLES ARE MORE
 THAN JUST MEDICAL.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
AT FIRST I WAS
REALLY HAPPY ABOUT IT.
I WAS THRILLED.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
AND THEN YOU GO THROUGH
THAT PANIC A LITTLE BIT,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
LIKE,  WHAT AM I GONNA DO
 WITH THREE BABIES?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Brazelton:
 THAT'S WHY THE HOSPITAL HAS
 INSTITUTED A SPECIAL PROGRAM

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
THAT CONTINUES LONG AFTER
 THE FAMILY HAS LEFT THE NICU.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
IT'S CALLED
  MOTHERS OF SUPER TWINS,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
AND MAUREEN DOOLAN BOYLE

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
IS ITS
 EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT
FOR FAMILIES TO KNOW
THAT THEY ARE FAR FROM ALONE,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE
OUT THERE THAT REALLY
TRULY DO CARE ABOUT THEM

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
AND THAT ARE INTERESTED IN
HELPING THEM AND SUPPORTING THEM
IN ANY WAY THAT THEY CAN.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
IT'S FOR THE MOM
 TO HAVE AN OUTLET,
 FOR HER TO HAVE

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
A BIG-SISTER
 PROGRAM AVAILABLE

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
TO MAYBE BE ABLE
 TO GET TOGETHER
 WITH OTHER MOTHERS

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
WHO HAVE TRIPLETS OR MORE
 AROUND THE SAME AGE

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
SO THEY CAN DISCUSS
NOT JUST THE FRUSTRATIONS

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
BUT ALSO THE JOYS
AND THE CHALLENGES.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Brazelton:
 LIKE, HOW IN THE WORLD ARE YOU
 BREASTFEEDING MORE THAN ONE?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I WAS VERY INVESTED
IN NURSING THEM BECAUSE OF
ALL THE HEALTH BENEFITS--

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
PARTICULARLY FOR THEM.
I KNEW THAT THEY'D
BE SMALL AS TWINS.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS
LIKE IT MIGHT BE MORE WORK,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
A LOT OF THE THINGS
YOU DO SIMULTANEOUSLY,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
SO IT ISN'T, LIKE,
TWICE AS MUCH WORK.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
THEY'RE NURSING
EIGHT OR MORE TIMES
IN A 24-HOUR PERIOD?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
- YES.
- GOOD GIRLS.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Brazelton:
 THE PROGRAM TAKES
 A LONG-TERM APPROACH.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
KIDS COME IN
 AT REGULAR INTERVALS
 FOR FOLLOW-UP

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE
 DEVELOPING NORMALLY.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
FORTUNATELY AT THE END OF
THE 20th AND THE BEGINNING
OF THE 21st CENTURY,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
PREMATURE BABIES
IN GENERAL ARE DOING
EXTREMELY WELL,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
PARTICULARLY THE MULTIPLES
 GROUP, AND DESPITE THEIR
 EXTREME PREMATURITY.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Brazelton:
 AND THAT THE PARENTS
 ARE DOING OKAY TOO.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
CAN I HAVE
THE PHONE?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE
 TO GET ALL THREE CHILDREN
 ON THE SAME SCHEDULE, OR--

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
OH, YEAH, EVERYONE TAKES
A NAP AT THE SAME TIME,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
THEY EAT DINNER
AT THE SAME TIME, BREAKFAST,
TAKE BATHS AT THE SAME TIME.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
- EXCELLENT.
-* THE WHEELS ON THE BUS
  GO ROUND AND ROUND *

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Brazelton:
 A SPECIAL PART OF THE PROGRAM--
 THE PLAY GROUPS.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
ALONG WITH BEING
 JUST PLAIN FUN,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
THEY SHOW THE KIDS
 THAT THERE ARE OTHERS
 JUST LIKE 'EM.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
PARENTS GET TO SEE
 THEY'RE NOT ALONE TOO.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Woman:
 PEOPLE COME UP
 AND SAY THINGS TO ME--

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
HOW DID YOU HAVE THEM?
 WHAT DID YOU TAKE
 TO HAVE THEM.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
WE'VE ALSO HAD THE GRANDMA
THAT CAME UP TO US WITH
TEARS IN HER EYES

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
AND SAYING,  YOU HAVE SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. I HOPE YOU
APPRECIATE IT. GOD BLESS YOU.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
THEN OF COURSE YOU HAVE
THE ONES THAT SAY,
 OH, GOD BLESS YOU!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
( all laughing )

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
BUT MOST OF THE TIME,
IT'S NICE THINGS.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
THIS IS, LIKE, A REALLY
BIG ISSUE. HOW DO YOU GET OUT
OF THE HOUSE IN THE MORNING?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
THE NIGHT BEFORE,
I HAVE THEIR COATS OUT,
THE HATS OUT.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I HAVE LITTLE BINS
IN MY BEDROOM
WITH THEIR NAMES ON THEM,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
AND THEIR SHOES
AND THE SOCKS
AND EVERYTHING IS THERE.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
ONE THING THAT WE RECOMMEND
FOR PARENTS TO CONSIDER

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
EVEN BEFORE DELIVERY

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
IS COLOR-CODING
DIFFERENT BABY ITEMS.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Boyle:
 HAS ANYONE SEEN THEIR CHILDREN
 HAVE A BOND THAT YOU THINK IS

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT
THAN OTHER SIBLING
RELATIONSHIPS?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
WE HAD A STOMACH VIRUS
LAST WEEK,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
AND THE FIRST ONE STARTED,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
AND SHE WAS THROWING UP
AND SHE WAS BY THE TOILET BOWL,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SEE
HER OTHER THREE SISTERS
SURROUNDING HER,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
AND ONE IS RUBBING HER HEAD

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
AND THE OTHER ONE HAD
THE TOWEL ON HER HEAD

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
AND THE OTHER ONE'S
JUST STANDING THERE,
HOLDING HER HAIR BACK,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
AND I THOUGHT THAT IS SO--

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I MEAN, IT BROUGHT
TEARS TO MY EYES.
I'M, LIKE, LOOK AT THEM.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
THE BOND IS REALLY, REALLY
SPECIAL AND BEAUTIFUL

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
AS A PARENT TO STAND BACK
AND TO WATCH.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Woman: MY NAME IS...
 SNUFFLEUPAGUS.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
- All: NO.
- NO?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Boyle:
 AS THE BABIES DEVELOP INTO
 TODDLERS, INTO YOUNG CHILDREN,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
THEY REALLY KNOW
 EACH OTHER IN WAYS

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
SO INTIMATE THAT YOU AND I
 COULD ONLY IMAGINE.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
AND THEY ALSO KNOW
HOW TO SOOTHE AND SUPPORT
EACH OTHER IN WAYS

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
THAT YOU AND I
REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
HERE WITH ME TODAY
IS CRYSTAL HOLMES,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM I.B.M.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
WHAT CAN PARENTS
OF MULTIPLES FIND
ON THE INTERNET

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
THAT HELPS THEM
THROUGH THAT NIGHTMARE

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
OF RAISING MORE
THAN ONE KID?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
BERRY, I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
IT WOULD BE LIKE TO RAISE

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
MORE THAN ONE TODDLER
AT A TIME, BUT THANKFULLY,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES
 AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
THE SITE WE'RE GONNA
 LOOK AT TODAY IS
 THE TRIPLET CONNECTION,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
AND THIS SITE
 IS KIND OF NEAT

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
BECAUSE YOU CAN ACTUALLY
 ASK QUESTIONS,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
AND WHAT THEY DO
 IS GROUP THE ANSWERS

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
IN TOPICAL AREAS BASED UPON
 WHATEVER THE CONTENT IS.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
SO FOR EXAMPLE,
 THEY HAVE TRIPLET TIPS.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE
 AND SEE WHAT SOME OF THEM ARE.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE EVERYTHING
 FROM RAISING TRIPLETS

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
TO SCHOOL AND EDUCATION
 AND SLEEPING

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
AND BEDROOMS AND NURSERIES.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
LET'S LOOK AT
 SOME OF THE QUESTIONS
 THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
ONE OF THEM IS
 A TIP, ACTUALLY,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
THAT A PARENT HAS GIVEN
 TO ANOTHER PARENT,
 AND IT SAYS

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
THAT YOU SHOULD LET THEM
 PARTICIPATE

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
IN THROWING DIRTY DIAPERS
 AWAY IN THE PAIL.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I'D BE SCARED THAT
 THEY WOULD MISS.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
IF YOU START THE CHORES EARLY,
 IT WON'T BE SO HARD

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
TO INTEGRATE
 OTHER CHORES IN THEIR DAY
 AS THEY GET OLDER.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
THAT MAKES SENSE.
 SO YOU CAN SEE
 THAT ON THIS SITE,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE
INFORMATION THAT'S USEFUL,
ONE PARENT TO ANOTHER,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
TO HELP WITH THOSE
TRYING TIMES.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
IT'S TOUGH
RAISING MULTIPLES,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
BUT THEY MEAN
SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
THAT YOU GET REALLY
JEALOUS OF HOW EXCITED

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
THEY ARE WITH EACH OTHER

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
AND WISH YOU COULD BE
IN THERE WITH THEM.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
AND, BERRY, OUR INTERNET
QUESTION TODAY COMES FROM KELLY
IN CAMARILLO, CALIFORNIA.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
HER QUESTION IS:

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I'M WORRIED THAT THIS
  WILL HAVE A NEGATIVE
  IMPACT ON THEM.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
HOW CAN I ENCOURAGE THEM
 TO BE INDIVIDUALS?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S REALLY AS IMPORTANT
AS YOU MAY THINK IT IS

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
BECAUSE THESE KIDS MEAN
SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
TWINS HAVE A VERY SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
IN FACT,
IT'S SO DELICIOUS

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
TO EVERYBODY AROUND THEM
THAT THEY'RE JEALOUS,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
AND I'LL BET THESE KIDS CAN
BOUNCE OFF AGAINST EACH OTHER

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
IN WAYS THAT SUPPORT
THEIR OWN SELF-IMAGE

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
IN A LOT BETTER WAY
THAN BECOMING INDIVIDUALS.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
SO I THINK I WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000

THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
WITH ME TODAY IS
DR. MAUREEN O'BRIEN,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
AUTHOR AND
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR
AT BENTLEY COLLEGE.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
MAUREEN, I KNOW
YOU HAVE TWINS,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
AND I JUST WONDER,
WHY DO PARENTS
GET SO UPTIGHT

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
ABOUT WHEN THEY SHOULD
SEPARATE TWINS

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
WHEN IT SEEMS TO ME
TWINS TAKE DIFFERENT ROLES
RIGHT FROM THE FIRST?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I THINK FROM THE BEGINNING
WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLES,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
PEOPLE TREAT THEM AS A UNIT,
AND YOU STRIVE FOR A LONG TIME

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
TO TREAT THEM
AS SEPARATE INDIVIDUALS,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
BUT THE REALITY IS,
THEY GO THROUGH LIFE TOGETHER.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
THEY GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER,
 THEY TOILET TRAIN TOGETHER,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
THEY LEARN HOW TO WALK
 TOGETHER, AND SO

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
EVEN IF DON'T
THINK OF THEM AS A UNIT

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
THEIR BEHAVIORS GO
THROUGH THE SAME SEQUENCE,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
AND SO YOU'RE USED TO
THEM BEING TOGETHER.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
AND ANYTHING THAT THREATENS
THAT FEELS LIKE A SEPARATION
THAT MIGHT HARM A RELATIONSHIP.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I THINK YOU
CONSTANTLY FIGHT IT AS
THE PARENT OF MULTIPLES--

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
HOW MUCH DO YOU
TREAT THEM AS

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
TOGETHER AND AS A UNIT,
AND HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
OF THEM AS INDIVIDUALS?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
IF THEY WERE FOUR YEARS APART
FROM ONE ANOTHER, THE QUESTION
WOULDN'T EVEN ENTER YOUR MIND.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
YOU WOULD ALWAYS THINK
OF ONE AS THE OLDER SISTER
OR THE YOUNGER BROTHER,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
BUT WHEN THEY
GROW UP TOGETHER,
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO NOT

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
CONSTANTLY
REMIND YOURSELF
THAT THEY ARE TWINS

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
BUT THEY'RE STILL
SEPARATE PEOPLE
WITH SEPARATE STRENGTHS

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
AND SKILLS
AND INTERESTS,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT JUST IS ALWAYS PART
OF HOW PEOPLE TREAT THEM.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
THAT'S FASCINATING,
'CAUSE I NEVER HAVE THOUGHT
OF THOSE TWO FORCES

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
SORT OF WORKING TOGETHER--
THE INTERNAL FORCE
ON THE PARENTS' PART

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
AND THE EXTERNAL FORCE
WHICH THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FACE SOONER OR LATER.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
AND THE TWINS
THEMSELVES REMIND YOU.
THEY'LL SAY THINGS LIKE,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
WE DON'T HAVE ANYONE
 TO PLAY WITH.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
THE PARENT SAYS,
  YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR
 SISTER'S RIGHT THERE.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
BUT THEY'RE SO USED TO SEEING
THEMSELVES AS TOGETHER--

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
- A UNIT?
- YEAH.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
- IS THAT GOOD?
- I THINK IT'S GOOD TO A POINT.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I THINK WHAT WE WOULD WANT
TO SEE IN THE TWINS, THOUGH,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
IS THAT AFTER THEY GOT
COMFORTABLE WITH THEMSELVES

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
THAT THEY'RE JUST AS
COMFORTABLE BEING APART.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
AND THAT'S WHERE THE SCHOOL
PRESSURES HAPPEN. BUT I DO
THINK THAT THERE ARE WAYS

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
THAT YOU CAN
HELP THEM ADJUST.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
OF THE WAYS IS TO EDUCATE
THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM
TO NOT CALL THEM  THE TWINS.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
YOU KNOW,
USE THEIR NAMES.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
DON'T TRY TO GUESS
WHICH TWIN IT IS.
ASK THEM WHAT THEIR NAME IS.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
IF IT WAS ANY OTHER CHILD,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
YOU WOULDN'T SAY,
 ARE YOU JOEY OR ARE YOU JANE?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
- YOU'D SAY,  I CAN'T REMEMBER
  YOUR NAME, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? 
- REALLY?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
AND SO YOU'RE ENCOURAGING
THAT SENSE OF, THEY'RE
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY,
 WHEN SHOULD I DRESS THEM
 DIFFERENTLY?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
SHOULD I GIVE THEM
INSIGNIAS

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK,
'WHICH ONE ARE YOU?'

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
- OR 'WHAT'S YOUR NAME?' 
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
WELL, I THINK AGAIN
IT'S SORT OF THE ADULT VERSION

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
OF TRYING TO DECIDE
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE KIDS.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
MOST PEOPLE DRESS
THEIR YOUNG TWINS ALIKE

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
SIMPLY BECAUSE
PEOPLE GIVE THEM
MATCHING OUTFITS.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
- AND YOU TEND TO DO THAT
  AND NOT THINK TWICE.
- SO YOUR SORT OF AT THE MERCY.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
SORT OF.
AND THERE'S SOME CULTURAL
ACCEPTANCE FOR THAT,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
AND IT'S FUN TO
HAVE YOUR KIDS NOTICED
AND HAVE PEOPLE SAY--

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
THERE'S SOMETHING IN IT
FOR THE PARENT TOO.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
BUT I THINK IT REACHES A POINT--
ESPECIALLY TWO, THREE,
FOUR YEARS OLD,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
WHEN THE CHILD IS REALLY
SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING ON

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
WHO THEY ARE AS A PERSON,
NOT,  WHO AM I COMPARED TO
MY BROTHER OR TO MY SISTER?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
GEE, THAT'S FASCINATING,
'CAUSE I CAN FORESEE THAT--

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
OR I WONDER--
IF PARENTS OF TWINS

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
DON'T WANT TO KEEP THEM
TO BE EQUAL ALL THE TIME,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE,
AS YOU SAY, WITH TWO KIDS,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
SO WHY SHOULDN'T IT
BE TRUE OF TWINS?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
MM-HMM. I THINK YOU WANT
TO TREAT THEM FAIRLY.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
THINK  EQUAL  IS NOT
THE RIGHT WORD TO TRY
TO GO FOR AS A PARENT.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I THINK YOU DO WANT
TO BE FAIR. SO ONE
MIGHT BE A CUDDLER

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
AND NEED MORE
OF YOUR PHYSICAL ATTENTION.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
ONE MIGHT BE MORE OF
A CURIOSITY TEMPERAMENT,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
AND SO YOU'D NEED
TO TRY AND FIND WAYS
TO INTEREST THAT CHILD.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE
THEY ALL HAVE TO BE

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
WITH YOU ALL THE TIME,
CLOCKING IT, TIMING IT,
IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE FAIR.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
AND ONE THING THAT I'VE SEEN
MULTIPLES DO BETTER THAN
OTHER KIDS IS THEY SAY,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
IT WAS HIS TURN YESTERDAY.
IT'S MY TURN TODAY.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
- REALLY?
- AND SO THEY REALLY LEARN
  TO ADOPT THAT THEMSELVES,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
WHICH IS A GREAT SKILL
WHEN THEY START GOING
OUT INTO THE WORLD.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE FUN.
- IT IS FUN.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
THAT'S WONDERFUL TO HEAR,
BECAUSE YOU HEAR
ALL THE HORRORS

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
THAT MOTHERS
OF TWINS GO THOUGH.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
IT'S REALLY GREAT
 TO HAVE YOU HERE

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
AND TALKING ABOUT IT
IN SUCH AN EXCITING WAY.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
WELL, THANKS, IT IS FUN.
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.
IT IS A LOT OF WORK.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH FUN
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT
THAT IT'S WORTH IT.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE--

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Emcee:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
HI, DOCTOR.
IT'S NICE MEETING YOU.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I'M THE MOTHER
OF FOUR DAUGHTERS.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I HAVE A 12-YEAR-OLD,
A NINE-YEAR-OLD,
AND I JUST HAD TWINS--

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
- BABY GIRLS.
- WONDERFUL.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
THEY WERE BORN AT 32 WEEKS.
THEY WERE PREEMIES.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
- THEY'RE DOING
   REALLY, REALLY WELL.
 - HOW OLD ARE THEY NOW?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
- THEY'RE EIGHT MONTHS-- THEY'LL
 BE EIGHT MONTHS ON TUESDAY.
- EIGHT MONTHS.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
SO THEY'RE REALLY ABOUT
SIX MONTHS, AREN'T THEY?
'CAUSE I ALWAYS TAKE AWAY

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
- THE TWO MONTHS
  THAT THEY WERE EARLY.
- RIGHT.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
ONE OF THE TWINS, MICHELLE,
SHE'S, LIKE, RIGHT ON TARGET.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
SHE ALREADY HAS
TWO TEETH.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
SHE'S ROLLED OVER

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
AT FOUR MONTHS
BOTH WAYS.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
AND KALA, I JUST--
SHE'S LITTLER.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
SHE WAS TWO POUNDS,
TEN OUNCES

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
AND MICHELLE WAS
THREE POUNDS, 13 OUNCES.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
BUT SHE'S STILL TINY.
EVEN THE PEDIATRICIAN SAID--

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
'CAUSE SHE WAS ON
HIGH-FORTIFIED FORMULA

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
AND TRYING TO REALLY
BEEF HER UP, WHICH SHE'S NOT.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
SHE'S LITTLE.
SHE'S ABOUT 14 POUNDS NOW.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
YOU THINK
THEY COULD BE A MONTH APART
IN THEIR GESTATION?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
- I WAS THINKING THAT!
- WERE YOU?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
I WAS THINKING
THAT ORIGINALLY.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
WE GIVE ENOUGH CREDIT.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
BECAUSE HERE'S THAT BABY,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
- A LITTLE OVER
 A POUND DIFFERENT...
- RIGHT.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
- AND MORE IMMATURE...
-EXACTLY.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE LONGER
FOR HER TO CATCH UP.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
- YEP.
-YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS ALMOST
LIKE THEY WEREN'T EVEN
CONCEIVED AT THE SAME TIME

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I SAID THAT SAME THING,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
BECAUSE I KNOW
THE TWO TIMES.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
- WELL, ME TOO.
- EXACTLY.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
WE'RE BOTH GUESSING,
BUT THAT MAY BE--

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I'M REALLY THINKING THAT
BECAUSE KALA ON HER OWN

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
IS RIGHT ON--
YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE ONE--

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
IS RIGHT ON TARGET
WHERE SHE SHOULD BE,
YOU KNOW, BUT--

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
OKAY, WELL, PULL YOURSELF
BACK AND SAY,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
-  THEY'RE DIFFERENT AGES. 
- OKAY.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
BECAUSE YOU CAN WASTE MORE TIME
PUSHING A CHILD TO CATCH UP

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
IF THEY'RE NOT
READY FOR IT.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
AND EVERY TIME YOU DO THAT,
YOU'RE SAYING TO HER,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I DON'T LIKE YOU
THE WAY YOU ARE.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
- YOU DON'T WANT TO
  DO THAT DO YOU?
-NO, NO.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
NO, SHE'S REALLY SWEET.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
- THERE ARE INSTANCES OF
  THEIR BEING DIFFERENT AGES.
- YEAH.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
MAY TAKE
VERY DIFFERENT ROLES.
ARE THEY?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
- OH YEAH, THEY'RE TWO
- DIFFERENT-- DEFINITELY.
- ALREADY?

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
- AND YOU CAN TELL
   THE DIFFERENCE ALREADY?
 - ALREADY. OH, YEAH.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
ONE IS MORE ACTIVE AND SORT OF
SHOWS OFF TO THE OTHER ONE?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
- YEAH.
- AND THE OTHER ONE
  SITS BACK AND WATCHES?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
OH, YEAH, THEY WATCH EACH OTHER.
IF ONE'S CRYING, THE OTHER ONE
JUST LOOKS AND LAUGHS.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
ISN'T THAT FASCINATING?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
AND THIS ONE THAT IS
SITTING BACK IS LEARNING
FROM THE OTHER ONE.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
- YEAH.
-AND WHEN THEY'RE
 LEARNING MOTOR THINGS,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
WHY, THIS ONE WILL LEARN
FROM THIS ONE.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I'LL BET WHEN
THEY START TALKING,
IT'LL SWITCH.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
- OKAY.
- AND THE ONE THAT
  STARTS TALKING FIRST,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
WHICH MAY WELL BE
THE SENSITIVE QUIET ONE,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
THE OTHER ONE
WILL LEARN FROM HER.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
SO IT'S FASCINATING WITH TWINS.
THEY SWITCH BACK AND FORTH.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
NOW, ONE THING I WANT
TO WARN YOU ABOUT--

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
DON'T KEEP PUSHING HIM
TO CATCH UP.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
- OKAY.
-MOTHERS OF PREEMIES
  ALWAYS SAY,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
WHEN IS HE GONNA
CATCH UP TO HIS AGE?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
- RIGHT.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
WHAT YOU DO IF YOU IF SPEND
YOUR TIME DOING THAT,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
YOU'RE JUST SPENDING
ALL YOUR TIME GOING UP
AND DOWN COMPARING THEM.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
IF YOU STAY DOWN
 WHERE THEY ARE--

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
AND WITH THESE TWO,
YOU GOTTA STAY WHERE
TWO OF THEM ARE--

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
THEN YOU GIVE 'EM
WHAT THEY NEED,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
- WHICH IS BACK-UP
  FOR WHAT THEY ARE.
- OKAY.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
- AND YOU'LL HAVE
  A LOT MORE FUN.
-OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
GREAT!

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
MY NAME IS JENNIFER.
I AM A MOTHER

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
OF IDENTICAL TWIN BOYS
THAT ARE THREE,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
AND THEY HAVE BEEN
WITH ME DOING HOME DAYCARE
SINCE THEY'VE BEEN BORN.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I'M WORKING ON
THE SEPARATION FROM ME

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
SO THAT I HAVE TIME
FOR MYSELF AWAY FROM THEM

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
BECAUSE THE ATTACHMENT
IS SO GREAT.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
ONCE THEY ENTER
THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
TEACHERS SUGGEST
THAT I SEPARATE THEM
TO TWO DIFFERENT CLASSROOMS.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH A SEPARATION ISSUE?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
- FROM EACH OTHER.
- I SEE.  SO YOU FEEL
  THEY'RE SO CLOSE--

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
I'M WORKING ON
THE SEPARATION FROM ME, BECAUSE
ONCE THEY ENTER KINDERGARTEN

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I THINK I'LL HAVE A HARDER TIME
BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN
WITH ME FOR SO LONG.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
- SO MY QUESTION--
-YOU EVEN GET A LITTLE--

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
- YEAH, IT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR ME.
- IS IT?  UH-HUH.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
SO, DO I SEPARATE THEM
FROM ONE ANOTHER?

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
YEAH.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
- MIXED.
- I DON'T FEEL THAT
  WE SHOULD SEPARATE THEM

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
UNTIL THEY'RE READY
TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
- AND HOW WILL I KNOW THAT?
- THEY'LL LET YOU KNOW.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
THEY'LL WANT FRIENDS
OF THEIR OWN,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
THEY'LL WANT TO DRESS
DIFFERENTLY,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
AND IT'LL PROBABLY HAPPEN
AT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX.
SIX, MAYBE SEVEN.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
- GOOD.
- TELL ME ABOUT YOUR OWN
  ISSUES ABOUT SEPARATION.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
- DOES THIS GO BACK--
- I'M JUST STARTING NOW.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
- STARTING WHAT?
 - LIKE, GO AN HOUR
   AT NIGHT TO THE GYM

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
AND LET THEM BE
WITH THEIR DAD.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
DO YOU THINK THIS GOES BACK
TO YOUR OWN CHILDHOOD?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
MY MOM WAS HOME WITH US--
WITH ME-- UNTIL SECOND GRADE.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
MM-HMM, SO THIS IS A KIND
OF RECAPITULATION OF THAT.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
- I THINK SO.
- MM-HMM.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
I BET IT GOES BACK
TO SOME OF YOUR OWN FEELINGS

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
ABOUT SEPARATION
AND HOW HARD IT WAS.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I THINK PEOPLE DON'T
FACE THIS, YOU KNOW,
IN THEMSELVES,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
AND SO THEY MAKE IT HARDER
FOR THEIR KIDS

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
'CAUSE THEY'RE HAVING
SUCH A HARD TIME.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
SO FACING IT IS REALLY
A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF IT.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
THANK YOU.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
HI.
MY NAME IS PAULA CARL,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
AND I'M THE MOTHER OF
YEAR-OLD FRATERNAL TWIN BOYS.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
FRATERNAL TWINS?
OH, YOU DON'T LOOK
EXHAUSTED ENOUGH.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
YOU SHOULD HAVE
 SEEN ME LAST YEAR.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
MY QUESTION IS SORT OF
A CONCERN THAT I HAVE.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I WORRY ABOUT
COMPARING THEM A LOT

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
AND, YOU KNOW, CONVEYING
A SENSE OF FAVORITISM

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
OR AFFECTING
ONE'S SELF-ESTEEM
IN A NEGATIVE WAY.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
WITH EACH NEW MILESTONE,
IT'S LIKE,  WELL, HE'S--
SMILED FIRST,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
OR HE DID SOMETHING ELSE
FIRST,  AND SO I WORRY
ABOUT THAT A LOT.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
- YOU JUST CAN'T
  HELP IT, CAN YOU?
- RIGHT, I CAN'T-- I TRY.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
ABSOLUTELY.
 YOU'RE JUST BOUND TO.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
AND YOU'RE BOUND TO REINFORCE
THE ONE THAT JUST DID IT.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
- RIGHT.
-SMILE AT 'EM, SAY
  SOMETHING TO 'EM.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
- AND I'LL BET
  THE OTHER ONE COLLAPSES.
- MM-HMM.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
- AND SO YOU FEEL SO GUILTY.
-YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
- YOU FEEL LIKE,
  WHY DID I DO THAT?
-YES.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
DON'T FEEL GUILTY
AND DON'T NOT DO IT.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I BET THEY BOTH
HAVE VERY DIFFERENT ROLES
IN YOUR FAMILY.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
- DO THEY?
- VERY DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
THAT'S WHAT I WONDERED.
TELL US ABOUT THAT.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
WELL, ONE OF THEM WAS COLICKY
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
AND HE'S STILL VERY,
I'D SAY, INTENSE.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
HE TENDS TO BE RETICENT

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
AND TAKES HIM A WHILE
TO WARM UP TO SOMEONE.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
THE OTHER IS SORT OF
 MORE EASILY SOCIAL
 AND ENGAGING.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
SO THEY SORT OF SWITCH ROLES
 ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
AND YOUR QUESTION
ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE PAYING

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO ONE
AND NOT TO THE OTHER--

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
YOU KNOW, I'D SAY
THE SAME THING-- THAT IT'LL
BALANCE ITSELF OUT OVER TIME.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
AND CERTAINLY
 IF YOU LOOK FOR TIMES

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
TO REINFORCE THEM
 FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING,
 THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
THEN TIMES WHEN
MAYBE WHEN YOU JUST
PICK 'EM UP AND HUG 'EM

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
AND SAY,  YOU KNOW,
I MISS YOU.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION
TO YOUR BROTHER 'CAUSE
HE'S ALWAYS INTO TROUBLE,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
SO I HAVE TO PICK YOU UP
AND HUG YOU.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
AND THERE'S A NEW CONCEPT

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
OF HANGING-OUT TIME.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
NOT JUST SPECIALTY TIME
BUT HANGING-OUT TIME.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
SO MAYBE WHEN YOU
PICKED HIM UP TO LOVE HIM,
YOU'D SIT DOWN

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
IN A ROCKING CHAIR
AND JUST ROCK

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
AND SORT OF JUST SING TOGETHER
 AND SEE IF HE'D SING WITH YOU

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
- AND MAKE UP
  FOR IT THAT WAY.
-OKAY, THAT'S HELPFUL.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
I THINK IT SOUNDS
LIKE A LOT OF FUN.
I WISH I COULD BE THERE.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YES, THANK YOU.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
- GREAT.
- ( applause )

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Brazelton:
 FOR MORE ANSWERS
 AND INFORMATION,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
VISIT US ON-LINE AT:

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
PRESENTED BY

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
THERE ARE LOTS OF CHALLENGES
FOR A PARENT OF MULTIPLES,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
BUT I JUST WANT TO TAKE
A MOMENT TO POINT OUT
THE POSITIVES.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER
SIBLING RELATIONSHIP
AS CLOSE AS THAT

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
WITH KIDS BORN TOGETHER.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
AND I SEE TWINS ESPECIALLY--
I SEE A SPECIAL BOND

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
THAT SOMETIMES MAKES ME JEALOUS
I'M NOT A TWIN MYSELF.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
SO IF YOU DO
HAVE MULTIPLES,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
VALUE THAT PRECIOUS BOND.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
IT'S SOMETHING
THAT WILL SUPPORT THEM
AND ENRICH THEM

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
