00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:58.370


2
00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.930
Tush! never tell me;

3
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.500
I take it much unkindly

4
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse

5
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.730
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

6
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.470
'Sblood, but you will not hear me:

7
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.700
If ever I did dream of such a matter,

8
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.030
Abhor me.

9
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.970
Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

10
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.670
Despise me, if I do not.

11
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.770
Three great ones of the city,

12
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.870
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,

13
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.300
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,

14
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.800
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:

15
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.270
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,

16
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.500
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance

17
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.400
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;

18
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.570
And, in conclusion,

19
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.230
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,

20
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.430
'I have already chosen my officer.'

21
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.070
And what was he?

22
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.270
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,

23
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.230
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,

24
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.930
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;

25
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.130
That never set a squadron in the field,

26
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.430
Nor the division of a battle knows

27
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.500
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,

28
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.870
Wherein the toged consuls can propose

29
00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.330
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,

30
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.870
Is all his soldiership.

31
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.770
But he, sir, had the election:

32
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.400
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof

33
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.270
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds

34
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.830
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd

35
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.570
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,

36
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.530
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,

37
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.730
And I--God bless the mark!-- his Moorship's ancient.

38
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.930
By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

39
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.030
Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,

40
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.570
Preferment goes by letter and affection,

41
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.430
And not by old gradation, where each second

42
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830
Stood heir to the first.

43
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.070
Now, sir, be judge yourself,

44
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.230
Whether I in any just term am affined

45
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.500
To love the Moor.

46
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.400
I would not follow him then.

47
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.070
O, sir, content you;

48
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.500
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:

49
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.930
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters

50
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.800
Cannot be truly follow'd.

51
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.900
You shall mark

52
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.070
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,

53
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.130
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,

54
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.630
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,

55
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.930
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:

56
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.870
Whip me such honest knaves.

57
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.400
Others there are

58
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.230
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,

59
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.270
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,

60
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.470
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,

61
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.530
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats

62
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.900
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;

63
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.130
And such a one do I profess myself.

64
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.300
For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo,

65
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.830
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:

66
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.830
In following him, I follow but myself;

67
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.870
Heaven is my judge, not for love or duty,

68
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.770
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:

69
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.770
For when my outward action doth demonstrate

70
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.100
The native act and figure of my heart

71
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.430
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after

72
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.570
I shall wear my heart upon my sleeve

73
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.630
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

74
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.170
What a full fortune does the thicklips owe

75
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.470
If he can carry't thus!

76
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.030
Call up her father,

77
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.170
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,

78
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.270
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,

79
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.400
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,

80
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.570
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,

81
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.130
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,

82
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.770
As it may lose some colour.

83
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.270
Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

84
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.900
Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell

85
00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.770
As when, by night and negligence, the fire

86
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.470
Is spied in populous cities.

87
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.030
What, ho, Brabantio!

88
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.830
Signior Brabantio, ho!

89
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:45.930
Awake!

90
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.370
What, ho, Brabantio!

91
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.930
Thieves!

92
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.130
Thieves!

93
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.030
Thieves!

94
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.200
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!

95
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.300
Thieves!

96
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.600
Thieves!

97
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.200
What is the reason of this terrible summons?

98
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.630
What is the matter there?

99
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.830
Signior, is all your family within?

100
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.330
Are your doors lock'd?

101
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.400
Why, wherefore ask you this?

102
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.800
'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on your gown;

103
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.700
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;

104
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.370
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram

105
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.570
Is topping your white ewe.

106
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.230
Arise, arise;

107
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.970
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,

108
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.000
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:

109
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.730
Arise, I say.

110
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.630
What, have you lost your wits?

111
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.470
Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

112
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.030
Not I what are you?

113
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.870
My name is Roderigo.

114
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.700
The worser welcome:

115
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.470
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:

116
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.100
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say

117
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.130
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,

118
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.830
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,

119
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.230
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come

120
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.330
To start my quiet.

121
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.430
Sir, sir--

122
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.630
But thou must needs be sure

123
00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.000
My spirit and my place have in them power

124
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.200
To make this bitter to thee.

125
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.300
Patience, good sir.

126
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.770
What tell'st thou me of robbing?

127
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.870
This is Venice;

128
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.600
My house is not a grange.

129
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.330
Most grave Brabantio,

130
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.130
In simple and pure soul I come to you.

131
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.430
'Zounds, sir,

132
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.930
you are one of those that will not serve God,

133
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.500
if the devil bid you.

134
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.000
Because we come to do you service

135
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.070
you think we are ruffians,

136
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.870
you'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;

137
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.200
you'll have your nephews neigh to you;

138
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.800
you'll have coursers for cousins

139
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.300
and gennets for germans.

140
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.030
What profane wretch art thou?

141
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.630
I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter

142
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.370
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

143
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.530
You art a villain.

144
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.970
You are--

145
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.130
A senator.

146
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.170
This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

147
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.200
Sir, I will answer any thing.

148
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.600
But, I beseech you,

149
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.070
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,

150
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.370
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,

151
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.830
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,

152
00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.200
Transported, with no worse nor better guard

153
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.170
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,

154
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.970
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--

155
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.670
If this be known to you and your allowance,

156
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.800
We then have done you bold and saucy wrong;

157
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.170
But if you know not this, my manners tell me

158
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.300
We have your wrong rebuke.

159
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.270
Do not believe that, from the sense of all civility,

160
00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.670
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:

161
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.470
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,

162
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.670
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;

163
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.770
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes

164
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.100
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger

165
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.400
Of here and every where.

166
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.030
Straight satisfy yourself:

167
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:48.970
If she be in her chamber or your house,

168
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.170
Let loose on me the justice of the state

169
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.070
For thus deluding you.

170
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.400
Strike on the tinder, ho!

171
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.030
Farewell; for I must leave you:

172
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.430
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,

173
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.330
To be produced-- as, if I stay, I shall--

174
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.000
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,

175
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.670
However this may gall him with some cheque,

176
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.570
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd

177
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.800
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,

178
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.030
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,

179
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.700
Another of his fathom they have none,

180
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.870
To lead their business: in which regard,

181
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.600
Though I do hate him as I do hells-pains.

182
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.500
Yet, for necessity of present life,

183
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.900
I must show out a flag and sign of love,

184
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.530
Which is indeed but sign.

185
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.470
That you shall surely find him,

186
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.100
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;

187
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.200
And there will I be with him.

188
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.200
So, farewell.

189
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.230
It is too true an evil: gone she is;

190
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.570
And what's to come of my despised time is nought but bitterness.

191
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.770
Now, Roderigo, where didst thou see her?

192
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.030
O unhappy girl!

193
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.130
With the Moor, say'st thou?

194
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.770
Who would be a father!

195
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:52.530
How didst thou know 'twas she?

196
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.830
O thou deceives me past thought!

197
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:55.970
What said she to you?

198
00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.400
Get more tapers: Raise all my kindred.

199
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.670
Are they married, think you?

200
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.770
Truly, I think they are.

201
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:00.930
O heaven!

202
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.030
How got she out?

203
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.200
O treason of the blood!

204
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.830
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds

205
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.930
By what you see them act.

206
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.130
Is there not charms

207
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.400
By which the property of youth and maidhood

208
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.530
May be abused?

209
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:10.800
Have you not read, Roderigo,

210
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.900
Of some such thing?

211
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:13.030
Yes, sir, I have indeed.

212
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:14.500
Call up my brother.

213
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.430
O, that you had had her!

214
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.870
Some one way, some another.

215
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.670
Do you know where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

216
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.470
I think I can discover him, if you please,

217
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.100
To get good guard and go along with me.

218
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:25.400
Pray you, lead me on.

219
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.530
At every house I'll call; I may command at most.

220
00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.700
Get weapons, ho!

221
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:30.670
And raise some special officers of night.

222
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.900
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

223
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.200
Though in the trade of war I have slain men,

224
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.300
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience

225
00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.570
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity

226
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.730
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times

227
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.900
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

228
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.030
'Tis better as it is.

229
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.330
Nay, but he prated,

230
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.430
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms

231
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.530
Against your honour

232
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.970
That, with the little godliness I have,

233
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.730
I did full hard forbear him.

234
00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.830
But, I pray you, sir,

235
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.730
Are you fast married?

236
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.000
Be assured of this,

237
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.470
That the magnifico is much beloved,

238
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.100
And hath in his effect a voice potential

239
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.600
As double as the Duke's: he will divorce you;

240
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.930
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance

241
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.030
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,

242
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.400
Will give him cable.

243
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.900
Let him do his spite:

244
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.700
My services which I have done the signiory

245
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.400
Shall out-tongue his complaints.

246
00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.730
'Tis yet to know,--

247
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.070
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,

248
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.930
I shall promulgate-- I fetch my life and being

249
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.030
From men of royal siege, and my demerits

250
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.070
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune

251
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:50.670
As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,

252
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.600
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,

253
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.470
I would not my unhoused free condition

254
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.470
Put into circumscription and confine

255
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:00.530
For the sea's worth.

256
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:04.130
But, look! What lights come yond?

257
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.870
Those are the raised father and his friends:

258
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.030
You were best go in.

259
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:08.130
Not I I must be found:

260
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.570
My parts, my title and my perfect soul

261
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.970
Shall manifest me rightly.

262
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.070
Is it they?

263
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.000
By Janus, I think no.

264
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:17.600
The servants of the Duke, and my lieutenant.

265
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.000
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!

266
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.100
What is the news?

267
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.600
The Duke does greet you, general,

268
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.400
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,

269
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.600
Even on the instant.

270
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.730
What is the matter, think you?

271
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:28.600
Something from Cyprus as I may divine:

272
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.970
It is a business of some heat: the galleys

273
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.230
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers

274
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.870
This very night at one another's heels,

275
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.030
And many of the consuls, raised and met,

276
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.270
Are at the Duke's already: you have been hotly call'd for;

277
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.330
When, not being at your lodging to be found,

278
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.970
The Senate hath sent about three several quests to search you out.

279
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.200
'Tis well I am found by you.

280
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.430
I will but spend a word here in the house,

281
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.370
And go with you.

282
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.130
Ancient, what makes he here?

283
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.630
Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:

284
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.400
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

285
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.700
I do not understand.

286
00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.800
He's married.

287
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.970
To who?

288
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:07.500
Marry, to-- Come, captain, will you go?

289
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.170
Have with you.

290
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.700
Here comes another troop to seek for you.

291
00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.030
It is Brabantio.

292
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.470
General, be advised; He comes to bad intent.

293
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.070
Holla! Stand there!

294
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.170
Signior, it is the Moor.

295
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.530
Down with him, thief!

296
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:19.630
You, Roderigo!

297
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.300
Come, sir, I am for you.

298
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.600
Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.

299
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.930
Good signior, you shall more command with years

300
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.500
Than with your weapons.

301
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.970
O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?

302
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.770
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;

303
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:43.770
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,

304
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.730
If she in chains of magic were not bound,

305
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.730
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,

306
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.300
So opposite to marriage that she shunned

307
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.770
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,

308
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.500
Could ever have, to incur a general mock,

309
00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.430
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom

310
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.770
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.

311
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.770
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense

312
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.830
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,

313
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.170
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals

314
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:15.530
That weakens motion: I'll have't disputed on;

315
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.600
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.

316
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.900
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee

317
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.200
For an abuser of the world, a practiser

318
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.

319
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.400
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,

320
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.100
Subdue him at his peril.

321
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.270
Hold your hands,

322
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.170
Both you of my inclining, and the rest:

323
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.970
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it

324
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.530
Without a prompter.

325
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.070
Where would you go that I would go with you

326
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.170
To answer this your charge?

327
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.000
To prison, till fit time

328
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.800
Of law and course of direct session

329
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.070
Call thee to answer.

330
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.200
What if I do obey?

331
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.070
How may the Duke be therewith satisfied,

332
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.500
Whose messengers are here about my side,

333
00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.370
Upon some present business of the state

334
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.470
To bring me to him?

335
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:58.770
'Tis true, most worthy signior;

336
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.030
The Duke's in council and your noble self,

337
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:02.230
I am sure, is sent for.

338
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.330
How!

339
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:04.430
The Duke in council!

340
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:05.530
This time of the night!

341
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.970
Bring him away:

342
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.770
Mine's not an idle cause: the Duke himself,

343
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:10.370
Or any of my brothers of the state,

344
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.530
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;

345
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.930
For if such actions may have passage free,

346
00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:18.500
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

347
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.330
There is no composition in these news

348
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.900
That gives them credit.

349
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.800
Indeed, they are disproportion'd;

350
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.700
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

351
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.270
And mine, a hundred and forty.

352
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.730
But though they jump not on a just account--

353
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.470
As in these cases, where the aim reports,

354
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.100
'Tis oft with difference-- yet do they all confirm

355
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.000
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

356
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.500
Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:

357
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.730
I do not so secure me in the error,

358
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.400
But the main article I do approve in fearful sense.

359
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.400
Now, what's the business?

360
00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.530
The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,

361
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.900
Steering with due course, towards the isle of Rhodes.

362
00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.770
Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

363
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.870
How say you by this change?

364
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:19.970
This cannot be,

365
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.070
By no assay of reason.

366
00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:22.500
There enjointed them with an after fleet.

367
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.100
Ay, so I thought.

368
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.300
How many, as you guess?

369
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.630
Thirty sail: and now they do restem

370
00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.600
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance

371
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.130
Their purposes toward Cyprus.

372
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:33.270
Signior Montano,

373
00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.230
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,

374
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.070
In his free duty recommends you thus,

375
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.330
And prays you to believe him.

376
00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.300
'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.

377
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.900
Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

378
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.370
Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you

379
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:51.270
Against the general enemy Ottoman.

380
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.870
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;

381
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.500
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

382
00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.230
So did I yours.

383
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.870
Good your grace, pardon me;

384
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.570
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business

385
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.930
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care

386
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.000
Take hold on me, for my particular grief

387
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.330
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature

388
00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.570
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows

389
00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.370
And yet is still itself.

390
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:13.500
Why, what's the matter?

391
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.600
My daughter!

392
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.530
O, my daughter!

393
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.270
Dead?

394
00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.870
Ay, to me;

395
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.930
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted

396
00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:25.100
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;

397
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.430
For nature so preposterously to err,

398
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.030
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,

399
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.130
Sans witchcraft could not.

400
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.130
Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding

401
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.200
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself

402
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.730
And you of her, the bloody book of law

403
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.500
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter

404
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.800
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son

405
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.030
Stood in your action.

406
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.400
Humbly I thank your grace.

407
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.430
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,

408
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.400
Your special mandate for the state-affairs

409
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.500
Hath hither brought.

410
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.900
We are very sorry for't.

411
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:53.700
What, in your own part, can you say to this?

412
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.970
Nothing, but this is so.

413
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:08.300
Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,

414
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.970
My very noble and approved good masters,

415
00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:14.100
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,

416
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.730
It is most true; true, I have married her:

417
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.300
The very head and front of my offending

418
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.330
Hath this extent, no more.

419
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.800
Rude am I in my speech,

420
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.470
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:

421
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.630
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,

422
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.670
Till now some nine moons wasted,

423
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.930
they have used their dearest action in the tented field,

424
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.770
And little of this great world can I speak,

425
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:42.000
More than pertains to feats of broils and battle,

426
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.330
And therefore little shall I grace my cause

427
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.500
In speaking for myself.

428
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.670
Yet, by your gracious patience,

429
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.530
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver

430
00:17:53.530 --> 00:18:00.230
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,

431
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.500
What conjuration and what mighty magic,

432
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.830
For such proceeding I am charged withal,

433
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.430
I won his daughter.

434
00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.100
A maiden never bold;

435
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.170
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion

436
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.030
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,

437
00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.370
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,

438
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.170
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!

439
00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:20.630
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect

440
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.400
That will confess perfection so could err

441
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.400
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven

442
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.370
To find out practises of cunning hell,

443
00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.430
Why this should be.

444
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.830
I therefore vouch again

445
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.530
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,

446
00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:36.100
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,

447
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.370
He wrought upon her.

448
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:38.530
To vouch this, is no proof,

449
00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.270
Without more wider and more overt test

450
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.370
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods

451
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.530
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

452
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.670
I do beseech you,

453
00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.030
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,

454
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.070
And let her speak of me before her father:

455
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.900
If you do find me foul in her report,

456
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.000
The trust, the office I do hold of you,

457
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.400
Not only take away, but let your sentence

458
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.500
Even fall upon my life.

459
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.670
Fetch Desdemona hither.

460
00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.430
Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.

461
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.870
And, till she come, as faithful as to heaven

462
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.930
I do confess the vices of my blood,

463
00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.300
So justly to your grave ears I'll present

464
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.600
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,

465
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.770
And she in mine.

466
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.170
Say it--ah--

467
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.170
Othello.

468
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.570
Her father loved me; oft invited me;

469
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.330
Still question'd me the story of my life,

470
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.670
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,

471
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.130
That I have passed.

472
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.800
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,

473
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.570
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;

474
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.230
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,

475
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.170
Of moving accidents by flood and field

476
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:51.400
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,

477
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.970
Of being taken by the insolent foe

478
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.770
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence

479
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.100
And portance in my travels' history:

480
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:07.000
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,

481
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.300
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven

482
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:18.230
It was my hint to speak-- such was the process;

483
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:22.030
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,

484
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:30.800
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads

485
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.570
Do grow beneath their shoulders.

486
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:39.900
This to hear

487
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.900
Would Desdemona seriously incline:

488
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.970
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:

489
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.730
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,

490
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:49.500
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear

491
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.300
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,

492
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.770
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means

493
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.570
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart

494
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.200
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,

495
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.970
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,

496
00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:06.900
But not intentively: I did consent,

497
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.330
And often did beguile her of her tears,

498
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:13.700
When I did speak of some distressful stroke

499
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.030
That my youth suffer'd.

500
00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:20.070
My story being done,

501
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.500
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:

502
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:30.330
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,

503
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.270
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:

504
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.270
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd

505
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:43.300
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,

506
00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.500
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,

507
00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:51.870
I should but teach him how to tell my story.

508
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.600
And that would woo her.

509
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.700
Upon this hint I spake:

510
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:59.370
She loved me for the dangersI had pass'd,

511
00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:03.170
And I loved her that she did pity them.

512
00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:07.030
This only is the witchcraft I have used:

513
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:09.670
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

514
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.770
I think this tale would win my daughter too.

515
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:17.930
Good Brabantio,

516
00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:20.130
Take up this mangled matter at the best:

517
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:21.900
Men do their broken weapons rather use

518
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.230
Than their bare hands.

519
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.500
I pray you, hear her speak:

520
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.970
If she confess that she was half the wooer,

521
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.270
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame

522
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.930
Light on the man!

523
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:34.330
Come hither, gentle mistress:

524
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.500
Do you perceive in all this noble company

525
00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.170
Where most you owe obedience?

526
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:46.630
My noble father, I do perceive here a divided duty:

527
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.300
To you I am bound for life and education;

528
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.670
My life and education both do learn me

529
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.500
How to respect you; you are the lord of all my duty;

530
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:03.230
I am hitherto your daughter:

531
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.630
but here's my husband,

532
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:12.300
And so much duty as my mother show'd to you, preferring you before her father,

533
00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.170
So much I challenge that I may profess

534
00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:19.130
Due to the Moor my lord.

535
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.270
God be wi'!

536
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:23.700
I have done.

537
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.600
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:

538
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.570
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.

539
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:31.000
Come hither, Moor:

540
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.170
I here do give thee that with all my heart

541
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.700
Which, but thou hast already,

542
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.170
with all my heart I would keep from thee.

543
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:42.830
For your sake, jewel, I am glad at soul

544
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:44.070
I have no other child:

545
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.730
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,

546
00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.430
To hang clogs on them.

547
00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.600
I have done, my lord.

548
00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.800
Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,

549
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.530
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers

550
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:55.700
Into your favour.

551
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.300
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended

552
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.270
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.

553
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.970
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone

554
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.970
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.

555
00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:05.630
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes

556
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.800
Patience her injury a mockery makes.

557
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.070
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;

558
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.170
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

559
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:17.900
So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;

560
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.930
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.

561
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.430
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears

562
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.400
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,

563
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.430
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow

564
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.930
Which, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.

565
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.530
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,

566
00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:38.900
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:

567
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.030
But words are words; I never yet did hear

568
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:46.970
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.

569
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:50.600
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

570
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.630
The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus.

571
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.330
Othello, the fortitude of the place is best known to you;

572
00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:59.300
and though we have there a substitute

573
00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.300
of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion,

574
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:02.730
a sovereign mistress of effects,

575
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.030
throws a more safer voice on you:

576
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.400
you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss

577
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.130
of your new fortunes with this more stubborn

578
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.300
and boisterous expedition.

579
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:14.730
The tyrant custom, most grave senators,

580
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.970
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war

581
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.230
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise

582
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.530
A natural and prompt alacrity

583
00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.300
I find in hardness, and would undertake

584
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.930
This present wars against the Ottomites.

585
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.870
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,

586
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.330
I crave fit disposition for my wife.

587
00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.100
Due reference of place and exhibition,

588
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.930
With such accommodation and besort

589
00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:35.130
As levels with her breeding.

590
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.370
If you please,

591
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:37.600
Be't at her father's.

592
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.800
I'll not have it so.

593
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.070
Nor I.

594
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.700
Nor I; I would not there reside,

595
00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.300
To put my father in impatient thoughts

596
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:44.770
By being in his eye.

597
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.470
Most gracious Duke,

598
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.100
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;

599
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.470
And let me find a charter in your voice,

600
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.600
To assist my simpleness.

601
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.130
What would You, Desdemona?

602
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.230
That I did love the Moor to live with him,

603
00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.470
My downright violence and storm of fortunes

604
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.830
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued

605
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:16.370
Even to the very quality of my lord:

606
00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.330
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,

607
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.030
And to his honour and his valiant parts

608
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.900
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.

609
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.600
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,

610
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.830
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,

611
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.770
The rites for why I love him are bereft me,

612
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.930
And I a heavy interim shall support

613
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.030
By his dear absence.

614
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.300
Let me go with him.

615
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:51.300
Let her have your voice.

616
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.800
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,

617
00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.270
To please the palate of my appetite,

618
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.200
Nor to comply with heat-- the young affects

619
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.300
In me defunct-- and proper satisfaction.

620
00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.730
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:

621
00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:07.130
And heaven defend your good souls,

622
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.300
that you think I will your serious and great business scan

623
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.670
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys

624
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.900
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness

625
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.730
My speculative and officed instruments,

626
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:22.670
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,

627
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.030
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,

628
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:28.170
And all indign and base adversities

629
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.470
Make head against my estimation!

630
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.100
Be it as you shall privately determine, Either for her stay or going:

631
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.700
the affair cries haste and speed must answer it.

632
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.800
You must away to-night.

633
00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:37.900
To-night, my lord?

634
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.000
This night.

635
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.230
With all my heart.

636
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.470
At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.

637
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:42.630
Othello, leave some officer behind,

638
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.930
And he shall our commission bring to you;

639
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:45.670
With such things else of quality and respect

640
00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:46.770
As doth import you.

641
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:47.970
So please your grace, my ancient;

642
00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.870
A man he is of honesty and trust:

643
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.770
To his conveyance I assign my wife,

644
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.900
With what else needful your good grace shall think

645
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.030
To be sent after me.

646
00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.130
Let it be so.

647
00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.130
Good night to every one.

648
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.730
And, noble signior,

649
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.170
If virtue no delightful beauty lack,

650
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.400
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

651
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.630
Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

652
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.500
Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:

653
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:26.370
She has deceived her father, and may thee.

654
00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:29.470
My life upon her faith!

655
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:41.070
Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee:

656
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.800
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:

657
00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.930
And bring them after in the best advantage.

658
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.600
Come, Desdemona:

659
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.100
I have but an hour

660
00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.670
Of love, worldly matter and direction,

661
00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:02.770
To spend with thee:

662
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:06.400
we must obey the time.

663
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:24.700
Iago.

664
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.730
What say'st thou, noble heart?

665
00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.930
What will I do, thinkest thou?

666
00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.370
Why, go to bed, and sleep.

667
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:38.170
I will incontinently drown myself.

668
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:42.600
Well, if thou dost, I shall never love thee after it.

669
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.930
Why, thou silly gentleman!

670
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.630
It is silliness to live when to live is torment;

671
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.930
and then have we a prescription to die

672
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:53.000
when death is our physician.

673
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.900
O villainous!

674
00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.670
I have looked upon this world four times seven years;

675
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:01.970
and since I could distinguish

676
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.970
betwixt a benefit and an injury,

677
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:08.800
I never found man that knew how to love himself.

678
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:11.970
Ere would I say, I would drown myself

679
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.170
for the love of a guinea-hen,

680
00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.570
I would change my humanity with a baboon.

681
00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:17.000
What should I do?

682
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.700
I confess it is my shame to be so fond;

683
00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.270
but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

684
00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:24.470
Virtue!

685
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.700
A fig!

686
00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.070
'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.

687
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.500
Our bodies are our gardens, to the which

688
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.700
our wills are gardeners:

689
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.300
so that if we will plant nettles, or sow lettuce,

690
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.370
set hyssop and weed up thyme,

691
00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:41.400
supply it with one gender of herbs,

692
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.900
or distract it with many, either to have it sterile with idleness,

693
00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:51.070
or manured with industry, why, the power and corrigible authority of this

694
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.130
lies in our wills.

695
00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.970
If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason

696
00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:58.800
to poise another of sensuality,

697
00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.530
the blood and baseness of our natures

698
00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.970
would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions:

699
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.800
but we have reason to cool our raging motions,

700
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.470
our carnal stings, our unbitted lusts,

701
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:15.870
whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion.

702
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.000
It cannot be.

703
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.970
It is merely a lust of the blood

704
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:22.300
and a permission of the will.

705
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.130
Come, be a man.

706
00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.330
Drown thyself!

707
00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:30.230
Drown cats, blind puppies.

708
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:34.400
I have professed me thy friend and I confess me

709
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.030
knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness;

710
00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.370
I could never better stead thee than now.

711
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:46.130
Put money in thy purse; follow thou the wars;

712
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.700
defeat thy favour with an usurped beard;

713
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.630
I say, put money in thy purse.

714
00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.270
It cannot be long that Desdemona

715
00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.500
shall continue her love unto the Moor--

716
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.900
put money in thy purse-- nor he his to her:

717
00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.000
it was a violent commencement in her,

718
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.870
and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration--

719
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.830
put but money in thy purse.

720
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:12.030
These Moors are changeable in their wills:

721
00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.200
fill thy purse with money--

722
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.070
the food that to him now is as luscious as locusts,

723
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:22.070
shall be to him shortly as acerb as coloquintida.

724
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:26.200
She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body,

725
00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.970
she will find the error of her choice:

726
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.730
therefore put money in thy purse.

727
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.500
If thou wilt needs damn thyself,

728
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.270
do it in a more delicate way than drowning.

729
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.600
Make all the money thou canst:

730
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.800
if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian

731
00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:46.100
and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits

732
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:51.800
and all the tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her;

733
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:54.100
therefore make money.

734
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.300
A pox on drowning thyself!

735
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.400
It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be hanged

736
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.170
in compassing thy joy than be drowned and go without her.

737
00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.970
Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue?

738
00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.770
Thou art sure of me-- go, make money--

739
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:12.600
I have told thee often, and I re-tell thee again

740
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.630
and again, I hate the Moor:

741
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:19.030
my cause is hearted; thine has no less reason.

742
00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:22.970
Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him:

743
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:27.030
if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost thyself a pleasure,

744
00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:28.670
and me a sport.

745
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:30.200
There are many events in the womb of time

746
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.730
which will be delivered.

747
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:32.900
Traverse!

748
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.270
Go, provide thy money.

749
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:35.430
We'll have more of this to-morrow.

750
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:36.530
Adieu.

751
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.930
Where shall we meet i' the morning?

752
00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.030
At my lodging.

753
00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.370
I'll be with thee betimes.

754
00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:41.470
Go to; farewell.

755
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:42.570
Do you hear, Roderigo?

756
00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.730
What say you?

757
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:46.230
No more of drowning, do you hear?

758
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.400
I am changed.

759
00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.470
Go to, fare well.

760
00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.030
Provide thy money.

761
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.000
I'll sell all my land.

762
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.830
Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:

763
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.770
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,

764
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.370
If I would time expend with such a snipe.

765
00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:13.570
But for my sport and profit.

766
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.200
I hate the Moor:

767
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.700
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets

768
00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.430
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;

769
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:33.070
Yet I, for mere suspicion of that kind,

770
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.570
Will do as if for surety.

771
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:38.600
He holds me well;

772
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.330
The better shall my purpose work on him.

773
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:49.230
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:

774
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:54.130
To get his place and to plume up my will

775
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.200
In the double knavery--

776
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.900
How, how?

777
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.170
Let's see--

778
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.900
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear

779
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.530
That he's too familiar with his wife.

780
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:16.500
He hath a person and smooth dispose To be suspected,

781
00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.270
framed to make women false.

782
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:23.370
The Moor of free and open nature,

783
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.530
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,

784
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:29.330
And will be as tenderly be led by the nose

785
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.670
As asses are.

786
00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.500
I have't.

787
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.430
It is engender'd.

788
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.500
Hell and night

789
00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.170
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

790
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.470
What from the cape can you discern at sea?

791
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.430
Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;

792
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.430
I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,

793
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:13.730
Descry a sail.

794
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:15.270
Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;

795
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:17.100
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:

796
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.570
If that the Turkish fleet

797
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.400
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:

798
00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.100
It is impossible they bear it out.

799
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:24.500
News, lads!

800
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.070
Our wars are done.

801
00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:28.300
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,

802
00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.230
That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice

803
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.030
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance

804
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.200
On most part of their fleet.

805
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.400
How! Is this true?

806
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.600
The ship is here put in,

807
00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.330
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,

808
00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:39.770
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,

809
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:41.670
Is come ashore: the Moor himself at sea,

810
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.230
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

811
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.570
I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.

812
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.330
But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort

813
00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:49.570
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,

814
00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:51.770
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted

815
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:52.900
With foul and violent tempest.

816
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.270
Pray heavens he be;

817
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.870
For I have served him, and the man commands like a full soldier.

818
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.330
Let's to the seaside, ho!

819
00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:59.870
As well to see the vessel that's come in

820
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.700
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,

821
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.000
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue an indistinct regard.

822
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.230
Come, let's do so:

823
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.030
For every minute is expectancy of more arrivance.

824
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.530
Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,

825
00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.670
That so approve the Moor!

826
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:12.770
O, let the heavens

827
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.370
Give him defence against the elements,

828
00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.870
For I have lost him on a dangerous sea.

829
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.200
Is he well shipp'd?

830
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.630
His bark is stoutly timber'd, and his pilot

831
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.030
Of very expert and approved allowance;

832
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.470
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,

833
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.900
Stand in bold cure.

834
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.930
The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea

835
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.330
Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'

836
00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:30.700
My hopes do shape him for the governor.

837
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.970
They do discharge their shot of courtesy:

838
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.100
Our friends at least.

839
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.270
I pray you, sir, go forth,

840
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.600
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

841
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.830
I shall.

842
00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.730
But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

843
00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.900
Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid

844
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.330
That paragons description and wild fame;

845
00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.500
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,

846
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.400
And in the essential vesture of creation

847
00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.370
Does tire the ingener.

848
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:51.570
Now! Who has put in?

849
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:53.800
One Iago, ancient to the general.

850
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.530
Has had most favourable and happy speed:

851
00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.570
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,

852
00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.770
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--

853
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:03.130
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel--

854
00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.730
As having sense of beauty, do omit

855
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.930
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by

856
00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.770
The divine Desdemona.

857
00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.600
What is she?

858
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.730
She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,

859
00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.130
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,

860
00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.100
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts

861
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:18.570
A se'nnight's speed.

862
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.970
Great Jove, Othello guard,

863
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.700
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,

864
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.230
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,

865
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.370
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,

866
00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:30.000
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits

867
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.430
And bring all Cyprus comfort!

868
00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:34.230
O, behold,

869
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.330
The riches of the ship is come ashore!

870
00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:36.430
Hail to thee, lady!

871
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.630
And the grace of heaven,

872
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:38.900
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,

873
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.000
Enwheel thee round!

874
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.230
I thank you, valiant Cassio.

875
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.400
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

876
00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.630
He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught

877
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:45.930
But that he's well and will be shortly here.

878
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.030
O, but I fear--

879
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.300
How lost you company?

880
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.800
The great contention of the sea and skies

881
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.500
Parted our fellowship--

882
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:52.800
So speaks this voice.

883
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.900
See for the news.

884
00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:56.500
Good ancient, you are welcome.

885
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:58.200
Welcome, mistress.

886
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:02.100
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,

887
00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:04.070
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding

888
00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.430
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.

889
00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:09.200
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips

890
00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.130
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,

891
00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.230
You'll have enough.

892
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.300
Alas, she has no speech.

893
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.570
I know too much.

894
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.930
I find it ay, when I have list to sleep:

895
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:19.670
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,

896
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.570
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,

897
00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.730
And chides with thinking.

898
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.700
You have little cause to say so.

899
00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.900
Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,

900
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:32.230
Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,

901
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.570
Saints in your injuries, devils being offended,

902
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.330
Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.

903
00:39:38.330 --> 00:39:40.130
O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

904
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.470
Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:

905
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.430
You rise to play and go to bed to work.

906
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:46.030
You shall not write my praise.

907
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.100
No, let me not.

908
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.070
What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?

909
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.170
O gentle lady, do not put me to't;

910
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.100
For I am nothing, if not critical.

911
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.100
Come on assay.

912
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.370
There's one gone to the harbour?

913
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.730
Ay, madam.

914
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.300
I am not merry; but do beguile

915
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.770
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.

916
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:11.070
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

917
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.370
I am about it; but indeed my invention

918
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.870
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;

919
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:19.570
It plucks out brain and all: but my Muse labours,

920
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.370
And thus it is deliver'd.

921
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:25.600
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,

922
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.030
The one's for use, the other useth it.

923
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:28.830
Well praised!

924
00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:30.930
How if black and witty?

925
00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:32.300
If she be black, and thereto have a wit,

926
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.130
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

927
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.030
Worse and worse.

928
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.400
How if fair and foolish?

929
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.300
She never yet was foolish that was fair;

930
00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.600
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

931
00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.330
These are old fond paradoxes

932
00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:47.530
to make fools laugh i' the alehouse.

933
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.200
Do not learn of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband.

934
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.830
How say you, Cassio?

935
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:55.630
Is he not a most profane and liberal counsellor?

936
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.230
He speaks home, madam:

937
00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.300
You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar.

938
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:06.800
He takes her by the palm: ay, well said, whisper:

939
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.070
with as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly

940
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.870
as Cassio.

941
00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.000
Ay, smile upon her, do;

942
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.930
I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.

943
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.800
You say true; 'tis so, indeed:

944
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.600
if such tricks as these will strip you

945
00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.600
of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not

946
00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.830
kissed your three fingers so oft,

947
00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:36.870
which now again you are most apt to play the sir in.

948
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:38.930
Very good; well kissed!

949
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.400
An excellent courtesy!

950
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.730
'Tis so, indeed.

951
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.170
Yet again your fingers are to your lips?

952
00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:49.930
Would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!

953
00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.600
The Moor!

954
00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:52.700
I know his trumpet.

955
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.800
'Tis truly so.

956
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.070
Let's meet him and receive him.

957
00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.530
Lo, where he comes!

958
00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:20.670
O my fair warrior!

959
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.830
My dear Othello!

960
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.570
It gives me wonder great as my content

961
00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.470
To see you here before me.

962
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.000
O my soul's joy!

963
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.800
If after every tempest come such calms,

964
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.530
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!

965
00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:41.730
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas

966
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:44.770
Olympus-high and duck again as low

967
00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.930
As hell's from heaven!

968
00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.700
If it were now to die,

969
00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.100
'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,

970
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:56.770
My soul hath her content so absolute

971
00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:59.430
That not another comfort like to this

972
00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.770
Succeeds in unknown fate.

973
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.070
The heavens forbid

974
00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.400
But that our loves and comforts should increase,

975
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:07.000
Even as our days do grow!

976
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.430
Amen to that, sweet powers!

977
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.770
I cannot speak enough of this content;

978
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:18.570
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:

979
00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:19.570
And this,

980
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:22.070
and this,

981
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.000
the greatest discords be

982
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.230
That e'er our hearts shall make!

983
00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:35.400
O, you are well tuned now!

984
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.700
I'll set down the pegs that make this music,

985
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.570
As honest as I am.

986
00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:46.700
News, friends; our wars are done,

987
00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.670
the Turks are drown'd.

988
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:56.370
How do my old acquaintance of the isle?

989
00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.200
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;

990
00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.300
I have found great love amongst them.

991
00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.700
O my sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I dote

992
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.030
In mine own comforts.

993
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.130
I prithee, good Iago,

994
00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.470
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:

995
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:17.430
Bring thou the master to the citadel;

996
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:19.100
He is a good one, and his worthiness

997
00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.500
Does challenge much respect.

998
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.230
Come, Desdemona,

999
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:29.700
Once more, well met at Cyprus.

1000
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.830
Do thou meet me presently at the harbour.

1001
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:42.470
Come hither.

1002
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.430
as, they say,st valiant--

1003
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.700
base men being in love than have a nobility

1004
00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.100
in their natures more than is native to them--

1005
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.370
list me.

1006
00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.830
The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard--

1007
00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.630
first, I must tell thee this--

1008
00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.700
Desdemona is directly in love with him.

1009
00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.800
With him!

1010
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.170
Why, 'tis not possible.

1011
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:07.430
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.

1012
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:10.270
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,

1013
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.330
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:

1014
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.930
love him still for prating?

1015
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:19.600
Let not thy discreet heart think so.

1016
00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.770
Her eye must be fed;

1017
00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:24.900
and what delight shall she have to look on the devil?

1018
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.370
When the blood is made dull with the act of sport,

1019
00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:29.430
there should be, again to inflame it

1020
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.870
and to give satiety a fresh appetite,

1021
00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.300
loveliness in favour, sympathy in years,

1022
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:40.100
manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in:

1023
00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:44.900
now, for want of these required conveniences,

1024
00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:48.430
her delicate tenderness will find itself abused,

1025
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:51.670
begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor;

1026
00:45:51.670 --> 00:45:53.970
very nature will instruct her in it

1027
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:57.400
and compel her to some second choice.

1028
00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.270
Now, sir, this granted-- as it is a most pregnant

1029
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:04.300
and unforward position-- who stands eminent

1030
00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.830
in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does?

1031
00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.770
A knave very voluble; no further conscionable

1032
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.200
than in putting on the mere form

1033
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.930
of civil and humane seeming,

1034
00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:16.930
for the better compassing of his salt

1035
00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.600
and most hidden loose affections?

1036
00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:28.000
Why, none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave,

1037
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.700
a finder out of occasion, that has an eye can stamp

1038
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.300
and counterfeit advantages,

1039
00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.770
though true advantage never present itself;

1040
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:39.030
a devilish knave.

1041
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.370
Besides, the knave is handsome, young,

1042
00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.730
and hath all those requisites in him

1043
00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:47.070
that folly and green minds look after:

1044
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.230
a pestilent complete knave;

1045
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:52.830
and the woman hath found him already.

1046
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.370
I cannot believe that in her;

1047
00:46:54.370 --> 00:46:56.800
she's full of most blessed condition.

1048
00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.500
Blessed fig's-end!

1049
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.130
The wine she drinks is made of grapes:

1050
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.570
if she had been blessed,

1051
00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:06.570
she would never have loved the Moor.

1052
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.430
Blessed pudding!

1053
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:11.630
Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?

1054
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:12.800
Didst not mark that?

1055
00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.900
Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

1056
00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:21.430
Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue

1057
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.800
to the history of lust and foul thoughts.

1058
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.870
They met so near with their lips

1059
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:30.370
that their breaths embraced together.

1060
00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:32.730
Villanous thoughts, Roderigo!

1061
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:36.030
When these mutualities so marshal the way,

1062
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:40.170
hard at hand comes the master and main exercise,

1063
00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:43.400
the incorporate conclusion, Pish!

1064
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:52.600
But, sir, be you ruled by me: I have brought you from Venice.

1065
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.400
Watch you to-night; for the command,

1066
00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.500
I'll lay't upon you.

1067
00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.100
Cassio knows you not.

1068
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.330
I'll not be far from you:

1069
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:04.130
find some occasion to anger Cassio,

1070
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:07.570
either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline;

1071
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:09.670
or from what other course you please,

1072
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:11.670
as the time will more favourably minister.

1073
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.000
Well.

1074
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.030
Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler,

1075
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:17.800
and haply with his truncheon may strike at you:

1076
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.870
provoke him, that he may; for even out of that

1077
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:24.170
will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny;

1078
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:27.200
whose qualification shall come into no true taste again

1079
00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:31.470
but by the displanting of Cassio.

1080
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.930
So shall you have a shorter journey

1081
00:48:34.930 --> 00:48:39.430
to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them;

1082
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.830
and the impediment most profitably removed,

1083
00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:46.300
without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.

1084
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.070
I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity.

1085
00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:50.600
I warrant thee.

1086
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.200
Meet me by and by at the citadel:

1087
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.030
I must fetch his necessaries ashore.

1088
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.170
Farewell.

1089
00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:57.230
Adieu.

1090
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:07.200
That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;

1091
00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:12.170
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:

1092
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:16.170
The Moor, howbeit I endure him not,

1093
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:20.100
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,

1094
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.070
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona

1095
00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:25.330
A most dear husband.

1096
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:26.930
Now, I do love her too;

1097
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:30.600
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure

1098
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.900
I stand accountant for as great a sin,

1099
00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:36.630
But partly led to diet my revenge,

1100
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.800
For that I do suspect the lustful Moor

1101
00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:43.630
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof

1102
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.870
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;

1103
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:50.000
And nothing can or shall content my soul

1104
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.230
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,

1105
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:57.870
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor

1106
00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.370
At least into a jealousy so strong

1107
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:04.030
That judgment cannot cure.

1108
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:05.870
Which thing to do,

1109
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.930
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash

1110
00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:12.470
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,

1111
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:16.500
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,

1112
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.330
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--

1113
00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:23.130
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--

1114
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:30.330
Make the Moor thank me, love me, reward me.

1115
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:34.700
For making him egregiously an ass

1116
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.730
And practising upon his peace and quiet

1117
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:41.600
Even unto madness.

1118
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.770
'Tis here, but yet confused:

1119
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:53.400
Knavery's plain face is never seen til used.

1120
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.000
Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:

1121
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.570
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,

1122
00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:32.430
Not to outsport discretion.

1123
00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:33.800
Iago hath direction what to do;

1124
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:35.370
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye

1125
00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:36.470
Will I look to't.

1126
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:38.130
Iago is most honest.

1127
00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:41.170
Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest

1128
00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:43.400
Let me have speech with you.

1129
00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:52.230
Come, my dear love,

1130
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:56.600
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;

1131
00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.070
That profit's yet to come 'twixt me and you.

1132
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:08.430
Good night.

1133
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:09.430
Good night.

1134
00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:16.770
To the watch.

1135
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:20.000
Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the clock.

1136
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.430
Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona;

1137
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:25.670
who let us not therefore blame:

1138
00:52:25.670 --> 00:52:28.700
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her;

1139
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.530
and she is sport for Jove.

1140
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:32.030
She's a most exquisite lady.

1141
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:34.100
And, I'll warrant her, full of game.

1142
00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.830
Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

1143
00:52:35.830 --> 00:52:37.070
What an eye she has!

1144
00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:39.470
Methinks it sounds a parley of provocation.

1145
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:41.300
An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

1146
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.730
And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

1147
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.000
She is indeed perfection.

1148
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.400
Well, happiness to their sheets!

1149
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.670
Come, lieutenant, I have a stoup of wine;

1150
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.130
and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants

1151
00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:55.030
who would fain have a measure to the health of the black Othello.

1152
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.470
Not to-night, good Iago:

1153
00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.730
I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking:

1154
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:00.230
I could well wish courtesy would invent

1155
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.030
some other custom of entertainment.

1156
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:04.570
O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for you.

1157
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:06.330
I have drunk but one cup to-night,

1158
00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.470
and that was craftily qualified too, and, behold,

1159
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:10.770
what innovation it makes here:

1160
00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:12.200
I am unfortunate in the infirmity,

1161
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.270
and dare not task my weakness with any more.

1162
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:15.500
What, man!

1163
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.230
'Tis a night of revels: the gallants desire it.

1164
00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:22.800
Where are they?

1165
00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.830
Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

1166
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:27.700
I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

1167
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:40.800
If I can fasten but one cup upon him,

1168
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.300
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,

1169
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.130
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence

1170
00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:48.070
As my young mistress' dog.

1171
00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:51.970
Now, my sick fool Roderigo,

1172
00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:56.900
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,

1173
00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:59.070
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused

1174
00:53:59.070 --> 00:54:02.600
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:

1175
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.870
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,

1176
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:10.300
That hold their honour in a wary distance,

1177
00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:12.530
The very elements of this warlike isle,

1178
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:15.500
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,

1179
00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:16.770
And they watch too.

1180
00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:21.030
Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,

1181
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:24.100
Am I to put our Cassio in some action

1182
00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:27.800
Which may offend the isle--

1183
00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.600
But here they come:

1184
00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.500
If consequence do but approve my dream,

1185
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:35.700
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

1186
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.930
'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

1187
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:41.870
Good faith, a little one; not past a pint,

1188
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:43.030
as I am a soldier.

1189
00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:44.230
Some wine, ho!

1190
00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:47.330
And let me the canakin clink;

1191
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.570
And let me the canakin clink

1192
00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:52.830
A soldier's a man; A life's but a span;

1193
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:55.370
Why, then, let a soldier drink.

1194
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:56.930
Some wine, boys!

1195
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:58.500
'Fore God, an excellent song.

1196
00:54:58.500 --> 00:54:59.670
I learned it in England, where, indeed,

1197
00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.470
they are most potent in potting:

1198
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:04.500
your Dane, your German, your swag-bellied Hollander--

1199
00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.530
Drink-- are nothing to your English.

1200
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.430
Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

1201
00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.930
He'll drink you, with facility, your Dane dead drunk;

1202
00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:15.270
he sweats not to overthrow your Almain;

1203
00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.400
he'll give your Hollander a vomit,

1204
00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.500
ere the next pottle can be filled.

1205
00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:20.900
To the health of our general!

1206
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.670
I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.

1207
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:26.670
O sweet England!

1208
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:29.200
King Stephen was a worthy peer,

1209
00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.700
His breeches cost him but a crown;

1210
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.530
He held them sixpence all too dear,

1211
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.570
With that he call'd the tailor lown.

1212
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:38.970
He was a wight of high renown,

1213
00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:40.800
And thou art but of low degree:

1214
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.870
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;

1215
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.370
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.

1216
00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:47.370
Some wine!

1217
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:49.470
A more exquisite song than the other.

1218
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:50.700
Will you hear't again?

1219
00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:53.570
No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place

1220
00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.130
that does those things.

1221
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:56.430
Well, God's above all;

1222
00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:58.670
and there be souls must be saved,

1223
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:59.930
and there be souls must not be saved.

1224
00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:01.470
It's true, good lieutenant.

1225
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:04.100
For mine own part-- no offence to the general,

1226
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:08.170
nor any man of quality-- I am to be saved.

1227
00:56:08.170 --> 00:56:10.100
And so do I too, lieutenant.

1228
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.630
Ay, but, by your leave, not before me;

1229
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:16.100
the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient.

1230
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:20.630
Let's have no more of this; let's to our affairs--

1231
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:21.870
God, forgive us our sins!--

1232
00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:23.670
Gentlemen, let's look to our business.

1233
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.500
Do not think, gentlemen, that I am drunk:

1234
00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.930
this is my ancient; this is my right hand,

1235
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:31.730
and this is my left: I am not drunk now;

1236
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.630
I can stand well enough, and I can speak well enough.

1237
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:38.600
All Excellent well.

1238
00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:40.530
Very well then;

1239
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.400
you must not think that I am drunk.

1240
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:55.300
You see this fellow who is gone before;

1241
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:57.700
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar

1242
00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:02.470
And give direction: and do but see his vice;

1243
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.370
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,

1244
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:07.330
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.

1245
00:57:07.330 --> 00:57:10.130
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.

1246
00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:12.030
On some odd time of his infirmity,

1247
00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:13.300
Will shake this island.

1248
00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.430
But is he often thus?

1249
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.270
'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:

1250
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:20.170
He'll watch the horologe a double set,

1251
00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:22.200
If drink rock not his cradle.

1252
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.170
It were well

1253
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:26.070
The general were put in mind of it.

1254
00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:27.270
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature

1255
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:31.130
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,

1256
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:33.400
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?

1257
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:36.400
How now, Roderigo!

1258
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.600
After the lieutenant; go.

1259
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:41.870
And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor

1260
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:43.670
Should hazard such a place as his own second

1261
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.400
With one of an ingraft infirmity:

1262
00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:50.900
It were an honest action to say so to the Moor.

1263
00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.370
Not I, for all this island:

1264
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:55.200
I do love Cassio well; and would do much

1265
00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.030
To cure him of this evil--

1266
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:58.170
What noise?

1267
00:57:58.170 --> 00:57:59.400
What's the matter, lieutenant?

1268
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.670
A knave teach me my duty!

1269
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:02.300
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

1270
00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:03.570
Beat me!

1271
00:58:03.570 --> 00:58:05.800
Dost thou prate, rogue?

1272
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.130
Nay, good lieutenant; I prithee, hold thy hand.

1273
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.930
Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.

1274
00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:16.400
Come, you're drunk.

1275
00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.070
God's will, gentlemen, help.

1276
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:21.630
Ho!--Lieutenant--sir-- Montano--sir;

1277
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.870
Help, masters!-- Here's a goodly--

1278
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:32.030
Lieutenant, sir, God's will, You'll be shamed forever.

1279
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:37.900
Ho! For your lives.

1280
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:51.830
From whence ariseth this?

1281
00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.570
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that

1282
00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:58.200
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?

1283
00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:02.430
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:

1284
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:06.130
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage

1285
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:10.100
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.

1286
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:13.600
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle

1287
00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.870
From her propriety.

1288
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:22.570
What is the matter, masters?

1289
00:59:25.270 --> 00:59:27.900
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,

1290
00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.200
Speak, who began this?

1291
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.470
On thy love, I charge thee.

1292
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:34.300
I do not know: friends all but now, even now,

1293
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:37.700
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom

1294
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.500
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--

1295
00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.430
As if some planet had unwitted men--

1296
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.970
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,

1297
00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:48.330
In opposition bloody.

1298
00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:49.570
I cannot speak

1299
00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:52.000
Any beginning to this peevish odds;

1300
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.470
And would in action glorious I had lost

1301
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:55.770
These legs that brought me to a part of it!

1302
01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:02.830
How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

1303
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.900
I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

1304
01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:14.400
Worthy Montano, you were wont to be civil;

1305
01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.200
The gravity and stillness of your youth

1306
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.600
The world hath noted, and your name is great

1307
01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.470
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,

1308
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.230
That you unlace your reputation thus

1309
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:26.600
And spend your rich opinion for the name

1310
01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:28.900
Of a night-brawler?

1311
01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:29.900
Give me answer to it.

1312
01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:35.700
Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:

1313
01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:39.200
Your officer, Iago, can inform you--

1314
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.830
While I spare breath, which something now offends me--

1315
01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:44.470
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught

1316
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:47.200
By me that's said or done amiss this night;

1317
01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.370
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,

1318
01:00:49.370 --> 01:00:51.170
And to defend ourselves it be a sin

1319
01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:54.070
When violence assails us.

1320
01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:56.400
Now, by heaven,

1321
01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.570
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;

1322
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:02.230
And passion, having my best judgment collied,

1323
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:03.970
Assays to lead the way:

1324
01:01:03.970 --> 01:01:06.130
Zounds, if I stir,

1325
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.070
Or but lift this arm, the best of you

1326
01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:09.300
Shall sink in my rebuke.

1327
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.670
Give me to know

1328
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:16.370
How this foul rout began, who set it on;

1329
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:18.000
And he that is approved in this offence,

1330
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.970
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,

1331
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.070
Shall lose me.

1332
01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:22.270
What, In a town of war,

1333
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:24.270
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,

1334
01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:27.100
To manage private and domestic quarrel,

1335
01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.730
At night, and on the court and guard of safety!

1336
01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:35.000
'Tis monstrous.

1337
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.130
Iago, who began't?

1338
01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.230
Partially affined, or leagued in office,

1339
01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.000
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,

1340
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.500
Thou art no soldier.

1341
01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.070
Touch me not so near:

1342
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.170
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth

1343
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.700
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;

1344
01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.770
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth

1345
01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.200
Shall nothing wrong him.

1346
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:58.770
Thus it is, general.

1347
01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:01.230
Montano and myself being in speech,

1348
01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.030
There comes a fellow crying out for help:

1349
01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:06.300
And Cassio following him with determined sword,

1350
01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:08.030
To execute upon him.

1351
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:09.330
Sir, this gentleman

1352
01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:12.130
Steps in to Cassio, to entreat his pause:

1353
01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:13.870
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,

1354
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:16.730
Lest by his clamour-- as it so fell out--

1355
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:19.130
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,

1356
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:21.130
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather

1357
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:23.500
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,

1358
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.900
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night

1359
01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:27.400
I ne'er might say before.

1360
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.300
When I came back-- For this was brief--

1361
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:31.470
I found them close together,

1362
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:34.230
At blow and thrust; even as again they were

1363
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:36.770
When you yourself did part them.

1364
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.270
More of this matter can I not report:

1365
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:43.700
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:

1366
01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:46.300
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,

1367
01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.900
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,

1368
01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.500
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received

1369
01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:55.970
From him that fled some strange indignity

1370
01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.970
That patience could not pass.

1371
01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:01.400
I know, Iago,

1372
01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:04.070
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,

1373
01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:05.600
Making it light to Cassio.

1374
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:11.870
Cassio, I love thee

1375
01:03:11.870 --> 01:03:15.370
But never more be officer of mine.

1376
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:20.770
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!

1377
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:25.030
I'll make thee an example.

1378
01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:26.630
What is the matter, dear?

1379
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:28.370
All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.

1380
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:29.900
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:

1381
01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:30.930
Lead him off.

1382
01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:41.600
Iago, look with care about the town,

1383
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.200
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.

1384
01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.200
Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life

1385
01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.030
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

1386
01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:26.500
What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

1387
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:31.100
Ay, past all surgery.

1388
01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.130
Marry, God forbid!

1389
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:39.800
Reputation, reputation,

1390
01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.030
I've lost my reputation!

1391
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:43.200
I have lost the immortal part of me,

1392
01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.200
and what remains is bestial.

1393
01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.470
My reputation, Iago, my reputation!

1394
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:52.770
As I am an honest man, I thought you had received

1395
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:54.430
some bodily wound;

1396
01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:59.070
there is more sense in that than in reputation.

1397
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:02.800
Reputation's an idle and most false imposition:

1398
01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.530
oft gained without merit, and lost without deserving:

1399
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:08.370
you have lost no reputation at all,

1400
01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:10.870
unless you repute yourself such a loser.

1401
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:12.370
What, man!

1402
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:15.530
There are ways to recover the general again:

1403
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:18.330
you are but now cast in his mood,

1404
01:05:18.330 --> 01:05:20.700
a punishment more in policy than in malice,

1405
01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.230
as one would beat one's offenceless dog

1406
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:25.470
to affright an imperious lion:

1407
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:26.970
sue to him again, and he's yours.

1408
01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:28.400
I will rather sue to be despised

1409
01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.330
than to deceive so good a commander with so slight,

1410
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.530
so drunken, and so indiscreet an officer.

1411
01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.670
Drunk?

1412
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.500
And speak parrot? And squabble?

1413
01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.300
Swagger? Swear?

1414
01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.930
And discourse fustian with one's own shadow?

1415
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:43.800
O thou invisible spirit of wine,

1416
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.070
if thou hast no name to be known by,

1417
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:46.930
let us call thee devil!

1418
01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.630
What was he that you followed with your sword?

1419
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:49.730
What had he done to you?

1420
01:05:49.730 --> 01:05:50.830
I know not.

1421
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:52.270
Is't possible?

1422
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:54.400
I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;

1423
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.630
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore.

1424
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:58.200
O God, that men should put an enemy in their mouths

1425
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:01.500
to steal away their brains!

1426
01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.200
That we should, with joy, pleasance revel and applause,

1427
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.000
transform ourselves into beasts!

1428
01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:10.170
Why, you are but now well enough:

1429
01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:11.270
how came you thus recovered?

1430
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.430
It hath pleased the devil drunkenness

1431
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.700
to give place to the devil wrath;

1432
01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.000
one unperfectness shows me another,

1433
01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.470
to make me frankly despise myself.

1434
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.770
Come, you are too severe a moraler:

1435
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:20.870
as the time, the place, and the condition

1436
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:23.070
of this country stands, I could heartily wish

1437
01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:26.730
this had not befallen; but, since it is as it is,

1438
01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:28.130
mend it for your own good.

1439
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:34.000
I will ask him for my place again;

1440
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.400
he shall tell me I am a drunkard.

1441
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.600
Had I as many mouths as Hydra,

1442
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.570
such an answer would stop them all.

1443
01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:41.270
To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool,

1444
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:43.670
and presently a beast!

1445
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:45.770
O strange!

1446
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:47.100
Every inordinate cup is unblessed

1447
01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.030
and the ingredient is a devil.

1448
01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:52.570
Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,

1449
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:56.330
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.

1450
01:06:56.330 --> 01:07:02.100
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

1451
01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.500
I have well approved it, sir.

1452
01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.470
I drunk!

1453
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:08.930
You or any man living may be drunk

1454
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:11.170
at some time, man.

1455
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:21.430
I shall tell you what you shall do.

1456
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:24.330
Our general's wife is now the general:

1457
01:07:24.330 --> 01:07:26.170
I may say so in this respect,

1458
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:29.330
that he hath devoted and given up himself

1459
01:07:29.330 --> 01:07:31.730
to the contemplation, mark, and denotement

1460
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:35.600
of her parts and graces: confess yourself freely to her;

1461
01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.870
importune her help to put you in your place again:

1462
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:43.970
she is of so free, so kind, so apt,

1463
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:45.700
so blessed a disposition,

1464
01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:48.330
she holds it a vice in her goodness

1465
01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:51.330
not to do more than she is requested:

1466
01:07:51.330 --> 01:07:55.300
this broken joint between you and her husband

1467
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.230
entreat her to splinter;

1468
01:07:57.230 --> 01:08:00.670
and, my fortune against any lay worth naming,

1469
01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:03.230
this crack of your love shallgrow stronger than it was before.

1470
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:04.730
You advise me well.

1471
01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:07.900
I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

1472
01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.600
I think it freely; and betimes in the morning

1473
01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.170
I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona

1474
01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.500
to undertake for me:

1475
01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:16.130
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

1476
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.270
You are in the right, lieutenant.

1477
01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:22.730
Good night; I must to the watch.

1478
01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:25.470
Good night, honest Iago.

1479
01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:38.770
And what's he then that says I play the villain?

1480
01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:41.130
When this advice is free I give, honest,

1481
01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:44.000
Probal to thinking and indeed the course

1482
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.430
To win the Moor again?

1483
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:46.630
For 'tis most easy

1484
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:49.400
The inclining Desdemona to subdue

1485
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.600
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful

1486
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.700
As the free elements.

1487
01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:55.200
And then for her

1488
01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:01.900
To win the Moor-- were't to renounce his baptism,

1489
01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.970
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,

1490
01:09:05.970 --> 01:09:08.770
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,

1491
01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:13.300
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,

1492
01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.670
Even as her appetite shall play the god

1493
01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:17.400
With his weak function.

1494
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:20.800
How am I then a villain

1495
01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.270
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,

1496
01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:24.600
Directly to his good?

1497
01:09:31.570 --> 01:09:33.530
Divinity of hell!

1498
01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:38.800
When devils will the blackest sins put on,

1499
01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.200
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,

1500
01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:48.700
As I do now: for whilst this honest fool

1501
01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:52.600
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes

1502
01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:56.930
And she for him pleads strongly with the Moor,

1503
01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:00.730
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,

1504
01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.930
That she repeals him for her body's lust;

1505
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:08.000
By how much she strives to do him good,

1506
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.470
She'll undo her credit with the Moor.

1507
01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:15.270
So shall I turn her virtue into pitch,

1508
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:18.600
And out of her own goodness make the net

1509
01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.730
That shall enmesh them all.

1510
01:10:28.530 --> 01:10:29.930
How now, Roderigo!

1511
01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:36.800
I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that hunts,

1512
01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.130
but one that fills up the cry.

1513
01:10:39.130 --> 01:10:41.030
My money is almost spent;

1514
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:44.300
I have been to-night exceedingly well cudgelled;

1515
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:45.770
and I think the issue will be,

1516
01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:48.730
I shall have so much experience for my pains as that comes to,

1517
01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:52.370
and so, with no money at all and a little more wit,

1518
01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:54.570
return again to Venice.

1519
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:58.730
How poor are they that have not patience!

1520
01:10:58.730 --> 01:11:03.000
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?

1521
01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.400
Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;

1522
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:11.330
And wit depends on dilatory time.

1523
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:13.200
Does't not go well?

1524
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.500
Cassio hath beaten thee.

1525
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.100
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:

1526
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.600
Though other things grow fair against the sun,

1527
01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.230
Yet fruits that blossom first shall first be ripe:

1528
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:29.730
Content thyself awhile.

1529
01:11:33.170 --> 01:11:37.970
By the mass, 'tis morning;

1530
01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:45.400
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.

1531
01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.530
Retire thee;

1532
01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:50.100
go where thou art billeted:

1533
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.470
Away, I say;

1534
01:11:55.030 --> 01:12:00.070
thou shalt know more hereafter: Nay, get thee gone.

1535
01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.800
Two things are to be done:

1536
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:14.800
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;

1537
01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800
I'll set her on;

1538
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:20.130
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,

1539
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:24.500
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find

1540
01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.970
Soliciting his wife:

1541
01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:33.030
ay, that's the way

1542
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:36.670
Dull not device with coldness and delay.

1543
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.400
Good morrow, good Lieutenant:

1544
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:11.700
I am sorry for your displeasure;

1545
01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:14.700
but all will sure be well.

1546
01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:17.370
The general and his wife are talking of it;

1547
01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:20.700
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,

1548
01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.870
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,

1549
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:24.770
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom

1550
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:29.000
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you

1551
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.170
And needs no other suitor but his likings

1552
01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.600
To take the safest occasion by the front

1553
01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:33.800
To bring you in again.

1554
01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.930
Yet, I beseech you,

1555
01:13:34.930 --> 01:13:36.870
Give me advantage of some brief discourse

1556
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:38.600
With Desdemona alone.

1557
01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:02.170
Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do

1558
01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:04.330
All my abilities in thy behalf.

1559
01:14:04.330 --> 01:14:06.370
Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,

1560
01:14:06.370 --> 01:14:07.570
As if the case were his.

1561
01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:09.170
O, that's an honest fellow.

1562
01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:10.470
Do not doubt, Cassio,

1563
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:11.700
But I will have my lord and you again

1564
01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:12.900
As friendly as you were.

1565
01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:14.070
Bounteous madam,

1566
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:15.430
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,

1567
01:14:15.430 --> 01:14:17.100
He's never any thing but your true servant.

1568
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:18.700
I know't; I thank you.

1569
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.870
You do love my lord:

1570
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:21.900
You have known him long; and be you well assured

1571
01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.070
You shall in strangeness stand no further off than in a polite distance.

1572
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.370
Ay, but, lady,

1573
01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:28.770
That policy may either last so long,

1574
01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:30.900
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,

1575
01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.300
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,

1576
01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.230
That, I being absent and my place supplied,

1577
01:14:35.230 --> 01:14:37.370
My general will forget my love and service.

1578
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:40.770
Do not doubt that; before Emilia here

1579
01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:43.500
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,

1580
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.870
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it

1581
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:48.830
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;

1582
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:52.070
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;

1583
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:54.630
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;

1584
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.200
I'll intermingle every thing he does

1585
01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.570
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;

1586
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:03.170
For thy solicitor shall rather die

1587
01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:04.730
Than give thy cause away.

1588
01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:06.430
Madam, here comes my lord.

1589
01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:12.400
Madam, I'll take my leave.

1590
01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.830
Nay, stay, and hear me speak.

1591
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:15.230
Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,

1592
01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:16.930
Unfit for mine own purposes.

1593
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:19.100
Well, do your discretion.

1594
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:21.930
I like not that.

1595
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:24.700
What dost thou say?

1596
01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:27.670
Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.

1597
01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.930
Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

1598
01:15:30.930 --> 01:15:32.430
Cassio, my lord!

1599
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:34.070
No, sure, I cannot think it,

1600
01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:35.930
That he would sneak away so guilty-like,

1601
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:37.530
Seeing you coming.

1602
01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:39.570
I do believe 'twas he.

1603
01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:46.630
How now, my lord!

1604
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:50.130
I have been talking with a suitor here,

1605
01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:54.330
A man who languishes in your displeasure.

1606
01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:55.900
Who is't you mean?

1607
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.030
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.

1608
01:15:58.030 --> 01:16:01.070
Good my lord,

1609
01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:02.970
If I have any grace or power to move you,

1610
01:16:02.970 --> 01:16:05.470
His present reconciliation take;

1611
01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:09.070
For if he be not one that truly loves you,

1612
01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:10.570
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,

1613
01:16:10.570 --> 01:16:13.870
I have no judgment of an honest face:

1614
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:15.230
I prithee, call him back.

1615
01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:16.600
Went he hence now?

1616
01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.330
Yes, faith; so humbled

1617
01:16:18.330 --> 01:16:19.900
That he hath left part of his grief with me,

1618
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:21.630
To suffer with him.

1619
01:16:21.630 --> 01:16:24.370
Good love, call him back.

1620
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:26.370
Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

1621
01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.430
But shall't be shortly?

1622
01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:31.570
The sooner, sweet, for you.

1623
01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:32.700
Shall't be to-night at supper?

1624
01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:34.200
No, not to-night.

1625
01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.300
To-morrow dinner, then?

1626
01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.530
No, I shall not dine at home;

1627
01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:39.030
I meet the captains at the citadel.

1628
01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:42.230
Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;

1629
01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:43.970
On Tuesday noon, or night; or Wednesday morn:

1630
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:46.770
I prithee, name the time, but let it not

1631
01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:49.670
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;

1632
01:16:49.670 --> 01:16:51.430
And yet his trespass, in our common reason--

1633
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:53.330
Save that, they say, the wars must make example

1634
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:55.130
Out of their best-- is not almost a fault

1635
01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:56.530
To incur a private cheque.

1636
01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:57.630
Shh.

1637
01:16:57.630 --> 01:16:58.900
When shall he come?

1638
01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:00.800
Tell me, Othello:

1639
01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.630
I wonder in my soul,

1640
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:04.370
What you would ask me, that I should deny,

1641
01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:05.500
Or stand so mammering on.

1642
01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:06.670
What!

1643
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:07.800
Michael Cassio,

1644
01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.130
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,

1645
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.530
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,

1646
01:17:11.530 --> 01:17:14.170
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do to bring him in!

1647
01:17:14.170 --> 01:17:15.400
If I a lady, I could do much--

1648
01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:20.730
Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;

1649
01:17:20.730 --> 01:17:22.270
I will deny thee nothing.

1650
01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:24.900
Why, this is not a boon;

1651
01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.870
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,

1652
01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:34.500
Or feed off nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,

1653
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.400
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit

1654
01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.530
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit

1655
01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:43.870
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,

1656
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:48.000
It will be full of poise and difficult weight

1657
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.300
And fearful to be granted.

1658
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:54.130
I will deny thee nothing:

1659
01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:56.670
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,

1660
01:17:56.670 --> 01:18:00.470
To leave me but a little to myself.

1661
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:03.200
Shall I deny you?

1662
01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.930
No: farewell, my lord.

1663
01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:07.800
Farewell, Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

1664
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:10.930
Emilia, come.

1665
01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:13.100
Be as your fancies teach you;

1666
01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.000
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

1667
01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.170
Excellent wretch!

1668
01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:31.600
Perdition catch my soul,

1669
01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.500
But I do love thee!

1670
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.300
And when I love thee not,

1671
01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:40.770
Chaos is come again.

1672
01:18:49.570 --> 01:18:51.500
My noble lord--

1673
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:53.670
What dost thou say, Iago?

1674
01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:55.670
Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,

1675
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:57.400
Know of your love?

1676
01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:01.630
He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

1677
01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:03.600
But for a satisfaction of my thought;

1678
01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.700
No further harm.

1679
01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:06.300
Why of thy thought, Iago?

1680
01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.630
I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

1681
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.800
O, yes; and went between us very often.

1682
01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.970
Indeed.

1683
01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:13.370
Indeed.

1684
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:18.370
Ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?

1685
01:19:18.370 --> 01:19:20.600
Is he not honest?

1686
01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:21.930
Honest, my lord?

1687
01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:23.970
Honest!

1688
01:19:23.970 --> 01:19:25.730
Ay, honest.

1689
01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:29.170
My lord, for aught I know.

1690
01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:36.400
What dost thou think?

1691
01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.470
Think, my lord?

1692
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:40.900
Think, my lord.

1693
01:19:40.900 --> 01:19:42.870
By heaven, he echoes me,

1694
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:45.200
As if there were some monster in his thought

1695
01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.470
Too hideous to be shown.

1696
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.470
Thou dost mean something:

1697
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:51.000
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,

1698
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.200
When Cassio left my wife:

1699
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:56.530
what didst not like?

1700
01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.200
And when I told thee he was of my counsel

1701
01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.530
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'

1702
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:04.400
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,

1703
01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.400
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain

1704
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.700
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,

1705
01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:10.800
Show me thy thought.

1706
01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.170
My lord, you know I love you.

1707
01:20:13.170 --> 01:20:14.470
I think thou dost;

1708
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:18.400
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,

1709
01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:20.370
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,

1710
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:24.870
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:

1711
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:27.500
For such things in a false disloyal knave

1712
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.670
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just

1713
01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:33.200
They are close delations, working from the heart

1714
01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.030
That passion cannot rule.

1715
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.330
For Michael Cassio,

1716
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:39.200
I dare presume I think he is honest.

1717
01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.870
I think so too.

1718
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:43.730
Men should be what they seem;

1719
01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:48.100
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

1720
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:51.570
Certain, men should be what they seem.

1721
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:54.370
Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

1722
01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:59.270
Nay, yet there's more in this:

1723
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:04.170
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,

1724
01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:07.030
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts

1725
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:08.230
The worst of words.

1726
01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:10.870
Good my lord, pardon me:

1727
01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:12.530
Though I am bound to every act of duty,

1728
01:21:12.530 --> 01:21:15.100
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.

1729
01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.670
Utter my thoughts?

1730
01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:20.400
Why, say they are vile and false;

1731
01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.700
As where's that palace whereinto foul things

1732
01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.070
Sometimes intrude not?

1733
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:26.700
Who has that breast so pure,

1734
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.770
But some uncleanly apprehensions

1735
01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:30.900
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit

1736
01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.500
With meditations lawful?

1737
01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:34.470
Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,

1738
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:37.730
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear

1739
01:21:37.730 --> 01:21:39.070
A stranger to thy thoughts.

1740
01:21:39.070 --> 01:21:41.830
I do beseech you--

1741
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.630
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,

1742
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:47.730
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague

1743
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:51.770
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy

1744
01:21:51.770 --> 01:21:53.930
Shapes faults which are not--

1745
01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:55.130
that your wisdom yet,

1746
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:56.930
From one that so imperfectly conjects,

1747
01:21:56.930 --> 01:21:59.430
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble

1748
01:21:59.430 --> 01:22:02.430
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.

1749
01:22:02.430 --> 01:22:06.230
It were not for your quiet nor your good,

1750
01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:08.300
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,

1751
01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.700
To let you know my thoughts.

1752
01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:12.730
What dost thou mean?

1753
01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:21.130
Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,

1754
01:22:21.130 --> 01:22:24.200
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:

1755
01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:28.500
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;

1756
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:32.200
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:

1757
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.270
But he that filches from me my good name

1758
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:37.900
Robs me of that which not enriches him

1759
01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.270
And makes me poor indeed.

1760
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:43.300
By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

1761
01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.400
You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;

1762
01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.970
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

1763
01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:51.900
Ha.

1764
01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.130
O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;

1765
01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:25.800
It is the green-eyed monster that doth mock

1766
01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.530
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss

1767
01:23:29.530 --> 01:23:32.130
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;

1768
01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:35.100
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er

1769
01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:39.900
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

1770
01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.570
O misery!

1771
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:44.830
Poor and content is rich and rich enough,

1772
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:47.700
But riches fineless is as poor as winter

1773
01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.570
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.

1774
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:52.970
Good God, the souls of all my tribe defend from jealousy!

1775
01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:59.870
Why, why is this?

1776
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:06.330
Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy,

1777
01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:08.730
To follow still the changes of the moon

1778
01:24:08.730 --> 01:24:10.400
With fresh suspicions?

1779
01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.070
No; to be once in doubt

1780
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:17.200
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,

1781
01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.500
When I shall turn the business of my soul

1782
01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.000
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,

1783
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.070
Matching thy inference.

1784
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:26.370
'Tis not to make me jealous

1785
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:28.830
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,

1786
01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:34.030
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;

1787
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:38.300
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:

1788
01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:41.170
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw

1789
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:45.630
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;

1790
01:24:45.630 --> 01:24:51.670
For she had eyes, and chose me.

1791
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:04.470
No, Iago; I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;

1792
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:08.300
And on the proof, there is no more but this--

1793
01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:12.230
Away at once with love or jealousy!

1794
01:25:12.230 --> 01:25:16.070
I am glad of this; for now I shall have reason

1795
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:17.700
To show the love and duty I bear you

1796
01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:22.230
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,

1797
01:25:22.230 --> 01:25:23.270
Receive it from me.

1798
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:26.530
I speak not yet of proof.

1799
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:34.770
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;

1800
01:25:34.770 --> 01:25:38.830
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:

1801
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:41.270
I would not have your free and noble nature,

1802
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:44.830
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:

1803
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:48.600
For I do know our country disposition well;

1804
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:51.370
In Venice they do let God see the pranks

1805
01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:54.300
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience

1806
01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.470
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

1807
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.770
Dost thou say so?

1808
01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:59.770
She deceived her father, marrying you;

1809
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:02.630
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,

1810
01:26:02.630 --> 01:26:04.430
She loved them most.

1811
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:06.930
And so she did.

1812
01:26:06.930 --> 01:26:08.230
Why, go to then;

1813
01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:11.630
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,

1814
01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:14.330
As to seal her father's eyes up close as oak--

1815
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:19.130
He thought 'twas witchcraft-- but I am much to blame;

1816
01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:21.500
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon

1817
01:26:21.500 --> 01:26:22.930
For too much loving you.

1818
01:26:22.930 --> 01:26:25.800
I am bound to thee for ever.

1819
01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.670
I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

1820
01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:33.030
No, not a jot, not a jot.

1821
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:34.570
I fear it has.

1822
01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:37.300
I hope you will consider what is spoke

1823
01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.430
Comes from my love.

1824
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:40.830
But I do see you are moved:

1825
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:44.770
I pray you not to strain my speech

1826
01:26:44.770 --> 01:26:46.730
To grosser issues nor to further reach

1827
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:48.030
Than to suspicion.

1828
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:49.300
I will not.

1829
01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:50.500
Should you do so, my lord,

1830
01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:53.300
My speech should fall into such vile success

1831
01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:54.730
As my thoughts aim not.

1832
01:26:54.730 --> 01:26:57.670
Cassio's my worthy friend--

1833
01:26:57.670 --> 01:26:59.530
My lord, I see you're moved.

1834
01:26:59.530 --> 01:27:03.400
No, not much moved:

1835
01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:06.030
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

1836
01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:07.430
Long live she so!

1837
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:09.070
And long live you to think so!

1838
01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:17.930
And yet, how nature erring from itself--

1839
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:24.070
Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--

1840
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:27.070
Not to affect many proposed matches

1841
01:27:27.070 --> 01:27:29.370
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,

1842
01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:31.900
Whereto we see in all things nature tends--

1843
01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:33.400
Foh!

1844
01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:37.670
One may smell in such a will most rank,

1845
01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:39.830
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.

1846
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:42.170
But pardon me; I do not in position

1847
01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:45.530
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear

1848
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:48.600
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,

1849
01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.730
May fall to match you with her country forms

1850
01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:54.470
And happily repent.

1851
01:27:54.470 --> 01:27:55.900
Farewell, farewell:

1852
01:27:55.900 --> 01:28:02.630
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;

1853
01:28:02.630 --> 01:28:08.630
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago.

1854
01:28:08.630 --> 01:28:10.200
My lord, I take my leave.

1855
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:16.570
Why did I marry?

1856
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:17.800
This honest creature doubtless

1857
01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.430
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

1858
01:28:21.430 --> 01:28:23.570
I would I might entreat you

1859
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:26.770
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:

1860
01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.970
Though it is fit that Cassio have his place,

1861
01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:33.170
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,

1862
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:36.470
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,

1863
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:39.630
You may by that perceive him and his means:

1864
01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:41.670
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment

1865
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:43.730
With any strong or vehement suit;

1866
01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:45.800
Much will be seen in that.

1867
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.970
In the mean time,

1868
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:49.430
Let me be thought too busy in my fears--

1869
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:51.900
As worthy cause I have to fear I am--

1870
01:28:51.900 --> 01:28:54.300
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

1871
01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.530
Fear not my government.

1872
01:28:56.530 --> 01:28:59.630
I once more take my leave.

1873
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:29.300
This fellow's of exceeding honesty,

1874
01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:32.130
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,

1875
01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:33.170
Of human dealings.

1876
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:42.070
If I do prove her haggard,

1877
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:46.330
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,

1878
01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:49.230
I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind,

1879
01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:53.300
To pray at fortune.

1880
01:29:57.430 --> 01:29:58.600
Haply, for I am black

1881
01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:02.200
And have not those soft parts of conversation

1882
01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:05.300
That chamberers have, or for I am declined

1883
01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:09.330
Into the vale of years-- yet that's not much--

1884
01:30:14.170 --> 01:30:18.130
She's gone.

1885
01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:22.530
I am abused; and my relief

1886
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:25.730
Must be to loathe her.

1887
01:30:29.670 --> 01:30:31.670
O curse of marriage,

1888
01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:34.500
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,

1889
01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:36.130
And not their appetites!

1890
01:30:38.130 --> 01:30:40.130
I had rather be a toad,

1891
01:30:40.130 --> 01:30:42.470
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,

1892
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:44.970
Than keep a corner in the thing I love

1893
01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:48.430
For others' uses.

1894
01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:54.230
Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;

1895
01:30:54.230 --> 01:30:57.170
Prerogatived are they less than the base;

1896
01:30:57.170 --> 01:31:00.830
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:

1897
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.400
Even then this forked plague is fated to us

1898
01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:10.630
When we do quicken.

1899
01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:14.500
Here she comes: and

1900
01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:18.900
If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!

1901
01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:21.130
I'll not believe't.

1902
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:31.200
How now, my dear Othello!

1903
01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:33.030
Your dinner, and the generous islanders

1904
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:35.230
By you invited, do attend your presence.

1905
01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:36.900
I am to blame.

1906
01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:40.830
Why do you speak so faintly?

1907
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:42.930
Are you not well?

1908
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:46.530
I have a pain upon my forehead here.

1909
01:31:46.530 --> 01:31:50.830
'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:

1910
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour

1911
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.170
It will be well.

1912
01:31:55.170 --> 01:31:56.330
Your napkin is too small:

1913
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:58.000
Let it alone.

1914
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.930
Come, I'll go in with you.

1915
01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:03.800
I am very sorry that you are not well.

1916
01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:19.770
I am glad I have found this napkin:

1917
01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:22.430
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:

1918
01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:27.000
My wayward husband hath a hundred times

1919
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.130
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,

1920
01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:33.470
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,

1921
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:35.770
That she reserves it evermore about her

1922
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:36.870
To kiss and talk to.

1923
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:41.600
I'll have the work ta'en out,

1924
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:45.730
And give't Iago: what he will do with it

1925
01:32:45.730 --> 01:32:47.630
Heaven knows, not I;

1926
01:32:47.630 --> 01:32:51.270
I nothing but to please his fantasy.

1927
01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:56.530
How now!

1928
01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:57.830
What do you here alone?

1929
01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:59.570
Do not you chide;

1930
01:33:04.630 --> 01:33:06.830
I have a thing for you.

1931
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:08.430
You have a thing for me?

1932
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:09.570
It is a common thing--

1933
01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:10.800
Ha?

1934
01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:12.500
To have a foolish wife.

1935
01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.200
O, is that all?

1936
01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:22.370
What will you give me now for that same handkerchief?

1937
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:24.000
What handkerchief?

1938
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:25.530
What handkerchief?

1939
01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:27.970
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;

1940
01:33:27.970 --> 01:33:32.200
That which so often you did bid me steal.

1941
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.770
Hast stol'n it from her?

1942
01:33:33.770 --> 01:33:37.170
No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.

1943
01:33:37.170 --> 01:33:41.270
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.

1944
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:44.070
Look, here it is.

1945
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:45.270
A good wench; give it me.

1946
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:49.830
Ah, ah, ah.

1947
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:52.570
What will you do with 't, that you have been so earnest

1948
01:33:52.570 --> 01:33:53.800
To have me filch it?

1949
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:56.030
Why, what's that to you?

1950
01:34:00.370 --> 01:34:02.330
If it be not for some purpose of import,

1951
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:05.030
Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad

1952
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:06.330
When she shall lack it.

1953
01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:10.530
Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.

1954
01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:13.800
Leave me.

1955
01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:31.070
In Cassio's lodging, I'll lose this napkin,

1956
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:32.300
And let him find it.

1957
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.300
Trifles light as air

1958
01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:42.430
Are to the jealous confirmations strong

1959
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:47.200
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.

1960
01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:52.600
The Moor already changes with my poison:

1961
01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.530
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons

1962
01:34:55.530 --> 01:34:58.500
that at first are scarce found to distaste,

1963
01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:04.630
But with a little act upon the blood.

1964
01:35:04.630 --> 01:35:06.470
Burn like the mines of Sulphur.

1965
01:35:08.230 --> 01:35:10.500
I did say so:

1966
01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:13.370
Look, where he comes!

1967
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:16.830
Not poppy, nor mandragora,

1968
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:19.070
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,

1969
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:21.300
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep

1970
01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:24.000
Which thou owedst yesterday.

1971
01:35:32.930 --> 01:35:35.600
Ha!

1972
01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:39.530
False to me,

1973
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:40.730
to me?

1974
01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:42.130
Why, how now, my lord.

1975
01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:43.300
No more of that.

1976
01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:44.770
Avaunt!

1977
01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:46.070
Be gone!

1978
01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:54.100
Thou hast set me on the rack:

1979
01:35:57.830 --> 01:36:00.330
I swear 'tis better to be much abused

1980
01:36:00.330 --> 01:36:02.970
Than but to know't a little.

1981
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:05.930
How now, my lord!

1982
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:09.430
What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?

1983
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:13.600
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:

1984
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:19.200
I slept the next night well, fed well, was free and merry;

1985
01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:24.700
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:

1986
01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:26.800
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,

1987
01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.430
Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.

1988
01:36:28.430 --> 01:36:29.770
I am sorry to hear this.

1989
01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:31.670
I had been happy, if the general camp,

1990
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:34.500
Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body,

1991
01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.030
So I had nothing known.

1992
01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:38.900
O, now, for ever

1993
01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:41.970
Farewell the tranquil mind!

1994
01:36:41.970 --> 01:36:44.000
Farewell content!

1995
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:51.230
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,

1996
01:36:51.230 --> 01:36:54.730
That makes ambition virtue!

1997
01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:56.100
O, farewell!

1998
01:36:57.730 --> 01:37:00.900
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,

1999
01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:03.800
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,

2000
01:37:05.630 --> 01:37:08.670
The royal banner, and all quality,

2001
01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:11.770
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!

2002
01:37:14.770 --> 01:37:16.870
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats

2003
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:20.070
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,

2004
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:22.200
Farewell!

2005
01:37:25.130 --> 01:37:28.170
Othello's occupation's gone!

2006
01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:29.370
Is't possible, my lord?

2007
01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:31.470
Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,

2008
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:33.370
Be sure of it;

2009
01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:35.370
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,

2010
01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:37.070
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog

2011
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:38.200
Than answer my waked wrath!

2012
01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.800
Is't come to this?

2013
01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.270
Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,

2014
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:44.300
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop

2015
01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:47.600
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

2016
01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.770
My noble lord--

2017
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:50.900
If thou dost slander her and torture me,

2018
01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:53.330
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;

2019
01:37:53.330 --> 01:37:55.370
On horror's head horrors accumulate;

2020
01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:58.130
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;

2021
01:37:58.130 --> 01:38:00.400
For nothing canst thou to damnation add

2022
01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.900
Greater than that.

2023
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:05.430
O grace!

2024
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:07.570
O heaven forgive me!

2025
01:38:07.570 --> 01:38:09.170
Are you a man?

2026
01:38:09.170 --> 01:38:11.630
Have you a soul or sense?

2027
01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:15.430
God be wi' you; take mine office.

2028
01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:17.770
O wretched fool.

2029
01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:19.930
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!

2030
01:38:19.930 --> 01:38:22.270
O monstrous world!

2031
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:25.000
Take note, take note, O world,

2032
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.030
To be direct and honest is not safe.

2033
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:31.000
I thank you for this profit; and from hence

2034
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.500
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

2035
01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:38.330
Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

2036
01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:40.130
I should be wise, for honesty's a fool

2037
01:38:40.130 --> 01:38:41.570
And loses that it works for.

2038
01:38:41.570 --> 01:38:44.030
By the world, I think my wife be honest and think she is not;

2039
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:46.600
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.

2040
01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:47.900
I'll have some proof.

2041
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:52.670
Her name, that was as fresh

2042
01:38:52.670 --> 01:38:54.700
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black

2043
01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:55.830
As mine own face.

2044
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:56.930
If there be cords, or knives,

2045
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:58.900
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,

2046
01:38:58.900 --> 01:39:00.570
I'll not endure it.

2047
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:02.330
Would I were satisfied!

2048
01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:05.430
I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:

2049
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:08.000
I regret me that I ever put it to you.

2050
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.230
You would be satisfied?

2051
01:39:10.230 --> 01:39:12.200
Nay, and I will.

2052
01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:13.470
And may: but, how?

2053
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:15.330
How satisfied?

2054
01:39:15.330 --> 01:39:17.400
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--

2055
01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:18.600
Behold her topp'd?

2056
01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.500
Death and damnation!

2057
01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.400
It were a tedious difficulty, I think,

2058
01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.130
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,

2059
01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:27.700
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster

2060
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:28.830
More than their own!

2061
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:30.400
What then?

2062
01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.500
How then?

2063
01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:32.800
What shall I say?

2064
01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.730
Where's satisfaction?

2065
01:39:34.730 --> 01:39:36.630
It is impossible you should see this,

2066
01:39:36.630 --> 01:39:39.570
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,

2067
01:39:39.570 --> 01:39:41.970
As salt as wolves in pride,

2068
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:47.170
and fools as gross as ignorance made drunk.

2069
01:39:47.170 --> 01:39:49.430
But yet, I say,

2070
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:53.670
If imputation and strong circumstances,

2071
01:39:53.670 --> 01:39:55.830
Which lead directly to the door of truth,

2072
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:59.930
Will give you satisfaction, you might have't.

2073
01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:07.770
You give me a living reason she's disloyal.

2074
01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:10.530
I do not like the office:

2075
01:40:10.530 --> 01:40:14.270
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,

2076
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:17.870
Prick'd to' by foolish honesty and love,

2077
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:19.100
I will go on.

2078
01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:27.670
I lay with Cassio lately;

2079
01:40:27.670 --> 01:40:30.030
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,

2080
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:32.430
I could not sleep.

2081
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:34.700
There are a kind of men so loose of souls,

2082
01:40:34.700 --> 01:40:37.470
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:

2083
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:39.870
One of this kind is Cassio:

2084
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:46.230
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,

2085
01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:48.930
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves';

2086
01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:50.930
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,

2087
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:52.030
Cried 'O sweet creature!'

2088
01:40:52.030 --> 01:40:54.230
And then kiss me hard,

2089
01:40:54.230 --> 01:40:55.530
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots

2090
01:40:55.530 --> 01:40:59.030
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg

2091
01:40:59.030 --> 01:41:04.630
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then

2092
01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:08.630
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

2093
01:41:08.630 --> 01:41:10.630
O monstrous!

2094
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:11.800
Monstrous!

2095
01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.400
Nay, this was but his dream.

2096
01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.500
But this denoted a foregone conclusion:

2097
01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:18.400
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

2098
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.770
And this may help to thicken other proofs

2099
01:41:20.770 --> 01:41:22.500
That do demonstrate thinly.

2100
01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.930
I'll tear her all to pieces.

2101
01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:27.770
Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;

2102
01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:29.370
She may be honest yet.

2103
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:33.630
Tell me but this,

2104
01:41:33.630 --> 01:41:36.070
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief

2105
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:38.300
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

2106
01:41:41.930 --> 01:41:47.700
I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

2107
01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:53.870
I know not that; yet such a handkerchief--

2108
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:59.470
I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day

2109
01:41:59.470 --> 01:42:02.270
See Cassio wipe his beard with.

2110
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:06.670
If it be that--

2111
01:42:06.670 --> 01:42:09.700
If it be that, or any that was hers,

2112
01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:12.830
It speaks against her with the other proofs.

2113
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:21.270
O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!

2114
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:25.630
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.

2115
01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.870
Now, look here, Iago;

2116
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:36.700
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.

2117
01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:39.100
'Tis gone.

2118
01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:45.630
Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!

2119
01:42:45.630 --> 01:42:48.570
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne

2120
01:42:48.570 --> 01:42:50.330
To tyrannous hate!

2121
01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:52.370
Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,

2122
01:42:52.370 --> 01:42:54.030
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

2123
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:55.170
Yet be content.

2124
01:42:55.170 --> 01:42:57.100
Blood, blood, blood!

2125
01:42:57.100 --> 01:42:59.600
Patience, your mind perhaps may change.

2126
01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:00.830
Never, Iago:

2127
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:02.430
Like to the Pontic sea,

2128
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:04.870
Whose icy current and compulsive course

2129
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:07.670
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on

2130
01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:10.100
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,

2131
01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:12.970
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,

2132
01:43:12.970 --> 01:43:16.170
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,

2133
01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:18.770
Till that a capable and wide revenge

2134
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:21.630
Swallow them up.

2135
01:43:26.970 --> 01:43:29.370
Now, by yond marble heaven,

2136
01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:31.370
In the due reverence of a sacred vow

2137
01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:32.500
I here engage my words.

2138
01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:35.670
Do not rise yet.

2139
01:43:35.670 --> 01:43:38.930
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,

2140
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:41.570
You elements that clip us round about,

2141
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:44.970
Witness that here Iago doth give up

2142
01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:48.470
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,

2143
01:43:48.470 --> 01:43:51.530
To wrong'd Othello's service!

2144
01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:53.100
Let him command,

2145
01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.400
And to obey shall be in me remorse,

2146
01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:57.400
What bloody business ever.

2147
01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.900
I greet thy love,

2148
01:44:04.900 --> 01:44:10.430
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,

2149
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:12.800
And will upon the instant put thee to't:

2150
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:19.100
Within these three days let me hear thee say

2151
01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:23.900
That Cassio's not alive.

2152
01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.830
My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:

2153
01:44:26.830 --> 01:44:28.070
But let her live.

2154
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:31.670
Damn her, lewd minx!

2155
01:44:34.930 --> 01:44:39.400
Damn her! Damn her.

2156
01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:50.670
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,

2157
01:44:50.670 --> 01:44:53.830
To furnish me with some quick means of death

2158
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:56.970
For the fair devil.

2159
01:44:56.970 --> 01:45:03.200
Now art thou my lieutenant.

2160
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:07.670
I am your own for ever.

2161
01:45:57.630 --> 01:46:00.500
Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

2162
01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.100
I know not, madam.

2163
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:06.170
Believe me, I'd rather have lose my purse

2164
01:46:06.170 --> 01:46:11.130
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor

2165
01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:14.470
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness

2166
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:16.100
As jealous creatures are, it were enough

2167
01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:17.700
To put him to ill thinking.

2168
01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:21.170
Is he not jealous?

2169
01:46:21.170 --> 01:46:22.900
Who, he?

2170
01:46:24.170 --> 01:46:25.500
I think the sun where he was born

2171
01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:27.000
Drew all such humours from him.

2172
01:46:31.630 --> 01:46:33.670
Look, where he comes.

2173
01:46:33.670 --> 01:46:35.170
I will not leave him now till Cassio

2174
01:46:35.170 --> 01:46:36.500
Be call'd to him.

2175
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:41.800
How is't with you, my lord?

2176
01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:43.230
Well, my good lady.

2177
01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.630
O, hardness to dissemble--

2178
01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:48.300
How do you, Desdemona?

2179
01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.170
Well, my good lord.

2180
01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:54.300
Give me thy hand:

2181
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:05.900
this hand is moist, my lady.

2182
01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:08.330
It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

2183
01:47:08.330 --> 01:47:13.270
This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:

2184
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:17.070
Hot, hot, and moist:

2185
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:22.070
this hand of yours requires

2186
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:25.570
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,

2187
01:47:25.570 --> 01:47:29.370
Much castigation, exercise devout;

2188
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:31.870
For here's a young and sweating devil here,

2189
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:34.070
That commonly rebels.

2190
01:47:35.170 --> 01:47:36.330
'Tis a good hand,

2191
01:47:36.330 --> 01:47:37.470
A frank one.

2192
01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:39.300
You may, indeed, say so;

2193
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:42.270
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

2194
01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:50.870
A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;

2195
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:57.200
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

2196
01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:02.730
I cannot speak of this.

2197
01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:04.930
Come now, your promise.

2198
01:48:04.930 --> 01:48:06.800
What promise, chuck?

2199
01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:09.530
I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

2200
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.830
I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;

2201
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:16.130
Lend me thy handkerchief.

2202
01:48:16.130 --> 01:48:17.230
Here, my lord.

2203
01:48:17.230 --> 01:48:18.470
That which I gave you.

2204
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:19.670
I have it not about me.

2205
01:48:19.670 --> 01:48:21.400
Not?

2206
01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:22.430
No, my lord.

2207
01:48:23.970 --> 01:48:25.530
That's a fault.

2208
01:48:25.530 --> 01:48:27.870
That handkerchief

2209
01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:30.800
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;

2210
01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.300
She was a charmer, and could almost read

2211
01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:34.830
The thoughts of people:

2212
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:37.500
She told her, while she kept it,

2213
01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:39.770
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father

2214
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:43.130
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it

2215
01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:48.200
Or made a gift of it, my father's eye

2216
01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:50.900
Should hold her loathly and his spirits should hunt

2217
01:48:50.900 --> 01:48:52.700
After new fancies:

2218
01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:55.600
she, dying, gave it me;

2219
01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:58.430
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,

2220
01:48:58.430 --> 01:49:01.400
I give it her.

2221
01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:05.100
I did so: and take heed on't;

2222
01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:08.670
Make it a darling like your precious eye;

2223
01:49:09.970 --> 01:49:13.330
To lose't or give't away were such perdition

2224
01:49:13.330 --> 01:49:15.870
As nothing else could match.

2225
01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:17.130
Is't possible?

2226
01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:19.870
'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:

2227
01:49:19.870 --> 01:49:22.030
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world

2228
01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:24.470
The sun to course two hundred compasses,

2229
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:28.300
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;

2230
01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:32.330
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;

2231
01:49:32.330 --> 01:49:35.530
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful

2232
01:49:35.530 --> 01:49:38.030
Conserved of maidens' hearts.

2233
01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:40.730
Is't true?

2234
01:49:40.730 --> 01:49:45.030
Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

2235
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.630
Then would to God that I had never seen't!

2236
01:49:49.630 --> 01:49:51.370
Ha!

2237
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:53.430
Wherefore?

2238
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:55.500
Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

2239
01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:56.670
Is't lost?

2240
01:49:56.670 --> 01:49:57.770
Is't gone?

2241
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:59.430
Speak, is it out o' the way?

2242
01:49:59.430 --> 01:50:01.200
Heaven bless us!

2243
01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.200
Say you?

2244
01:50:04.670 --> 01:50:07.800
It is not lost;

2245
01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:11.530
but what an if it were?

2246
01:50:11.530 --> 01:50:12.630
How!

2247
01:50:12.630 --> 01:50:13.870
I say, it is not lost.

2248
01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:14.930
Fetch't, let me see't.

2249
01:50:17.230 --> 01:50:18.430
Why, so I can, sir,

2250
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:25.570
but I will not now.

2251
01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:32.200
This is a trick to put me from my suit:

2252
01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:36.570
I pray you, let Cassio be received again.

2253
01:50:36.570 --> 01:50:38.170
Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

2254
01:50:38.170 --> 01:50:39.270
Come, come;

2255
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:40.700
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

2256
01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.800
The handkerchief!

2257
01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:42.900
I pray, talk me of Cassio.

2258
01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:44.000
The handkerchief!

2259
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:45.200
A man that all his time

2260
01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.830
Hath founded the good fortunes on your love,

2261
01:50:46.830 --> 01:50:48.430
Shared dangers with you--

2262
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:49.930
The handkerchief!

2263
01:50:49.930 --> 01:50:51.200
In faith, you are to blame.

2264
01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.400
Zounds!

2265
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.500
Is not this man jealous?

2266
01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:09.570
I ne'er saw this before.

2267
01:51:09.570 --> 01:51:12.070
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:

2268
01:51:12.070 --> 01:51:14.800
I am most unhappy at the loss of it.

2269
01:51:16.470 --> 01:51:19.800
'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:

2270
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:25.470
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;

2271
01:51:25.470 --> 01:51:27.330
They eat us hungerly, and when they are full,

2272
01:51:27.330 --> 01:51:28.730
They belch us.

2273
01:51:28.730 --> 01:51:32.230
Look you, Cassio and my husband,

2274
01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:37.230
There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:

2275
01:51:37.230 --> 01:51:39.300
And, lo, the happiness!

2276
01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:40.500
Go, and importune her.

2277
01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:45.700
How now, good Cassio!

2278
01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:47.330
What's the news with you?

2279
01:51:48.600 --> 01:51:51.200
Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you

2280
01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.900
That by your virtuous means I may again

2281
01:51:52.900 --> 01:51:54.730
Exist, and be a member of his love

2282
01:51:54.730 --> 01:51:56.100
Whom I with all the office of my heart

2283
01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:59.230
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.

2284
01:51:59.230 --> 01:52:00.770
If my offence be of such mortal kind

2285
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:03.100
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,

2286
01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:04.630
Nor purposed merit in futurity,

2287
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:05.870
Can ransom me into his love again,

2288
01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:07.030
But to know so must be my benefit;

2289
01:52:09.130 --> 01:52:11.100
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,

2290
01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:12.530
And shut myself up in some other course,

2291
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:13.700
To fortune's alms.

2292
01:52:13.700 --> 01:52:15.100
Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!

2293
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:16.700
My advocation is not now in tune;

2294
01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:20.830
My lord is not my lord; nor would I know him,

2295
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:23.270
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.

2296
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:26.400
So help me every spirit sanctified,

2297
01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.200
I've spoken for you all my best

2298
01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.000
And stood within the blank of his displeasure

2299
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:31.000
For my free speech!

2300
01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:34.030
You must awhile be patient:

2301
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:36.700
What I can do I will; and more I will

2302
01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:40.430
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

2303
01:52:41.630 --> 01:52:42.870
Is my lord angry?

2304
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:44.100
He went hence but now,

2305
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:46.530
And certainly in strange unquietness.

2306
01:52:46.530 --> 01:52:48.270
Can he be angry?

2307
01:52:48.270 --> 01:52:50.270
I have seen the cannon,

2308
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:52.300
When it has blown his ranks into the air,

2309
01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:54.500
And, like the devil, from his very arm

2310
01:52:54.500 --> 01:52:57.430
Puff'd his own brother-- is he angry?

2311
01:52:57.430 --> 01:53:01.600
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:

2312
01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:04.800
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

2313
01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:06.600
I prithee, do so.

2314
01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.330
Something, sure, of state,

2315
01:53:08.330 --> 01:53:11.500
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise

2316
01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:13.670
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,

2317
01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:17.830
Hath puddled his clear spirits: and in such cases

2318
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:19.970
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,

2319
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:21.330
Though great ones are their object.

2320
01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.600
'Tis even so;

2321
01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:28.270
For let our finger ache, and it indues

2322
01:53:28.270 --> 01:53:31.130
Our other healthful members even to a sense of pain:

2323
01:53:32.970 --> 01:53:35.070
nay, we must think men are not gods,

2324
01:53:35.070 --> 01:53:37.730
Nor of them look for such observances

2325
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:39.770
As fit the bridal.

2326
01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:44.900
Beshrew me much, Emilia, I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,

2327
01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:47.670
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;

2328
01:53:47.670 --> 01:53:49.800
But now I find I have suborn'd the witness,

2329
01:53:49.800 --> 01:53:51.530
And he's indicted falsely.

2330
01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:54.530
Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,

2331
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:58.130
And no conception nor no jealous toy concerning you.

2332
01:53:58.130 --> 01:53:59.870
Alas the day!

2333
01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:01.200
I never gave him cause.

2334
01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:04.700
But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;

2335
01:54:06.370 --> 01:54:08.570
They are not ever jealous for the cause,

2336
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:12.100
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster

2337
01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:15.470
Begot upon itself, born on itself.

2338
01:54:17.530 --> 01:54:19.270
Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

2339
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:20.300
Lady, amen.

2340
01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:24.270
I will go seek him.

2341
01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:26.030
Cassio, walk you hereabout:

2342
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:28.430
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit

2343
01:54:28.430 --> 01:54:31.030
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

2344
01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.230
I humbly thank your ladyship.

2345
01:54:50.230 --> 01:54:51.570
Save you, friend Cassio!

2346
01:54:51.570 --> 01:54:53.430
What make you from home?

2347
01:54:55.730 --> 01:54:58.430
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?

2348
01:54:58.430 --> 01:55:01.500
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

2349
01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:03.470
And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.

2350
01:55:05.370 --> 01:55:07.530
What, keep a week away?

2351
01:55:07.530 --> 01:55:09.200
Seven days and nights?

2352
01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:10.930
Eight score eight hours?

2353
01:55:10.930 --> 01:55:12.500
And lovers' hours,

2354
01:55:12.500 --> 01:55:15.000
More tedious than the dial eight score times?

2355
01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:17.530
O weary reckoning!

2356
01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:18.900
Pardon me, Bianca:

2357
01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:20.600
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:

2358
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:22.330
But I shall, in a more continuate time,

2359
01:55:22.330 --> 01:55:24.200
Strike off this score of absence.

2360
01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.900
Sweet Bianca,

2361
01:55:25.900 --> 01:55:27.670
Take me this work out.

2362
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:29.900
O Cassio, whence came this?

2363
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:35.800
This is some token from a newer friend:

2364
01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:37.470
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:

2365
01:55:38.670 --> 01:55:39.930
Is't come to this?

2366
01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:41.030
Well, well.

2367
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:42.430
Go to, woman!

2368
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:43.730
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,

2369
01:55:43.730 --> 01:55:44.900
From whence you have them.

2370
01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:46.030
You are jealous now

2371
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:48.530
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:

2372
01:55:48.530 --> 01:55:51.570
No, by my faith, Bianca.

2373
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:52.730
Why, whose is it?

2374
01:55:52.730 --> 01:55:53.830
I know not neither:

2375
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:55.070
I found it in my chamber.

2376
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:56.630
I like the work well: ere it be demanded--

2377
01:55:56.630 --> 01:55:57.730
As like enough it will--

2378
01:55:57.730 --> 01:55:59.070
I'ld have it copied:

2379
01:55:59.070 --> 01:56:00.470
So take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

2380
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:01.570
Leave you wherefore?

2381
01:56:01.570 --> 01:56:02.830
I do attend here on the general;

2382
01:56:02.830 --> 01:56:04.100
And think it no addition, nor my wish,

2383
01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:06.070
To have him see me woman'd.

2384
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:07.170
Why, I pray you?

2385
01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:10.300
Not that I love you not.

2386
01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.300
But that you do not love me.

2387
01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.670
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,

2388
01:56:17.670 --> 01:56:20.030
And say if I shall see you soon at night.

2389
01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:21.430
'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;

2390
01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:24.370
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

2391
01:56:24.370 --> 01:56:27.570
'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.

2392
01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:41.000
Will you think so?

2393
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.130
Think so, Iago!

2394
01:56:42.130 --> 01:56:43.930
What, To kiss in private?

2395
01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:46.400
An unauthorized kiss.

2396
01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:48.300
Or to be naked with her friend in bed

2397
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:50.030
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

2398
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:52.200
Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!

2399
01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:55.600
It is hypocrisy against the devil:

2400
01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.670
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,

2401
01:56:58.670 --> 01:57:02.100
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

2402
01:57:02.100 --> 01:57:04.130
So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:

2403
01:57:04.130 --> 01:57:06.670
But if I give my wife a handkerchief--

2404
01:57:06.670 --> 01:57:08.170
What then?

2405
01:57:08.170 --> 01:57:10.070
Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,

2406
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:11.930
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

2407
01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:14.270
She is protectress of her honour too:

2408
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:15.700
May she give that?

2409
01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:18.200
Her honour is an essence that is not seen;

2410
01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:19.800
They have it very oft that have it not:

2411
01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:21.070
But, for the handkerchief--

2412
01:57:21.070 --> 01:57:24.300
By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.

2413
01:57:28.230 --> 01:57:30.700
Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,

2414
01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:33.070
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,

2415
01:57:33.070 --> 01:57:34.330
Boding to all--

2416
01:57:36.630 --> 01:57:38.670
he had my handkerchief.

2417
01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:40.800
Ay, what of that?

2418
01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:42.800
That's not so good now.

2419
01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:49.970
What if I had said I had seen him do you wrong?

2420
01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:53.870
Or heard him say-- as knaves be such abroad,

2421
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:55.770
Who having, by their own importunate suit,

2422
01:57:55.770 --> 01:57:57.800
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,

2423
01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:00.200
Convinced or supplied them, well, they cannot choose

2424
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:01.770
But they must blab--

2425
01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:02.930
Hath he said any thing?

2426
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:05.230
He hath, my lord; but be well assured,

2427
01:58:05.230 --> 01:58:06.330
No more than he'll unswear.

2428
01:58:06.330 --> 01:58:07.700
What hath he said?

2429
01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:10.370
Faith, that he did-- I know not what he did.

2430
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:11.470
What? What?

2431
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:12.600
Lie--

2432
01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:13.700
With her?

2433
01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:14.970
With her, on her; what you will.

2434
01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:16.870
Lie with her! Lie on her!

2435
01:58:16.870 --> 01:58:18.830
We say lie on her, when they belie her.

2436
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:21.070
Lie with her!

2437
01:58:21.070 --> 01:58:24.370
Zounds. That's fulsome.

2438
01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:30.170
Handkerchief--confessions- - handkerchief!--

2439
01:58:30.170 --> 01:58:32.430
To confess, and be hanged for his labour--

2440
01:58:32.430 --> 01:58:34.330
first, to be hanged, and then to confess.

2441
01:58:34.330 --> 01:58:35.800
I tremble at it.

2442
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:40.330
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion

2443
01:58:40.330 --> 01:58:41.630
without some instruction.

2444
01:58:41.630 --> 01:58:45.000
It is not words that shakes me thus.

2445
01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:46.130
Pish!

2446
01:58:46.130 --> 01:58:48.430
Noses, ears, and lips.

2447
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:50.700
Is't possible?

2448
01:58:52.730 --> 01:58:59.370
Confess--handkerchief!-- O devil!--

2449
01:59:06.930 --> 01:59:09.330
Work on, My medicine, work!

2450
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.770
Thus credulous fools are caught;

2451
01:59:13.770 --> 01:59:16.400
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,

2452
01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:18.730
All guiltless, meet reproach.

2453
01:59:18.730 --> 01:59:20.730
What, ho! My lord!

2454
01:59:20.730 --> 01:59:21.870
My lord, I say.

2455
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:22.900
Othello.

2456
01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:26.230
How now, Cassio.

2457
01:59:26.230 --> 01:59:27.530
What's the matter?

2458
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:28.970
My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:

2459
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:31.770
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

2460
01:59:31.770 --> 01:59:32.930
Rub him about the temples.

2461
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:34.370
No, forbear;

2462
01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:40.070
The lethargy must have his quiet course:

2463
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:43.430
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by

2464
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:45.030
Breaks out to savage madness.

2465
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:47.130
Look he stirs:

2466
01:59:47.130 --> 01:59:48.970
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,

2467
01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:51.830
He will recover straight: when he is gone,

2468
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:54.700
I would on great occasion speak with you.

2469
01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:00.970
How is it, general?

2470
02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:03.230
Have you not hurt your head?

2471
02:00:03.230 --> 02:00:04.770
Dost thou mock me?

2472
02:00:04.770 --> 02:00:06.100
I mock thee?

2473
02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:08.270
No, by heaven.

2474
02:00:08.270 --> 02:00:11.400
Would you would take your fortune like a man!

2475
02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:14.270
A horned man's a monster and a beast.

2476
02:00:14.270 --> 02:00:16.430
There's many a beast then in a populous city,

2477
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:18.770
And many a civil monster.

2478
02:00:23.170 --> 02:00:24.800
Did he confess it?

2479
02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.530
Good sir, be a man;

2480
02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:34.730
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked

2481
02:00:34.730 --> 02:00:37.630
May draw with you: there's millions now alive

2482
02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:40.770
That nightly lie in those improper beds

2483
02:00:40.770 --> 02:00:45.300
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.

2484
02:00:47.330 --> 02:00:51.200
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,

2485
02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.200
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,

2486
02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:56.230
Oh no, let me know;

2487
02:00:56.230 --> 02:01:00.070
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

2488
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:01.970
Nay, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

2489
02:01:06.070 --> 02:01:07.900
Stand you awhile apart;

2490
02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:11.330
Confine yourself but in a patient list.

2491
02:01:11.330 --> 02:01:13.930
While you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--

2492
02:01:13.930 --> 02:01:16.970
A passion most unsuiting such a man--

2493
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:20.170
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,

2494
02:01:20.170 --> 02:01:22.370
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,

2495
02:01:22.370 --> 02:01:25.830
Bade him anon return and here speak with me.

2496
02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:27.200
Do but encave yourself,

2497
02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:33.000
And mark the fleers, the gibes, the notable scorns,

2498
02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:36.200
That dwell in every region of his face;

2499
02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:38.900
For I will make him tell the tale anew,

2500
02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:43.970
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when

2501
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:47.030
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:

2502
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:50.230
Hurry, I say, but mark his gesture.

2503
02:01:50.230 --> 02:01:51.730
Marry, patience;

2504
02:01:51.730 --> 02:01:55.200
Or else I shall say you are all in all in spleen,

2505
02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:56.500
And nothing of a man.

2506
02:01:58.700 --> 02:01:59.900
Dost thou know, Iago?

2507
02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:01.830
I will be most cunning in my patience;

2508
02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:04.170
But--dost thou hear?-- most bloody.

2509
02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:05.500
That's not amiss;

2510
02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:08.070
Yet keep time in all.

2511
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:09.500
Will you withdraw?

2512
02:02:30.730 --> 02:02:33.630
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,

2513
02:02:33.630 --> 02:02:35.430
A housewife that by selling her desires

2514
02:02:35.430 --> 02:02:37.200
Buys herself bread and clothes:

2515
02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:40.300
it is a creature

2516
02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:42.830
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague

2517
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:45.130
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:

2518
02:02:45.130 --> 02:02:48.070
He, when he hears of her, cannot restrain

2519
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:50.730
From an excess of laughter.

2520
02:02:50.730 --> 02:02:52.230
Here he comes:

2521
02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:55.800
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad.

2522
02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:59.130
His unbookish jealousy must construe

2523
02:02:59.130 --> 02:03:02.070
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,

2524
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:03.370
Quite in the wrong.

2525
02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:07.100
How do you now, lieutenant?

2526
02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:08.900
The worser that you give me the addition

2527
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.170
Whose want even kills me.

2528
02:03:10.170 --> 02:03:12.830
Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.

2529
02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:16.830
Now, if this suit lay in Bianca's dower,

2530
02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:18.070
How quickly should you speed!

2531
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:20.070
Alas, poor caitiff!

2532
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:22.700
I never knew woman love man so.

2533
02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:23.970
Alas, poor rogue!

2534
02:03:23.970 --> 02:03:25.600
I think, i' faith, she loves me.

2535
02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:26.830
Do you hear, Cassio?

2536
02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:29.970
She gives it out that you shall marry hey:

2537
02:03:29.970 --> 02:03:31.070
Do you intend it?

2538
02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:32.900
Ha, ha, ha!

2539
02:03:32.900 --> 02:03:34.170
I marry her!

2540
02:03:34.170 --> 02:03:35.270
What?

2541
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:36.370
A customer!

2542
02:03:36.370 --> 02:03:37.700
Prithee, bear some charity to my wit:

2543
02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:39.030
don't think it so unwholesome.

2544
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:40.700
The cry goes that you shall marry her.

2545
02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:41.830
Prithee, say true.

2546
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:42.970
I am a very villain else.

2547
02:03:42.970 --> 02:03:44.170
This is the monkey's own giving out:

2548
02:03:44.170 --> 02:03:45.430
she is persuaded I will marry her,

2549
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:46.800
out of her own love and flattery,

2550
02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.700
not out of my promise.

2551
02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:52.800
She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.

2552
02:03:52.800 --> 02:03:54.230
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank

2553
02:03:54.230 --> 02:03:56.970
with certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,

2554
02:03:56.970 --> 02:04:00.470
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

2555
02:04:00.470 --> 02:04:02.730
So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me;

2556
02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:03.970
so hales, and pulls me.

2557
02:04:05.230 --> 02:04:06.430
Oh, well, I must leave her company.

2558
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:07.600
Before me!

2559
02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.700
Look, where she comes.

2560
02:04:08.700 --> 02:04:09.800
'Tis such another fitchew!

2561
02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:10.900
Marry a perfumed one.

2562
02:04:10.900 --> 02:04:12.430
What do you mean by this haunting of me?

2563
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:14.000
Let the devil and his dam haunt you!

2564
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.630
What did you mean by that same handkerchief

2565
02:04:15.630 --> 02:04:16.830
you gave me even now?

2566
02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:20.230
I was a fine fool to take it.

2567
02:04:20.230 --> 02:04:21.630
I must take out the whole work?

2568
02:04:21.630 --> 02:04:23.430
A likely piece of work, that you should

2569
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:27.830
find it in your chamber, and know not who left it there!

2570
02:04:27.830 --> 02:04:31.430
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the work?

2571
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:34.200
There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever you had it,

2572
02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:36.470
I'll take out no work on't.

2573
02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:48.600
An you'll come to supper to-night, you may;

2574
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:49.830
an you will not,

2575
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:51.970
come when you are next prepared for.

2576
02:04:53.930 --> 02:04:55.500
After her, after her.

2577
02:04:55.500 --> 02:04:57.000
'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

2578
02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:58.170
Will you sup there?

2579
02:04:58.170 --> 02:04:59.530
'Faith, I intend so.

2580
02:04:59.530 --> 02:05:01.230
Well, I may chance to see you;

2581
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:03.470
for I would very fain speak with you.

2582
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:05.270
Prithee, come; will you?

2583
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:06.730
Go to; say no more.

2584
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:31.730
How shall I murder him, Iago?

2585
02:05:31.730 --> 02:05:34.400
Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

2586
02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.830
O Iago!

2587
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:37.400
And did you see the handkerchief?

2588
02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.600
Was that mine?

2589
02:05:39.600 --> 02:05:41.570
Yours by this hand:

2590
02:05:41.570 --> 02:05:45.570
and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife!

2591
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:47.330
She gave it him, and he hath given it his whore.

2592
02:05:47.330 --> 02:05:51.570
I would have him nine years a-killing.

2593
02:05:51.570 --> 02:05:53.230
A fine woman!

2594
02:05:53.230 --> 02:05:55.300
A fair woman! A sweet woman!

2595
02:05:55.300 --> 02:05:56.970
Nay, you must forget that.

2596
02:05:56.970 --> 02:05:59.730
Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;

2597
02:05:59.730 --> 02:06:05.430
for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to stone;

2598
02:06:05.430 --> 02:06:08.000
I strike it, and it hurts my hand.

2599
02:06:09.730 --> 02:06:15.070
O, the world hath not a sweeter creature:

2600
02:06:15.070 --> 02:06:17.000
she might lie by an emperor's side

2601
02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.700
and command him tasks.

2602
02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:19.830
Nay, that's not your way.

2603
02:06:19.830 --> 02:06:21.200
Hang her!

2604
02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.300
I do but say what she is: so delicate with her needle:

2605
02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:26.430
an admirable musician:

2606
02:06:26.430 --> 02:06:28.500
O!

2607
02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:33.300
She will sing the savageness out of a bear:

2608
02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:36.800
of so high and plenteous wit and invention--

2609
02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:37.900
She's the worse for all this.

2610
02:06:37.900 --> 02:06:39.600
Ay, a thousand and thousand times:

2611
02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:43.170
and then, of so gentle a condition!

2612
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:44.830
Ay, too gentle.

2613
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:50.630
Nay, that's certain: and yet the pity of it, Iago!

2614
02:06:50.630 --> 02:06:55.130
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

2615
02:06:55.130 --> 02:06:57.400
If you be so fond over her iniquity,

2616
02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.900
give her patent to offend; If it touch not you,

2617
02:06:59.900 --> 02:07:02.330
it comes near nobody.

2618
02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:05.330
I chop her into messes: cuckold me!

2619
02:07:05.330 --> 02:07:06.430
O, 'tis foul in her.

2620
02:07:06.430 --> 02:07:07.630
With mine officer!

2621
02:07:07.630 --> 02:07:08.630
That's fouler.

2622
02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.370
Get me some poison this night, Iago.

2623
02:07:12.370 --> 02:07:13.870
I'll not expostulate with her,

2624
02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:15.900
lest her beauty and body unprovide my mind again:

2625
02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.470
this night, Iago.

2626
02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:19.030
Do it not with poison,

2627
02:07:25.230 --> 02:07:27.100
strangle her in her bed,

2628
02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:29.330
even the bed she hath contaminated.

2629
02:07:32.230 --> 02:07:33.430
Good: the justice of it pleases me:

2630
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:34.670
good, very good.

2631
02:07:34.670 --> 02:07:38.570
And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker:

2632
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:40.530
you shall hear more by midnight.

2633
02:07:40.530 --> 02:07:41.830
Excellent good.

2634
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:43.530
What trumpet is that same?

2635
02:07:43.530 --> 02:07:46.970
Warrant something from Venice.

2636
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:55.830
'Tis Lodovico.

2637
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:58.530
This comes from the duke: see, your wife is with him.

2638
02:08:01.070 --> 02:08:02.530
God save thee, worthy general!

2639
02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:04.300
With all my heart, sir.

2640
02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:06.500
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.

2641
02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:08.570
I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

2642
02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:15.530
What's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

2643
02:08:15.530 --> 02:08:17.300
I am very glad to see you, signior.

2644
02:08:17.300 --> 02:08:18.600
Welcome to Cyprus.

2645
02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:19.930
I thank you.

2646
02:08:19.930 --> 02:08:21.130
How does Lieutenant Cassio?

2647
02:08:21.130 --> 02:08:22.170
Lives, sir.

2648
02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:25.400
Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord

2649
02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:28.370
A most unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

2650
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:29.470
Are you sure of that?

2651
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:30.630
My lord?

2652
02:08:30.630 --> 02:08:32.030
'This fail you not to do, as you will--'

2653
02:08:32.030 --> 02:08:33.300
He did not call; he's busy in the paper.

2654
02:08:35.130 --> 02:08:37.200
Is there division 'twixt thy lord and Cassio?

2655
02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:39.800
A most unhappy one: I would do much

2656
02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:41.200
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

2657
02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.300
Fire and brimstone!

2658
02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:43.500
My lord?

2659
02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:45.870
Are you wise?

2660
02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:47.200
What, is he angry?

2661
02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:48.330
May be the letter moved him;

2662
02:08:48.330 --> 02:08:50.270
For, as I think, they do command him home,

2663
02:08:50.270 --> 02:08:52.470
Deputing Cassio in his government.

2664
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:54.430
By my troth, I am glad on't.

2665
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:55.770
Indeed!

2666
02:08:55.770 --> 02:08:56.870
My lord?

2667
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:58.370
I am glad to see you mad.

2668
02:08:58.370 --> 02:08:59.470
Why, sweet Othello--

2669
02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:00.570
Devil!

2670
02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:04.730
I have not deserved this.

2671
02:09:04.730 --> 02:09:06.770
My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,

2672
02:09:06.770 --> 02:09:10.030
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:

2673
02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:12.670
Make her amends; she weeps.

2674
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:15.600
O devil, devil!

2675
02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.800
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,

2676
02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:20.330
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.

2677
02:09:20.330 --> 02:09:21.670
Out of my sight!

2678
02:09:21.670 --> 02:09:24.130
I will not stay to offend you.

2679
02:09:24.130 --> 02:09:25.730
Truly, an obedient lady:

2680
02:09:25.730 --> 02:09:28.370
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

2681
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:29.370
Mistress!

2682
02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:40.900
My lord?

2683
02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:42.230
What would you with her, sir?

2684
02:09:42.230 --> 02:09:43.530
Who, I, my lord?

2685
02:09:43.530 --> 02:09:46.030
Ay; you did wish that I should make her turn:

2686
02:09:46.030 --> 02:09:49.370
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,

2687
02:09:49.370 --> 02:09:51.270
And turn again;

2688
02:09:51.270 --> 02:09:53.200
and she can weep, sir, weep;

2689
02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:56.370
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,

2690
02:09:56.370 --> 02:09:57.470
Very obedient.

2691
02:09:57.470 --> 02:09:58.970
Proceed you in your tears.

2692
02:10:04.730 --> 02:10:05.830
Concerning this, sir,--

2693
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:07.900
O well-painted passion!--

2694
02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:12.300
I am commanded home.

2695
02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:14.470
Get you away; I'll send for you anon.

2696
02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:22.600
Sir, I obey the mandate,

2697
02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:24.100
And will return to Venice.

2698
02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:25.670
Hence, avaunt!

2699
02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:37.670
Cassio shall have my place.

2700
02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:40.600
Sir,

2701
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:50.430
tonight, I do entreat that we may sup together:

2702
02:10:50.430 --> 02:10:54.330
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus--

2703
02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:59.170
Goats and monkeys!

2704
02:11:04.130 --> 02:11:06.570
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate

2705
02:11:06.570 --> 02:11:08.230
Call all in all sufficient?

2706
02:11:08.230 --> 02:11:09.330
Is this the nature

2707
02:11:09.330 --> 02:11:10.870
Whom passion could not shake?

2708
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:12.070
Whose solid virtue

2709
02:11:12.070 --> 02:11:14.270
The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,

2710
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:16.230
Could neither graze nor pierce?

2711
02:11:16.230 --> 02:11:17.530
He is much changed.

2712
02:11:17.530 --> 02:11:19.270
Are his wits safe?

2713
02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:21.430
Is he not light of brain?

2714
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:24.770
He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure

2715
02:11:24.770 --> 02:11:27.770
What he might be: if what he might he is not,

2716
02:11:27.770 --> 02:11:28.870
I would to heaven he were!

2717
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:30.130
What, strike his wife!

2718
02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:32.300
'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew

2719
02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:34.730
That stroke would prove the worst!

2720
02:11:34.730 --> 02:11:36.200
Is it his use?

2721
02:11:36.200 --> 02:11:37.770
Or did the letters work upon his blood,

2722
02:11:37.770 --> 02:11:39.000
And new-create this fault?

2723
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:40.100
Alas, alas!

2724
02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:41.870
It is not honesty in me to speak

2725
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:44.070
What I have seen and known.

2726
02:11:44.070 --> 02:11:45.870
You shall observe him,

2727
02:11:45.870 --> 02:11:47.970
And his own courses will denote him so

2728
02:11:47.970 --> 02:11:51.130
That I may save my speech: will you go after,

2729
02:11:51.130 --> 02:11:53.200
And mark how he continues.

2730
02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:56.000
I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

2731
02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:19.700
So you have seen nothing then?

2732
02:12:19.700 --> 02:12:22.400
Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

2733
02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.670
Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

2734
02:12:26.670 --> 02:12:30.470
But then I saw no harm, and then I heard

2735
02:12:30.470 --> 02:12:33.630
Each syllable that breath made up between them.

2736
02:12:33.630 --> 02:12:35.570
What, did they never whisper?

2737
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:36.930
Never, my lord.

2738
02:12:36.930 --> 02:12:38.030
Nor send you out o' the way?

2739
02:12:38.030 --> 02:12:39.400
Never.

2740
02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.700
To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

2741
02:12:41.700 --> 02:12:43.000
Never, my lord.

2742
02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:46.770
That's strange.

2743
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:51.230
I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,

2744
02:12:51.230 --> 02:12:52.670
Lay down my soul at stake:

2745
02:12:54.430 --> 02:12:55.730
if you think other,

2746
02:12:55.730 --> 02:12:58.900
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.

2747
02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:00.930
If any wretch have put this in your head,

2748
02:13:00.930 --> 02:13:03.030
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!

2749
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:05.930
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,

2750
02:13:05.930 --> 02:13:09.500
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives

2751
02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:10.970
Is foul as slander.

2752
02:13:13.500 --> 02:13:16.170
Bid her come hither: go.

2753
02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:27.300
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd

2754
02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:29.370
That cannot say as much.

2755
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.300
This is a subtle whore,

2756
02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:37.700
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets

2757
02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.270
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

2758
02:13:52.130 --> 02:13:53.470
My lord, what is your will?

2759
02:13:53.470 --> 02:13:54.500
I pray you, chuck, come hither.

2760
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:03.300
What is your pleasure?

2761
02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:07.500
Let me see your eyes;

2762
02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:09.500
Look in my face!

2763
02:14:09.500 --> 02:14:11.630
What horrible fancy's this?

2764
02:14:14.230 --> 02:14:16.300
Some of your function, mistress;

2765
02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:19.630
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;

2766
02:14:20.930 --> 02:14:23.000
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:

2767
02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.

2768
02:14:30.170 --> 02:14:34.170
Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?

2769
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:37.530
I understand a fury in your words.

2770
02:14:37.530 --> 02:14:38.570
But not the words.

2771
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:44.470
Why, what art thou?

2772
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:47.300
Your wife, my lord; your true

2773
02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:48.670
And loyal wife.

2774
02:14:50.070 --> 02:14:52.500
Come, swear it, damn thyself

2775
02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:55.900
Lest, like being one of heaven, the devils themselves

2776
02:14:55.900 --> 02:14:59.770
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:

2777
02:14:59.770 --> 02:15:01.970
Swear thou art honest.

2778
02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:04.070
Heaven doth truly know it.

2779
02:15:04.070 --> 02:15:07.400
Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

2780
02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:08.570
To whom, my lord?

2781
02:15:08.570 --> 02:15:09.830
With whom?

2782
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:11.200
How am I false?

2783
02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:13.230
Desdemona!

2784
02:15:15.330 --> 02:15:16.330
Away!

2785
02:15:18.270 --> 02:15:19.370
Away!

2786
02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:24.200
Alas the day!

2787
02:15:26.770 --> 02:15:27.970
Why do you weep?

2788
02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.030
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?

2789
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:38.430
If haply you my father do suspect

2790
02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:40.130
An instrument of this your calling back,

2791
02:15:40.130 --> 02:15:41.900
Lay not your blame on me:

2792
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:44.600
If you have lost him,

2793
02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:47.430
Why, I have lost him too.

2794
02:15:49.030 --> 02:15:50.570
Had it pleased heaven

2795
02:15:50.570 --> 02:15:53.030
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd

2796
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:56.330
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.

2797
02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:59.030
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,

2798
02:15:59.030 --> 02:16:02.830
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,

2799
02:16:02.830 --> 02:16:06.330
I should have found in some place of my soul

2800
02:16:06.330 --> 02:16:12.030
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me

2801
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:15.770
A fixed figure for the time of scorn

2802
02:16:15.770 --> 02:16:18.630
To point his slow unmoving finger at!

2803
02:16:18.630 --> 02:16:24.070
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:

2804
02:16:25.930 --> 02:16:32.600
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,

2805
02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:35.870
Where either I must live, or bear no life;

2806
02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:40.070
The fountain from the which my current runs,

2807
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:44.670
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!

2808
02:16:44.670 --> 02:16:47.570
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads

2809
02:16:47.570 --> 02:16:49.700
To knot and gender in!

2810
02:16:54.470 --> 02:16:56.170
Turn thy complexion there,

2811
02:16:56.170 --> 02:16:58.600
Ay, patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin--

2812
02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:00.970
Ay, there, look grim as hell!

2813
02:17:04.170 --> 02:17:06.470
I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

2814
02:17:06.470 --> 02:17:10.200
O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,

2815
02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:12.130
That quicken even with blowing.

2816
02:17:12.130 --> 02:17:14.570
O thou weed,

2817
02:17:14.570 --> 02:17:18.770
Who art so lovely fresh and smell'st so sweet

2818
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:21.470
That the sense aches at thee,

2819
02:17:21.470 --> 02:17:24.170
would thou hadst ne'er been born!

2820
02:17:24.170 --> 02:17:26.800
Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

2821
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:35.530
Alack, was this fair paper, this most goodly book,

2822
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:37.430
Made to write 'whore' upon?

2823
02:17:37.430 --> 02:17:38.470
What committed!

2824
02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:41.600
Committed!

2825
02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:42.630
O thou public commoner!

2826
02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:46.800
I should make very forges of my cheeks,

2827
02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:48.870
That would to cinders burn up modesty,

2828
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:50.000
Did I but speak thy deeds.

2829
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.500
What committed!

2830
02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:54.870
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,

2831
02:17:54.870 --> 02:17:57.730
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets

2832
02:17:57.730 --> 02:18:00.170
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth

2833
02:18:00.170 --> 02:18:01.530
And will not hear it.

2834
02:18:01.530 --> 02:18:02.530
What committed!

2835
02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:05.900
Impudent strumpet!

2836
02:18:08.070 --> 02:18:10.000
By heaven, you do me wrong.

2837
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.270
Are you not a strumpet?

2838
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:12.670
No, as I am a Christian:

2839
02:18:14.770 --> 02:18:16.430
If to preserve this vessel for my lord

2840
02:18:16.430 --> 02:18:18.230
From any other foul unlawful touch

2841
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:20.100
Be not to be a strumpet, why, I am none.

2842
02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:22.400
What, not a whore?

2843
02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:23.670
No, as I shall be saved.

2844
02:18:23.670 --> 02:18:24.670
Is't possible?

2845
02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:30.300
O, heaven forgive us!

2846
02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:32.270
I cry you mercy, then:

2847
02:18:32.270 --> 02:18:35.270
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice

2848
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:36.970
That married with Othello.

2849
02:18:42.570 --> 02:18:43.830
You, mistress,

2850
02:18:43.830 --> 02:18:46.700
That have the office opposite Saint Peter,

2851
02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:47.900
And keeps the gate of hell!

2852
02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:50.530
You, you, ay, you!

2853
02:18:50.530 --> 02:18:54.770
We have done our course; there's money for your pains:

2854
02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:59.670
I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

2855
02:19:05.130 --> 02:19:07.200
Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?

2856
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:10.700
How do you, madam?

2857
02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:12.730
How do you, my good lady?

2858
02:19:15.470 --> 02:19:16.830
'Faith, half asleep.

2859
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:37.600
Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

2860
02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.130
With who?

2861
02:19:39.130 --> 02:19:41.300
Why, with my lord, my lady.

2862
02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:42.730
Who is thy lord?

2863
02:19:42.730 --> 02:19:45.630
He that is yours, sweet lady.

2864
02:19:45.630 --> 02:19:46.630
I have none:

2865
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:51.370
do not talk to me, Emilia;

2866
02:19:54.630 --> 02:19:59.530
I cannot weep; nor answers have I none,

2867
02:20:01.600 --> 02:20:03.130
As I should go by water.

2868
02:20:07.030 --> 02:20:08.270
I prithee, tonight

2869
02:20:08.270 --> 02:20:13.000
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;

2870
02:20:18.930 --> 02:20:21.170
And call thy husband hither.

2871
02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:24.730
Here's a change indeed!

2872
02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:39.100
'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.

2873
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:43.530
How have I been behaved, that he should stick

2874
02:20:43.530 --> 02:20:46.900
The small'st opinion on my great'st abuse?

2875
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:58.800
What is your pleasure, madam?

2876
02:20:58.800 --> 02:21:01.170
How is't with you?

2877
02:21:01.170 --> 02:21:02.230
I cannot tell.

2878
02:21:05.700 --> 02:21:08.900
Those that do teach young babes

2879
02:21:08.900 --> 02:21:12.670
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:

2880
02:21:14.970 --> 02:21:18.700
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,

2881
02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:20.700
I am a child to chiding.

2882
02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:23.230
What is the matter, lady?

2883
02:21:23.230 --> 02:21:26.270
Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.

2884
02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:28.330
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,

2885
02:21:28.330 --> 02:21:30.700
As true hearts cannot bear it.

2886
02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:32.800
Am I that name, Iago?

2887
02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:34.170
What name, fair lady?

2888
02:21:34.170 --> 02:21:35.930
Such as she says my lord did say I was.

2889
02:21:35.930 --> 02:21:39.170
He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink

2890
02:21:39.170 --> 02:21:41.270
Would not have laid such terms upon his callat.

2891
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:43.000
Why did he so?

2892
02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.730
I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

2893
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:48.130
Do not weep, do not weep.

2894
02:21:48.130 --> 02:21:49.400
Alas the day!

2895
02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.830
Hath she forsook so many noble matches,

2896
02:21:51.830 --> 02:21:53.330
Her father and her country and her friends,

2897
02:21:53.330 --> 02:21:54.570
To be call'd whore?

2898
02:21:54.570 --> 02:21:56.870
Would it not make one weep?

2899
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:59.230
It is my wretched fortune.

2900
02:21:59.230 --> 02:22:00.870
Beshrew him for't!

2901
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:02.300
How comes this trick upon him?

2902
02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:04.130
Nay, heaven doth know.

2903
02:22:04.130 --> 02:22:06.900
I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,

2904
02:22:06.900 --> 02:22:09.830
Some busy and insinuating rogue,

2905
02:22:09.830 --> 02:22:12.730
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,

2906
02:22:12.730 --> 02:22:14.730
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

2907
02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:18.800
There is no such man; it is impossible.

2908
02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:21.270
If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

2909
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:22.800
A halter pardon him!

2910
02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:24.770
And hell gnaw his bones!

2911
02:22:24.770 --> 02:22:27.630
Why should he call her whore?

2912
02:22:27.630 --> 02:22:29.170
What keeps her company?

2913
02:22:29.170 --> 02:22:32.270
What time? What place? What form?

2914
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:33.530
What likelihood?

2915
02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:36.300
The Moor's abused by some egregious knave,

2916
02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:38.730
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.

2917
02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:44.030
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,

2918
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:46.030
And put in every honest hand a whip

2919
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:48.100
To lash the rascals naked through the world

2920
02:22:48.100 --> 02:22:49.270
Even to the east to the west!

2921
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:50.630
Speak within door.

2922
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:52.400
O, fie upon them!

2923
02:22:54.100 --> 02:22:55.630
Some such squire he was

2924
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:57.500
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,

2925
02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:59.300
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

2926
02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:00.800
You are a fool; go to.

2927
02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:02.400
O good Iago,

2928
02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:04.970
How shall I win my lord again?

2929
02:23:04.970 --> 02:23:07.370
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,

2930
02:23:07.370 --> 02:23:09.100
I know not how I lost him.

2931
02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:11.630
Here I do kneel:

2932
02:23:13.500 --> 02:23:15.670
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,

2933
02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:18.000
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,

2934
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:21.230
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,

2935
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:23.000
Delighted them in any other form;

2936
02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.370
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.

2937
02:23:25.370 --> 02:23:27.670
And ever will-- though he do shake me off

2938
02:23:27.670 --> 02:23:29.630
To beggarly divorcement-- love him dearly,

2939
02:23:29.630 --> 02:23:31.170
Comfort forswear me!

2940
02:23:33.930 --> 02:23:36.170
Unkindness may do much;

2941
02:23:36.170 --> 02:23:38.930
And his unkindness may defeat my life,

2942
02:23:38.930 --> 02:23:40.070
But never taint my love.

2943
02:23:43.100 --> 02:23:44.300
I cannot say 'whore:'

2944
02:23:46.870 --> 02:23:48.700
It does abhor me now I speak the word;

2945
02:23:50.800 --> 02:23:52.400
To do the act that might the addition earn

2946
02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:56.530
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

2947
02:23:56.530 --> 02:24:03.430
I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:

2948
02:24:03.430 --> 02:24:05.770
The business of the state does him offence,

2949
02:24:05.770 --> 02:24:06.970
And he doth chide with you.

2950
02:24:06.970 --> 02:24:08.070
If 'twere no other--

2951
02:24:08.070 --> 02:24:10.670
'Tis but so, I warrant.

2952
02:24:10.670 --> 02:24:14.430
Hark, how these instruments summon you to supper!

2953
02:24:14.430 --> 02:24:15.800
Boo, boo, boo, boo.

2954
02:24:16.830 --> 02:24:18.970
The messengers of Venice stay the meat;

2955
02:24:18.970 --> 02:24:25.270
Go in, and weep not; all things will be well.

2956
02:24:25.270 --> 02:24:26.570
Boo, boo, boo, boo.

2957
02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:28.300
Come on.

2958
02:24:30.770 --> 02:24:31.870
Boo, boo, boo, boo.

2959
02:24:39.470 --> 02:24:41.000
Doo, roo, doo, roo.

2960
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:44.600
How now, Roderigo!

2961
02:24:44.600 --> 02:24:47.470
I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

2962
02:24:47.470 --> 02:24:48.700
What in the contrary?

2963
02:24:48.700 --> 02:24:51.130
Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;

2964
02:24:51.130 --> 02:24:52.630
and rather, as it seems to me now,

2965
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:54.530
keepest from me all conveniency than suppliest me

2966
02:24:54.530 --> 02:24:56.070
with the least advantage of hope.

2967
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:58.370
I will indeed no longer endure it,

2968
02:24:58.370 --> 02:25:01.400
nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace

2969
02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.770
what already I have foolishly suffered.

2970
02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:05.630
Will you hear me, Roderigo?

2971
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:07.670
'Faith, I've heard too much, for your words

2972
02:25:07.670 --> 02:25:09.970
and performances are no kin together.

2973
02:25:09.970 --> 02:25:12.070
You charge me most unjustly.

2974
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:13.930
With nought but truth.

2975
02:25:13.930 --> 02:25:16.330
I have wasted myself out of my means.

2976
02:25:16.330 --> 02:25:18.970
The jewels you've had from me to deliver to Desdemona

2977
02:25:18.970 --> 02:25:21.100
would half have corrupted a votarist:

2978
02:25:21.100 --> 02:25:23.230
you've told me she hath received them

2979
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:25.000
and returned me expectations and comforts

2980
02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.600
of sudden respect and acquaintance, but I find none.

2981
02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:28.830
Well; go to; very well.

2982
02:25:28.830 --> 02:25:29.930
Very well!

2983
02:25:29.930 --> 02:25:31.070
Go to!

2984
02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:34.430
I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis not very well:

2985
02:25:34.430 --> 02:25:36.630
By this hand, I say it is scurvy,

2986
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:38.500
and begin to find myself fobbed in it.

2987
02:25:38.500 --> 02:25:39.600
Very well.

2988
02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:41.370
I say 'tis not very well.

2989
02:25:43.670 --> 02:25:45.130
I will make myself known to Desdemona:

2990
02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:47.900
if she'll return me my jewels,

2991
02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:51.700
I'll give over my suit and repent my unlawful solicitation;

2992
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:56.330
if not, assure yourself I will seek satisfaction of you.

2993
02:25:56.330 --> 02:25:57.870
You have said now.

2994
02:25:57.870 --> 02:25:59.000
Ay, and said nothing

2995
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.900
but what I protest intendment of doing.

2996
02:26:04.570 --> 02:26:08.500
Why, now I see there's mettle in thee,

2997
02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:11.930
and even from this instant to build

2998
02:26:11.930 --> 02:26:14.900
a better opinion of thee than ever before.

2999
02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:19.500
Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast taken against me

3000
02:26:19.500 --> 02:26:21.000
a most just exception;

3001
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.230
but yet, I protest, I have dealt most directly

3002
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:25.330
in thy affair.

3003
02:26:25.330 --> 02:26:27.000
It hath not appeared.

3004
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.930
I grant indeed it hath not appeared,

3005
02:26:30.930 --> 02:26:35.000
and your suspicion is not without wit and judgment.

3006
02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.930
But, Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed,

3007
02:26:38.930 --> 02:26:43.970
which I have greater reason to suspect now than ever,

3008
02:26:43.970 --> 02:26:48.300
why, I mean purpose,

3009
02:26:48.300 --> 02:26:53.670
courage, valour, this night show it:

3010
02:26:53.670 --> 02:26:57.070
if thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,

3011
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:59.570
take me from this world with treachery,

3012
02:26:59.570 --> 02:27:01.830
devise engines for my life.

3013
02:27:03.270 --> 02:27:04.930
Well, what is it?

3014
02:27:04.930 --> 02:27:06.670
Is it within reason and compass?

3015
02:27:06.670 --> 02:27:12.530
Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice

3016
02:27:12.530 --> 02:27:15.030
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

3017
02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:16.330
Is that true?

3018
02:27:16.330 --> 02:27:18.070
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.

3019
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:22.000
O, no; he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him

3020
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:25.370
the fair Desdemona, unless his abode

3021
02:27:25.370 --> 02:27:27.900
be lingered here by some accident:

3022
02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:30.530
whereto none can be so determinate

3023
02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:32.000
as the removing of Cassio.

3024
02:27:33.470 --> 02:27:36.730
How do you mean, removing of him?

3025
02:27:36.730 --> 02:27:39.930
Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;

3026
02:27:42.470 --> 02:27:44.230
knocking out his brains.

3027
02:27:46.330 --> 02:27:47.730
And that you would have me to do?

3028
02:27:47.730 --> 02:27:53.230
Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.

3029
02:27:53.230 --> 02:27:55.600
He sups to-night with a harlotry,

3030
02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.330
and thither will I go to him:

3031
02:27:57.330 --> 02:28:00.300
he knows not yet of his honorable fortune.

3032
02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:02.830
If you will watch his going thence,

3033
02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:05.230
which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,

3034
02:28:05.230 --> 02:28:07.100
you may take him at your pleasure:

3035
02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:10.070
I'll be near by to second thy attempt,

3036
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:12.230
and he shall fall between us.

3037
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:15.300
Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me;

3038
02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:20.330
I will show you such a necessity in his death

3039
02:28:20.330 --> 02:28:24.630
that you will think yourself bound to put it on him.

3040
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:26.970
It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste:

3041
02:28:26.970 --> 02:28:28.200
about it.

3042
02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:30.730
I will hear further reason for this.

3043
02:28:30.730 --> 02:28:32.600
And you shall be satisfied.

3044
02:28:56.670 --> 02:28:59.100
I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

3045
02:29:00.470 --> 02:29:03.170
O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.

3046
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:12.830
Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

3047
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:14.870
Your honour is most welcome.

3048
02:29:16.700 --> 02:29:17.730
So will you walk?

3049
02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:24.830
O--Desdemona--

3050
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:26.330
My lord?

3051
02:29:26.330 --> 02:29:30.330
Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned forthwith:

3052
02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:32.600
dispatch your attendant there: look it be done.

3053
02:29:32.600 --> 02:29:34.570
I will, my lord.

3054
02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:14.270
How goes it now?

3055
02:30:14.270 --> 02:30:16.600
He looks gentler than he did.

3056
02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:19.000
He says he will return incontinent:

3057
02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:21.030
He hath commanded me to go to bed,

3058
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:22.130
And bade me to dismiss you.

3059
02:30:22.130 --> 02:30:23.330
Dismiss me!

3060
02:30:23.330 --> 02:30:24.830
That was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia.

3061
02:30:24.830 --> 02:30:27.130
Give me my nightly wearing:

3062
02:30:27.130 --> 02:30:28.930
We must not now displease him.

3063
02:30:48.970 --> 02:30:50.430
I would you had never seen him!

3064
02:30:50.430 --> 02:30:56.200
So would not I my love doth so approve him,

3065
02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:58.470
That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--

3066
02:30:58.470 --> 02:31:03.700
Prithee, unpin me-- have grace and favour in them.

3067
02:31:07.130 --> 02:31:09.570
I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

3068
02:31:09.570 --> 02:31:10.600
All's one.

3069
02:31:16.670 --> 02:31:18.570
Good faith, how foolish are our minds!

3070
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:28.030
If I should die before thee prithee, shroud me

3071
02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:29.770
In one of those same sheets.

3072
02:31:29.770 --> 02:31:32.200
Oh, come, come you talk.

3073
02:32:00.700 --> 02:32:04.500
My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:

3074
02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:11.770
She was in love, and he she loved proved mad

3075
02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:15.270
And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'

3076
02:32:17.270 --> 02:32:20.130
An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,

3077
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:23.700
And she died singing it:

3078
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:29.300
that song to-night

3079
02:32:29.300 --> 02:32:30.700
Will not go from my mind;

3080
02:32:32.830 --> 02:32:34.030
I have much to do,

3081
02:32:34.030 --> 02:32:36.070
But go hang my head all on one side,

3082
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:37.930
And sing it like poor Barbara.

3083
02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:42.600
Prithee, dispatch.

3084
02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:43.900
Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

3085
02:32:43.900 --> 02:32:44.970
No, no, no, unpin me here.

3086
02:32:51.470 --> 02:32:53.100
This Lodovico is a proper man.

3087
02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:56.430
A very handsome man.

3088
02:32:56.430 --> 02:32:58.800
He speaks well.

3089
02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:01.070
I know a lady in Venice would have walked

3090
02:33:01.070 --> 02:33:05.170
barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

3091
02:33:16.330 --> 02:33:23.570
The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,

3092
02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:28.970
Sing all a green willow:

3093
02:33:28.970 --> 02:33:34.330
Sing willow, willow, willow:

3094
02:33:34.330 --> 02:33:42.330
Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,

3095
02:33:42.330 --> 02:33:46.970
Sing all a green willow.

3096
02:33:46.970 --> 02:33:51.500
Sing willow, willow, willow.

3097
02:33:53.430 --> 02:34:01.730
The fresh stream ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;

3098
02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:06.500
Sing willow, willow, willow;

3099
02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:14.600
Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;

3100
02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:20.230
Sing willow, willow, willow;

3101
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:21.570
Lay by these--

3102
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:32.570
Sing all a green willow must be my garland.

3103
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:36.470
Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon--

3104
02:34:43.270 --> 02:34:45.770
Let nobody blame him--

3105
02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:46.830
No, that's not next.

3106
02:34:48.970 --> 02:34:50.130
Hark! Who is't that knocks?

3107
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:52.870
It's the wind.

3108
02:34:57.430 --> 02:35:05.800
I call'd my love false love; and what said he then?

3109
02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:14.300
Sing willow, willow, willow; Sing all a green willow.

3110
02:35:16.470 --> 02:35:23.670
If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!

3111
02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:29.700
Sing willow, willow, willow.

3112
02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:38.200
So, get thee gone; good night

3113
02:35:42.130 --> 02:35:44.530
Oh, mine eyes do itch;

3114
02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:49.230
Doth that bode weeping?

3115
02:35:50.130 --> 02:35:51.370
'Tis neither here nor there.

3116
02:35:51.370 --> 02:35:52.730
Oh, I have heard it said so.

3117
02:35:58.030 --> 02:35:59.830
O, these men, these men!

3118
02:36:03.730 --> 02:36:06.370
Dost thou in conscience think-- tell me, Emilia--

3119
02:36:06.370 --> 02:36:10.400
That there be women do abuse their husbands

3120
02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:11.770
In such gross kind?

3121
02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:14.970
There be some such, no question.

3122
02:36:16.470 --> 02:36:20.500
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

3123
02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:21.900
Why, would not you?

3124
02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:23.900
Nay, by this heavenly light!

3125
02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:27.000
Nor I neither by this heavenly light;

3126
02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:28.370
I might do't as well i' the dark.

3127
02:36:33.170 --> 02:36:35.830
Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

3128
02:36:35.830 --> 02:36:40.430
The world's a huge thing: it is a great price

3129
02:36:40.430 --> 02:36:41.970
For a small vice.

3130
02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:45.300
Good troth, I think thou wouldst not.

3131
02:36:45.300 --> 02:36:52.430
By my troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had done it.

3132
02:36:54.770 --> 02:36:57.370
Marry, I would not do such a thing for a joint-ring,

3133
02:36:57.370 --> 02:37:02.030
nor for measures of lawn, nor for gowns and petticoats,

3134
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:05.530
nor caps, nor for any petty exhibition;

3135
02:37:05.530 --> 02:37:06.930
but for all the whole world--

3136
02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:10.970
pity what woman would not make her husband a cuckold

3137
02:37:10.970 --> 02:37:12.170
to make him a monarch?

3138
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.170
I should venture purgatory for't.

3139
02:37:18.670 --> 02:37:20.470
Beshrew me, if I should do such a wrong

3140
02:37:20.470 --> 02:37:22.500
For the whole world.

3141
02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:24.300
Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world:

3142
02:37:24.300 --> 02:37:27.500
and having the world for your labour,

3143
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.370
tis a wrong in your own world,

3144
02:37:29.370 --> 02:37:31.470
and you might quickly make it right.

3145
02:37:32.730 --> 02:37:34.400
I do not believe there is any such woman.

3146
02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:39.100
Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage

3147
02:37:39.100 --> 02:37:41.530
as would store the world they played for.

3148
02:37:44.370 --> 02:37:46.630
But I do think it is their husbands' faults

3149
02:37:46.630 --> 02:37:51.630
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,

3150
02:37:51.630 --> 02:37:53.970
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,

3151
02:37:53.970 --> 02:37:56.170
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,

3152
02:37:56.170 --> 02:37:59.400
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,

3153
02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:03.700
Or scant our former having in despite;

3154
02:38:03.700 --> 02:38:08.570
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,

3155
02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:12.300
Yet have we some revenge.

3156
02:38:12.300 --> 02:38:13.730
Let husbands know

3157
02:38:13.730 --> 02:38:18.270
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell

3158
02:38:18.270 --> 02:38:20.270
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,

3159
02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:21.330
As men have.

3160
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:27.130
What is it that they do

3161
02:38:27.130 --> 02:38:28.930
When they change us for others?

3162
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:34.070
Is it sport?

3163
02:38:34.070 --> 02:38:39.670
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?

3164
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:44.730
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?

3165
02:38:44.730 --> 02:38:49.970
It is so too: and have not we affections,

3166
02:38:49.970 --> 02:38:55.130
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?

3167
02:38:55.130 --> 02:39:00.170
Then let them use us well: else let them know,

3168
02:39:00.170 --> 02:39:02.900
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

3169
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:12.170
Good night, good night:

3170
02:39:17.700 --> 02:39:19.230
God me such uses send,

3171
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:28.000
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

3172
02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:27.030
Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:

3173
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:29.300
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:

3174
02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:33.100
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:

3175
02:40:33.100 --> 02:40:36.200
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,

3176
02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:39.530
And fix most firm thy resolution.

3177
02:40:39.530 --> 02:40:42.200
Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

3178
02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:47.100
Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.

3179
02:40:47.100 --> 02:40:49.200
I have no great devotion to the deed;

3180
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:52.630
Yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:

3181
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:55.100
'Tis but a man gone.

3182
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:58.930
Forth, my sword: he dies.

3183
02:41:05.930 --> 02:41:09.130
I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,

3184
02:41:09.130 --> 02:41:11.470
And he grows angry.

3185
02:41:11.470 --> 02:41:14.170
Now, whether he kill Cassio,

3186
02:41:14.170 --> 02:41:17.900
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,

3187
02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:21.500
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,

3188
02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:25.030
He calls me to a restitution large

3189
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:27.270
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,

3190
02:41:27.270 --> 02:41:29.570
As gifts to Desdemona;

3191
02:41:29.570 --> 02:41:33.270
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,

3192
02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:37.800
He has a daily beauty in his life

3193
02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.900
That makes me ugly; besides, the Moor

3194
02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:47.630
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:

3195
02:41:47.630 --> 02:41:50.930
No, he must die.

3196
02:41:50.930 --> 02:41:55.930
Be it so: I hear him coming.

3197
02:41:55.930 --> 02:41:57.130
I know his gait, 'tis he--

3198
02:41:57.130 --> 02:41:58.900
Villain, thou diest!

3199
02:41:59.970 --> 02:42:01.270
Thrust had been mine enemy indeed,

3200
02:42:01.270 --> 02:42:03.670
But that my coat is better than thou know'st

3201
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:06.070
I will make proof of thine.

3202
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:19.700
Ahh.

3203
02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:40.330
Ahh!

3204
02:42:45.870 --> 02:42:48.000
Ohh. Ahh.

3205
02:42:49.900 --> 02:42:51.170
Iago keeps his word.

3206
02:42:52.330 --> 02:42:54.730
'Tis he--

3207
02:42:54.730 --> 02:42:56.670
O brave Iago, honest and just.

3208
02:42:58.200 --> 02:42:59.830
O, murder.

3209
02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:10.700
Minion, your dear lies dead,

3210
02:43:10.700 --> 02:43:14.370
And my unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.

3211
02:43:14.370 --> 02:43:19.770
Forth of mine heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;

3212
02:43:19.770 --> 02:43:25.230
Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.

3213
02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:29.970
'Tis some mischance; which is very direful.

3214
02:43:29.970 --> 02:43:34.100
Hark! two or three groan: it is a heavy night:

3215
02:43:34.100 --> 02:43:36.830
These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe

3216
02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:38.430
To come in to the cry without more help.

3217
02:43:46.030 --> 02:43:47.470
Hark!

3218
02:43:47.470 --> 02:43:49.800
Here's one comes in his shirt, with weapons.

3219
02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:50.900
Who's there?

3220
02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:52.330
Whose noise is this that cries on murder?

3221
02:43:52.330 --> 02:43:53.430
We do not know.

3222
02:43:53.430 --> 02:43:54.530
Did not you hear a cry?

3223
02:43:54.530 --> 02:43:55.630
Here, here!

3224
02:43:55.630 --> 02:43:56.830
For heaven's sake, help me!

3225
02:43:56.830 --> 02:43:58.000
What's the matter?

3226
02:43:58.000 --> 02:43:59.130
This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

3227
02:43:59.130 --> 02:44:00.500
The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

3228
02:44:03.700 --> 02:44:05.570
What are you here that cry so grievously?

3229
02:44:05.570 --> 02:44:06.870
Iago?

3230
02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:08.600
O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!

3231
02:44:08.600 --> 02:44:09.970
Give me some help.

3232
02:44:09.970 --> 02:44:11.600
O me, lieutenant!

3233
02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:13.300
What villains have done this?

3234
02:44:13.300 --> 02:44:14.670
I think that one of them is hereabout,

3235
02:44:14.670 --> 02:44:15.830
And cannot make away.

3236
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:16.930
O treacherous villains!

3237
02:44:16.930 --> 02:44:18.030
What are you there?

3238
02:44:18.030 --> 02:44:19.300
Come in, and give some help.

3239
02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:21.270
O, help me here!

3240
02:44:21.270 --> 02:44:22.970
That's one of them.

3241
02:44:22.970 --> 02:44:26.730
O murderous slave!

3242
02:44:26.730 --> 02:44:30.500
O villain!

3243
02:44:34.530 --> 02:44:36.900
Damn'd Iago!

3244
02:44:41.470 --> 02:44:43.370
Kill men i' the dark!

3245
02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:47.600
Where be these bloody thieves?

3246
02:44:48.270 --> 02:44:49.830
How silent is this town!

3247
02:44:49.830 --> 02:44:51.100
Ho!

3248
02:44:51.100 --> 02:44:52.270
Murder!

3249
02:44:52.270 --> 02:44:53.400
Murder!

3250
02:44:53.400 --> 02:44:54.500
What may you be?

3251
02:44:54.500 --> 02:44:55.630
Are you good or evil?

3252
02:44:55.630 --> 02:44:57.130
As you shall prove us, praise us.

3253
02:44:57.130 --> 02:44:58.230
Signior Lodovico?

3254
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:59.400
He, sir.

3255
02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:00.730
I cry you pardon.

3256
02:45:00.730 --> 02:45:01.970
Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

3257
02:45:03.870 --> 02:45:05.130
How is't, brother!

3258
02:45:05.130 --> 02:45:07.700
My leg's cut in two.

3259
02:45:07.700 --> 02:45:09.670
Marry, heaven forbid!

3260
02:45:09.670 --> 02:45:13.170
Light; I'll bind it with my shirt.

3261
02:45:13.170 --> 02:45:15.100
What is the matter?

3262
02:45:15.100 --> 02:45:16.300
Who is't that cried?

3263
02:45:16.300 --> 02:45:17.500
Who is't that cried!

3264
02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:19.600
O my dear Cassio!

3265
02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:23.770
My sweet Cassio!

3266
02:45:23.770 --> 02:45:25.800
O notable strumpet!

3267
02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:28.400
Cassio, may you suspect

3268
02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:29.930
Who they should be that have thus have many led you?

3269
02:45:29.930 --> 02:45:31.270
No.

3270
02:45:31.270 --> 02:45:32.730
I am sorry to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

3271
02:45:32.730 --> 02:45:33.830
O, for a chair,

3272
02:45:33.830 --> 02:45:35.200
To bear him easily hence!

3273
02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:37.300
Alas, he faints!

3274
02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:39.500
O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

3275
02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:41.170
Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash

3276
02:45:41.170 --> 02:45:43.400
To be a party in this injury.

3277
02:45:43.400 --> 02:45:44.970
Patience awhile, good Cassio.

3278
02:45:44.970 --> 02:45:46.070
Come, come;

3279
02:45:46.070 --> 02:45:47.070
Lend me the torch.

3280
02:45:49.970 --> 02:45:51.300
Know we this face or no?

3281
02:45:53.730 --> 02:46:00.130
Alas my friend, my dear countryman Roderigo!

3282
02:46:01.370 --> 02:46:05.670
No--yes, sure: O heaven!

3283
02:46:05.670 --> 02:46:07.200
Roderigo.

3284
02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:08.470
What, of Venice?

3285
02:46:08.470 --> 02:46:09.830
Even he, sir; did you know him?

3286
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:10.930
Know him!

3287
02:46:10.930 --> 02:46:12.100
Ay.

3288
02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:13.430
Signior Gratiano?

3289
02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:15.530
I cry your gentle pardon;

3290
02:46:15.530 --> 02:46:18.100
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,

3291
02:46:18.100 --> 02:46:19.300
That so neglected you.

3292
02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:20.430
I am glad to see you.

3293
02:46:20.430 --> 02:46:22.430
How do you, Cassio?

3294
02:46:22.430 --> 02:46:24.800
A chair, a chair!

3295
02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:26.530
Roderigo!

3296
02:46:26.530 --> 02:46:31.700
He, he 'tis he.

3297
02:46:31.700 --> 02:46:34.400
O, the chair!

3298
02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:36.300
I'll fetch the general's surgeon.

3299
02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:38.500
For you, mistress,

3300
02:46:38.500 --> 02:46:40.630
Save you your labours.

3301
02:46:42.430 --> 02:46:44.400
He that lies slain here, Cassio,

3302
02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:48.800
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

3303
02:46:50.130 --> 02:46:53.430
None in the world; nor do I know the man.

3304
02:46:53.430 --> 02:46:55.230
What, look you pale?

3305
02:46:55.230 --> 02:46:56.270
O, bear him out o' the air.

3306
02:46:59.700 --> 02:47:01.430
Stay you, good gentlemen.

3307
02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:05.300
Look you pale, mistress?

3308
02:47:07.930 --> 02:47:10.830
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?

3309
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:14.200
Nay, if you shall stare, we shall hear more anon.

3310
02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:15.470
Behold her well;

3311
02:47:15.470 --> 02:47:16.830
I pray you, look at her:

3312
02:47:16.830 --> 02:47:18.200
Do you see, gentlemen?

3313
02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:20.400
Nay, guiltiness will speak,

3314
02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:21.930
Even though tongues were out of use.

3315
02:47:21.930 --> 02:47:23.130
'Las, what's the matter?

3316
02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:26.170
What's the matter, husband?

3317
02:47:26.170 --> 02:47:28.500
Cassio hath been here set on in the dark

3318
02:47:28.500 --> 02:47:30.430
By Roderigo and others who are scaped:

3319
02:47:30.430 --> 02:47:34.170
He's almost slain, and Roderigo quite dead.

3320
02:47:35.100 --> 02:47:36.830
Alas, good gentleman!

3321
02:47:36.830 --> 02:47:38.200
Alas, good Cassio!

3322
02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:40.070
This is the fruit of whoring.

3323
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:41.330
Prithee, Emilia,

3324
02:47:41.330 --> 02:47:43.730
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.

3325
02:47:43.730 --> 02:47:45.630
What, do you shake at that?

3326
02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:48.630
He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

3327
02:47:48.630 --> 02:47:49.800
O, did he so?

3328
02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:51.630
I charge you, go with me.

3329
02:47:51.630 --> 02:47:53.430
Fie upon thee, strumpet!

3330
02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:55.900
I am no strumpet; but of life as honest

3331
02:47:55.900 --> 02:47:57.730
As you that thus abuse me.

3332
02:47:57.730 --> 02:47:58.830
As I!

3333
02:47:58.830 --> 02:48:00.300
Foh!

3334
02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:02.300
Fie upon thee, strumpet!

3335
02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:05.700
Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.

3336
02:48:05.700 --> 02:48:09.230
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.

3337
02:48:09.230 --> 02:48:11.870
Emilia run you to the citadel,

3338
02:48:11.870 --> 02:48:14.070
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.

3339
02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:15.400
Will you go on afore?

3340
02:48:26.600 --> 02:48:28.370
This is the night

3341
02:48:28.370 --> 02:48:34.230
That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

3342
02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:36.300
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul--

3343
02:49:40.230 --> 02:49:43.970
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!

3344
02:49:47.070 --> 02:49:48.370
It is the cause.

3345
02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:13.470
Yet I'll not shed her blood;

3346
02:50:13.470 --> 02:50:17.370
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,

3347
02:50:17.370 --> 02:50:21.670
And smooth as monumental alabaster.

3348
02:50:23.570 --> 02:50:29.770
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.

3349
02:50:34.030 --> 02:50:45.070
Put out the light, and then put out the light:

3350
02:50:47.530 --> 02:50:49.900
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,

3351
02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:53.570
I can again thy former light restore,

3352
02:50:53.570 --> 02:51:01.170
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,

3353
02:51:01.170 --> 02:51:07.170
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,

3354
02:51:07.170 --> 02:51:09.970
I know not where is that Promethean heat

3355
02:51:09.970 --> 02:51:12.770
That can thy light relume.

3356
02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:22.700
When I have pluck'd thy rose,

3357
02:51:22.700 --> 02:51:25.870
I cannot give it vital growth again.

3358
02:51:28.530 --> 02:51:30.770
It needs must wither:

3359
02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:41.400
I'll smell it on the tree.

3360
02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:05.030
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade

3361
02:52:05.030 --> 02:52:08.870
Justice to break her sword!

3362
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:13.730
One more, one more.

3363
02:52:25.970 --> 02:52:30.170
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,

3364
02:52:30.170 --> 02:52:32.530
And love thee after.

3365
02:52:34.100 --> 02:52:39.600
One more, and this the last:

3366
02:52:48.200 --> 02:52:51.470
So sweet was ne'er so fatal.

3367
02:52:53.500 --> 02:52:58.300
I must weep, But they are cruel tears:

3368
02:52:58.300 --> 02:53:00.500
this sorrow's heavenly;

3369
02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:02.930
It strikes where it doth love.

3370
02:53:02.930 --> 02:53:04.270
She wakes.

3371
02:53:17.370 --> 02:53:18.370
Who's there?

3372
02:53:26.130 --> 02:53:27.230
Othello.

3373
02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:28.330
Ay. Desdemona.

3374
02:53:32.930 --> 02:53:35.170
Will you come to bed, my lord?

3375
02:53:38.270 --> 02:53:39.800
Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

3376
02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:43.070
Ay, my lord.

3377
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:46.900
If you bethink yourself of any crime

3378
02:53:46.900 --> 02:53:50.630
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,

3379
02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:53.000
Solicit for it straight.

3380
02:53:55.330 --> 02:53:56.800
Alack, what may you mean by that?

3381
02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:03.030
Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:

3382
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:07.830
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;

3383
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:12.600
No; heaven forfend!

3384
02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:14.230
I would not kill thy soul.

3385
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:16.770
Talk you of killing?

3386
02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:20.700
Ay, I do.

3387
02:54:21.770 --> 02:54:25.400
Then heaven have mercy on me!

3388
02:54:25.400 --> 02:54:29.470
Amen, with all my heart!

3389
02:54:29.470 --> 02:54:30.470
If you say so,

3390
02:54:35.770 --> 02:54:37.570
I hope you will not kill me.

3391
02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:46.470
And yet I fear you; for you are fearful then

3392
02:54:46.470 --> 02:54:48.330
When your eyes roll so:

3393
02:54:48.330 --> 02:54:50.870
I know not why I fear,

3394
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:54.030
Since guiltiness I know not; and yet I feel I fear.

3395
02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:01.770
Think on thy sins.

3396
02:55:01.770 --> 02:55:04.300
They are loves I bear to thee.

3397
02:55:04.300 --> 02:55:06.670
Ay, and for that thou diest.

3398
02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:10.300
That death's unnatural that kills for loving.

3399
02:55:12.330 --> 02:55:14.700
Why gnaw you so your nether lip?

3400
02:55:16.370 --> 02:55:18.030
The bloody passion shakes your very frame:

3401
02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:25.730
These are portents; and yet I hope, I hope,

3402
02:55:25.730 --> 02:55:27.230
They do not point at me.

3403
02:55:27.230 --> 02:55:28.330
Peace, and be still!

3404
02:55:28.330 --> 02:55:29.330
I will so.

3405
02:55:34.930 --> 02:55:36.930
What's the matter?

3406
02:55:41.230 --> 02:55:47.470
That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee

3407
02:55:47.470 --> 02:55:49.770
Thou gavest to Cassio.

3408
02:55:49.770 --> 02:55:52.900
No, by my life and soul!

3409
02:55:52.900 --> 02:55:55.230
Send for the man, and ask him.

3410
02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:58.000
Sweet soul, take heed,

3411
02:55:58.000 --> 02:55:59.430
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

3412
02:55:59.430 --> 02:56:00.600
Ay, but not yet to die.

3413
02:56:00.600 --> 02:56:01.830
Yes, presently:

3414
02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:04.530
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;

3415
02:56:04.530 --> 02:56:08.030
For to deny each article with oath

3416
02:56:08.030 --> 02:56:11.570
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception

3417
02:56:11.570 --> 02:56:13.530
That I do groan withal.

3418
02:56:13.530 --> 02:56:15.600
Thou art to die!

3419
02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:17.470
Then Lord have mercy on me!

3420
02:56:17.470 --> 02:56:18.570
I say, amen.

3421
02:56:18.570 --> 02:56:19.770
And have you mercy too!

3422
02:56:21.770 --> 02:56:23.070
I never did

3423
02:56:23.070 --> 02:56:26.230
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio

3424
02:56:26.230 --> 02:56:28.430
But by such general warranty of heaven

3425
02:56:28.430 --> 02:56:31.800
As I might love: I never gave him token.

3426
02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:34.100
By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.

3427
02:56:34.100 --> 02:56:35.800
O perjured woman!

3428
02:56:37.930 --> 02:56:39.400
Thou dost stone my heart,

3429
02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:40.800
And makest me call what I intend to do

3430
02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:43.070
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:

3431
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:46.970
I saw the handkerchief.

3432
02:56:46.970 --> 02:56:48.130
He found it then;

3433
02:56:48.130 --> 02:56:50.500
I never gave it him: send for him hither;

3434
02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:51.970
Let him confess the truth.

3435
02:56:51.970 --> 02:56:52.970
He hath confess'd.

3436
02:56:55.100 --> 02:56:56.930
What, my lord?

3437
02:56:56.930 --> 02:57:00.530
That he hath used thee.

3438
02:57:02.770 --> 02:57:03.870
How?

3439
02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:04.970
Unlawfully?

3440
02:57:04.970 --> 02:57:06.070
Ay.

3441
02:57:06.070 --> 02:57:08.130
He will not say so.

3442
02:57:08.130 --> 02:57:10.500
No, his mouth is stopp'd;

3443
02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:12.370
Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

3444
02:57:14.830 --> 02:57:18.670
My fear interprets: what, is he dead?

3445
02:57:18.670 --> 02:57:21.100
Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge

3446
02:57:21.100 --> 02:57:23.600
Had stomach for them all.

3447
02:57:25.100 --> 02:57:26.270
Alas!

3448
02:57:26.270 --> 02:57:30.470
He is betray'd and I undone.

3449
02:57:30.470 --> 02:57:31.600
Out, strumpet!

3450
02:57:31.600 --> 02:57:33.130
Weep'st thou for him to my face?

3451
02:57:33.130 --> 02:57:34.600
O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

3452
02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:35.700
Down, strumpet!

3453
02:57:35.700 --> 02:57:37.130
Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

3454
02:57:37.130 --> 02:57:38.230
Nay, if you strive--

3455
02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:39.330
But half an hour!

3456
02:57:39.330 --> 02:57:40.430
It is too late.

3457
02:57:40.430 --> 02:57:41.530
I say one prayer!

3458
02:57:41.530 --> 02:57:42.530
It is too late.

3459
02:58:09.800 --> 02:58:11.470
My lord, my lord!

3460
02:58:14.070 --> 02:58:15.230
What, ho!

3461
02:58:15.230 --> 02:58:16.500
My lord, my lord!

3462
02:58:16.500 --> 02:58:17.530
What noise is this?

3463
02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:23.570
Not dead?

3464
02:58:23.570 --> 02:58:26.200
Not yet quite dead?

3465
02:58:26.200 --> 02:58:29.930
I that am cruel am yet merciful;

3466
02:58:29.930 --> 02:58:32.330
I would not have thee linger in thy pain:

3467
02:58:33.670 --> 02:58:36.670
So, so.

3468
02:58:41.370 --> 02:58:42.630
Who's there?

3469
02:58:43.630 --> 02:58:46.230
Yes: 'tis Emilia.

3470
02:58:48.730 --> 02:58:49.970
By and by.

3471
02:58:58.030 --> 02:58:59.830
She's dead.

3472
02:59:12.130 --> 02:59:16.070
'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.

3473
02:59:16.070 --> 02:59:17.300
The noise was here.

3474
02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:21.030
Ha! Ha! Ha!

3475
02:59:23.200 --> 02:59:24.400
No more moving?

3476
02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.470
Still as the grave.

3477
02:59:28.930 --> 02:59:30.200
Should she come in?

3478
02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:32.300
Were't good?

3479
02:59:32.300 --> 02:59:34.630
I think she stirs again: no.

3480
02:59:37.570 --> 02:59:39.830
What's the best?

3481
02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:42.270
If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:

3482
02:59:44.570 --> 02:59:46.870
My wife!

3483
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:48.270
My wife!

3484
02:59:49.770 --> 02:59:51.330
What wife?

3485
02:59:52.470 --> 02:59:54.830
I have no wife.

3486
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:59.030
O insupportable!

3487
03:00:00.070 --> 03:00:01.600
O heavy hour!

3488
03:00:05.270 --> 03:00:07.730
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse

3489
03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:11.400
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe

3490
03:00:11.400 --> 03:00:15.030
Did yawn at alteration.

3491
03:00:19.270 --> 03:00:20.800
O, good my lord!

3492
03:00:22.870 --> 03:00:25.670
I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;

3493
03:00:28.070 --> 03:00:30.030
Soft you; by and by.

3494
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:34.000
Let me the curtain draw.

3495
03:00:40.570 --> 03:00:42.130
Where art thou?

3496
03:01:01.700 --> 03:01:03.300
What's the matter with thee now?

3497
03:01:03.300 --> 03:01:05.130
O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

3498
03:01:05.130 --> 03:01:06.230
What, now?

3499
03:01:06.230 --> 03:01:07.330
But now.

3500
03:01:07.330 --> 03:01:08.770
It is the very error of the moon;

3501
03:01:08.770 --> 03:01:10.100
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,

3502
03:01:10.100 --> 03:01:11.500
And makes men mad.

3503
03:01:11.500 --> 03:01:13.900
Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian call'd Roderigo.

3504
03:01:13.900 --> 03:01:16.100
Roderigo kill'd! And Cassio kill'd!

3505
03:01:16.100 --> 03:01:17.500
No, Cassio is not kill'd.

3506
03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:18.830
Not Cassio kill'd!

3507
03:01:18.830 --> 03:01:20.100
Then murder's out of tune,

3508
03:01:20.100 --> 03:01:22.030
And sweet revenge grows harsh.

3509
03:01:28.700 --> 03:01:29.800
What cry is that?

3510
03:01:29.800 --> 03:01:30.800
That! What?

3511
03:01:32.300 --> 03:01:33.830
Out, and alas!

3512
03:01:33.830 --> 03:01:35.330
That was my mistress' voice.

3513
03:01:40.430 --> 03:01:42.230
Help!

3514
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:43.370
Help, ho!

3515
03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:49.500
O lady, lady speak again!

3516
03:01:52.130 --> 03:01:54.800
Sweet Desdemona!

3517
03:01:54.800 --> 03:01:58.670
O sweet mistress, speak!

3518
03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:06.870
A guiltless death I die.

3519
03:02:08.770 --> 03:02:14.370
O, who hath done this deed?

3520
03:02:15.470 --> 03:02:20.200
Nobody; I myself.

3521
03:02:22.700 --> 03:02:27.600
Farewell,

3522
03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:31.030
Commend me to my kind lord:

3523
03:02:32.970 --> 03:02:36.330
O, farewell!

3524
03:02:58.630 --> 03:03:00.700
Why, how should she be murder'd?

3525
03:03:01.700 --> 03:03:02.830
Alas, who knows?

3526
03:03:02.830 --> 03:03:04.000
You heard her say herself, it was not I.

3527
03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:07.930
She said so: I must needs report the truth.

3528
03:03:07.930 --> 03:03:09.730
She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:

3529
03:03:09.730 --> 03:03:11.230
'Twas I that kill'd her.

3530
03:03:11.230 --> 03:03:15.270
O, the more angel she,

3531
03:03:15.270 --> 03:03:17.770
And you the blacker devil!

3532
03:03:17.770 --> 03:03:19.630
She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

3533
03:03:19.630 --> 03:03:23.200
Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

3534
03:03:23.200 --> 03:03:24.570
She was false as water.

3535
03:03:24.570 --> 03:03:25.970
Thou art rash as fire, to say

3536
03:03:25.970 --> 03:03:30.670
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

3537
03:03:30.670 --> 03:03:34.430
Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.

3538
03:03:36.830 --> 03:03:41.000
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,

3539
03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:44.030
But that I did proceed upon just grounds

3540
03:03:44.030 --> 03:03:46.530
To this extremity.

3541
03:03:46.530 --> 03:03:47.530
Thy husband knew it all.

3542
03:03:49.300 --> 03:03:50.470
My husband?

3543
03:03:50.470 --> 03:03:52.730
Thy husband.

3544
03:03:52.730 --> 03:03:54.100
That she was false to wedlock?

3545
03:03:54.100 --> 03:03:58.170
Ay, with Cassio.

3546
03:03:58.170 --> 03:03:59.230
Nay, had she been true,

3547
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:03.070
If heaven would make me such another world

3548
03:04:03.070 --> 03:04:08.330
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite, I'd not have sold her for it.

3549
03:04:09.500 --> 03:04:10.630
My husband!

3550
03:04:12.030 --> 03:04:16.230
Thy husband, ay, 'twas he that told me first:

3551
03:04:16.230 --> 03:04:19.230
An honest man he is, and hates the slime

3552
03:04:19.230 --> 03:04:21.630
That sticks on filthy deeds.

3553
03:04:24.330 --> 03:04:25.530
My husband!

3554
03:04:25.530 --> 03:04:26.870
What needs this iteration, woman?

3555
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:27.900
I say thy husband.

3556
03:04:29.630 --> 03:04:32.700
O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,

3557
03:04:32.700 --> 03:04:36.170
My husband say that she was false!

3558
03:04:36.170 --> 03:04:40.230
He, woman; I say thy husband: dost understand the word?

3559
03:04:40.230 --> 03:04:42.330
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

3560
03:04:44.530 --> 03:04:47.530
If he say so, may his pernicious soul

3561
03:04:47.530 --> 03:04:50.000
Rot half a grain a day!

3562
03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:53.400
He lies to the heart:

3563
03:04:56.670 --> 03:04:59.200
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

3564
03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:00.470
Ha!

3565
03:05:00.470 --> 03:05:01.870
Do thy worst:

3566
03:05:01.870 --> 03:05:04.170
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven

3567
03:05:04.170 --> 03:05:05.670
Than thou wast worthy her.

3568
03:05:05.670 --> 03:05:06.930
Peace, you were best.

3569
03:05:06.930 --> 03:05:09.230
Thou hast not half that power to do me harm

3570
03:05:09.230 --> 03:05:11.300
As I have to be hurt.

3571
03:05:13.100 --> 03:05:16.930
O gull!

3572
03:05:16.930 --> 03:05:19.330
O dolt!

3573
03:05:19.330 --> 03:05:22.070
As ignorant as dirt!

3574
03:05:22.070 --> 03:05:25.830
Thou hast done a deed-- I care not for thy sword;

3575
03:05:25.830 --> 03:05:27.830
I'll make thee known,

3576
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:31.830
Though I lost twenty lives--Help!

3577
03:05:31.830 --> 03:05:34.070
Help, ho!

3578
03:05:34.070 --> 03:05:36.900
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress!

3579
03:05:36.900 --> 03:05:38.470
Murder!

3580
03:05:38.470 --> 03:05:39.900
Murder!

3581
03:05:39.900 --> 03:05:41.030
What is the matter?

3582
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:42.830
How now, general!

3583
03:05:45.530 --> 03:05:47.500
O, are you come, Iago?

3584
03:05:47.500 --> 03:05:49.070
You have done well,

3585
03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:51.230
That men must lay their murders on your neck.

3586
03:05:51.230 --> 03:05:52.730
What's the matter?

3587
03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:55.770
Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:

3588
03:05:55.770 --> 03:06:02.730
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:

3589
03:06:02.730 --> 03:06:06.730
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:

3590
03:06:06.730 --> 03:06:10.230
Do speak, for my heart is full.

3591
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:13.130
I told him what I thought, and told no more

3592
03:06:13.130 --> 03:06:16.070
Than what he found himself was apt and true.

3593
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:18.100
But did you ever tell him she was false?

3594
03:06:18.100 --> 03:06:19.300
I did.

3595
03:06:19.300 --> 03:06:23.500
You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;

3596
03:06:23.500 --> 03:06:27.130
Upon my soul, a wicked lie.

3597
03:06:27.130 --> 03:06:32.430
She false with Cassio did you say with Cassio?

3598
03:06:32.430 --> 03:06:34.070
With Cassio, mistress.

3599
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:35.500
Go to, charm your tongue.

3600
03:06:35.500 --> 03:06:38.170
I will not charm my tongue;

3601
03:06:38.170 --> 03:06:41.370
I am bound to speak:

3602
03:06:41.370 --> 03:06:45.200
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed--

3603
03:06:45.200 --> 03:06:46.330
Heavens forfend!

3604
03:06:49.630 --> 03:06:52.400
And your reports have set the murder on.

3605
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:59.030
Villany, villany, villany!

3606
03:06:59.030 --> 03:07:01.200
I think upon't, I think:

3607
03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:03.570
I smell't: villany!--

3608
03:07:03.570 --> 03:07:08.500
I thought so then-- O, I'll kill myself for grief--

3609
03:07:08.500 --> 03:07:09.700
villany, villany!

3610
03:07:09.700 --> 03:07:10.830
What, are you mad?

3611
03:07:10.830 --> 03:07:13.170
I charge you, get you home.

3612
03:07:19.000 --> 03:07:21.500
I pray you, give me leave to speak:

3613
03:07:24.970 --> 03:07:29.800
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.

3614
03:07:32.370 --> 03:07:36.630
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

3615
03:07:37.570 --> 03:07:40.900
O! O! O!

3616
03:07:40.900 --> 03:07:44.000
Nay, lay thee down and roar;

3617
03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:48.400
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent

3618
03:07:48.400 --> 03:07:50.500
That e'er did lift up eye.

3619
03:07:50.500 --> 03:07:52.370
O, she was foul!

3620
03:07:58.470 --> 03:08:02.500
I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,

3621
03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:06.400
Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:

3622
03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:10.970
I know this act shows horrible and grim.

3623
03:08:10.970 --> 03:08:12.830
Poor Desdemona!

3624
03:08:12.830 --> 03:08:15.070
I am glad thy father's dead:

3625
03:08:15.070 --> 03:08:17.730
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief

3626
03:08:17.730 --> 03:08:21.600
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,

3627
03:08:21.600 --> 03:08:23.500
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,

3628
03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:25.570
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,

3629
03:08:25.570 --> 03:08:27.600
And fall to reprobance.

3630
03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:31.330
'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows

3631
03:08:31.330 --> 03:08:32.970
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame

3632
03:08:32.970 --> 03:08:35.100
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:

3633
03:08:36.330 --> 03:08:38.100
And she did gratify his amorous works

3634
03:08:38.100 --> 03:08:40.200
With that recognizance and pledge of love

3635
03:08:40.200 --> 03:08:42.000
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:

3636
03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:51.130
It was a handkerchief, an antique token

3637
03:08:51.130 --> 03:08:54.830
My father gave my mother.

3638
03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:57.670
O God.

3639
03:08:57.670 --> 03:08:59.570
O heavenly God!

3640
03:08:59.570 --> 03:09:01.200
Come, hold your peace.

3641
03:09:01.200 --> 03:09:07.130
'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!

3642
03:09:08.200 --> 03:09:13.730
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:

3643
03:09:13.730 --> 03:09:16.770
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,

3644
03:09:16.770 --> 03:09:21.870
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

3645
03:09:21.870 --> 03:09:23.330
Be wise, and get you home.

3646
03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:24.570
I will not.

3647
03:09:24.570 --> 03:09:25.670
Fie!

3648
03:09:25.670 --> 03:09:27.730
Your sword upon a woman?

3649
03:09:27.730 --> 03:09:30.800
O thou dull Moor!

3650
03:09:32.270 --> 03:09:35.130
That handkerchief thou speak'st of

3651
03:09:35.130 --> 03:09:41.670
I found by fortune and did give my husband;

3652
03:09:41.670 --> 03:09:44.000
For often, with a solemn earnestness,

3653
03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:47.070
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,

3654
03:09:47.070 --> 03:09:48.700
He begg'd of me to steal it.

3655
03:09:48.700 --> 03:09:50.770
Villanous whore!

3656
03:09:50.770 --> 03:09:52.630
She give it Cassio!

3657
03:09:52.630 --> 03:09:53.630
No!

3658
03:09:55.100 --> 03:09:56.830
I found it,

3659
03:09:56.830 --> 03:10:00.230
And I did give't my husband.

3660
03:10:00.230 --> 03:10:02.270
Filth, thou liest!

3661
03:10:02.270 --> 03:10:06.030
By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.

3662
03:10:06.030 --> 03:10:10.930
O murderous coxcomb!

3663
03:10:10.930 --> 03:10:15.930
What would such a fool do with so good a wife?

3664
03:10:18.330 --> 03:10:19.730
Are there no stones in heaven

3665
03:10:22.530 --> 03:10:25.830
But what serve as for the thunder?

3666
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:33.500
Precious villain!

3667
03:10:37.100 --> 03:10:41.930
The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.

3668
03:10:41.930 --> 03:10:48.000
Ay: O, O lay me by my mistress' side.

3669
03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:49.300
He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

3670
03:10:49.300 --> 03:10:50.400
'Tis a notorious villain.

3671
03:10:50.400 --> 03:10:51.500
Take you this weapon,

3672
03:10:51.500 --> 03:10:52.770
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:

3673
03:10:52.770 --> 03:10:54.630
Guard the door without; let him not pass,

3674
03:10:54.630 --> 03:10:55.870
But kill him rather.

3675
03:10:55.870 --> 03:10:58.300
I'll after that same villain, for 'tis a damned slave.

3676
03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:04.170
I am not valiant neither,

3677
03:11:04.170 --> 03:11:08.030
But every puny whipster gets my sword:

3678
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:11.200
But why should honour outlive honesty?

3679
03:11:11.200 --> 03:11:13.070
Let it go all.

3680
03:11:17.370 --> 03:11:19.830
What did thy song bode, lady?

3681
03:11:21.900 --> 03:11:26.600
Hark, canst thou hear me?

3682
03:11:30.570 --> 03:11:34.270
I will play the swan.

3683
03:11:34.270 --> 03:11:36.230
And die in music.

3684
03:11:38.100 --> 03:11:41.930
Willow, willow, willow--

3685
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:53.070
O Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;

3686
03:11:53.070 --> 03:11:59.800
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;

3687
03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:08.400
And speaking as I think, alas, I die.

3688
03:12:16.900 --> 03:12:19.230
I have another weapon in this chamber;

3689
03:12:21.300 --> 03:12:25.730
It was a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper--

3690
03:12:27.600 --> 03:12:29.230
O, here it is.

3691
03:12:30.700 --> 03:12:33.930
Uncle, I must come forth.

3692
03:12:33.930 --> 03:12:36.330
If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:

3693
03:12:36.330 --> 03:12:38.170
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

3694
03:12:40.100 --> 03:12:42.130
Look in upon me then and speak with me,

3695
03:12:42.130 --> 03:12:44.730
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

3696
03:12:46.330 --> 03:12:47.730
What's the matter?

3697
03:12:47.730 --> 03:12:51.330
Behold, I have a weapon;

3698
03:12:53.100 --> 03:12:54.400
A better never did sustain itself

3699
03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:58.100
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,

3700
03:12:58.100 --> 03:12:59.900
That, with this little arm and this good sword,

3701
03:12:59.900 --> 03:13:02.570
I have made my way through more impediments

3702
03:13:02.570 --> 03:13:09.070
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!

3703
03:13:11.000 --> 03:13:13.700
Who can control his fate?

3704
03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:15.330
'Tis not so now.

3705
03:13:16.830 --> 03:13:20.000
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;

3706
03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:24.100
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,

3707
03:13:24.100 --> 03:13:28.000
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.

3708
03:13:32.570 --> 03:13:35.630
Do you go back dismay'd?

3709
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:37.600
'Tis a lost fear;

3710
03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:42.230
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,

3711
03:13:42.230 --> 03:13:44.500
And he retires.

3712
03:13:47.530 --> 03:13:49.670
Where should Othello go?

3713
03:14:00.900 --> 03:14:04.970
Now, how dost thou look now?

3714
03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.070
O ill-starr'd wench!

3715
03:14:09.930 --> 03:14:11.500
Pale as thy smock!

3716
03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:17.800
When we shall meet at compt,

3717
03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:22.270
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,

3718
03:14:24.130 --> 03:14:26.800
And fiends will snatch at it.

3719
03:14:28.900 --> 03:14:33.770
Cold, cold, my girl!

3720
03:14:35.430 --> 03:14:38.100
Even like thy chastity.

3721
03:14:39.630 --> 03:14:43.670
O cursed, cursed slave!

3722
03:14:47.370 --> 03:14:51.430
Whip me, ye devils,

3723
03:14:51.430 --> 03:14:54.800
From the possession of this heavenly sight!

3724
03:14:56.130 --> 03:14:58.500
Blow me about in winds!

3725
03:14:58.500 --> 03:15:00.600
Roast me in sulphur!

3726
03:15:02.330 --> 03:15:08.230
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!

3727
03:15:09.670 --> 03:15:12.170
O Desdemona!

3728
03:15:12.170 --> 03:15:14.170
Dead!

3729
03:15:14.170 --> 03:15:18.230
O Desdemona!

3730
03:15:24.730 --> 03:15:27.370
Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

3731
03:15:30.570 --> 03:15:33.200
That's he that was Othello: here I am.

3732
03:15:33.200 --> 03:15:35.400
Where is that viper?

3733
03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:37.770
Bring the villain forth.

3734
03:15:42.430 --> 03:15:47.200
I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.

3735
03:15:49.470 --> 03:15:51.230
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.

3736
03:15:51.230 --> 03:15:53.370
Wrench his sword from him.

3737
03:15:55.130 --> 03:15:58.070
I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

3738
03:15:58.070 --> 03:16:01.670
I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;

3739
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:04.570
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

3740
03:16:04.570 --> 03:16:06.570
O thou Othello, that wert once so good,

3741
03:16:06.570 --> 03:16:09.800
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,

3742
03:16:09.800 --> 03:16:11.030
What shall be said to thee?

3743
03:16:11.030 --> 03:16:12.300
Why, any thing:

3744
03:16:12.300 --> 03:16:15.300
An honourable murderer, if you will;

3745
03:16:15.300 --> 03:16:17.830
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

3746
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:20.130
This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:

3747
03:16:20.130 --> 03:16:23.600
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

3748
03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:24.830
Ay.

3749
03:16:24.830 --> 03:16:26.300
Dear general, I never gave you cause.

3750
03:16:26.300 --> 03:16:29.470
I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.

3751
03:16:31.200 --> 03:16:36.130
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil

3752
03:16:36.130 --> 03:16:40.370
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

3753
03:16:40.370 --> 03:16:45.200
Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:

3754
03:16:45.200 --> 03:16:47.830
From this time forth I never will speak word.

3755
03:16:47.830 --> 03:16:49.000
What, not to pray?

3756
03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:50.830
Torment will open your lips.

3757
03:16:50.830 --> 03:16:52.530
Well, thou dost best.

3758
03:16:52.530 --> 03:16:54.370
Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,

3759
03:16:54.370 --> 03:16:55.700
Which, as I think, you know not.

3760
03:16:55.700 --> 03:16:56.900
Here is a letter

3761
03:16:56.900 --> 03:16:58.930
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;

3762
03:16:58.930 --> 03:17:01.130
And here another: the one of them imports

3763
03:17:01.130 --> 03:17:03.230
The death of Cassio to be undertook by Roderigo.

3764
03:17:03.230 --> 03:17:04.330
O villain!

3765
03:17:04.330 --> 03:17:05.570
Most heathenish and most gross!

3766
03:17:05.570 --> 03:17:06.900
Now here's another discontented paper,

3767
03:17:06.900 --> 03:17:08.970
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,

3768
03:17:08.970 --> 03:17:11.600
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;

3769
03:17:11.600 --> 03:17:12.830
But that belike Iago in the nick

3770
03:17:12.830 --> 03:17:14.930
Came in and satisfied him.

3771
03:17:14.930 --> 03:17:16.530
O thou pernicious caitiff!

3772
03:17:17.970 --> 03:17:20.230
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief

3773
03:17:20.230 --> 03:17:21.730
That was my wife's?

3774
03:17:21.730 --> 03:17:23.930
I found it in my chamber:

3775
03:17:23.930 --> 03:17:26.100
And he himself confess'd it even now

3776
03:17:26.100 --> 03:17:27.500
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose

3777
03:17:27.500 --> 03:17:30.100
Which wrought to his desire.

3778
03:17:30.100 --> 03:17:33.770
Fool! Fool! Fool!

3779
03:17:33.770 --> 03:17:35.370
There is besides in Roderigo's letter,

3780
03:17:35.370 --> 03:17:37.170
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him

3781
03:17:37.170 --> 03:17:38.730
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came

3782
03:17:38.730 --> 03:17:42.630
I was cast: and even but now he spake,

3783
03:17:42.630 --> 03:17:44.370
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,

3784
03:17:44.370 --> 03:17:45.730
Iago set him on.

3785
03:17:45.730 --> 03:17:47.800
You must forsake this room, and go with us:

3786
03:17:47.800 --> 03:17:49.400
Your power and your command is taken off,

3787
03:17:49.400 --> 03:17:51.370
And Cassio rules in Cyprus.

3788
03:17:51.370 --> 03:17:53.800
For this slave,

3789
03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:56.130
If there be any cunning cruelty

3790
03:17:56.130 --> 03:17:58.570
That can torment him much and hold him long,

3791
03:17:58.570 --> 03:18:00.400
It shall be his.

3792
03:18:00.400 --> 03:18:02.030
You shall close prisoner rest,

3793
03:18:02.030 --> 03:18:03.870
Till that the nature of your fault be known

3794
03:18:03.870 --> 03:18:05.300
To the Venetian state.

3795
03:18:05.300 --> 03:18:07.100
Come, bring him away.

3796
03:18:07.100 --> 03:18:11.070
Soft you; a word or two before you go.

3797
03:18:17.300 --> 03:18:23.630
I have done the state some service, and they know't.

3798
03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:24.700
No more of that.

3799
03:18:27.970 --> 03:18:29.600
I pray you, in your letters,

3800
03:18:29.600 --> 03:18:32.770
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,

3801
03:18:32.770 --> 03:18:40.100
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,

3802
03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:44.670
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak

3803
03:18:44.670 --> 03:18:52.470
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;

3804
03:18:54.900 --> 03:19:00.200
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought

3805
03:19:00.200 --> 03:19:03.000
Perplex'd in the extreme;

3806
03:19:13.730 --> 03:19:17.930
of one whose hand,

3807
03:19:17.930 --> 03:19:22.070
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away

3808
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:28.170
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,

3809
03:19:28.170 --> 03:19:31.930
Albeit unused to the melting mood,

3810
03:19:31.930 --> 03:19:36.900
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees

3811
03:19:36.900 --> 03:19:38.530
Their medicinal gum.

3812
03:19:41.370 --> 03:19:43.330
Set you down this;

3813
03:19:43.330 --> 03:19:47.770
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,

3814
03:19:47.770 --> 03:19:51.500
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk

3815
03:19:51.500 --> 03:19:54.030
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,

3816
03:19:54.030 --> 03:20:00.270
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,

3817
03:20:00.270 --> 03:20:03.330
And smote him, thus.

3818
03:20:03.330 --> 03:20:06.570
O bloody period!

3819
03:20:06.570 --> 03:20:09.100
All that's spoke is marr'd.

3820
03:20:16.270 --> 03:20:21.600
I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;

3821
03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:27.070
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

3822
03:20:34.170 --> 03:20:39.230
This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;

3823
03:20:39.230 --> 03:20:41.500
For he was great of heart.

3824
03:20:41.500 --> 03:20:44.130
O Spartan dog,

3825
03:20:44.130 --> 03:20:48.030
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!

3826
03:20:49.170 --> 03:20:51.570
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;

3827
03:20:51.570 --> 03:20:56.170
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;

3828
03:20:56.170 --> 03:20:57.230
Let it be hid.

3829
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:59.930
Gratiano, keep the house,

3830
03:20:59.930 --> 03:21:01.330
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,

3831
03:21:01.330 --> 03:21:02.830
For they succeed on you.

3832
03:21:03.930 --> 03:21:05.070
To you, lord governor,

3833
03:21:05.070 --> 03:21:07.430
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;

3834
03:21:07.430 --> 03:21:10.700
The time, the place, the torture:

3835
03:21:10.700 --> 03:21:12.470
O, enforce it!

3836
03:21:14.530 --> 03:21:17.870
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state

3837
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:22.370
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

3838
03:23:47.100 --> 03:23:50.100
