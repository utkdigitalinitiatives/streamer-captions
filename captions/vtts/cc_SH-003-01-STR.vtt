00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:51.330


2
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.030
Two households, both alike in dignity,

3
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.530
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

4
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.500
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

5
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.900
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

6
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.770
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes

7
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.230
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;

8
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.500
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows

9
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.030
Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.

10
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.000
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,

11
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.170
And the continuance of their parents' rage,

12
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.730
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,

13
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.230
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;

14
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.830
The which if you with patient ears attend,

15
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.700
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

16
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.830
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

17
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.330
No, for then we should be colliers.

18
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.300
I strike quickly, being moved.

19
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.270
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

20
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.970
'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant:

21
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.270
when I have fought with the men,

22
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.500
I will be civil with the maids, and cut off their heads.

23
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.830
The heads of the maids?

24
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.500
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;

25
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
take it in what sense thou wilt.

26
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.730
They must take it in sense that feel it.

27
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.630
Me they shall feel whilst I am able to stand:

28
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.800
and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

29
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.570
Draw thy tool!

30
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.970
Here come two of the house of the Montagues.

31
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.700
Quarrel, I'll back thee.

32
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.800
How! Turn thy back and run?

33
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.930
Fear me not.

34
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.130
No, marry; I fear thee!

35
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.570
Let us take the law of our sides;

36
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.670
let them begin.

37
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.930
I will frown as I pass by,

38
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.200
and let them take it as they list.

39
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.500
Nay, as they dare.

40
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.830
I will bite my thumb at them;

41
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.200
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

42
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.700
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

43
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.930
I do bite my thumb, sir.

44
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.570
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

45
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.230
Is the law of our side, if I say ay?

46
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.430
No.

47
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.500
No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir,

48
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.700
but I do bite my thumb, sir.

49
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.930
Do you quarrel, sir?

50
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.470
Quarrel sir!

51
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.530
No, sir.

52
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.670
If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

53
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.930
No better?

54
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.200
Say 'better:' here comes one of our master's kinsmen.

55
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.430
Yes, better, sir.

56
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.030
You lie.

57
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.370
Gregory!

58
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.770
Remember thy swashing blow.

59
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.570
Part, fools!

60
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.070
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

61
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.730
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

62
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.070
I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,

63
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.270
Or manage it to part these men with me.

64
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.100
What, drawn, and talk of peace!

65
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.200
I hate the word,

66
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.300
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.

67
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.000
Down with the Capulets!

68
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.830
Down with the Montagues!

69
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.830
What noise is this?

70
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.900
Give me my long sword, ho!

71
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.130
A crutch, a crutch!

72
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.030
Why call you for a sword?

73
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.300
My sword, I say!

74
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.400
Old Montague is come,

75
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.930
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

76
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.870
Thou villain Capulet,-- Hold me not, let me go.

77
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.900
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.

78
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:01.970
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,

79
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.330
Profaners of this neighbour- stained steel,--

80
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:07.570
Will they not hear?

81
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.670
What, ho!

82
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.700
You men, you beasts,

83
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:14.730
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage

84
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.500
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,

85
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.270
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands

86
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.300
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,

87
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.300
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.

88
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:32.970
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,

89
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.600
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,

90
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.200
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,

91
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.500
And made Verona's ancient citizens

92
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.000
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,

93
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.800
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,

94
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.670
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:

95
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.200
If ever you disturb our streets again,

96
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.030
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.

97
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.830
For this time, all the rest depart away:

98
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.100
Capulet, you shall go along with me:

99
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.700
Montague, come you this afternoon,

100
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.430
To hear our further pleasure in this case,

101
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:18.800
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

102
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.870
O, where is Romeo?

103
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.070
Saw you him to-day?

104
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.470
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

105
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.900
Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun

106
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.770
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,

107
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.670
A troubled mind drew me to walk abroad;

108
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.170
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore

109
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.770
That westward rooteth from the city's side,

110
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.600
So early walking did I see your son:

111
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.100
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me

112
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.630
And stole into the covert of the wood.

113
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.330
Many a morning hath he there been seen,

114
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.500
With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew.

115
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.870
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;

116
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.930
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun

117
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:12.900
Should in the furthest east begin to draw

118
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.530
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,

119
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:19.070
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,

120
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.470
And private in his chamber pens himself,

121
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.100
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out

122
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.870
And makes himself an artificial night:

123
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.530
Black and portentous must this humour prove,

124
00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.830
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

125
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.330
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

126
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.270
I neither know it nor can learn of him.

127
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.570
Have you importuned him by any means?

128
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.270
Both by myself and many other friends.

129
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:44.230
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,

130
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.730
We would as willingly give cure as know.

131
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.300
Trust me, my lord: so please you, step aside;

132
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.070
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

133
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.130
Good-morrow, cousin.

134
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.870
Is the day so young?

135
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.530
But new struck nine.

136
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.700
Ay me!

137
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.830
Sad hours seem long.

138
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.270
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

139
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.870
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

140
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:12.970
In love?

141
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.070
Out--

142
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.170
Of love?

143
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.800
Out of her favour, where I'm in love.

144
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.830
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,

145
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.830
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

146
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.030
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,

147
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.700
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!

148
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.300
Where shall we dine?

149
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:29.500
O me!

150
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.070
What fray was here?

151
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:34.570
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.

152
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.370
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.

153
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.230
Why, then, O brawling love!

154
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.170
O loving hate!

155
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.270
O any thing, of nothing first create!

156
00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.900
O heavy lightness!

157
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.130
Serious vanity!

158
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.800
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!

159
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.500
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!

160
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.570
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.

161
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.570
Dost thou not laugh?

162
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.700
No, coz, I rather weep.

163
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.870
Good heart, at what?

164
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.870
At thy good heart's oppression.

165
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.300
Why, such is love's transgression.

166
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.030
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;

167
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.530
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;

168
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.370
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovering tears:

169
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.930
What is it else? a madness most discreet,

170
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.170
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.

171
00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.400
Farewell, my coz.

172
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.730
Soft!

173
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.430
I will go along;

174
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.400
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

175
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.170
I've lost myself; I'm not here;

176
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.800
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

177
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.870
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

178
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.470
What, shall I groan and tell thee?

179
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:43.570
Groan, why, no.

180
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.570
But sadly tell me who.

181
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.930
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

182
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.370
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

183
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.470
A right good mark-man!

184
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.670
And she's fair I love.

185
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.070
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

186
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.430
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit

187
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:57.770
With Cupid's arrow.

188
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.030
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

189
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.870
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.

190
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.700
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow

191
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.700
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

192
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:16.800
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

193
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.900
Teach me how I should forget to think.

194
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.070
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;

195
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.400
Examine other beauties.

196
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.830
He that is strucken blind cannot forget

197
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.800
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:

198
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.900
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,

199
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.670
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note

200
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.730
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?

201
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.930
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

202
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:41.470
I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

203
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.670
But Montague is bound as well as I,

204
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:49.770
In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,

205
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.900
For men so old as we to keep the peace.

206
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.600
Of honourable reckoning are you both;

207
00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.570
And pity 'tis you've lived at odds so long.

208
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.830
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

209
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.000
But saying o'er what I have said before:

210
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.600
My child is yet a stranger to the world;

211
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.030
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.

212
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.730
Let two more summers wither in their pride,

213
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.800
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

214
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.100
Younger than she are happy mothers made.

215
00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.200
And too soon marr'd are those so early made.

216
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.500
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,

217
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.600
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:

218
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.770
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,

219
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.530
My will to her consent is but a part;

220
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.070
An she agree, within her scope of choice

221
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.000
Lies my consent and fair according voice.

222
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.970
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,

223
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.900
Whereto I have invited many a guest,

224
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.900
Such as I love; and you, among the store,

225
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.670
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.

226
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.230
At my poor house look to behold this night

227
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.470
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:

228
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.530
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel

229
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:59.400
When well-apparell'd April on the heel

230
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.430
Of limping winter treads, even such delight

231
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.700
Among fresh female buds shall you this night

232
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:07.530
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,

233
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.030
And like her most whose merit most shall be.

234
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.300
Come, go with me.

235
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.300
Go, sirrah, trudge about

236
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.970
Through fair Verona; find those persons out

237
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.330
Whose names are written there, and to them say,

238
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.100
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

239
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.970
Find them out whose names are written here!

240
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.200
It is written,

241
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.700
that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard,

242
00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:51.170
and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil,

243
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.230
and the painter with his nets;

244
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:59.030
but I am sent to find those persons

245
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.400
whose names are here writ, and can never find what names

246
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.730
the writing person hath here writ.

247
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.330
I must to the learned.-- In good time.

248
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.570
Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,

249
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.800
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;

250
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.530
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;

251
00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.930
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:

252
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.530
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,

253
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.100
And the rank poison of the old will die.

254
00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.670
Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

255
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.830
God-den, good fellow.

256
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.130
God gi' god-den.

257
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.330
I pray, sir, can you read?

258
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.170
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

259
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.800
Perhaps you have learned it without book:

260
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.030
but, I pray, can you read any thing that you see?

261
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.030
Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

262
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.530
Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

263
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:44.570
Stay, fellow; I can read.

264
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.630
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;

265
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:55.130
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters;

266
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.600
the lady widow of Vitravio;

267
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.170
Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;

268
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.630
Mercutio and his brother Valentine;

269
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.970
mine uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters;

270
00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.670
my fair niece Rosaline and Livia;

271
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.030
Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt,

272
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.470
Lucio and the lively Helena.'

273
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:14.670
A fair assembly: whither should they come?

274
00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:15.770
Up.

275
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:16.870
Whither?

276
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.970
To supper at our house.

277
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.070
Whose house?

278
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.170
My master's.

279
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.830
Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

280
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.500
Now I'll tell you without asking:

281
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.870
my master is the great rich Capulet;

282
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:29.200
and if you be not of the house of Montague,

283
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.900
come and crush a cup of wine.

284
00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:32.700
Rest you merry!

285
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.170
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's

286
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.470
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,

287
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.000
With all the admired beauties of Verona:

288
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.030
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,

289
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.170
Compare her face with some that I will show,

290
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.770
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

291
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.070
One fairer than my love!

292
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.330
The all-seeing sun

293
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.530
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

294
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.470
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,

295
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.670
Herself poised with herself in either eye:

296
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.270
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd

297
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.670
Your lady's love against some other maid

298
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.430
That I will show you shining at this feast,

299
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.300
And she shall scant show well that now seems best.

300
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.070
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,

301
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.770
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

302
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.400
Nurse, where's my daughter?

303
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.270
Call her forth to me.

304
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.930
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve years old,

305
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.770
I bade her come.

306
00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:30.800
What, lamb!

307
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.830
What, ladybird!

308
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.930
God forbid!

309
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.200
Where's this girl?

310
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.300
What, Juliet!

311
00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.530
How now! Who calls?

312
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.530
Your mother.

313
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.230
Madam, I am here.

314
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.530
What is your will?

315
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.500
This is the matter:-- Nurse, give leave awhile,

316
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.930
We must talk in secret:--

317
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.470
Nurse, come back again;

318
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:57.300
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.

319
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.830
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

320
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:02.800
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

321
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:03.900
She's not fourteen.

322
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.000
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--

323
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.900
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--

324
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.000
She's not fourteen.

325
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
How long is it now To Lammas-tide?

326
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.600
A fortnight and odd days.

327
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.070
Even or odd, of all days in the year,

328
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.000
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.

329
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.770
Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--

330
00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.070
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;

331
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.200
She was too good for me: but, as I said,

332
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.530
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;

333
00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.300
I remember it well.

334
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.630
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;

335
00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:38.900
And on that day, of all days of the year,

336
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.170
that she was weaned; I never shall forget it.

337
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.800
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,

338
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.770
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;

339
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.770
My lord and you were then at Mantua:--

340
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.700
Nay, I do bear a brain:-- but, as I said,

341
00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.330
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple

342
00:18:56.330 --> 00:19:00.600
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty retch,

343
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.170
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!

344
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.630
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,

345
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.830
To bid me trudge:

346
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.270
And since that time it is eleven years;

347
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:17.000
And then she could stand high alone; nay, by the rood,

348
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.970
She then could run and waddle all about;

349
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.030
For e'en the day before, she broke her brow:

350
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:27.470
And then my husband-- O, God rest his soul!

351
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.500
He was a merry man-- took up the child:

352
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.930
"Yea," quoth he, "fallst thou upon thy face?

353
00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.830
"Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;

354
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.470
Wilt thou not, Jule?"

355
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.200
And, by my holidame,

356
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.830
The pretty wretch left crying and said "Ay."

357
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.470
To see, now, how a jest might come about!

358
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.430
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,

359
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.700
I never should forget it: "Wilt thou not, Jule?"

360
00:19:53.700 --> 00:20:00.300
Quoth he; And, pretty fool, it stinted and said "Ay."

361
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.530
Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

362
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.670
Yes, madam.

363
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:05.770
Juliet--

364
00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.000
I cannot choose but laugh,

365
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.270
To think it should leave crying and say "Ay."

366
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.230
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow

367
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.800
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;

368
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.570
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:

369
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:21.000
"Yea," quoth my husband, "fall'st upon thy face?

370
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
"Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;

371
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.370
Wilt thou not, Jule?"

372
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:31.400
Pretty fool, it stinted and said "Ay."

373
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.200
And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

374
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.730
Peace, I have done.

375
00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.930
God mark thee to his grace!

376
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.930
Thou wast the prettiest babe as e'er I nursed:

377
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:42.970
An I might live to see thee married once,

378
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.070
I'd have my wish.

379
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:45.430
Marry, that 'marry'

380
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.830
is the very theme I came to talk of.

381
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:49.930
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

382
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.100
How stands your disposition to be married?

383
00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.770
It is an honour that I dream not of.

384
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.870
An honour!

385
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:00.770
Were not I thine only nurse,

386
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.130
I'd say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

387
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:06.430
Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,

388
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.270
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,

389
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.030
Are made already mothers: by my count,

390
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.870
I was your mother much upon these years

391
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.130
That you are now a maid.

392
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Thus then in brief:

393
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.800
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

394
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.030
A man, young lady!

395
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.200
Lady, such a man

396
00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.170
As all the world-- oh, he's a man of wax.

397
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.730
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

398
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.070
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

399
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.600
What say you?

400
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.200
Can you love the gentleman?

401
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.970
This night you shall behold him at our feast;

402
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.400
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,

403
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.670
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;

404
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.400
Examine every married lineament,

405
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.430
And see how one another lends content

406
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.500
And what obscured in that fair volume lies

407
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.800
Find written in the margent of his eyes.

408
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.470
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,

409
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.930
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:

410
00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.470
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride

411
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.300
For fair without the fair within to hide:

412
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:16.900
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,

413
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.870
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;

414
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:24.100
So shall you share all that he doth possess,

415
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.900
By having him, making yourself no less.

416
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.070
No less!

417
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.830
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.

418
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:35.430
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

419
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:38.470
I'll look to like, if looking liking move:

420
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.830
But no more deep will I endart mine eye

421
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.330
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

422
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.900
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called,

423
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.330
my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in the pantry,

424
00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.370
and every thing in extremity.

425
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.570
I must hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

426
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:54.700
We follow thee.

427
00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.130
Juliet, the county stays.

428
00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:03.230
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

429
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.530
Shall we on without a apology?

430
00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:14.400
The date is out of such prolixity.

431
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.400
But let them measure us by what they will;

432
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.100
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

433
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.330
Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;

434
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:22.030
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

435
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.930
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

436
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.930
Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes

437
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:30.970
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead

438
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:32.900
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

439
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.500
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,

440
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.970
And soar with them above the common bound.

441
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.830
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft

442
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.870
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,

443
00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:44.530
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:

444
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.030
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

445
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.700
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;

446
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.870
Too great oppression for a tender thing.

447
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.070
Is love a tender thing?

448
00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.430
It is too rough,

449
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.030
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

450
00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.930
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;

451
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.430
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.

452
00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.630
Give me a case to put my visage in:

453
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.030
A visor for a visor!

454
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.170
What care I What curious eye doth quote deformities?

455
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.030
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

456
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.800
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,

457
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.500
But every man betake him to his legs.

458
00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.330
And we mean well in going to this mask;

459
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.900
But 'tis no wit to go.

460
00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.270
Why, may one ask?

461
00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.870
I dreamt a dream to-night.

462
00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.630
And so did I.

463
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.730
Well, what was yours?

464
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.230
That dreamers often lie.

465
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.370
Ay, in bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

466
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.100
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.

467
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.770
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes

468
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.300
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone

469
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.730
On the fore-finger of an alderman,

470
00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.200
Drawn with a team of little atomies

471
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.770
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;

472
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:53.630
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,

473
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.370
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,

474
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.100
The traces of the smallest spider's web,

475
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.230
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,

476
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:08.270
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,

477
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:12.270
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,

478
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.800
Not half so big as a round little worm

479
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.670
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;

480
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.530
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut

481
00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.570
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,

482
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.170
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.

483
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.400
And in this state she gallops night by night

484
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.900
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;

485
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:39.670
O'er courtiers' knees, who dream on court'sies straight,

486
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.130
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,

487
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.570
O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,

488
00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.730
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,

489
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:54.900
Because their breath with sweetmeats tainted are;

490
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.730
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,

491
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.000
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;

492
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.900
Sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail

493
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.770
Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep,

494
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:08.800
Then dreams, he of another benefice:

495
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.170
Sometime she gallops o'er a soldier's neck.

496
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.930
Then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,

497
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.700
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,

498
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.030
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon

499
00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:26.430
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,

500
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.570
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two

501
00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:31.770
And sleeps again.

502
00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.430
This is that very Mab

503
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:37.100
That plats the manes of horses in the night,

504
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.170
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,

505
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:43.270
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:

506
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:47.930
This is the hag that, when maids lie on their backs,

507
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.000
Presses them and learns them first to bear,

508
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Making them women of good carriage:

509
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.130
This is she--

510
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.400
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!

511
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.600
Thou talk'st of nothing.

512
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.670
True, I talk of dreams,

513
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.270
Which are the children of an idle brain,

514
00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.500
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,

515
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.530
Which is as thin of substance as the air

516
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:14.900
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes

517
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.070
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,

518
00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.430
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,

519
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.500
Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.

520
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.230
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;

521
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.130
Supper is done, and we will come too late.

522
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:32.100
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives

523
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.500
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars

524
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.970
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date

525
00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:40.630
With this night's revels and expire the term

526
00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.900
Of a despised life closed in my breast

527
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.270
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.

528
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.430
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,

529
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.170
Direct my sail!

530
00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:00.730
On, lusty gentlemen!

531
00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:02.530
Strike, drum!

532
00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:22.000
Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?

533
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.630
Antony, and Potpan!

534
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:25.730
Ay, boy, ready.

535
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.030
You are looked for and called for,

536
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.830
asked for and sought for, in the great chamber.

537
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.900
We cannot be here and there too.

538
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:34.670
Cheerly, boys; be brisk awhile; the longer liver takes all.

539
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.330
Look to the plate; look to the plate.

540
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:58.130
Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes

541
00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:01.430
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.

542
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:04.770
Ah ha, my mistresses!

543
00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:06.770
Which of you all will now deny to dance?

544
00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:08.300
She that makes dainty,

545
00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:14.170
She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?

546
00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.370
Welcome, gentlemen!

547
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.430
I have seen the day

548
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.270
That I have worn a visor and could tell

549
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:22.430
A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,

550
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:29.270
Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:

551
00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.830
You are welcome, gentlemen!

552
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.730
Come, musicians, play.

553
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.300
A hall, a hall!

554
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.530
Give room!

555
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.800
And foot it, girls.

556
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:51.270
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,

557
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.270
And quench the fire, the room's grown too hot.

558
00:29:55.270 --> 00:30:01.000
Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.

559
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.800
Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;

560
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.770
For you and I are past our dancing days:

561
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.530
How long is't now since last yourself and I

562
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.900
Were in a mask?

563
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.230
Oh, by'r lady, thirty years.

564
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.330
'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much:

565
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:27.030
'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,

566
00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.930
Come pentecost as quickly as it will,

567
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:35.300
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

568
00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:40.870
'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;

569
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.330
His son is thirty.

570
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.730
Will you tell me that?

571
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.070
His son was but a ward two years ago.

572
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.670
Thirty.

573
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.730
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand

574
00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:38.830
Of yonder knight?

575
00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.270
I know not, sir.

576
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:48.030
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

577
00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:50.470
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night

578
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.970
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;

579
00:32:53.970 --> 00:33:00.730
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!

580
00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:04.800
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,

581
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.570
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.

582
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.230
Did my heart love till now?

583
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.970
Forswear it, sight!

584
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.370
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

585
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:28.130
Fetch me my rapier, boy.

586
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.530
What dares the slave

587
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:31.370
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,

588
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.700
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

589
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:35.730
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,

590
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:38.630
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

591
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:40.230
Why, how now, kinsman!

592
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.330
Wherefore storm you so?

593
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:42.970
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,

594
00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:50.670
A villain that is hither come in spite,

595
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.400
To scorn at our solemnity this night.

596
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:53.630
Young Romeo is it?

597
00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:54.900
'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

598
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.370
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;

599
00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:57.970
He bears him like a portly gentleman;

600
00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.670
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him

601
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.330
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:

602
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:04.830
I would not for the wealth of all this town

603
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:07.500
Here in my house do him disparagement:

604
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.700
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:

605
00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.870
It is my will, the which if you respect,

606
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.900
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,

607
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.730
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

608
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.030
It fits, when such a villain is a guest:

609
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:20.130
I'll not endure him.

610
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.500
He shall be endured: What, goodman boy!

611
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.570
I say, he shall: go to;

612
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.770
Am I the master here, or you?

613
00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:27.230
Go to.

614
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:28.630
You'll not endure him!

615
00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.870
God shall mend my soul!

616
00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.330
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!

617
00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:32.430
You will set cock-a-hoop!

618
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:33.530
You'll be the man!

619
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.630
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

620
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.730
Go to, go to;

621
00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:39.170
You are a saucy boy:

622
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:41.470
is't so, indeed?

623
00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:43.800
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:

624
00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.600
You must contrary me!

625
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.700
Marry, 'tis time.

626
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.200
Well said, my hearts!

627
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.800
You are a princox; go: Be quiet, or--

628
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.400
More light, more light!

629
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.670
For shame!

630
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.900
I'll make you quiet.

631
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:57.930
What--cheerly, my hearts!

632
00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.330
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting

633
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.900
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.

634
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.530
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall

635
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:18.970
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

636
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:05.830
If I profane with my unworthiest hand

637
00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:09.970
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:

638
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:14.500
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand

639
00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.170
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

640
00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:28.630
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,

641
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:33.100
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;

642
00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.230
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,

643
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.830
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

644
00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.870
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

645
00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:05.100
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

646
00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.370
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;

647
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.030
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

648
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:16.600
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

649
00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.530
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.

650
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.970
Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.

651
00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:36.970
Then have my lips the sin that they have took?

652
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.770
Sin from my lips?

653
00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.330
O trespass sweetly urged!

654
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:43.170
Give me my sin again.

655
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.700
You kiss by the book.

656
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.000
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

657
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.070
What is her mother?

658
00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.800
Marry, bachelor, her mother is the lady of the house,

659
00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.000
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.

660
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.030
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;

661
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.600
I tell you, he that can lay hold on her

662
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.800
Shall have the chinks.

663
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.570
Is she a Capulet?

664
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:17.900
O dear account!

665
00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.070
My life is my foe's debt.

666
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.630
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

667
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.600
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

668
00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:39.430
Oh, nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;

669
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:44.630
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.

670
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.530
Is it e'en so?

671
00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:49.030
Well, I thank you all.

672
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.100
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.

673
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.170
More torches here!

674
00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:03.100
Come hither, nurse.

675
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.930
What is yond gentleman?

676
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.630
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

677
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.570
Whee!

678
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.070
What's he that now is going out of door?

679
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.670
That, I think, be young Petrucio.

680
00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.270
What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

681
00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:35.570
I know not.

682
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:38.870
Go ask his name:

683
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.500
if he be married,

684
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.130
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

685
00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:03.400
His name is Romeo, and a Montague;

686
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.330
The only son of your great enemy.

687
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.230
My only love sprung from my only hate!

688
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:15.170
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!

689
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.570
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,

690
00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:19.470
That I must love a loathed enemy.

691
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.000
What's this? What's this?

692
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.930
A rhyme I learn'd even now Of one I danced withal.

693
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:26.570
Come, let's away.

694
00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.800
