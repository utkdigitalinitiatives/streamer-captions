00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:43.100


2
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.270
Who's there?

3
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.830
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

4
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.400
Long live the king!

5
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.530
Bernardo?

6
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.500
He.

7
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.030
You come most carefully upon your hour.

8
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.200
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

9
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.930
For this relief much thanks.

10
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.530
'Tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.

11
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.930
Have you had quiet guard?

12
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.300
Not a mouse stirring.

13
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.930
Well, good night.

14
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.970
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,

15
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.130
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

16
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.470
I think I hear them.

17
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.570
Stand, ho!

18
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.930
Who's there?

19
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.030
Friends to this ground.

20
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.100
And liegemen to the Dane.

21
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.400
Give you good night.

22
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.670
Farewell, honest soldier.

23
00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.770
Who hath relieved you?

24
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.400
Bernardo hath my place.

25
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.570
Give you good night.

26
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.730
Who are! Bernardo!

27
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.470
Say.

28
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.100
What, is Horatio there?

29
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.330
A piece of him.

30
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.770
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

31
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.130
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

32
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.630
I have seen nothing.

33
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.370
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,

34
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.730
And will not let belief take hold of him

35
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.030
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.

36
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.400
Therefore I have entreated him along with us

37
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.470
to watch the minutes of this night;

38
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.900
That if again this apparition come,

39
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

40
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.930
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

41
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.730
Sit down awhile;

42
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.370
And let us once again assail your ears

43
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.870
That are so fortified against our story

44
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.170
What we have two nights seen.

45
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.530
Well, sit we down,

46
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.600
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

47
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.770
Last night of all,

48
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.370
When yond same star that's westward from the pole

49
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.570
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven

50
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.270
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,

51
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.870
The bell then beating one--

52
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.400
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

53
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.070
In the same figure like the king that's dead.

54
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.970
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

55
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.500
Looks it not like the king?

56
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.700
Mark it, Horatio.

57
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.130
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

58
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.000
It would be spoke to.

59
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.730
Question it, Horatio.

60
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.170
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,

61
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.330
Together with that fair and warlike form

62
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.100
In which the majesty of buried Denmark did sometimes march?

63
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.630
By heaven I charge thee, speak!

64
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.230
It is offended.

65
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.600
See, it stalks away!

66
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.700
Stay!

67
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.600
Speak, speak!

68
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.130
I charge thee, speak!

69
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.400
'Tis gone and will not answer.

70
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.900
How now, Horatio!

71
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.770
You tremble and look pale.

72
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.630
Is not this something more than fantasy?

73
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.830
What think you on't?

74
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.770
Before my God, I might not this believe

75
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.300
Without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes.

76
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.500
Is it not like the king?

77
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.830
As thou art to thyself:

78
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.500
Such was the very armour he had on

79
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.700
When he the ambitious Norway combated;

80
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.130
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,

81
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.200
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.

82
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.470
'Tis strange.

83
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.330
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,

84
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.230
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

85
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.870
In what particular thought to work...

86
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.770
I know not;

87
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.630
But in the gross and scope of mine opinion,

88
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.630
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

89
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.270
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,

90
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.000
Why this same strict and most observant watch

91
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.130
So nightly toils the subject of the land,

92
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.800
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,

93
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.230
And foreign mart for implements of war;

94
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.370
Who is it that can inform me?

95
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.800
That can I; At least, the whisper goes so.

96
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.700
Our last king,

97
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.270
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,

98
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.570
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,

99
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.800
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,

100
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.100
Dared to the combat; in the which our valiant Hamlet--

101
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.300
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--

102
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.700
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,

103
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.670
Well ratified by law and heraldry,

104
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.030
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands

105
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.300
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror.

106
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.600
Now, sir, young Fortinbras,

107
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.330
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,

108
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.800
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there

109
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.100
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,

110
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.300
For food and diet,

111
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.270
to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't;

112
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.830
which is none other--

113
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.600
As it doth well appear unto our state--

114
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.030
But to recover of us

115
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.930
by strong hand And terms compulsatory

116
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.130
those foresaid lands So by his father lost.

117
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.330
And this, I take it, Is the main motive

118
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.800
of our preparation.

119
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.030
I think it be no other but e'en so:

120
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.100
Well may it sort that this portentous figure

121
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.470
Comes armed through our watch;

122
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.430
so like the king That was and is

123
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.130
the question of these wars.

124
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.870
But soft, behold! where it comes again!

125
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.830
I'll cross it, though it blast me.

126
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.770
Stay, illusion!

127
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.370
If thou hast any sound or use of voice,

128
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.730
Speak to me:

129
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:36.000
If there be any good thing to be done

130
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.670
That may to thee do ease or grace to me, Speak to me.

131
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.770
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,

132
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.100
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!

133
00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.430
Stop it, Marcellus.

134
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.100
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

135
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.230
I do, if it will not stand.

136
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.330
'Tis here!

137
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.400
'Tis here!

138
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.970
'Tis gone!

139
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.770
We do it wrong, being so majestical,

140
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.270
To offer it the show of violence;

141
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.830
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,

142
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.030
And our vain blows malicious mockery.

143
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.900
It was about to speak when the cock crew.

144
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.630
And then it started like a guilty thing

145
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.870
Upon a fearful summons.

146
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.870
I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,

147
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.100
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat

148
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.330
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,

149
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.970
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,

150
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:36.930
The extravagant and erring spirit

151
00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:40.470
hies To his confine: and of the truth herein

152
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.200
This present object made probation.

153
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.400
It faded on the crowing of the cock.

154
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.470
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes

155
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.800
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,

156
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.170
This bird of dawning singeth all night long:

157
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.970
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;

158
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.500
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,

159
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.370
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,

160
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.100
So hallow'd and so gracious is that time.

161
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.630
So have I heard and do in part believe it.

162
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.900
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,

163
00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.200
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:

164
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.930
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,

165
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:19.900
Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet;

166
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.970
for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.

167
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.630
Let's do it, I pray; and I this morning know

168
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.870
Where we shall find him most convenient.

169
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.300
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death

170
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.330
The memory be green and that it us befitted

171
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.630
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom

172
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.770
To be contracted in one brow of woe.

173
00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.170
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature

174
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.800
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,

175
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.330
Together with remembrance of ourselves.

176
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:13.930
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,

177
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.500
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,

178
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.130
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy--

179
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.470
With one auspicious and one dropping eye,

180
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.470
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,

181
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.730
In equal scale weighing delight and dole--

182
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.800
Taken to wife:

183
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.070
nor have we herein barr'd Your better wisdoms,

184
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.330
which have freely gone With this affair along.

185
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:39.770
For all, our thanks.

186
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.200
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,

187
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.470
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,

188
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:54.470
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death

189
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.630
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,

190
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.570
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,

191
00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:00.430
Importing the surrender of those lands

192
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.170
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,

193
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.900
To our most valiant brother.

194
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.130
So much for him.

195
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.230
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:

196
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.770
Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway,

197
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.200
uncle of young Fortinbras-- Who, impotent and bed-rid,

198
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.470
scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose--

199
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:20.130
to suppress His further gait herein;

200
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.430
in that the levies, The lists and full proportions

201
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.830
are all made Out of his subject:

202
00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:25.200
and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius,

203
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.400
and you, Voltemand,

204
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.000
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;

205
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.800
Giving to you no further personal power

206
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.100
To business with the king

207
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.000
more than the scope Of these delated articles allow.

208
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.070
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

209
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.470
In that and all things will we show our duty.

210
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.700
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

211
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.430
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?

212
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.600
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?

213
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.930
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane

214
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:05.870
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,

215
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.700
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?

216
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.500
The head is not more native to the heart,

217
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.170
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,

218
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.000
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.

219
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.670
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

220
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.170
My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France;

221
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.930
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark

222
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.700
To show my duty in your coronation,

223
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.870
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,

224
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.200
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France

225
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.030
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

226
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.370
Have you your father's leave?

227
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.630
What says Polonius?

228
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.900
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave

229
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.600
By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will

230
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.830
I seal'd my hard consent:

231
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.670
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

232
00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.200
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,

233
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.670
And thy best graces spend it at thy will.

234
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.800
But now, my cousin Hamlet and my son--

235
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.700
A little more than kin and less than kind.

236
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.270
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

237
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.770
Not so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.

238
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.070
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,

239
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.170
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.

240
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.630
Do not forever with thy vailed lids

241
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:36.300
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:

242
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.370
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that live must die,

243
00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.870
Passing through nature to eternity.

244
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.630
Ay, madam, it is common.

245
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.500
If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?

246
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.070
Seems, madam!

247
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.330
Nay, it is; I know not "seems."

248
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.100
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,

249
00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.970
Nor customary suits of solemn black,

250
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.600
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,

251
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.130
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,

252
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.100
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,

253
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.500
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief

254
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.900
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem

255
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.430
For they are actions that a man might play:

256
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.670
But I have that within which passes show;

257
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.830
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

258
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.130
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,

259
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.370
To give these mourning duties to your father:

260
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.070
But, you must know, your father lost a father;

261
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.000
That father lost, lost his,

262
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and the survivor bound In filial obligation

263
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.830
for some term To do obsequious sorrow:

264
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.700
but to persever In obstinate condolement

265
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.900
is a course Of impious stubbornness;

266
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.400
'tis unmanly grief;

267
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.230
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,

268
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.030
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,

269
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.930
An understanding simple and unschool'd:

270
00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.230
For what we know must be

271
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:01.630
and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense,

272
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.400
Why should we in our peevish opposition

273
00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.500
Take it to heart?

274
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.000
Fie!

275
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.530
'Tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead,

276
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:13.700
a fault to nature, To reason most absurd

277
00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.200
whose common theme Is death of fathers.

278
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.970
We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe,

279
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:22.200
and think of us As of a father:

280
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.200
for let the world take note,

281
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.770
You are the most immediate to our throne;

282
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:33.700
And with no less nobility of love

283
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.730
Than that which dearest father bears his son

284
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.770
Do I impart toward you.

285
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.830
For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg,

286
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.870
It is most retrograde to our desires:

287
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:48.000
And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here,

288
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.470
in the cheer and comfort of our eye,

289
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.930
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

290
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.870
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:

291
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.970
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

292
00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:02.430
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

293
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.570
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:

294
00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:09.630
Be as ourself in Denmark.

295
00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.930
Madam, come; This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet

296
00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.470
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,

297
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.170
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,

298
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.570
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,

299
00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.100
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,

300
00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.500
Re-speaking earthly thunder.

301
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500
Come away.

302
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.870
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt

303
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:56.000
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!

304
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.230
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd His cannon

305
00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.330
'gainst self-slaughter!

306
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:03.430
O God!

307
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.800
God!

308
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.270
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable

309
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:11.170
Seem to me all the uses of this world!

310
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.100
Fie on't! O, fie!

311
00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.100
'Tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed.

312
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:23.470
Things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely.

313
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.970
That it should come to this!

314
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.830
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:

315
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.970
So excellent a king;

316
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.970
that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr;

317
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.970
so loving to my mother

318
00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.530
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven

319
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:44.430
Visit her face too roughly.

320
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.230
Heaven and earth! Must I remember?

321
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.770
Why, she would hang on him,

322
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:53.630
As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on:

323
00:17:53.630 --> 00:18:01.400
and yet, within a month-- Let me not think on't.

324
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:05.200
Frailty, thy name is woman!

325
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.130
A little month, or ere those shoes were old

326
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.670
With which she follow'd my poor father's body

327
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.700
Like Niobe, all tears.

328
00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.130
Why she, even she-- O, God!

329
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.970
A beast, that wants discourse of reason

330
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:20.570
Would have mourn'd longer--

331
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:27.570
married with my uncle, My father's brother,

332
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.400
but no more like my father Than I to Hercules.

333
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.770
Within a month.

334
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.130
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears

335
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:43.100
Hath left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married.

336
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:47.170
O, most wicked speed,

337
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:51.800
to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!

338
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:58.870
It is not nor it cannot come to good:

339
00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:07.800
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

340
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.670
Hail to your lordship!

341
00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.300
I'm glad to see thee well.

342
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.430
Horatio.

343
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.170
I do forget myself.

344
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:21.170
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

345
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.900
Sir, my good friend;

346
00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.700
I'll change that name with you:

347
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.170
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?

348
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.270
Marcellus?

349
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:30.370
My good lord.

350
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.570
I am very glad to see you.

351
00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.230
Good even, sir.

352
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.630
What, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

353
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.830
A truant disposition, good my lord.

354
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.430
I would not hear your enemy say so.

355
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.870
I know you are no truant.

356
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:44.670
But what is your affair in Elsinore?

357
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.170
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

358
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.830
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

359
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.230
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;

360
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.630
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

361
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.530
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

362
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.400
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!

363
00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.670
The funeral baked meats

364
00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.400
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

365
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.030
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven

366
00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.400
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

367
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.200
My father!

368
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.370
Methinks I see my father.

369
00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:16.470
Where, my lord?

370
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.300
In my mind's eye, Horatio.

371
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:27.200
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

372
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.730
He was a man, take him for all in all,

373
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.570
I shall not look upon his like again.

374
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:39.900
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

375
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.400
Saw who?

376
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.870
My lord, the king your father.

377
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.230
The king my father!

378
00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:47.730
Season your admiration for awhile With an attent ear

379
00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.000
till I may deliver,

380
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.700
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,

381
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.270
This marvel to you.

382
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.830
For God's love, let me hear.

383
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.770
Two nights together had these gentlemen,

384
00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:57.630
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch

385
00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.470
In the dead waste and middle of the night

386
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.400
Been thus encounter'd.

387
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.170
A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly,

388
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.270
cap-a-pe, Appears before them,

389
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.130
and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them.

390
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.670
Thrice he walk'd

391
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:13.730
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes

392
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.070
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they,

393
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.170
distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear,

394
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.800
Stand dumb and speak not to him.

395
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.170
This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did;

396
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.230
And I with them the third night kept the watch;

397
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.130
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time, Form of the thing,

398
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:34.470
each word made true and good, The apparition comes:

399
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.330
I knew your father; These hands are not more like.

400
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.800
But where was this?

401
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.530
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

402
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:41.830
Did you not speak to it?

403
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.600
My lord, I did; But answer made it none.

404
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.270
Yet once methought It lifted up its head

405
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.870
and did address Itself to motion,

406
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.730
like it would speak;

407
00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.870
But even then the morning cock crew loud,

408
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:56.570
And at its sound it shrunk in haste away,

409
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.870
And vanish'd from our sight.

410
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.230
'Tis very strange.

411
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.030
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;

412
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.830
And we did think it writ down in our duty

413
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.070
To let you know of it.

414
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.770
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

415
00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:10.330
Hold you the watch to-night?

416
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.500
We do, my lord.

417
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.600
Arm'd, you say?

418
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.700
Arm'd, my lord.

419
00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:14.900
From top to toe?

420
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:16.130
My lord, from head to foot.

421
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:17.230
Then saw you not his face?

422
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:18.770
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

423
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.970
What look'd he? Frowningly?

424
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.400
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

425
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.500
Pale or red?

426
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.600
Nay, very pale.

427
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.770
And fix'd his eyes upon you?

428
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:25.870
Most constantly.

429
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.170
I would had I been there.

430
00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.470
It would have much amazed you.

431
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:30.030
Very like, very like.

432
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.400
Stay'd it long?

433
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.100
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

434
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.200
Longer.

435
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.300
Not when I saw't.

436
00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.370
His beard was grizzled--no?

437
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:44.600
It was as I have seen it in his life, A sable silver'd.

438
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.100
I will watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again.

439
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:49.200
I warrant it will.

440
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.400
If it assume my noble father's person,

441
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.830
I'll speak to it,

442
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.500
though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.

443
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.000
I pray you all,

444
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.900
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,

445
00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.170
Let it be tenable in your silence still;

446
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.430
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,

447
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:04.230
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:

448
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.530
I will requite your loves.

449
00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.230
So, fare you well:

450
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.270
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,

451
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.730
I'll visit you.

452
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:11.870
Our duty to your honour.

453
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:16.600
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

454
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.070
My father's spirit in arms!

455
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:31.030
All is not well; I doubt some foul play:

456
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.100
O, would the night were come!

457
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.770
Till then sit still, my soul:

458
00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.230
foul deeds will rise,

459
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.770
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

460
00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.930
My necessaries are embark'd.

461
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.630
Farewell.

462
00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.970
And, sister, as the winds give benefit

463
00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:57.300
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,

464
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.800
But let me hear from you.

465
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:02.700
Do you doubt that?

466
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.200
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,

467
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.930
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,

468
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:11.570
A violet in the youth of primy nature,

469
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.870
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,

470
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.900
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.

471
00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.200
No more but so?

472
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:25.570
Think it no more.

473
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.600
Perhaps he loves you now, but you must fear,

474
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.230
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;

475
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.570
For he himself is subject to his birth:

476
00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.800
He may not, as unvalued persons do,

477
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.600
Carve for himself;

478
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.030
for on his choice depends The sanity and health

479
00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.830
of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be

480
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.070
circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body

481
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.030
Whereof he is the head.

482
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.500
Then if he says he loves you,

483
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.530
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it

484
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.400
As he in his particular act and place

485
00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.770
May give his saying deed; which is no further

486
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.230
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.

487
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.000
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,

488
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.530
If with too credent ear you list his songs,

489
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:15.700
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure

490
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.700
open To his unmaster'd importunity.

491
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:24.630
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,

492
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.030
And keep you in the rear of your affection,

493
00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:30.130
Out of the shot and danger of desire.

494
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:33.430
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,

495
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.200
As watchman to my heart.

496
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.730
But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,

497
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.170
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;

498
00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.270
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,

499
00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:49.300
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,

500
00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:51.230
And recks not his own rede.

501
00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.030
O, fear me not.

502
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.830
Yet here, Laertes!

503
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.770
Aboard, aboard, for shame!

504
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.730
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,

505
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:05.300
And you are stay'd for.

506
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:11.070
There; my blessing with thee!

507
00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.400
And these few precepts in thy memory look thou character.

508
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.500
Give thy thoughts no tongue,

509
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.130
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.

510
00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:22.930
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

511
00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:26.200
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,

512
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.100
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;

513
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.330
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment

514
00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.130
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged courage.

515
00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:40.230
Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,

516
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.230
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.

517
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:46.570
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;

518
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.230
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.

519
00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.300
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,

520
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.700
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;

521
00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.400
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,

522
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.970
And they in France of the best rank and station

523
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:07.230
Are of a most select and generous choice in that.

524
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:12.470
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;

525
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:15.170
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,

526
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:19.470
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.

527
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.470
This above all: to thine ownself be true,

528
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.270
And it must follow, as the night the day,

529
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.170
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

530
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:34.200
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

531
00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:41.130
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

532
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.670
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.

533
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.700
Farewell, Ophelia;

534
00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:49.370
and remember well What I have said to you.

535
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.070
'Tis in my memory lock'd,

536
00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.270
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

537
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:56.770
Farewell.

538
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.970
What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

539
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.270
So please you,

540
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:19.070
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

541
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.570
Marry, well bethought:

542
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.200
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late

543
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.930
Given private time to you;

544
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.730
and you yourself Have of your audience

545
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.930
been most free and bounteous.

546
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.870
What is between you? Hmm?

547
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:33.670
Give me up the truth.

548
00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:34.970
He hath, my lord,

549
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:38.700
of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.

550
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.370
Affection!

551
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:41.630
Pooh!

552
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.230
You speak like a green girl,

553
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.330
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.

554
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.970
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

555
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.470
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

556
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.400
Marry, I shall teach you: think yourself a baby;

557
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.530
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,

558
00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:57.570
Which are not sterling.

559
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:58.930
Tender yourself more dearly;

560
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:01.000
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,

561
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.870
Running it thus-- you'll tender me a fool.

562
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.570
My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion.

563
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.200
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

564
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.430
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,

565
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.570
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

566
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:19.170
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.

567
00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.070
I do know, When the blood burns,

568
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:25.530
how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows:

569
00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.200
these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat,

570
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.000
extinct in both, Even in their promise,

571
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.270
as they are a-making, You must not take for fire.

572
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:40.770
In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows;

573
00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.130
Now, this is for all: I would not, in plain terms,

574
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.300
from this time forth,

575
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.200
Have you so slander any moment's leisure,

576
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:50.230
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

577
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.230
Look to't, I charge you.

578
00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.600
Come your ways.

579
00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.800
I shall obey, my lord.

580
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.230
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

581
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.800
It is a nipping and an eager air.

582
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.900
What hour now?

583
00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.170
I think it lacks of twelve.

584
00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:20.270
No, it is struck.

585
00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:22.130
Indeed? I heard it not:

586
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.130
Then draws near the season

587
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.200
Wherein the spirit held its wont to walk.

588
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.500
What does this mean, my lord?

589
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.700
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,

590
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.930
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;

591
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:42.870
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,

592
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:44.830
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out

593
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.170
The triumph of his pledge.

594
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:48.370
Is it a custom?

595
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:51.870
Ay, marry, is't: But to my mind,

596
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.200
though I am native here And to the manner born,

597
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.600
it is a custom More honour'd

598
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.030
in the breach than the observance.

599
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.800
This heavy-headed revel east and west

600
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.830
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:

601
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.500
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase

602
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.370
Soil our addition;

603
00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:10.430
and indeed it takes From our achievements,

604
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.730
though perform'd at height,

605
00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.330
The pith and marrow of our attribute.

606
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.170
So, oft it chances in particular men,

607
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.170
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,

608
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.370
As in their birth-- wherein they are not guilty,

609
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.570
Since nature cannot choose his origin--

610
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.700
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,

611
00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.030
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,

612
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:39.030
Or by some habit

613
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.670
that too much o'er-leavens the form of plausive manners.

614
00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.770
That these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,

615
00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:55.600
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star--

616
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.100
his virtues else-- be they as pure as grace,

617
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:02.030
As infinite as man may undergo-- Shall in the general censure

618
00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:05.400
take corruption From that particular fault.

619
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.700
Look, my lord, it comes!

620
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.030
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!

621
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.370
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,

622
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.070
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,

623
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:24.500
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,

624
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.500
Thou comest in such a questionable shape

625
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.430
That I will speak with thee:

626
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:38.570
I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane:

627
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:39.770
O, answer me!

628
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.530
Let me not burst in ignorance

629
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.030
but tell Why thy canonized bones,

630
00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.130
hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements;

631
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.970
why the sepulchre

632
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.930
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd

633
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.870
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws

634
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.330
To cast thee up again.

635
00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:59.070
What may this mean, That thou, dead corse,

636
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.600
again in complete steel Revisit'st thus

637
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.600
the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous;

638
00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.930
and we fools of nature

639
00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:08.700
So horridly to shake our dispositions

640
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.630
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

641
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.700
Say, why is this?

642
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.370
Wherefore?

643
00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.200
What should we do?

644
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.970
It beckons you to go away with it,

645
00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.200
As if it some impartment did desire with you alone.

646
00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.170
Look, with what courteous action It waved you

647
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:26.830
to a more removed ground: But do not go with it.

648
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.970
By no means, my lord.

649
00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.370
It will not speak; then I will follow it.

650
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.470
Do not, my lord.

651
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.770
Why, what should be the fear?

652
00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.670
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;

653
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.400
And for my soul, what can it do to that,

654
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.930
Being a thing immortal as itself?

655
00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.030
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.

656
00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.800
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,

657
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.300
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff

658
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.870
That beetles o'er his base into the sea

659
00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.100
And there assume some other horrible form

660
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.400
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason

661
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.900
And draw you into madness?

662
00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.070
Think of it.

663
00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.100
It waves me still.

664
00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.330
Go on; I'll follow thee.

665
00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:55.430
You shall not go, my lord.

666
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.530
Hold off your hands.

667
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:57.870
Be ruled; you shall not.

668
00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.570
My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body

669
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.570
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve!

670
00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.730
Still am I call'd.

671
00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:08.270
Unhand me, gentlemen.

672
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.570
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!

673
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:14.100
I say, away!

674
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:17.430
Go on; I'll follow thee.

675
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.430
He waxes desperate with imagination.

676
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.200
Let's follow him; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

677
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.500
I have after.

678
00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.000
To what issue will this come?

679
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.800
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

680
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.300
Heaven will direct it.

681
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.430
Nay, let's follow him.

682
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.570
Where wilt thou lead me?

683
00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.400
Speak;

684
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:17.100
I'll go no further.

685
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.930
Mark me.

686
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.100
I will.

687
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.270
My hour is almost come,

688
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.230
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames

689
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.330
Must render up myself.

690
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.530
Alas, poor ghost!

691
00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:33.830
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing

692
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.070
To what I shall unfold.

693
00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:37.000
Speak; I am bound to hear.

694
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.730
So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear.

695
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:41.770
What?

696
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:48.670
I am thy father's spirit,

697
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:51.070
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,

698
00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:53.370
And for the day confined to fast in fires,

699
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:55.330
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature

700
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.930
Are burnt and purged away.

701
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.830
But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house,

702
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.070
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word

703
00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.670
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,

704
00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:10.570
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,

705
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:12.570
Thy knotted and combined locks to part

706
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.200
And each particular hair to stand on end,

707
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.600
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.

708
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:21.530
But this eternal blazon must not be

709
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.270
To ears of flesh and blood.

710
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:26.700
List, list, O, list!

711
00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.670
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--

712
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.800
O God!

713
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.330
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

714
00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.530
Murder!

715
00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.330
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;

716
00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.970
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

717
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.370
Haste me to know't, that I,

718
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.370
with wings as swift As meditation

719
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.530
or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.

720
00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.330
I find thee apt;

721
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.300
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed

722
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.130
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,

723
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.200
Wouldst thou not stir in this.

724
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.330
Now, Hamlet, hear:

725
00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.570
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,

726
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.530
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark

727
00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:12.670
Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused.

728
00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.030
But know, thou noble youth,

729
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:18.170
The serpent that did sting thy father's life

730
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.070
Now wears his crown.

731
00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:24.200
O my prophetic soul!

732
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.530
My uncle!

733
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:29.130
Nay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,

734
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.630
With witchcraft of his wits, with traitorous gifts--

735
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:33.830
O wicked wit and gifts,

736
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.900
that have the power So to seduce!

737
00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.100
Won to his shameful lust

738
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:39.930
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:

739
00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:49.570
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!

740
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.230
From me, whose love was of that dignity

741
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:57.400
That it went hand in hand

742
00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.430
even with the vow I made to her in marriage,

743
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:03.970
and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor

744
00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:05.670
To those of mine!

745
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.400
But virtue, as it never will be moved,

746
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.430
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,

747
00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.070
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,

748
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.070
Will sate itself in a celestial bed

749
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:18.370
And prey on garbage.

750
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.570
But, soft!

751
00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.100
Methinks I scent the morning air;

752
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.400
Brief let me be.

753
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.470
Sleeping within my orchard,

754
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.300
My custom always of the afternoon,

755
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.600
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole

756
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.330
With juice of cursed hebona in a vial,

757
00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.000
And in the porches of my ears

758
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.800
did pour The leperous distilment;

759
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.600
whose effect Holds such an enmity

760
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.530
with blood of man That swift as quicksilver

761
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:47.130
it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body,

762
00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.330
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd,

763
00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.670
like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood:

764
00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:56.900
so did it mine;

765
00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:01.670
And a most instant tetter bark'd about, Most lazar-like,

766
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:06.270
with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body.

767
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:14.270
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life,

768
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.970
of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd.

769
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:18.670
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,

770
00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.470
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd, No reckoning made,

771
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:23.600
but sent to my account

772
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.770
With all my imperfections on my head.

773
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.470
O, horrible!

774
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.970
Most horrible!

775
00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:42.630
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;

776
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.030
Let not the royal bed of Denmark

777
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:46.630
be a couch for luxury and damned incest.

778
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:53.000
But, howsomever thou pursuest this act, Taint not thy mind,

779
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.300
nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught:

780
00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:02.470
leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,

781
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:04.470
To prick and sting her.

782
00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:08.500
Fare thee well at once!

783
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.370
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,

784
00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:17.300
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:

785
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.900
Adieu.

786
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:22.630
Adieu, adieu.

787
00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.570
Remember me.

788
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.470
O you host of heaven!

789
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.130
O earth!

790
00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.230
What else?

791
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.770
And shall I couple hell?

792
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:56.500
Fie! Fie!

793
00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:01.900
Hold, hold, my heart;

794
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.170
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,

795
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.900
But bear me stiffly up.

796
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.030
Remember thee!

797
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:09.400
Ay, thou poor ghost,

798
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.500
whilst memory holds a seat In this distracted globe.

799
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.000
Remember thee!

800
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.830
Yea, from the table of my memory

801
00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.970
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books,

802
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:22.870
all forms, all pressures past,

803
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:25.270
That youth and observation copied there;

804
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:28.170
And thy commandment all alone shall live

805
00:41:28.170 --> 00:41:30.770
Within the book and volume of my brain,

806
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:33.630
Unmix'd with baser matter.

807
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:39.500
Yes, yes, by heaven!

808
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.400
O most pernicious woman!

809
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:46.470
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!

810
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:48.130
My tables, my tables.

811
00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:49.600
Meet it as I set it down,

812
00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.630
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;

813
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.330
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:

814
00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:59.500
So, uncle, there you are.

815
00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.300
Now to my word; It is Adieu, adieu!

816
00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.930
Remember me.

817
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.770
I have sworn it.

818
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:10.770
My lord.

819
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:11.970
My lord?

820
00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.300
Lord Hamlet?

821
00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.400
Heaven secure him!

822
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.700
So be it!

823
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.830
Hello, ho, ho, my lord!

824
00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:19.770
Hello, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

825
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.930
Come, bird, come.

826
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.470
How is't, my noble lord?

827
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.570
What news, my lord?

828
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.670
O, wonderful!

829
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:25.770
Good my lord, tell it.

830
00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:26.870
No.

831
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:27.970
You will reveal it.

832
00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:29.070
My lord, by heaven.

833
00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.200
Nor I, my lord.

834
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.000
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?

835
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.100
But you'll be secret?

836
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.270
Ay, by heaven, my lord.

837
00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.730
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark

838
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:39.700
But he's an arrant knave.

839
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.130
There needs no ghost, my lord,

840
00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.770
come from the grave To tell us this.

841
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.730
Why, right; you are in the right;

842
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.570
And so, without more circumstance at all,

843
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.400
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:

844
00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.600
You, as your business and desire shall point you;

845
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:55.670
For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is;

846
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.330
and for mine own poor part, Look you, I'll go pray.

847
00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:00.970
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

848
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:04.300
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, faith heartily.

849
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.670
There's no offence, my lord.

850
00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:08.500
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,

851
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.130
And much offence too.

852
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.300
Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost,

853
00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.470
that let me tell you:

854
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.370
For your desire to know what is between us,

855
00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.130
O'ermaster it as you may.

856
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:19.570
And now, good friends,

857
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.970
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,

858
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:23.570
Give me one poor request.

859
00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.370
What is't, my lord? We will.

860
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.400
Never make known what you have seen to-night.

861
00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.570
My lord, we will not.

862
00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:30.100
Nay, but swear't.

863
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.370
In faith, My lord, not I.

864
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.630
Nor I, my lord, in faith.

865
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:33.730
Upon my sword.

866
00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:35.730
We have sworn, my lord, already.

867
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:39.370
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

868
00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:40.930
Swear.

869
00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.930
Ah, ha, boy!

870
00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.400
Say'st thou so?

871
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.770
Art thou there, truepenny?

872
00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.630
Come on.

873
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.400
You hear this fellow in the cellarage.

874
00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.970
Consent to swear.

875
00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:53.800
Propose the oath, my lord.

876
00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.670
Never to speak of this that you have seen,

877
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.800
Swear by my sword.

878
00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.600
Swear.

879
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.200
Hic et ubique?

880
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.630
Then we'll shift our ground.

881
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:05.700
Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword.

882
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.370
Swear by my sword never to speak of this

883
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.870
that you have heard.

884
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:13.200
Swear by his sword.

885
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.230
Well said, old mole!

886
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:17.170
Canst work in the earth so fast?

887
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:18.500
A worthy pioner!

888
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.530
Once more remove, good friends.

889
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.800
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

890
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.970
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.

891
00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.330
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,

892
00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:36.130
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

893
00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:39.330
But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,

894
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.600
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,

895
00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.130
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
