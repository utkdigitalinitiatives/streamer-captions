00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.870


2
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.070
Fiddler, forbear.

3
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.430
You grow too forward, sir.

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400
Have you so soon forgot the entertainment

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.430
her sister Katharine welcomed you withal?

6
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.800
Ooh, but, wrangling pedant,

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.830
this is the patroness of heavenly harmony.

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.700
Then give me leave to have prerogative,

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.570
and when in music, we have spent an hour,

10
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.630
your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

11
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.770
Preposterous ass that never read so far

12
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.770
to know the cause why music was ordain'd.

13
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.570
Was it not to refresh the mind of man

14
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.900
after his studies or his usual pain?

15
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.730
Then give me leave to read philosophy,

16
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.970
and while I pause, serve in your harmony.

17
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.170
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

18
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.900
Oh, you--

19
00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.500
Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong

20
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.800
to strive for that which resteth in my choice.

21
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.630
I am no breeching scholar in the schools.

22
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.600
I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times

23
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.270
but learn my lessons as I please myself.

24
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.130
And to cut off all strife, here sit we down.

25
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.130
Ah.

26
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.400
Take you your instrument, and play you the whiles.

27
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.470
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

28
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.430
You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

29
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.530
That will be never.

30
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.700
Tune your instrument.

31
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.570
Where left we last?

32
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.400
Here, madam:

33
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.200
"Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;

34
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.900
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis."

35
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.970
Construe them.

36
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.770
"Hic ibat"--

37
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
As I told you before--

38
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.470
"Simois"--

39
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.100
I am Lucentio--

40
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.330
"Hic est"--

41
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.830
son unto Vincentio of Pisa--

42
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.000
"sigeia tellus"--

43
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
disguised thus to get your love--

44
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.100
"Hic steterat"--

45
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.930
and that Lucentio that comes a-wooing--

46
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.400
"Priami"--

47
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.200
is my man Tranio--

48
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.700
"regia"--

49
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.800
bearing my port--

50
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.330
"celsa senis."

51
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.400
that we might beguile the old pantaloon.

52
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400
Madam, my instrument's in tune.

53
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.670
O, let's hear.

54
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.000
O fie, the treble jars.

55
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.800
Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

56
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.100
Tsk.

57
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.470
Now let me see if I can construe it.

58
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.330
"Hic ibat Simois"--

59
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.370
I know you not.

60
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.130
"Hic est Sigeia tellus"--

61
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.170
I trust you not.

62
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.130
"Hic steterat Priami"--

63
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.670
Take heed he hear us not.

64
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.930
"regia"--

65
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.230
Hmm.

66
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.570
Presume not.

67
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.970
"celsa senis."

68
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.330
Despair not.

69
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.530
Madam, 'tis now in tune.

70
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.730
All but the base.

71
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.070
The base is right.

72
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.330
'Tis the base knave that jars.

73
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.700
How fiery and forward our pedant is.

74
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.430
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love.

75
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.100
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

76
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.230
In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

77
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.630
Mistrust it not,

78
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.900
for, sure, Aeacides was Ajax,

79
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.630
call'd so from his grandfather.

80
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.470
I must believe my master, else, I promise you,

81
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.400
I should be arguing still upon that doubt.

82
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.270
But let it rest.

83
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.330
Now, Licio, to you.

84
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.830
Good master, take it not unkindly, pray,

85
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.300
that I have been thus pleasant with you both.

86
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.430
You may go walk and give me leave a while, hmm?

87
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.770
My lessons make no music in three parts.

88
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.030
Are you so formal, sir?

89
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.570
Well, I must wait and watch withal,

90
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.100
for but I be deceived,

91
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.830
our fine musician groweth amorous.

92
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.230
Madam, before you touch the instrument,

93
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.570
to learn the order of my fingering,

94
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.900
I must begin with rudiments of art,

95
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.530
to teach you gamut in a briefer sort,

96
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.870
more pleasant, pithy, and effectual,

97
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.470
than hath been taught by any of my trade;

98
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.170
and there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

99
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.300
Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

100
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.200
But read the gamut of Hortensio.

101
00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.100
Read it.

102
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.770
"'Gamut'-- I am the ground of all accord--

103
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.730
"'A re'-- to plead Hortensio's passion.

104
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.300
"'B mi'-- Bianca, take him for thy lord--

105
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.630
"'C fa ut'-- that loves with all affection.

106
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.370
"'D sol re'-- One clef, two notes have I.

107
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.870
'E la mi'-- Show pity, or I die."

108
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.000
Call you this gamut?

109
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.970
I like it not:

110
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.500
Old fashions please me best.

111
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.330
I am not so nice as to change true rules

112
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.670
for old inventions.

113
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.170
Mistress,

114
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.130
your father prays you, leave your books

115
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.170
and help to dress your sister's chamber up.

116
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.470
You know tomorrow is the wedding-day.

117
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.230
Farewell, sweet masters both.

118
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.570
I must be gone.

119
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.570
Oh.

120
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.100
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

121
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.870
But I have cause to pry into this pedant.

122
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.130
Methinks he looks as though he were in love.

123
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.000
Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble

124
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.400
to cast thy wandering eyes on any stale,

125
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.330
seize thee that list.

126
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.430
If once I find thee ranging,

127
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.730
Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

128
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.730
Signior Lucentio, this is the 'pointed day

129
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.030
that Katharina and Petruchio should be married,

130
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.830
and yet we hear not of our son-in-law.

131
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.970
What will be said?

132
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.130
What mockery will it be

133
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.330
to want the bridegroom when the priest attends

134
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.770
to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage?

135
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.530
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?

136
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.630
No shame but mine.

137
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.070
I must, forsooth, be forced

138
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.930
to give my hand opposed against my heart

139
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.070
unto a mad-brained rudesby full of spleen

140
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.400
who woos in haste and means to wed at leisure.

141
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.030
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,

142
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.970
hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior,

143
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.530
and to be noted for a merry man,

144
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.830
he'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,

145
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.330
make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns,

146
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.130
yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.

147
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.230
Now must the world point at poor Katharine

148
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.570
and say, "Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,

149
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.230
if it would please him come and marry her."

150
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.470
Patience, good Katharine, and Baptista too.

151
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:21.470
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well

152
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.430
whatever fortune stays him from his word.

153
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.470
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise.

154
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.530
Though he be merry, yet withal, he's honest.

155
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.570
Would Katharine had never seen him though.

156
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:31.170
Go, girl.

157
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.700
I cannot blame thee now to weep,

158
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.670
for such an injury would vex a very saint,

159
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.970
much more a shrew of thy impatient humor.

160
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.900
Master, master, news,

161
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.730
and such old news as you never heard of.

162
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:41.830
Is it new and old too?

163
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.030
How may that be?

164
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.330
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio's coming?

165
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.430
Is he come?

166
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.530
Why, no, sir.

167
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.630
What then?

168
00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:49.800
He's coming.

169
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.030
When will he be here?

170
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.070
When he stands where I am and sees you there.

171
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.370
But say, what to thine old news?

172
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.100
Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat

173
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.670
and an old jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned,

174
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.800
a pair of boots that have been candle-cases,

175
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.200
one buckled, another laced,

176
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.130
an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town armory with a broken hilt

177
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:07.970
and chapeless with two broken points,

178
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.900
his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle

179
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.030
and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possessed with the glanders

180
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.600
and like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampas,

181
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.830
infected with the fashions, full of windgalls,

182
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.700
sped with spavins, rayed with yellows,

183
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.300
past cure of the fives, stark spoiled with the staggers,

184
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.270
begnawn with the bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten,

185
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.500
near-legged before and with a half-checked bit

186
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.100
and a headstall of sheep's leather

187
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.530
which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling,

188
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.870
hath been often burst and now repaired with knots;

189
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.600
one girth six-times pieced and a woman's crupper of velure

190
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.300
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs

191
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.370
and here and there pieced with packthread.

192
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.730
Who comes with him?

193
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.430
O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned like the horse,

194
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:46.730
with a linen stock on one leg

195
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.470
and a kersey boot-hose on the other,

196
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.330
gartered with a red and blue list, yeah;

197
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.170
an old hat and "the humor of 40 fancies"

198
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.530
pricked in't for a feather:

199
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.600
a monster, a very monster in apparel,

200
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.430
and not like a Christian footboy

201
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.800
or a gentleman's lackey.

202
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.000
'Tis some odd humor pricks him to this fashion,

203
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.970
yet oftentimes, he goes but mean-apparell'd.

204
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.300
I am glad he's comes, howsoe'er he comes.

205
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.500
Why, sir, he comes not.

206
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.670
Oh!

207
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.470
Oh, didst thou not say he comes?

208
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.770
Who? That Petruchio came?

209
00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.070
Ay, that Petruchio came!

210
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.630
No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

211
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.730
Why, that's all one.

212
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:20.830
Nay, by Saint Jamy,

213
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.000
I hold you a penny,

214
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.130
a horse and a man is more than one

215
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.730
and yet not many.

216
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.030
Where be these gallants?

217
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.130
Who's at home?

218
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.230
Ha, ha!

219
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.770
You are welcome, sir.

220
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.870
And yet I come not well.

221
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.330
And yet you halt not.

222
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.470
Not so well apparell'd as I wish you were.

223
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.700
Were it not better, I should rush in thus.

224
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.870
But where is Kate?

225
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:44.330
Where is my lovely bride?

226
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.200
How does my father?

227
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.500
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

228
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.130
Gentles, methinks you frown,

229
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.200
and wherefore gaze this goodly company

230
00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.330
as if they saw some wondrous monument,

231
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.870
some comet, or unusual prodigy?

232
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.030
Why, sir, you know this is your wedding day.

233
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.570
First, we were sad, fearing you would not come,

234
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:10.230
now sadder that you come so unprovided.

235
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.870
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,

236
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.830
an eyesore to our solemn festival.

237
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.500
And tell us what occasion of import

238
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.530
hath all so long detain'd you from your wife

239
00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.400
and sent you hither so unlike yourself?

240
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.330
Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear.

241
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.470
Sufficeth, I am come to keep my word,

242
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.400
though in some part enforced to digress,

243
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.800
which, at more leisure, I shall so explain

244
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.830
as you shall well be satisfied withal.

245
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.600
But where is Kate?

246
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.770
I stay too long from her.

247
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:35.870
The morning wears.

248
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.170
'Tis time we were at church.

249
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.530
See not your bride in these unreverent robes.

250
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.800
Go--go--go to my chamber.

251
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.170
Put on clothes of mine.

252
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:43.370
Not I, believe me.

253
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.530
Thus, I'll visit her.

254
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.870
But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

255
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:48.470
Good sooth, even so.

256
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.970
Therefore, ha' done with words.

257
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.330
To me she's married, not unto my clothes.

258
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.100
Could I repair what she will wear in me

259
00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.070
as I can change these poor accoutrements,

260
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.070
'twere well for me and better for my Kate.

261
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:01.270
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

262
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.130
But what a fool am I to chat with you

263
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.330
when I should bid good morrow to my bride

264
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.830
and seal the title with a lovely kiss.

265
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:09.830
Ah!

266
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.730
He hath some meaning in his mad attire.

267
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.500
We will persuade him, be it possible,

268
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.170
put on better ere he go to church.

269
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.200
I'll after him and see the event of this.

270
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.230
But to her love concerneth us to add her father's liking

271
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.030
which, to bring to pass, as I before unparted to your worship,

272
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.230
I am to get a man.

273
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.430
Eh?

274
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.100
Whate'er he be, it skills not much.

275
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.330
We'll fit him to our turn,

276
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.900
and he shall be Vincentio of Pisa

277
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.470
and make assurance here in Padua

278
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:44.230
of greater sums than I have promised.

279
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:46.000
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope

280
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.770
and marry sweet Bianca with consent.

281
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.630
Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster

282
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:51.500
doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,

283
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.700
'twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage,

284
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.000
which once perform'd-- let all the world say no--

285
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.030
I'll keep mine own despite of all the world.

286
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.930
That by degrees we mean to look into

287
00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.870
and watch our vantage in this business.

288
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.800
We'll overreach the graybeard, Gremio,

289
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.530
the narrow-prying father, Minola,

290
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.700
the quaint musician, amorous Licio

291
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.270
all for my master's sake, Lucentio.

292
00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.130
Oh, Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

293
00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.570
Oh, as willingly as e'er I came from school.

294
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.330
And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

295
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:21.500
Bridegroom say you?

296
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.300
'Tis a groom indeed, a grumbling groom,

297
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.770
and that the girl shall find.

298
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.170
Curseder than she?

299
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.330
Why, it is impossible.

300
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.900
Why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

301
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.470
Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.

302
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.330
Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him.

303
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.000
I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio,

304
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.670
when the priest should ask if Katharine should be his wife,

305
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.170
"Ay, by gogs-wouns," quoth he and swore so loud

306
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.270
that, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book,

307
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:51.570
and as he stoop'd again to take it up,

308
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.470
this mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff

309
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.530
that down fell priest and book and book and priest.

310
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:00.500
"Now take them up," quoth he, "if any list."

311
00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.330
What said the wench when he rose again?

312
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.930
Trembled and shook, for, why, he stamp'd and swore

313
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.930
as if the vicar meant to cozen him.

314
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:13.970
But after many ceremonies done, he calls for wine.

315
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.600
"Her health," quoth he as if he had been aboard,

316
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.300
carousing to his mates after a storm,

317
00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.830
quaff'd off the muscadel

318
00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:23.930
and threw the sops all in the sexton's face,

319
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.400
having no other reason

320
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.300
but that his beard grew thin and hungerly

321
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.230
and seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.

322
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:34.700
This done, he took the bride about the neck

323
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.800
and kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack

324
00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.600
that at the parting all the church did echo,

325
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.830
and, I, seeing this came thence for very shame,

326
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.030
and after me, I know, the rout is coming.

327
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.900
Such a mad marriage never was before.

328
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.770
Hark, hark, I hear the minstrels play.

329
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.100
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains.

330
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.830
I know you think to dine with me today

331
00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.070
and have prepared great store of wedding cheer,

332
00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.900
but so it is my haste doth call me hence,

333
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.000
and therefore, here I mean to take my leave.

334
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.700
Is't possible you will away tonight?

335
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.830
I must away today, before night comes.

336
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:07.930
Make it no wonder.

337
00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.070
If you knew my business,

338
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.200
you would entreat me rather go than stay.

339
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.930
And, honest company, I thank you all

340
00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:14.670
that have beheld me give away myself

341
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.900
to this most patient, sweet, and virtuous wife.

342
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.300
Dine with my father.

343
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.900
Drink a health to me, for I must hence, and farewell to you all.

344
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.870
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

345
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.070
It may not be.

346
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.300
- Let me entreat you. - It cannot be.

347
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.500
- Let me entreat you. - I am content.

348
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.730
You are content to stay?

349
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.200
I am content you shall entreat me stay, but yet not stay.

350
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.400
Entreat me how you can.

351
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.600
Now, if you love me, stay.

352
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.830
Grumio, my horse.

353
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.070
Ay, sir, they be ready.

354
00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.570
The oats have eaten the horses.

355
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:39.970
Nay, then, do what thou canst.

356
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.170
I will not go today,

357
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.300
no, nor tomorrow, not till I please myself.

358
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.970
The door is open, sir.

359
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.200
There lies your way.

360
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.700
You may be jogging whiles your boots are green.

361
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.770
For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself!

362
00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.800
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom

363
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.500
that take it on you at the first so roundly.

364
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.030
O Kate, content thee.

365
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:00.300
Prithee, be not angry.

366
00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.370
I will be angry!

367
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:04.800
What hast thou to do?

368
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.500
Father, be quiet!

369
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.430
He shall stay my leisure.

370
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.400
Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

371
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.500
Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner.

372
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.630
I see a woman may be made a fool

373
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.200
if she had not a spirit to resist.

374
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.700
They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.

375
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.530
Obey the bride, you that attend on her.

376
00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.300
Go to the feast, revel, and domineer,

377
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.630
carouse full measure to her maidenhead,

378
00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:31.270
be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves,

379
00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.100
but for my bonny Kate, she must with me.

380
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:39.130
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret.

381
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.630
I will be master of what is mine own.

382
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.730
She is my goods, my chattels.

383
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.500
She is my house, my household stuff,

384
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.600
my field, my barn,

385
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.430
my horse, my ox, my ass, my--oh--anything;

386
00:15:50.430 --> 00:15:51.930
and here she stands.

387
00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.070
Touch her whoever dare.

388
00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.000
I'll bring mine action on the proudest he

389
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.400
that stops my way in Padua.

390
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.500
Grumio, draw forth thy weapon.

391
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.730
We are beset with thieves!

392
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.530
Rescue thy mistress if thou be a man.

393
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.100
Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch thee, Kate.

394
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:13.530
I'll buckler thee against a million.

395
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.570
Nay, let them go.

396
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.570
A couple of quiet ones.

397
00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:31.870
Went--went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

398
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.670
Of all mad matches, never was the like.

399
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.870
Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?

400
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:43.070
Oh, that being mad herself, she's madly mated.

401
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.530
I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

402
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.170
Ho, neighbours and friends,

403
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.830
though bride and bridegroom wants

404
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:58.770
for to supply the places at the table,

405
00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:04.130
you know there want no junkets at the feast.

406
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.270
Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place,

407
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.630
and let Bianca take her sister's room.

408
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.770
Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

409
00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.530
She shall, Lucentio.

410
00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.470
Gentlemen, let's go.

411
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.970
