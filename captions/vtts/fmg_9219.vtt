00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Announcer: THIS IS

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
AN ABC NEWS SPECIAL.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
AND MARRIAGE.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
WHY WE STAY AND WHY WE STRAY.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
NOW FROM NEW YORK, JOHN STOSSEL.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
GOOD EVENING.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
HOW DO YOU FIND LOVE?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
AND THEN HOW DO YOU KEEP

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
FROM LOSING IT?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
THE PEOPLE WHO REPORT

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
THE GREATEST SATISFACTION

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
WITH LIFE ARE COUPLES -- PEOPLE

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
WHO ARE IN LONG-TERM

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
RELATIONSHIPS.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
NOT ALL OF THEM, OF COURSE,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
BUT ON AVERAGE, COUPLES ARE

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
HEALTHIER AND SAY THEY'RE

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
HAPPIER.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
GETTING THERE IS ANOTHER MATTER.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
MANY OF US KEEP MESSING THAT UP.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
POETS AND PHILOSOPHERS USED

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
TO BE THE EXPERTS ON THIS.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
NOW SCIENTISTS SAY THEY HAVE

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
SOME ANSWERS.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
AND THEY SAY THE MATING GAME

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
BEGINS EARLIER THAN YOU THINK.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
**

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Reporter: DOES THIS LOOK

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
FAMILIAR?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
PAINFUL?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
WHEN I HADO ATTEND THESE

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
AWKWARD GRADE SCHOOL DANCES,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
THE LAST THING I WOULD ADMIT WAS

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
THAT I LIKED SOMEONE.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
YET I DID.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
CRUSHES START AT THIS AGE.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000
AND NOW RESEARCHERS SAY KIDS

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
THIS AGE ARE ALREADY FOCUSING

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
ON THE KIND OF PERSON THEY'LL

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
LATER MARRY.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
THEY BELIEVE THE BLUEPRINT

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
PROBABLY GELS BETWEEN THE AGES

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
OF 3 AND 8.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
ANTHROPOLOGIST HELEN FISHER --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
AS A SMALL CHILD, YOU GROW UP

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
GETTING USED TO YOUR FATHER'S

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
SENSE OF HUMOR, THE AMOUNT

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
OF CHAOS AROUND THE HOUSE,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
THE MUSIC THAT IS PLAYED.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
AND YOU BEGIN TO BUILD

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
AN UNCONSCIOUS LIST OF THINGS

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
THAT YOU ARE LOOKING

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
FOR IN A MATE.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Reporter: MAYBE IT'S THE WAY

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
YOUR FATHER HELD YOU.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
THE WAY YOUR MOTHER'S HAIR

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
TOUCHED YOUR FACE.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
IT'S THESE SNIPPETS OF MEMORY

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
THAT ARE IMPRINTED -- MOMENTS

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
THAT MADE US FEEL WARM

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
AND CONTENTED.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
OR ANGRY AND UNHAPPY.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
THE MEMORIES FORM OUR LOVE MAP,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
AND WE FOLLOW THAT MAP,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
FOR BETTER OR WORSE, THROUGHOUT

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
OUR LIVES.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
THE KIDS ARE AWARE

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
OF THEIR PREFERENCES.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR HUSBAND

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
TO BE LIKE?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
SMART.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Reporter: SMART?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
HANDSOME.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.000
THE PERFECT NOSE.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
[ GIGGLING ]

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
THE PERFECT HEAD.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
NO BIG HEADS.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
SHE HAS TO HAVE GOOD TEETH.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
AND SHE GOTTA WEAR NICE SHOES.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
HANDSOME OR NOT, BUT THEY HAVE

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
TO BE FUNNY, BECAUSE YOU KNOW

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
THOSE BORING GUYS ARE BORING.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Reporter: DO SUCH CHILDHOOD

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
WISHES REALLY GOVERN OUR CHOICES

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
YEARS LATER?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
THE ANTHROPOLOGISTS SAY YES.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
SO WHEN PEOPLE GO OUT, THEY'RE

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.000
LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO FITS

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
THEIR MAP?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
MM-HMM.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
WELL, THEY DON'T THINK THEY ARE,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
BUT THEY WALK INTO A BAR,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
AND THEY LOOK AT FOUR PEOPLE,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
AND THEY SAY, "THOSE WON'T DO,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
BUT, BOY, HE'S CUTE."

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
AND SO ALREADY, A CERTAIN SIZE,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
A CERTAIN SHAPE, A CERTAIN

HAIRSTYLE, A CERTAIN WAY

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
THE BODY IS HANDLED HAS SENT

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
MESSAGES TO YOU.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
AND YOU RESPOND TO THEM.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
ARE YOU READY?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000

AND AGAIN, EVEN IF THAT PERSON

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
MAY NOT BE RIGHT FOR YOU.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
NOTICE HOW SOME PEOPLE'S EXES

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
LOOK ALIKE?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
YOU KEEP LOOKING FOR THAT ONE

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
WHO FEELS LIKE A PERFECT FIT.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
THE PERFECT ONE WOULD BE LIKE

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER, EVERYONE

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000

LEVELS.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
A SOFTNESS.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
THAT'S WHAT I THINK FIRST

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
ABOUT JOY IS SHE'S SO SOFT,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000

THEY JUST GOT ENGAGED.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
FIVE WEEKS FROM THIS DAY,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
KEEP CHECKING IN WITH THEM

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000

OUR PARTNER.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
IT WAS SOMETHING.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I'M NOT -- I CAN'T EXACTLY

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I SAW HER STANDING ACROSS

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
THE ROOM, AND I LOOKED

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
AT MY BROTHER, AND I SAID, "I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000

WITH ANIMALS, BUT IT'S MORE

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000
COMPLEX THAN THAT.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
OFTEN WHAT TURNS THE FEMALES

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
ON --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
THE MALES' LOOKS.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM, IT'S

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
THE MALES THAT HAVE EVOLVED

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000

TO MATE WITH THOSE BIRDS.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
WHY WOULD ORNAMENTATION MAKE

SUCH A DIFFERENCE?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
PEOPLE ARE OBSESSED

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
HAVE LOW NUMBERS.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
SURE ENOUGH, MOST PEOPLE JUDGE

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
THOSE FACES AS MORE ATTRACTIVE.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH OTHER

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
CULTURES.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
EVERYWHERE, PEOPLE REGARD

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
SYMMETRY AS MORE ATTRACTIVE.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
AND ON QUESTIONNAIRES,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
THE SYMMETRICAL MEN REPORT

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
MORE SEX PARTNERS

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.000
IN A LIFETIME.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
THEY BEGIN SEX AT AN EARLIER

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
AGE.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
THEY ENGAGE IN MORE INFIDELITY

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Reporter: IT'S NOT SURPRISING

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
THAT GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE HAVE

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEX,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
BUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
SCIENTISTS SAY IT RELATES

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
TO SURVIVAL OF THE SPECIES.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
WE HAVE AN INSTINCT DEEP

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
IN THE PRIMITIVE PART

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
OF OUR BRAINS, A REPTILIAN

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
BRAIN, THEY CALL IT, THAT TELLS

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
US TO TRY HARD TO MAKE SURE

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
OUR GENES CARRY ON.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
TO PICK HEALTHY MATES AND,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
APPARENTLY, GOOD LOOKS --

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
CLEAR SKIN, BRIGHT EYES, OFTEN

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
PREDICT GOOD GENES.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
SO DOES BEING ABLE TO JUMP HIGH.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
IT'S A MASAI COURTING RITUAL

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Reporter: WHEN WE'RE OLDER,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
THE SIGNALS ARE SIMILAR BUT MORE

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
SOPHISTICATED.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
WHEN YOU WALK INTO A SINGLES

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
BAR, THE FIRST THING THAT BOTH

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
MEN AND WOMEN DO IS SET UP

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
A TERRITORY.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
THEN THEY BEGIN THE MOVE

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000
IN THEIR SPACE TO ATTRACT

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
ATTENTION TO THEMSELVES --

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
A VERY LOUD LAUGH.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
GESTURING TO PEOPLE AROUND

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
THE BAR.

THE MOVING OF THE HAIR.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
ANYTHING TO DRAW ATTENTION

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
TO YOURSELF.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Reporter: SCIENTISTS ACTUALLY

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
STUDY THIS BEHAVIOR, RECORDING

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
GESTURES THEY LABEL

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
"GROOMING TALK" AND

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
THE "COPULATORY GAZE."

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
PSYCHOLOGIST DAVID BUSS --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
HERE WE SEE A WOMAN DO WHAT'S

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
CALLED NECK CANTING.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
THIS GESTURE LIKE THAT IS

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
A SEXUAL SIGNAL.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
TOUCHING THE HAIR IS ALSO

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
A FLIRTATION SIGNAL.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Reporter: THERE ARE DOZENS

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
OF THESE SIGNALS.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AND SUBTLE

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
AS DOING THIS TO THE EDGE

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
OF A GSS.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
"NO THANK YOU" SIGNALS, TOO.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
THE WOMAN HAS A CLOSED ARM

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
GESTURE, AGAIN INDICATING SHE'S

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
NOT RECEPTIVE TO THE GUY.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
SO THE PICKUP RUNS

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
ON MESSAGES, AND THEY HAVE TO BE

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
RETURNED.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
THEY EVOLVED BECAUSE THOSE

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD THEM LIVED

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000

ABOUT HAVING HEALTHY CHILDREN?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.000
NO.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000

IN THE BAR?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT GOES

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
ON IN THE CONSCIOUS BRAIN WHEN

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
IT COMES TO LOVE, BUT DON'T

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
FORGET THAT THE MATING GAME IS

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
THE MOST IMPORTANT GAME THAT

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
WE PLAY.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
IF YOU HAVE FOUR CHILDREN,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
AND I HAVE NO CHILDREN, YOU LIVE

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
ON, AND I DIE OUT.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
SO THE GAME OF LOVE MATTERS.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Reporter: AND THE GAME IS

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.000
DIFFERENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000

STRATEGIES.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
FOR A MAN TO PASS ON HIS GENES,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
THE BEST THING HE CAN DO IS

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
FATHER AS MANY CHILDREN

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
AS HE CAN.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
TO DO THAT, HE HAS TO TRY

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
TO HAVE SEX WITH AS MANY WOMEN

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000

TO IMPREGNATE THE WHOLE HERD.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
BUT FEMALES MAKE CHOICES, TOO.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
A CHILD.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
ON THE GRASSLANDS OF AFRICA, IT

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
WAS AN ADAPTIVE THING

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
FOR A FEMALE TO FIND A MALE WHO

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
WAS WILLING TO SHARE HIS GOODS

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
AND WEALTH.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Reporter: AND TODAY STILL,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO ALSO

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
LOOK FOR RESOURCES.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
AFTER ALL, MOTHERHOOD'S

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
EXPENSIVE.

BUT SPERM IS CHEAP.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
THAT'S EVOLUTION SPEAKING.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
OF COURSE, TODAY WE CALL IT

ROMANCE AND LOVE.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000

AND SUDDENLY GET A RUSH

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
DIFFERENT FEELING FROM FALLING

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
ON THE TELEPHONE.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
A DIFFERENT BRAIN SYSTEM

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000

IS CALLED INFATUATION.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
FROM THE ANIMAL.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.000

PERSON.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY THAT

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
THEY THINK OF THEIR TRUE LOVE

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
AS MUCH AS 85% OF THEIR WAKING

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
HOURS.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000

INTO YOUR BRAIN.

THINKING -- YOU CAN'T GET THEM

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

THE FIRST TIME I TOLD JOY

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
"I LOVE YOU" WAS A STRICTLY

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
INVOLUNTARY RESPONSE.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I MEAN, JOY MENTIONED SOMETHING

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
THAT SHE LOVED CHOCOLATE

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
OR SOMETHING, AND I JUST WENT,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000
"WELL, I LOVE YOU."

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I SORT OF GOT A CHILL.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I REMEMBER MY SPINE KIND

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
OF TINGLING LIKE, "YEAH, THAT

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
SOUNDED GREAT COMING OUT

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
BROUGHT THIS RING AND PROPOSED.

THEIR LIVES AS HUSBAND AND WIFE.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
WE WISH THEM WELL.

STILL, FOR THEM AND FOR ANY

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
COUPLE, THERE IS WITHIN US

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
AN ANCIENT CONFLICT.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
THE BRAIN IS A POOR DESIGN,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
ACTUALLY.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
WE'RE NOT A WELL-BUILT ANIMAL.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
WE HAVE EVOLVED THE BRAIN

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000
PHYSIOLOGY TO ATTACH TO ONE

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
PARTNER AND RAISE OUR CHILDREN

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
AS A TEAM.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
AND I THINK WE'VE ALSO EVOLVED

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
THE BRAIN PHYSIOLOGY TO HAVE

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
A ROVING EYE.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
SO WE SEEM TO HAVE BOTH.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
LEAVING THE HUMAN ANIMAL --

PERSON AND TO SPREAD OUR SEED.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
THE RESULT IS THAT LOTS

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
OF PEOPLE BOND TO ONE PERSON,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
PLEDGE EVERLASTING LOVE AND THEN

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
CHEAT.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I BETRAYED MY WIFE.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
AND I EMBARRASSED THE PRESIDENT.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
KENNEDY WENT ON TO PUBLICLY

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
APOLOGIZE TO THE FAMILY

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
OF THE TEENAGE BABY-SITTER --

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
THERE WERE FURTHER QUESTIONS

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
TODAY ABOUT WHETHER

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
JOSEPH RALSTON'S EXTRAMARITAL

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
AFFAIR --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
FORGIVE ME.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Reporter: OF COURSE, THERE'S

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
NOTHING NEW ABOUT ALL THIS.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
LIFELONG MONOGAMY IS

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
EXTREMELY RARE STATISTICALLY.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
PERHAPS 25% OF THE PEOPLE PURSUE

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
THAT.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
OF PUBLIC HUMILIATION.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Reporter: NOW, YOU'D THINK

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
THE FALLOUT FROM INFIDELITY,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
OR EVEN JUST THE RISK OF BEING

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
CAUGHT AND EXPOSED, ESPECIALLY

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
FOR FAMOUS PEOPLE, WOULD DETER

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
THEM, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
WE'RE TOLD EVEN OUR LEADERS

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
CAN'T RESIST.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
PEOPLE TAKE ENORMOUS RISKS

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
TO CHEAT?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
YEAH.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
YOU CAN LOSE NOT ONLY YOUR JOB

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
AND YOUR FAMILY AND YOUR HOME

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
AND YOUR MONEY AND YOUR PRIDE

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
AND YOUR SELF-RESPECT,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000
BUT YOUR HEALTH.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I MEAN, WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
WHERE YOU CAN GET AIDS AND DIE.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Reporter: THERE WERE TIMES

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
WHEN THERE WERE HORRIBLE

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
PUNISHMENTS.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
ABSOLUTELY.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Reporter: YOU COULD GET

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
YOUR HEAD CHOPPED OFF.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
BURNED YOU ALIVE.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.000
AND PEOPLE STILL CHEAT.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
THAT IS THE TRIUMPH OF NATURE

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
OVER CULTURE --

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
THE FACT THAT THE HUMAN ANIMAL

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
WILL CONTINUE TO DO THINGS THAT

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
THEY ALL THEIR LIVES HAVE KNOWN

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
ARE NOT CORRECT.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Reporter: AND THERE ARE

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
GENDER DIFFERENCES WITH THIS.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
AS WE SAID, FOR 1 MILLION YEARS,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
NATURE TAUGHT THAT A WOMAN'S

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
GENES ARE BEST SERVED BY FINDING

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
ONE MAN WHO WILL COMMIT TO HER,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
WHILE MEN'S GENES LIVE

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
ON BY HAVING SEX WITH LOTS

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
OF WOMEN.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THEN

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
AND NOW, MEN ARE MORE LIKELY

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
TO CHEAT --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
BY TWO TO ONE, ACCORDING TO MOST

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
SURVEYS.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
OUR APPETITES ARE DIFFERENT.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
YOU ALSO SEE THE DIFFERENCE

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
IN OUR CHOICE OF READING

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
MATERIAL.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
FAR MORE WOMEN BUY ROMANCE

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
NOVELS, WHERE THE LEADING

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
CHARACTER USUALLY HAS AN INTENSE

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE SPECIAL

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
MAN.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
MEN BUY SKIN MAGAZINES, WHICH

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.000
LET MEN LOOK AT LOTS

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
OF DIFFERENT WOMEN.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
IT'S AS IF MEN ARE PROGRAMMED

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
TO KEEP SEEKING NEW PARTNERS.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
MEN TEND, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
TO HAVE TWICE AS MANY SEXUAL

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
FANTASIES AS WOMEN PER DAY.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
ALSO, DURING THE COURSE

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
OF A SINGLE FAMILY EPISODE, MEN

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
ARE MORE LIKELY TO DO WHAT'S

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
CALLED "PARTNER SWITCHING"

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.000
SO ONE PARTNER WILL COME IN,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
AND THEN HE'LL SWITCH TO ANOTHER

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
PARTNER AND ANOTHER.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Reporter: AND WITH ALL

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
THE CHEATING IN OUR MINDS, SOME

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000
SCIENTISTS SAY IT'S SURPRISING

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
HOW FEW OF US CHEAT IN REAL

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
IT'S THE NORM FOR MOST ANIMALS

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
TO JUST COPULATE AND MOVE

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
ONTO ANOTHER PARTNER.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
ONLY 3% OF MAMMALS STAY WITH ONE

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
PARTNER FOR LIFE.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
BEAVERS, CERTAIN KINDS

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
WE DO.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
IT MAY BE THAT CHEMICALS

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
IN THE BRAIN DICTATE THESE

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000

DID THIS GO UP?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
OXYTOCIN, WHICH IS IN THE BRAIN

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000

PAIRED UP.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
BECAUSE WHEN THE RESEARCHERS

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
BLOCK THAT CHEMICAL, VOLS STOP

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
PREFERRING THE SINGLE PARTNER.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000

ITS MATE.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
RESEARCHERS SPECULATE THAT

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
THE SAME CHEMICAL WHICH IS

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
PRESENT IN HUMANS DICTATES

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
OUR DRIVE TO STAY OR STRAY.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
IF IT IS A MATTER OF BRAIN

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
CHEMISTRY, SOME RESEARCHERS

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
SUGGEST THAT THE TENDENCY

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
OF THE RELATIONSHIP.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
GOTTMAN SAYS FOUR KINDS

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
OF BEHAVIOR ARE PREDICTORS

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
OF DIVORCE.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000
HE CALLS THEM FOUR HORSEMEN

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
OF THE APOCALYPSE.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
THE FIRST ONE IS CRITICISM, THEN

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
DEFENSIVENESS.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
THE THIRD ONE IS CONTEMPT,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
THE FOURTH WITHDRAWAL.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
FOUR YEARS AGO FOR "20/20,"

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
WE TAPED THIS COUPLE

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
AS THEY WENT THOUGH THE PROGRAM.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
DOUG AND THERESA DICHTMAN WERE

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000
ASKED TO DISCUSS A FAMILY

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000
CONFLICT.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
I HAD NO IDEA DAD WAS EVEN

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
COMING TO TOWN OR THEY WERE

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
GOING TO A MARINERS GAME

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
OR ANYTHING, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
TELL ME.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.000
NOW, HE HAS A VERY CRUCIAL

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
DECISION TO MAKE HERE.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
HOW IS HE GOING TO RESPOND

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
TO HER COMPLAINT?

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000
SHE DIDN'T INSULT HIM.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
SHE DIDN'T CALL HIM ANY NAMES.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
SHE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:33.000
IRRESPONSIBLE, THAT HE WAS A BAD

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
PERSON.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
LET'S SEE HOW HE RESPONDS.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000
WELL, THAT'S NOT TRUE,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:38.000
BECAUSE I TOLD YOU ON TUESDAY

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
THAT WE WERE GOING

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
TO THE MARINERS GAME ON MONDAY,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
BUT THAT WASN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000
FOR YOU REMEMBER, APPARENTLY.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
HE'S DEFENSIVE.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
HE DEFENDS HIMSELF.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
DENIES RESPONSIBILITY

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED, AND THEN

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
HE IS SARCASTIC.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000
WELL, THAT WAS PRETTY

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
BRILLIANT TO ASK ME WHEN I'M

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
IN BED, HALF ASLEEP.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Reporter: HE'S CONTEMPTUOUS

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
OF HER.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
HE PUTS HER DOWN.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
CONTEMPT IS A VERY CORROSIVE

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000
THING IN A MARRIAGE.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
IT OUGHT REALLY TO BE OUTLAWED

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
AND BANNED IN MARRIAGES.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Reporter: HOW MUCH

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.000
OF YOUR FOUR HORSEMEN DO YOU SEE

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
IN THEM?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I SEE THREE.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
THREE OUT OF THE FOUR --

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
CRITICISM, CONTEMPT,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
DEFENSIVENESS.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
OH, ALL RIGHT!

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Reporter: GOTTMAN PREDICTED

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.000
THE DICHTMANS WOULD DIVORCE,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
BUT THE DICHTMANS DIDN'T BELIEVE

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
IT.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
WILL YOU STAY MARRIED, DO

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
YOU THINK?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
YEAH, WE'LL STAY MARRIED.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Reporter: DO YOU LOVE HIM?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.000
YES, I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000
[ CHEERS ]

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Reporter: TWO YEARS LATER,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
THE DICHTMANS DID DIVORCE.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
DOUG NOW SAYS HE WISHED GOTTMAN,

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
INSTEAD OF MAKING NEGATIVE

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
PREDICTIONS, HAD ACTUALLY TRIED

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:47.000
TO HELP.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Reporter: AND NOW GOTTMAN

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
AND HIS WIFE, PSYCHOLOGIST

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
JULIE GOTTMAN, DO HELP.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
TO SEE HOW, WE ARRANGED FOR THIS

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:55.000
COUPLE DAN AND ALLISON KNITTEL

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
TO GO THROUGH HIS MARRIAGE LAB.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
DAN IS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:57.000
IN THE NAVY, WORKING

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
ON SUBMARINES.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
GO.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Reporter: ALLISON IS

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
A DISPATCHER FOR A LOCAL BUS

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000
SYSTEM.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
THEY MARRIED TWO YEARS AGO

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
AND ANSWERED THE AD, EVEN THOUGH

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
THEY DIDN'T THINK THEIR MARRIAGE

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
WAS IN TROUBLE.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
THE KNITTELS STRUCK US AS A VERY

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
CLOSE COUPLE.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000
THEY'RE ALL OVER EACH, OTHER

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
MUCH OF THE TIME.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
OF COURSE THEY HAVE CONFLICTS.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
IN THE LAB, DAN SUGGESTS

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
THEY SAVE MONEY BY SELLING

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000
THEIR HOUSE AND MOVING

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
INTO A TRAILER.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000
THEN WHEREVER OUR JOBS TAKE

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
US, AT LEAST WE GOT OUR HOME.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
MM-HMM.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
YOU KNOW, WE CAN GO THERE,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
YOU KNOW, EVEN IF WE HAVE TO SIT

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.000
IN A TRAILER PARK FOR, YOU KNOW,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
MONTHS UNTIL WE CAN FIND

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
SOMEPLACE TO LIVE.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
MY BIGGEST FEAR IS THAT ONCE

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
WE GET INTO THAT LIFESTYLE

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
WE WON'T GET OUT OF IT.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Reporter: ON THE SURFACE

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
WRONG, BUT AS THE RESEARCHERS

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
WATCH, THEY SEE DAN

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
AND ALLISON'S HEART AND SWEAT

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
RATES STAY LOW.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000
THAT SUGGESTS THE FOURTH

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
HORSEMAN, EMOTIONAL WITHDRAWAL.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
SO, WHAT DO WE DO?

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Reporter: SHE LOOKS

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000
AS IF SHE HAS CHECKED OUT.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
YOU'RE PICKING THAT UP.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
SHE'S SITTING BACK.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.000
SHE'S NOT EVEN REALLY PAYING

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
FULL ATTENTION TO HIM.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
SHE'S NOT THERE EMOTIONALLY.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
GOING ON UNDERNEATH, THEY'RE

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
REALLY SAYING, I'M OUT OF THIS

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
MORE CLUES ABOUT THE SEEMINGLY

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
BLISSFUL MARRIAGE

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
FROM THE MARRIAGE QUESTIONNAIRE,

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000
ON WHICH ALLISON SAID SHE THINKS

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
ABOUT DIVORCE OFTEN, SOMETIMES

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
WISHES SHE HAD NEVER MARRIED.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
DAN, HOWEVER, SAYS HE'S

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
PERFECTLY HAPPY.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
IT'S LIKE YOU ARE OUT TO LUNCH

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
IN THE MARRIAGE HERE.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
SHE HAS ALL THESE THINGS SHE'S

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000
UNHAPPY ABOUT AND YOU SAY, "OH,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.000
I DO --

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
I DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF TRYING

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
TO COVER MY EMOTIONS.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000
A SCORE OF FOUR ON THIS

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
DIVORCE POTENTIAL SCALE SUGGESTS

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
THAT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THIS

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000

CAN I HELP HERE

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000

GETS TO THE ESSENCE OF IT.

I LIVED IN THE PROJECTS.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
I DID THAT.

START SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER.

YES.

THERE WASN'T THAT SCREAMING RAW

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000
BETTER?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000
A LOUD FIGHT WHERE THERE'S

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
NO CONTEMPT, YES.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
GO AHEAD, TELL ME I'M MANIAC!

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
GO AHEAD, SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
BUT I DON'T CARE!

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
I DON'T CARE.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
THAT'S THE WAY I FEEL!

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Reporter: THE CRAMDENS, SAYS

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
GOTTMAN, ARE AN EXAMPLE

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
OF A HEALTHY COUPLE.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
I LOVE YOU.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Reporter: FIGHTING AND ANGER,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.000
HE SAYS, ARE NOT PREDICTORS

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
OF DIVORCE.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
MARRIAGES END WITH A WHIMPER.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
PEOPLE GROW APART, THEY'RE

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000
NO LONGER FRIENDS.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
THEY GET LONELY AND EVENTUALLY

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
THERE'S NO CONNECTION.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Reporter: GOTTMAN DOES

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
A SECOND INTERVENTION.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
HE TELLS THEM WHAT HE SAW

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000
AND SUGGESTS COUNSELING.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
WHAT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
A LITTLE BIT, LISTENING

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
TO YOU WAS THAT MAYBE IT WAS TOO

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
LATE.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
YOU KNOW, THAT IN A LOT OF WAYS

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000
YOU'VE LEFT.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000
PARTS OF YOU HAVE GONE ALREADY.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
HARD TO REALLY HAVE THE COURAGE

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
TO COME BACK AND TRY.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Reporter: I TALKED TO THEM

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
TWO WEEKS LATER.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
THEY SAY THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
DID GOTTMAN'S INTERVENTION HAVE

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
SOMETHING TO DO WITH CHANGING

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
THE WAY YOU FEEL ABOUT

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000
THE CONFLICT?

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
WE WERE FORCED TO TALK

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
ABOUT THE STUFF THAT WE HAD BEEN

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
HIDING OR GLOSSING OVER.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Reporter: GONNA STAY MARRIED?

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
OH, YEAH.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:10.000
* YOU LIKE POTATO

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
* YOU LIKE TO MATE OH -- *

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Reporter: GOTTMAN TRIES

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
TO GET COUPLES TO UNDERSTAND

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
THAT MANY MARITAL PROBLEMS

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
CANNOT BE FIXED.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:19.000
YOU JUST NEED TO LEARN TO LIVE

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
WITH THEM.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
I DIDN'T GET THAT.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
I DIDN'T GET THAT.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.000
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU NEVER

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
LISTEN.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
IT SEEMS LIKE THE GOAL

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
OF COUPLES IS IF THEY SOLVE

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
THEIR PROBLEMS, THEY'LL BE

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.000
HAPPY.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
THE GOAL OF THERAPY OUGHT TO BE,

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
TO GET COUPLES TO COME TO TERMS

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
WITH UNRESOLVABLE ISSUES,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:30.000
WITH PERPETUAL PROBLEMS THAT

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE FOREVER.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
SPOTLESS.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
I'M A SPOTTER.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
I'M USED TO IT.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
**

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
* AND YOU SAY -- *

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Reporter: THE GOTTMANS TELL

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
COUPLES IT'S OKAY THAT YOU CAN'T

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000
AGREE AND COUPLES OFTEN FIND

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
THAT A RELIEF.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
AFTER ALL IF YOU THINK

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
ABOUT IT, THERE'S NO HUMAN

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
RELATIONSHIP THAT ANY OF US HAVE

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
WITH SIBLINGS OR WITH FRIENDS

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000
THAT IS PERFECT.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
INSTEAD, WE ACCEPT OUR FRIENDS

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
WITH NO LIMITATIONS AND THAT'S

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.000
WHAT OUR COUPLES ARE DOING

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
IN MARRIAGES THAT ARE WORKING

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
VERY WELL.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
YOU ARE, INDEED, MY VERY LIFE

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
AND I AM BLESSED TO BE

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
YOUR LOVING WIFE.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
WE'VE FOUND THAT THE REAL

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
BASIS FOR ROMANCE AND PASSION

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000
ARE IN THESE VERY SMALL MOMENTS.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
DO YOU SEE ANY MORE OF THEM?

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
WHEN PEOPLE EITHER

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
CAN TURN TOWARD ONE ANOTHER

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
OR TURN AWAY FROM ONE ANOTHER.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
THEY'RE READING THE SUNDAY PAPER

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
TOGETHER.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
SO WE GOT THAT ONE FINISHED.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.000
AND WE FIND IN MARRIAGES

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
WHERE ROMANCE CONTINUES, PEOPLE

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
ARE CONNECTING IN THIS EVERY

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
DAY, SMALL WAY.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Reporter: JUST BE NICE

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
TO EACH OTHER?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
RIGHT.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000
PEOPLE SAY, "IS THIS ALL

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
THERE IS TO IT?

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.000
THIS IS EASY, I CAN DO THIS."

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR THESE

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
SECRETS THAT ARE REALLY VERY

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
EASY.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:43.000
IT'S JUST THAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
THEM OFTEN, EVERY DAY.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I THINK YOU DO LOVE ME.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
I THINK SO, TOO.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
ONLY 100 YEARS AGO DIVORCE

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
BARELY EXISTED.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
IT'S NOT THAT MARRIED LIFE WAS

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000
ANY EASIER.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000
IT WAS BECAUSE YOUR PARTNER

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
RARELY LIVED LONG ENOUGH

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
FOR DIVORCE TO BEEN AN ISSUE.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
THE DIVORCE RATE HAS BEEN

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000
CLIMBING, NOT JUST SINCE

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
THE SEXUAL REVOLUTION, IT'S BEEN

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000
GOING UP FOR 100 YEARS.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
IT MEANS TODAY'S DIVORCE PROBLEM

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
HAS GROWN OUT OF GOOD THINGS,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
AFFLUENCE AND FREEDOM.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
IT'S A LUXURY OF THE

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
20th CENTURY, ONE THAT'S HURT

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
THE EXPERTS SAY WE CAN MAKE LOVE

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
LAST.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
LOVE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
HAPPENS TO US.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
WE CAN HELP MAKE IT STAY.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
IT DOES TAKE WORK,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
BUT THE COUPLES WHO HANG

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
IN THERE, FIGHTING

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
THROUGH PROBLEMS BY TALKING

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
ABOUT THEM EVEN SCREAMING

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000
ABOUT THEM, ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
TO FIND THAT COMFORT

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
AND HAPPINESS A LONG

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
RELATIONSHIP CAN GIVE.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
YOUR LOCAL NEWS.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
I'M JOHN STOSSEL.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.000
GOOD NIGHT.
