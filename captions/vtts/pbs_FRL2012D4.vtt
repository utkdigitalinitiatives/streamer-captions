00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:44.460
>> Five, four, three, two, one.
>> I think the problem parents
have is that once their kid
becomes a teenager, for a brief

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.060
period of time it's as though
they've been invaded by another
body.
>> They need to learn how to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.030
relate to being a kid.
I think they forgot.
>> We now know that there's a
lot of dynamic activity.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.830
In many ways, it's the most
tumultuous time of brain
development since coming out of
the womb.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.160
>> I swear to God, I'm never
talking to any of your friends
again.
I'll never talk to you again.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.000
I swear to God!
>> No!
You don't have to... Did I say
anything?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.330
Did I say, "No, you couldn't sit
here"?
>> Those cells and connections
that are used will survive and

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.360
flourish.
Those cells and connections that
are not used will wither and
die.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.830
>> With all of the things that
teenagers have available to
them, their sleep has been
shoved into an ever-narrowing

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.300
window.
>> Living in teenage life today
is completely different from
before.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.100
I know it's very stressful on
adults, but they're going to
have to realize that it's
today's world.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.400
That's how it is.
>> NARRATOR: Tonight,
"Frontline" takes you inside the
teenage brain a

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.460
>> NARRATOR: The sun is up, and
inside the O'Donnell's house,
they are trying to get Charlie
up.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:11.460
>> Charl... Charl?
>><i> What!</i>
>> NARRATOR: Pam tries.
>> Come on.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.600
>> No!
>> NARRATOR: And then Charles,
Sr.
>> Charles, time to get up.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.460
>> No, just leave me alone!
>> All right, well...
>> Get out.
I want to sleep.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:32.900
>> All right, well, time to get
up.
I'll give you ten minutes.
>> By the time he gets up in the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:41.600
morning to the time he walks out
the door, there's a matter of,
like, 11 minutes maximum.
So he's a procrastinator.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.060
He'll just stay in bed.
>> NARRATOR: They happen to live
in East Providence, Rhode
Island, but parents everywhere

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.500
will recognize the look and the
pacing.
It's a school day, and there is
a teenager to get out of bed.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.560
>> We have to remind him do your
hair, get your books, take your
backpack, have your key for the
house.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:08.630
It's a normal routine type of
thing.
>> Did you study?
>> No.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.460
How do you study math?
>> Practice.
>> Yippee.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.630
Bacon's a little burnt.
>> Yeah, sorry about that.
He's a very friendly person.
He's very outgoing.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.060
He's very well liked outside the
house.
It's almost like he's a
different kid than he is at home

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.730
because they don't get the
attitude that we get.
(<i> Charles burps</i> )
>> About three more days, you're

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:47.200
all done; school's out.
>> Uh-uh, only one more.
>> How come you don't have to go
to school on Friday?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.100
>> 'Cause that's when the
unofficial report cards are
distributed.
>> Well, maybe it'd be a good

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.460
idea for you to go into school.
>> No, they're mailing it.
Why bother going in and getting
out at 10:30?

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:04.000
I don't have to go in.
>> We'll see.
Pam and I are trying to make
sure that Charlie does well in

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.700
high school so that he doesn't
unknowingly close some doors on
himself for future
opportunities.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.160
It was nice of your mother to
cook breakfast for you this
morning.
Did you say thank you?

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:22.430
>> Yes, I did, Dad.
>> That's good.
>> Did I, Mom?
>> No, you didn't.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:29.500
You're welcome.
>> Can I have another drink of
orange juice?
>> NARRATOR: If parents often

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:35.930
wonder what is going on inside
the teenage brain, tonight, some
answers-- perhaps more than most
parents expect.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:43.330
Here at the University of
Minnesota, this $2 million
machine is revealing the secrets
of another 15-year-old boy to

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.100
his father.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.730
While Colin Nelson lies calmly,
a scanning machine-- a magnetic
resonance imager-- will open a
window into his brain.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:08.630
The details are there, but what
does this picture mean about
mood, learning, memory?
>> So he has a good hippocampus.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.660
How come he doesn't remember to
take out the garbage in the
morning?
(<i> scanner beeping</i> )

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:20.230
I wonder if he's awake.
The first time we scanned him,
when he was about nine, with all
that noise he fell asleep.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:28.060
(<i> scanner beeping</i> )
>> NARRATOR: Charles Nelson is a
neuroscientist and child
psychologist at the University

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.800
of Minnesota.
>> Teenagers have-- particularly
when they're first becoming
teenagers-- have every reason to

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:41.000
believe and to feel that no one
understands them, that they
themselves are sometimes
surprised at what flies out of

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.560
their mouth.
And... and a personal example is
when my son was 12, he one day
just blurted something out and

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.200
then grinned, and he thought...
he thought out loud, "Where did
that come from?"
>> NARRATOR: His father is

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:03.060
trying to answer this question.
Slowly a picture is emerging of
the brain of a boy not yet an
adult, not quite a child.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.130
>> ...we can correlate it with
real life.
If we show activation in the
hippocampus, the question would

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.530
be, why is it that in this
particular case of Colin, why he
doesn't remember to bring his
books home from school?

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.900
I think the problem parents have
is they... no matter how well
they think they know their kid,
once their kid becomes a

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.730
teenager, for a brief period of
time it's as though they've been
invaded by another body or
another brain.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:31.630
And suddenly they don't quite
know that kid anymore, and they
get thrown off balance.
>> We're bending.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:39.300
It's a give-and-take situation.
>> They still... like, they're
only about like that.
They've still got, like, that

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:46.130
much more to go.
>> Well, it takes a lot to let
go.
>> Not for me.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.200
>> For me, it does.
>> You gotta be relaxed.
>> I am cool.
There's nobody cooler than me,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:57.500
let me tell you.
It just takes a lot, you know.
We've raised you to the best of
our ability.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:03.230
You may think that we're
paranoid or we're uncool or
we're too strict...
>> All of the above.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:09.660
>> That's what works for us, we
feel.
>> But you're not the kid.
You don't have to abide by your

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.030
own rules.
>> I have to abide by<i> his</i> rules.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:36.330
>> NARRATOR: In an artist's
studio in Cincinnati, Jim
Borgman is capturing the flash
points of life with teens.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:43.930
A Pulitzer prize winner, Borgman
developed the popular "Zits"
cartoon with artist Jerry Scott.
Now syndicated in 900

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:53.100
newspapers, Jeremy and his comic
strip family are familiar to
parents everywhere.
>> 90% of the letters we get

00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:01.600
fall into one wonderful
category, which are, "You must
have a camera in our house."
Or, you know, "This is my son

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:10.400
exactly, I can't believe it.
How are you doing it?"
Jeremy is 15 years old, he can't
drive, he's still stuck within

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.030
the orbit of his parents' rules,
and they are still a much bigger
factor in his life than he would
like.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:24.700
And so there's that moment
before he can get out of the
house and drive off on his own
when there is the maximum

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:33.200
tension in the house.
>> Many parents are thrown for a
loop when their kids get to be
an adolescent, in some respects.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.830
And what I think they need to do
is recognize that this is just
another phase of child
development, and even though

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:46.230
their children may be shouting
more and talking back more and
kicking and... and throwing
temper tantrums, it's just a

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:53.700
temper tantrum in a five-foot-
tall body instead of an 18-inch-
long body.
>> NARRATOR: And Nelson knows.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:10:02.660
He's an expert on little babies.
This one, Natalie Aune, can
already recognize her mother's
voice and she's just a week old.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:10.300
By measuring small brain waves,
researchers at Nelson's lab at
the University of Minnesota can
show how babies are learning

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:17.700
quickly, taking in data from the
vivid world around them.
That period of dramatic growth
in Natalie's brain will happen

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:25.630
once again, just before she
becomes a teenager.
>> I think the transition into
puberty is analogous to the

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:32.630
transition to being a baby in
many respects.
That a child suddenly is
undergoing fairly substantial

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.600
changes in their brain
development at a very, very
rapid pace.
And that period of time, often

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:45.830
that lasts only a year or two,
is a time where we really need
to pay very close attention to
what's happening to our kids.

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:51.860
>> NARRATOR: But paying
attention to a teenager brings a
different set of challenges.
>> We have rules that you have

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.100
to follow while you're in the
house-- like it or not.
>> Did you like your father's
rules?

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:01.230
>> Probably not.
>> You don't remember it?
"Probably"?
>> I still have a good

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:06.860
relationship with my father,
Charlie.
>> Yeah, but did you like his
rules?

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:14.230
>> I would assume he had rules
that I didn't care for.
But while I was living in the
house, I had to abide by the

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:20.330
rules, and I feel, you know...
>> Did you want to move out of
there as soon as possible
because of those rules?

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:24.060
>> No.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:33.130
>> They need to learn how to
relate to being a kid.
I think they forgot.
Stuff like that.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:38.300
Let us make our own mistakes.

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:47.300
>> NARRATOR: 15 years old, a
teenager with wheels that are
too small, with ambitions to
drive, to fly in a larger world.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:12:03.200
Late at night Dr. Jay Giedd
heads to work.
He, too, is grappling with the
teenage world, trying to

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:11.230
untangle the workings and
wirings of the adolescent brain.
This doctor is crossing over a
new threshold to a fresh

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:18.530
understanding of adolescence.
>> I think people for
generations have been fascinated
by teen behavior and what is

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:27.800
happening in teens.
But for so long to actually look
inside the biology of teen
behavior has been very elusive.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:34.830
And we just haven't had the
technology or the tools to... to
try to peer into the so-called
black box.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:41.430
>> NARRATOR: But now he does.
Dr. Giedd of the National
Institute of Mental Health gets
the use of this imaging machine

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:47.860
one night a week to look at the
brain structure of normal
children.
Teens come in and sometimes even

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:56.060
sleep in this large magnet so he
can take a long, hard look
inside their brains.
>> Now for the first time in our

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:03.330
human history, we can actually
start exploring the living,
growing, activity of the human
brain.

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:14.230
Five, four, three, two, one,
blast off.
>> NARRATOR: What he discovered
in the all-important part of the

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:21.460
brain that sits behind the
forehead in an area called the
frontal cortex was an unexpected
growth spurt, an overproduction

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:28.960
of cells just before puberty.
>> This is a process that we
knew happened in the womb, maybe
even the first 18 months of

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:35.500
life.
But it was only when we started
following the same children by
scanning their brains at two-

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:43.930
year intervals that we detected
a second wave of overproduction.
And this second wave of
overproduction is manifest by an

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:51.230
actual thickening in the gray
matter or the thinking part, in
the front parts of the brain.
>> Many people mistakenly

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.730
believe that most of the changes
occurred in the first few years
of life, and then after a child
was about three, there was

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:02.430
actually relatively little
change occurring.
And... and we know now that's
absolutely incorrect.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:08.830
>> Well, I think the most
surprising thing has been how
much the teen brain is changing.
By age six, the brain's already

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:17.500
95% of its adult size.
But the gray matter, or thinking
part of the brain, continues to
thicken throughout childhood as

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:25.830
the brain cells grow extra
connections, much like a tree
growing extra branches, twigs,
and roots.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:31.730
>> NARRATOR: It's like this: the
brain grows like a tree.
First there is a flurry of
growth.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:37.760
Then unused branches or pathways
are pruned.
And it is this pruning that
gives the tree its shape for the

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.630
future.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:53.500
>> I'll hold this in position
because it has to have a little
bit of an angle.
I'm going to tighten this clamp.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.900
Fingers first.
>> NARRATOR: For Charlie, as he
works in his uncle's garage, the
skills he's acquiring will

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:07.800
strengthen certain neural
pathways.
What he practices will combine
with his own genetic heritage to

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.330
consolidate the wiring in
certain parts of his brain and
not others.
>> The last thing you want to do

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:19.660
is give this thing...
>> Want me to hold it right
there?
>> Yes, right there is perfect.

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:26.530
>> The pruning-down phase is
perhaps even more interesting
because our leading hypothesis
for that is the use-it-or-lose-

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:31.500
it principle.
Those cells and connections that
are used will survive and
flourish.

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:37.700
Those cells and connections that
are not used will wither and
die.
So if the teen is doing music or

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:46.160
sports or academics, those are
the cells and connections that
will be hard-wired.
If they're lying on the couch or

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.900
playing video games or MTV,
those are the cells and
connections that are going to
survive.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.160
>> NARRATOR: It is not only what
a teenager does that matters,
but how old he is and what the
immature brain is capable of

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:05.400
doing.
Some areas coordinate and
oversee others, and it is those
parts of the brain that have

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:12.060
long interested neuroscientists.
>> We've known for a long time
that what we actually call the
prefrontal cortex, the part that

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:19.000
sits behind your forehead, is
involved in planning behavior,
your use of strategies, a
technical term we call cognitive

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.330
flexibility, which is can you
change your mind and do you have
sort of a... a fluid way of
going about solving problems?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:31.530
>> The part of the brain that is
the so-called CEO or the
executive of the brain is still
being built during the teenage

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:37.960
years.
Teens are capable of enormous
intellectual and artistic
accomplishments.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:45.300
But that basic part of the brain
that gives us strategies and
organizing and perhaps warns us
of potential consequences isn't

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:53.200
fully on board yet.
>> NARRATOR: The risks of a
severe concussion or a turned
ankle, for instance.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:59.130
An adult brain might call for a
helmet here or suggest this is
not quite the moment to take a
drag.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:06.830
But when you're very good, very
determined, and very young, it's
easy to feel invulnerable.
>> On some occasions, I wear

00:17:06.830 --> 00:17:10.330
helmets, but not that much.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:17.930
I come here almost every day, so
it's not that much for me if I
fall because I'm kind of used to
it.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.030
I just get little scrapes.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:31.360
No, it's not that risky.
>> NARRATOR: Well, "not<i> that</i>
risky" would be one way to put
it.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.560
>> What happened?
>> It's one of, like, the most
common-- either rolling or
wrists.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:46.600
(<i> children talking</i> )
>> Adolescence has always been a
period of high risk.
We know that teenagers engage in

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:52.960
risky behavior, and they have
always engaged in risky
behavior.
There's nothing new about that

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.600
now.
And because the child, the 13-
or 14- or 15-year-old, still has
an immature frontal cortex, they

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:03.760
often do not make the most
responsible, reasoned decisions.
And by virtue of having things
available that can do harm, they

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:16.600
often wind up in a higher risk
group than I experienced as a
child myself.
(<i> music playing</i> )

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:22.560
>> NARRATOR: The prevalence of
drugs, for instance.
Here at a rave party, ecstasy
and other drugs are a kind of

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:29.700
rite of passage.
>> When you're on E, you love
everyone.
Like, I love<i> you.</i>

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:36.860
>> It's very similar to San
Francisco in 1969.
>> The way you feel.
Like, your hands are soft.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:45.460
You can touch your face and your
skin is very, very soft.
People touch you; it's nice.
>> It's also a particularly

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:53.130
cruel irony of nature, I think,
that right at this time when the
brain is most vulnerable is also
a time when teens are most

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:58.300
likely to experiment with drugs
or alcohol.
If they're doing drugs or
alcohol that evening, it may not

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:08.360
just be affecting their brains
for that night or even for that
weekend, but for the next 80
years of their life.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:20.060
>> Sullenous, boredom, one-word
answers, the misery, you know.
It always looks a lot more
humorous to us in retrospect.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.160
(<i> carnival music playing</i> )

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:30.900
>> NARRATOR: At the old carousel
in Riverside, Rhode Island,
Brittany Husnander and her
friend Leah Crowell ride around

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:38.700
just as they did when they were
kids.
But now the thrills are
elsewhere.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.760
>> So what happened last night?
Did you guys, like, kiss or
anything?
>> Nope.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.630
>> Why not?
>> 'Cause.
>> 'Cause why?
>> I don't know if I want to.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:51.360
>> Why not?
>> I don't know.
>> Okay.
(<i> laughs</i> )

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.260
How come you wouldn't give him
an answer, Leah?
I want you to go out with him.
>> Then why do you make it so

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:04.100
complicated?
>> There's nothing to do in
Riverside; it's so boring.
We don't.. we just walk around.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.230
That's all we ever do is, like,
walk around or, like... I don't
know.
We barely do anything.

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.230
We go to the beach sometimes.
Sometimes we go to the mall.
Sometimes we go to the movies.
But pretty much all we do is sit

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:22.300
around and just, like, talk or
go in the pool or whatever.
It's boring.
>> NARRATOR: Brittany can change

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:28.930
from fed-up teen to focused
artist very quickly.
She's a good student with many
talents and a lot of support

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:37.630
from the teen expert in her
house, her mother, Beverley.
>> They're trying to make the
best way they can.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:42.830
They're trying to put the pieces
together the best way they know
how.
And on top of it all, they're

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:48.360
going through this hormone thing
and peer pressure and all this
other stuff.
>> NARRATOR: Bev is sympathetic

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.060
to the ups and downs of teenage
life.
She is easy about Brittany's
swings in mood, able to tolerate

00:20:54.060 --> 00:21:01.100
a lot of teenage angst.
>> Now she's aggravated.
Can't do nothing right these
last few days.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:09.300
I wonder whose fault that is.
God bless the guy who's willing
to take her on because he's
going to have to be a very open

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:17.160
and comfortable person with
females, rather than being
intimidated by them.
>> No, he didn't!

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.160
>> NARRATOR: Brittany's not
going to be intimidated by her
brother, Brandon.
>> All right!

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.100
You're not going to deny that
they fought with me, too.
So why aren't you mad at them?
That's why I get mad at Leah.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:33.260
I don't get mad at you because
Leah always sits in your room
with you and follows you guys
and talks to you guys.

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.860
I don't get mad at you; I get
mad at Leah.
So why are you mad at me?
Get mad at your friends!

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.700
Tell your friends to stay the
(<i> bleep</i> ) away from me.
>> Did I say anything?
Did I say, "No, you couldn't sit

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.000
here"?
>> I swear to God, I'm never
talking to any of your friends
again.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.660
I'll never talk to you again, I
swear to God!
>> You don't have to stop
talking to us.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:53.960
You can talk!
>> Brandon, what, am I not
supposed to live in my own
house?

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.460
They're here more than I am!
>> You live on Mike!
>> I swear to God, I'll be like,
"Mike, you need to move.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.860
I live here and there's no other
seats on the couch, so I need to
lay down.
Get up."

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.500
>> You don't see me doing it to
your friends whenever someone
goes, "Want to go to
Buccaneers?"

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.160
You don't see me going, "Yeah,
I'll go with you.
I'll take the walk.
Oh, man, let's go."

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:17.030
>> All right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
>> NARRATOR: Bev Husnander

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:22.400
remains unperturbed.
She knows it could all pass in a
moment.
>> Give me a hug.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.200
You need to hug me.
I hugged you.
>> Okay, that's good enough.
>> No, give me a hug.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:31.100
Give me a hug.
Thank you.
(<i> laughs</i> )
>> We think that the dramatic

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:38.260
changes in mood-- for example, a
child having an outburst at one
moment and then being very calm
and happy the next-- is due in

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:44.160
part to changes in hormones,
because we know that as a child
enters puberty, these changes in
mood are much more dramatic.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.800
And as a year or two after
puberty has begun, things level
down a little bit.
But we think the ultimate

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.600
responsibility for regulating
these mood changes resides in
the frontal cortex, and that's
what's overseeing this whole

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.030
operation.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:07.200
>> NARRATOR: Jim Borgman, a
parent himself, recalls his own
teenage mood swings with great
clarity.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:18.060
>> Remembering those years and
how they felt and how insecure
we were and how vulnerable we
felt and the sadness and the

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:25.060
loneliness and the confusion and
the isolation.
The strip is intended to be
funny, and I hope it is, but

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:33.460
there has to always be that
underlying layer of, you know,
the sudden touch you have as a
teenager with the deep well of

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:37.100
human experience.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:24:02.800
>> NARRATOR: Nicole Ellis often
feels vulnerable, but today the
picture she's trying to portray
is of the self-assured Nicole,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.500
the one who is running for
student council at a Toronto
high school.
>> I've been attending this

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.330
school for the past years and
noticed the lack of interest
taken to make the school more
exciting.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.530
That's why I am running for
social convenor.
One of the things I'd like to
bring back is our school dance.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:22.230
>> NARRATOR: Today the students
will give her a vote of
confidence.
>> It's your school; embrace it.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:29.330
Thank you.
(<i> cheers and applause</i> )
>> NARRATOR: But for a teenager,
confidence is something clutched

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:36.830
at, seldom held.
>> One hour I could be really
happy and laughing, and the next
hour I am just really, really

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:44.730
upset.
Then there could be one whole
day I'm fine; then two days
later I'm just mad.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:54.330
>> NARRATOR: Nikki lives with
her mother and two brothers.
Her mother, Gayle, knows the
turbulence of the teenage years.

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:59.660
>> I know her moods.
I know when something is
bothering her.
I know when she feels she

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:05.400
doesn't want to talk.
And I know when it is the time
to just leave her alone, and I
also know when there's a time to

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:14.300
find out and find out what's
bothering her ASAP.
I sort of have to feel her out.
>> Sometimes I just don't feel

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:20.860
like talking, period, and she
knows.
She knows that, so...
>> Like, are you feeling angry

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.600
inside, confused, what?
That's what she wants to...
>> I don't even know.
Sometimes I don't even know.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.930
>> Sometimes she doesn't know.
>> Sometimes I don't even know
why I'm upset; I'm just upset.
>> She comes to me sometimes,

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.760
she says, "Mom, I feel like
crying."
So I sit down, put my arms
around her, let her cry.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:40.900
>> The recent work on brain
development, in my mind,
enormously helps explain things
that we've known for some time

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:47.100
in child development.
So people who've studied
adolescence for many years have
pointed to these changes in

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:52.400
behavior that we've been
describing, these changes in
mood and fluctuations in mood
and the like, without quite

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:58.960
being able to pinpoint what was
responsible for those changes.
And now I think we have a much
better handle on that, and I

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.760
think my argument would be that
it's the changes going on in the
frontal cortex that gradually
give the child the ability to

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:10.530
regulate those powerful
emotions, solve problems more
effectively, to be more planful
in their behavior.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:17.760
So what's really new here is our
ability to explain the child
development work that we've
known about for quite some time.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:43.500
>> I find that the quickest way
to get shut out is to ask
questions about things that
you're not welcome to know or to

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:51.300
share.
So for me as a parent, it has
always been more a matter of
waiting for the oyster to open

00:26:51.300 --> 00:27:02.630
and being present when it does.
>> NARRATOR: Dr. Deborah
Yurgelun-Todd and her associate
Staci Gruber are scanning the

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:09.260
brains of teenagers to see how
they read emotion.
The small but intriguing study
at McLean Hospital near Boston

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:18.300
is mapping differences between
the brains of adults and teens.
>> I came to this research with
the assumption that the teenager

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:26.300
was going to look a lot like an
adult.
In fact, I assumed that the 13-
year-old brain would respond

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:32.560
quite similarly to the adult
brain in terms of the kinds of
tasks that we were asking them
to do when they were in the

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:40.360
magnet.
>> NARRATOR: To explore this,
Todd put teenage and adult
volunteers through an MRI and

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:45.000
monitored how their brains
responded to a series of
pictures.
>> Here we go.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.630
Ready?
Ready.
(<i> electronic pulsing sound</i> )
>> NARRATOR: The volunteers were

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:58.960
asked to discern the emotion on
these faces.
The results were surprising.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:06.800
>> Well, one of the interesting
things about the findings are
that they suggest that the
teenagers are not able to

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:14.460
correctly read all the feelings
in the adult face.
>> NARRATOR: All the adults
identified this emotion as fear,

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:20.630
but the teenagers invariably saw
something different.
>> Patrick, how are you doing?
>><i> Fine.</i>

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:29.600
>> Tell me about those faces?
What were those faces feeling?
>><i> A lot of them are shock or</i>
<i>angry and...</i>

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:38.130
<i>I think that was it.</i>
>> Okay, shocked and angry.
>><i> Yeah.</i>
>> Okay, thank you.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:45.530
>> They see anger when there
isn't anger, or sadness when
there isn't sadness.
And if that's the case, then

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:51.930
clearly their own behavior is
not going to match that of the
adult.
So you'll see a miscommunication

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:59.030
both in terms of what they think
the adult is feeling, but also
and then what the response
should be to that.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:05.400
>> NARRATOR: The reason for
this, she believes, is that
teenagers use a different part
of the brain to assess the

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:13.800
emotion on people's faces.
>> This is a really nice picture
highlighting the fact that in an
adolescent brain, the relative

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:20.560
activation of the prefrontal
region, or this anterior front
part of the brain, is less than
it is in the adults.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:28.830
But in contrast to that, the
more emotional region, or that
gut-response region, has more
activation compared to the

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:35.230
adult, so that the relationship
between these two regions is
very different.
And we think that that's been a

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:41.730
very important finding in terms
of understanding adolescent
behavior.
>> NARRATOR: At Nikki Ellis's

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:47.960
high school, students often feel
that they are the ones who are
misunderstood-- not the other
way around-- with some

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:55.000
exceptions.
>> When you're looking on the
border and see you as central,
how does your family factor into

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.500
your life?
I would like a picture of you.
(<i> laughter</i> )
I don't want a mug shot.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:07.500
I want a picture, okay?
>> NARRATOR: Patrick Knight is a
popular teacher, often acting as
a bridge between the students

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:17.400
and adults.
We asked Knight to gather a
group of his students to find
out what's on their minds.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.730
>> What's a stereotype that's
placed upon teenagers shoulders
that bothers you?
>> That no matter what they're

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.830
doing, they're always causing
trouble.
Everything they do will end up
causing trouble in some way.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:32.760
>> Young and stupid.
>> Yeah.
>> Just that they think we're
all liars.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:39.300
They think... yeah, I think...
Not even that we're liars.
People, a lot of them, adults
think we're dumb.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:43.900
That we don't know anything.
No, but not even that.
Remember, you can be just
walking... I've been standing

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:49.730
beside adults... I've stood
beside adults, and there could
be just a girl or a guy walking,
they don't look any way-- the

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:55.300
guy doesn't have no bandanas or
nothing-- and they'll just, "Oh,
look at them.
I don't know why teens love to

00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:00.730
walk the street."
>> My dad thinks that, like, I
drink and I cause trouble.
He thinks I'm always looking for

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:07.200
ruckus and stuff.
That's not true.
>> The funniest thing, though,
is just, like, they think that

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.560
we're dumb and that we're
whatever.
And then some of these people
that have that attitude-- and

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.330
they've even said stuff to me
and some people-- they are the
biggest hypocrites I've ever
seen.

00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:21.760
I was just like, "Okay, like, be
quiet," you know.
Like, "Look at yourself and then
fix yourself up before you judge

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:27.300
me."
>> The teenager is not going to
take the information that is in
the outside world and organize

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:34.160
it and understand it the same
way we do.
>> I'll just be sitting at home
watching TV, and my mom will

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:40.760
say, "Did you do that for me?"
I'll be like, "Oops, I forgot.
Sorry."
"You didn't forget.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:44.330
You<i> chose</i> not to do it."
>> Exactly.
(<i> laughter</i> )
>> Yeah.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:50.600
>> "You chose.
You decided that you did not
want to do that, because if you
wanted to do it, then you'd have

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.460
done it right away."
>> My mom, she'll say, "Oh, but
you didn't forget to roam the
street.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:59.430
You didn't forget to go...
Oh..."
>> Exactly, exactly.
>> In terms of interactions at

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:04.630
the dinner table or on the
weekend or doing chores or doing
homework, it means that whatever
communication, whatever

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:11.000
conversation you have with them,
if you're assuming they
understood everything you said,
they may not have or they may

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:19.630
have understood it differently.
>> NARRATOR: The new ways of
looking at the brain point
scientists like Jay Giedd to a

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:27.500
different understanding of how
it works.
>> The cerebellum in the back of
the brain is the part of the

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:34.200
brain that changes most during
the teen years.
So this part of the brain has
not finished growing well into

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:42.630
the early 20s even.
(<i> music playing</i> )
The cerebellum used to be
thought to be involved in the

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:48.430
coordination of our muscles.
But we now know it's also
involved in coordination of our
thinking processes.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:54.160
And just like one can be
physically clumsy, one can be
kind of mentally clumsy.
And this ability to smooth out

00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:00.760
all the different intellectual
processes, to navigate the
complicated social life of the
teen and to get through these

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:06.760
things smoothly and gracefully
instead of lurching through
adolescence seems to be a
function of the cerebellum.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:17.360
As a society we're less active
than we ever have been in the
history of humanity.
We're good with our thumbs and

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:24.160
video games and such, but as far
as actual physical activity--
running, jumping, playing--
children are doing less and less

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:29.960
of that.
The recess and play seem to be
the first thing that is cut out
of school curriculums in tight

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:35.900
times.
But those actually may be as
important or maybe even more
important than some of the

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.000
academic subjects that the
children are doing.

00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.960
>> Often the hallmark of
recognizing that your kid has
become a teenager, after they
say something like, "I hate you,

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:08.100
Dad" or "I hate you, Mom," is
that suddenly they find
themselves sleeping until 11:00
in the morning, which they never

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:13.360
did before.
>> We're going to review this.
White House...
>> NARRATOR: First period is

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.930
just wrapping up in this ninth
grade English classroom.
>> We haven't done this, so
nobody has this yet.

00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:26.060
Okay, this is the last story.
>> NARRATOR: The teacher is wide
awake, trying to inject a little
life into his students.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:32.500
>> Number 12, okay, prodigious:
wonderful, of great size.
A lot of people got that mixed
up with poignant.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:39.230
All right, prodigious, if we're
going to be technical.
Okay, prodigious.
>> What you see in the classroom

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:49.530
is a sea of sleepy faces and
drool on their notebooks and so
forth.
When we bring those kids into

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:56.360
the laboratory, what we see is a
phenomenon that's of a lot of
concern for us.
They start to look as if they

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:07.360
have a major sleep disorder.
>> NARRATOR: At a sleep lab in
Rhode Island, director Mary
Carskadon has become a world

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:13.430
expert on adolescents and how
they sleep.
She is disturbed by what her
studies show-- that most teens

00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:19.600
are getting an average seven and
a half hours a night.
>> When you put that in the
context of what they need to be

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:27.760
optimally alert, which is nine
and a quarter hours of sleep,
it's clear that they're building
huge, huge sleep debts night

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:36.100
after night after night.
With all of the things that
teenagers have available to
them, from televisions and

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:44.830
telephones and computers, their
sleep has been shoved into an
ever-narrowing window.
Fundamentally, the issue is

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:51.130
they're not filling up their
tank at night, and so they're
starting the day with an empty
tank.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:57.500
>> Okay, guys, I want to know
how many people had a problem
this morning getting out of bed?
All of you guys?

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:03.500
>> It's hard to get up because
sometimes my brother and my mom
will come wake me up, and like,
it will take... you know,

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:10.300
they'll have to come 15 times
before I actually get up.
>> What's interesting is there's
another part of their brain

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:18.060
that's the biological timing
system, or the circadian clock,
that actually helps to prop them
up at the end of the day.

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:25.530
>> NARRATOR: The circadian clock
shifts forward as children
become teenagers.
>> I'm so used to staying up so

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:31.000
late and everything; I just
can't fall asleep.
>> Like, 12:00 to, like, 1:00,
sometimes 2:00.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.430
>> Why do you go to bed so late?
>> A whole bunch of stuff.
I can't sleep most of the time.
>> When they start the day with

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:43.760
the empty tank and there's no
biological clock helping them in
the morning, they really should
be home in bed sleeping, not

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:52.160
sleeping in the classroom.
>> I'm not a morning person at
all, not at all.
Like, when I get on the bus, I

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:58.530
don't even remember what happens
at home.
It's just like, blah, like
just...

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:04.800
It's all a big blur.
So, like, when they say I'm
grounded when I get home, I
don't remember what I did in the

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:13.560
morning.
>> The teenagers are really put
in a kind of a gray cloud when
they aren't having enough sleep.

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:23.530
It affects both their mood and
their ability to think and their
ability to perform and react
appropriately.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:31.330
>> You're on again.
>> NARRATOR: Professor Carlyle
Smith at Trent University in
Canada specializes in sleep and

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:36.700
learning.
We asked Dr. Smith to run both
Nicole and Charlie through a
series of sleep studies.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:46.830
>> Go.
>> NARRATOR: Both teens will
perform certain tasks, go to
sleep for the night, and come

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:52.360
back three days later to repeat
them.
It doesn't matter what skills
they have coming into the test.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:38:00.430
It will simply measure, under
various amounts of sleep,
whether they will improve their
skills.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.760
>> 15:04:7.
>> Mmm.
Almost half the time.
>> You were on there half the

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:12.700
time.
That's pretty good.
Go.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:20.400
>> NARRATOR: The exercises are
designed to get the brain
learning something new.
>> Stop.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.560
See what you got here?
Better than Charlie on his first
trial.
(<i> Nicole laughs</i> )

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:33.430
Just a minute.
>> NARRATOR: This test is a real
brainteaser.
It's like learning an equation

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:40.200
in math.
Not only does Charlie have to
trace something upside down, he
must visualize the task in his

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:48.560
brain and work from that
picture.
>> Can't get out of this thing.
>> The special worry with

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:53.530
teenagers is that they are
learning a tremendous amount and
trying to keep up with their
peers and so on.

00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:58.230
They're often stretching almost
to the limit of what they can
do.
And sleeping in is one of the

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:13.500
best ways that they can do to
sort of stay abreast of what's
going on.
And let them do it.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:18.100
>> Yeah, who makes the beds?
>> I do.
>> Can you make mine again?
>> Yeah, I'll make it up for

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.600
you.
Did you mess it up?
>> No, it was just from
everybody being in it.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.130
>> Yeah, I'll make it nice for
you.
>> Hospital corners?
>> No.

00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:30.230
>> No?
>> No, I'll give you lab
corners.
>> NARRATOR: It would seem hard

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:36.360
to go to sleep this way, but
Jeremy Jacob needs to measure
exactly what stage of sleep
Nikki is in.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:43.800
He's particularly interested in
REM, rapid eye movement-- the
time of dreaming and learning.
The same part of the brain that

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:52.800
was working when the teens were
learning their new skills
continues to rehearse and
practice when the students

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:57.900
sleep.
The brain consolidates and
improves on what they have just
learned.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:07.860
In a sense, the lessons are
effortless, happening while they
sleep.
>> The best predictor of how

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:14.630
well someone is going to do-- be
they at Harvard or wherever-- is
not their SAT scores or anything
else.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:20.660
It's whether or not they got a
good night's sleep.
And then up again to two.
>> NARRATOR: Three days later

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:28.260
the teens are back.
>> Charlie and Nicole, one of
you got a normal night of sleep,
almost.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:34.560
What normally happens is you
start off with what's called a
little stage one, and you go to
two, three, four.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:39.830
Nicole, she got 105 minutes of
REM sleep.
That's quite a bit.
Charlie, on the other hand, you

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:45.260
only got 44 minutes.
You got less than half of what
she got.
So you're a little short on REM

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:52.660
sleep.
And as it turns out, that's
going to be pretty important as
to what happened to your tests.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.400
>> NARRATOR: Smith had purposely
arranged for Charlie to have
less sleep.
Now after retesting the two

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:07.260
students, the evidence is clear
about how important sleep is to
learning.
>> You improved by 6% on the

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:13.260
ball and cup.
>> I improved?
>> You improved by 6%.
>> I did?

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:20.030
I thought I did crappy.
>> No, you improved by 6%.
But Nicole improved 11%.
We're looking at your degree of

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:24.960
improvement.
In terms of improvement, you
didn't improve as much as Nicole
did.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.000
So she was over double what you
had.
Now, then, the mirror trace.
This we think requires REM

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:40.000
sleep.
Nicole, who got lots of REM
sleep, she improved 44%.
And you, Charlie, you were worse

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.130
by 10%.
I can't tell you any more
clearly, having a good night's
sleep will give you more of an

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:49.560
advantage than anything else you
can do.
Now, you can relearn this stuff,
but you're going to run out of

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.300
time.
Every day you say, "Well, I'll
catch up."
But while you're catching up,

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:59.760
Nicole is busy going ahead.
I think maybe you should go to
bed now.
(<i> laughs</i> )

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.760
>> NARRATOR: In response to the
studies that show many teenagers
are sleep-deprived, a number of
school districts across the

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:17.400
country have changed their
school start times.
In Minneapolis, high schools
start over an hour later than

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:24.060
they did five years ago.
Trevor Nelson notices a big
change in first-period class.
>> A lot of kids are talking,

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:31.500
awake, you know, smiling.
It's a lot more alert than it
was in middle school.
>> What we found as a result of

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:37.660
the later school time is the
students were attending classes.
They were more alert in class.
They're reporting... they're

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:43.630
reporting themselves being more
alert.
They're staying with the
discussion, with the teacher.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:50.960
They're raising their hand.
They're being engaged as
learners instead of struggling
just to stay awake and... or

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:58.530
passively sitting there.
>> NARRATOR: Wahlstrom's recent
report on the Minneapolis school
experiment meant attendance was

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:04.230
up, but there was a downside,
particularly for middle school
students who now start two hours
later.

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:10.960
>> I think it's really hurt
after-school programs.
Occasionally I'll leave school
at 4:30 and I'll see students

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:18.930
leaving the building, and
then...  at middle schools.
And I think, "You have no time
to go have any kind of after-

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:23.400
school activities, including
tutoring or sports or anything,
before you need to be home and
having dinner with your

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.230
families," which is an important
time as well.
And I... you know, there's...
For every study that says kids

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:33.600
do better with a late start
times academically, there's
studies that say kids do better
when they're involved in

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:39.730
activities and sports and choirs
and drama and all those things.
And so I think it's limited the
amount of kids that can be

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:46.300
involved in that kind of stuff.
>> NARRATOR: It's not only
after-school activities that are
affected when school districts

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:53.360
change their start times.
Bus schedules, child care,
everything changes when the
school's start time shifts.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:44:00.760
Even in Rhode Island, where much
of the groundbreaking sleep
research was done, later school
start times have met resistance.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:06.800
>> There have been some other
districts where it's just sort
of blown up in the face of the
schools when they've tried to

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:13.030
delay.
The school is really the heart
of the community and the heart
of these families.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:20.330
And if you do it without any
warning, you know, parents have
structured day care and child
care for the little ones being

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:28.100
provided by the older ones.
I mean, it just can get out of
control.
>> NARRATOR: Applying new

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:34.730
science to public policy has
always been tricky, and nowhere
more so than in areas that
affect children.

00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:41.730
Take, for instance, the debate
over what science has said about
early childhood.
Parents used to be told that

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:47.430
mobiles, Mozart, and lots of
stimulation would make their
babies smarter.
If they didn't do it early,

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:54.260
there wouldn't be a second
chance.
We now know that simply isn't
true.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:45:02.330
>> Brain science has told us
very little about what we can do
to raise our children and raise
our children better.

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:10.930
>> NARRATOR: John Bruer is the
author of a book "The Myth of
the First Three Years."
>> What we really have to be

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:17.060
careful of here is if we're
talking about how fast three-
year-olds learn or what kind of
moral decisions teenagers could

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:27.300
make, the relationships between
the behaviors and the desired
behaviors and the brain
structure is totally unknown.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:35.530
So these... this simple,
popular, newsweekly magazine
idea that adolescents are
difficult because their frontal

00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:43.560
lobes aren't mature is one we
should be very cautious of.
>> NARRATOR: Even Dr. Jay Giedd,
who seems to have penetrated

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:50.430
deep inside the teenage brain,
wonders about the kind of
lessons parents can draw from
his science.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:57.360
>> The more technical and more
advanced the science becomes,
often the more it leads us back
to some very basic tenets.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:04.060
And sometimes it's even
disappointing to people that
with all the science and with
all the advances, the best

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:09.000
advice we can give is things
that our grandmother could have
told us generations ago: to
spend loving, quality time with

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.700
our children.
>> So often what happens in the
United States is that we're on a
pendulum.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:22.600
We go from saying this is good
to this is bad, and then we say
what was bad becomes good.
>> NARRATOR: Ellen Galinsky is a

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:29.230
social scientist and the
president of the Families and
Work Institute.
She has seen scientific fads

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:36.700
come and go, but she says her
research for a book about
children shows there are
enduring lessons for parents.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:43.530
>> Even though the public
perception is about building
bigger and better brains, what
the research shows is that it's

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:50.730
the relationships, it's the
connections, it's the people in
children's lives who make the
biggest difference.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:57.260
>> A lot of times older kids,
they seem to break away from
their parents a little bit.
It's like a feeling of freedom

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:02.230
or something.
And then they find that when
they get into a problem, they
want their parents' help, but

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:08.100
they don't want to, you know,
outright ask their parents.
>> You'd really like them just
to step in and say, "Hey, you

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.260
know, you don't seem too, you
know, happy today.
Is everything okay?"
Because sometimes-- I don't

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:17.600
know-- I have trouble asking,
you know, expressing my feelings
if someone doesn't come up and
ask first.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:24.060
>> It's a surprise to me and
it's a surprise to every group
of parents or teachers with whom
I speak, is that kids are

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:28.860
actually yearning, teens are
yearning for more time with
their parents.
>> From since I was younger, she

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:35.000
was always there for me.
Whenever anything happened, it's
her; she's there.
Anything went down, you know,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.860
when I'm feeling sad, whatever,
it doesn't matter when it is.
She's the type of person who'll
always makes sure you're fine.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:46.230
Bye, Mom.
>> Bye, Nic.
See you later.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:55.600
>> NARRATOR: Gayle Jarvis works
two jobs.
Every afternoon she heads out
for the evening shift, leaving

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:02.260
three kids behind.
Yet even though Gayle has to
spend a great deal of time away
from her children, they feel her

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:08.530
presence.
>> She's, like, always calling
from work.
I mean, she works till, like...

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.530
You've been to my house.
You've heard how much my mom
calls.
>> Her mom calls her just for

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:17.060
not eating food.
>> Okay, my mom, she's the way
that she has to make sure that
when we get up, you know...

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.230
when we come home, she finds out
how was our day.
As soon as we come... like, she
knows the time we come home--

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:24.960
ring, ring, ring.
(<i> phone rings</i> )
I'll bet you it's Mom.
>> Want to bet?

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:28.860
>> Bet you.
>> Okay.
>> Hello?
>><i> Hey.</i>

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:32.800
>> Hi, Mom.
>><i> What's up?</i>
>> What did I say?
>><i> Did Rodney come?</i>

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.000
>> Yeah, we had to leave early.
He said he had to go straight to
work, so he said to say sorry.
>><i> Let me speak to her.</i>

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.960
>> Hold on.
>> Hi, Mom.
>><i> Hi, hon.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:45.230
>> Nothing.
>> You have to be careful with
kids.
It's the time when you push them

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:53.530
off, that's the time when they
really need to... to be heard.
So you have to be very, very
careful because it's easy to

00:48:53.530 --> 00:49:00.700
say, "Okay, call me later
maybe," you know, "We'll talk
later," but then later might be
a couple of minutes too late.

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:06.630
So you don't take that chance.
>> I hate how everyone says
that.
"Was that how it was when you

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:12.560
were younger?"
>> NARRATOR: Bev Husnander
spends a lot of time listening
to what's on the minds of her

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:17.960
kids.
Here she let us set up a camera
to observe a typical evening
with Brittany and her friend

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:22.560
Leah.
>> He's been suspended, like, a
hundred times, so he finally
quit school because he got... he

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.930
was never in school anyway
because he was suspended so many
times.
>> For what reason?

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:30.160
>> She went to class like
normal, she was just a little
out of it.
>> She just couldn't walk.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:34.660
And then she passed out next to
the toilet.
>> So they just won't listen to
us no matter how hard we try, so

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:40.830
we have to suck it up, and...
>> And the name of my six-page
report was "How to help our
children in this 'me first'

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:47.560
culture."
Whatever that means.
>> I just wanted to be open.
I wanted them to be able to talk

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:59.760
back to me about anything and
not feel that they were going to
be reprimanded or thought
foolish or insignificant, or

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:05.100
they didn't know what they were
talking about because they were
children or because they were
kids.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:13.830
I think kids are a lot smarter
and a lot in tuned to what's
going on than their parents ever
give them credit for.

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:19.400
>> Growing up, one of the things
I hated-- or even when I was an
adult in certain situations-- I
hated that feeling of when I got

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:25.330
home I know there was going to
be something that was going to
upset the apple cart, and that
feeling you get in the pit of

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:32.300
your stomach.
And I don't ever want them to
have that.
>> NARRATOR: Charlie O'Donnell

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:39.830
regards his mom as a good sport.
>> Ah!
>> NARRATOR: But he's still
continuously battling for more

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.260
independence.
>> I'm going to go to the air
force after high school, and
then I'll get my college paid

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:50.560
for, then go to college.
Doesn't really matter where.
I just want to get out of the
house.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:58.800
I want to live in a dorm.
No parents' rules.
I'd have to set them for myself.
(<i> laughter</i> )

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:17.800
>> Separation is the whole job
of teenagers.
And as parents, what we would
say we want, what we truly want

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:27.430
in our hearts is to launch them
into rich, independent, textured
lives of their own.
And so in the teenage years,

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:33.560
here we get it, and it doesn't
always feel the way we thought
it would.
I have a friend who says that

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:42.000
teenagers plant their feet
firmly on your chest and launch
themselves off into their own
life.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.860
And that's just how it feels
usually.
(<i> laughs</i> )
>> So I went back and I asked

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:54.460
teens, and they said, "Well,
yeah, we are pushing our parents
away because it's really hard
for us to come out and say, 'I

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.660
need you.'"
It makes them feel young, or,
you know, they want us to be
mind readers.

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.930
Okay, well, we can't be mind
readers.
But what they said is, "Hang in
there.

00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:09.630
If we push you away, yeah, we
still want you, so hang in
there."
When you ask children whom they

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:14.830
admire, they often talk about
their parents.
If they have a good
relationship, they talk about

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:18.760
their parents.
>> I tell my mom mostly
everything.
Like, I don't tell her guy

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:22.700
things.
But, like, I tell her mostly
everything, like, about my
friends and everything.

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:31.200
I trust my mom with everything.
>> I admire my mom because she's
been raising me and my sister by
herself.

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:37.100
And she's... if you know me and
my sister, you know that she's
done a good job.
>> I think you can put more

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:40.760
trust in your mom than you can
in anybody else.
And I have no shame in saying I
love my mom.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.930
My mom can be clear down the
hall and I'll bellow, "Hi, Mom,
I love you," just like that.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:54.130
>> I got the golden ring!
