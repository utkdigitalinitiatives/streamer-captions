00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.870
IN THE YEAR 2000 THE
BBC STARTED TO

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.300
RECORD THE LIVES
OF OF 25 CHILDREN.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.330
THEIR FAMILIES COME FROM ALL
OVER THE UNITED KINGDOM

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.300
AND ALL WALKS OF LIFE.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.170
HOW WILL THEIR PARENTS
INFLUENCE THEIR LIVES?

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.930
AND HOW WILL THEIR GENES AND
THEIR ENVIRONMENT COMBINE

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.670
TO FORM THEIR PERSONALITY?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.470
THIS HUGE PROJECT WILL
LAST FOR TWENTY YEARS.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.430
FOLLOWING THESE
CHILDREN AS THEY GROW,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.170
TO FIND OUT WHAT
MAKES US WHO WE ARE.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.630
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.100
OUCH.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:13.270
NEITHER ARE CHILDREN,
NOR THEIR PARENTS.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.000
MOM!

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.430
HOW SIX ARE STARTING TO FEEL
THE INFLUENCE OF A WIDER WORLD.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.900
HOW DO WE WORK OUT
WHAT'S RIGHT OR WRONG,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.670
GOOD OR BAD?

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.930
&nbsp WHAT'S THE VERY WORST THING
&nbsp ANYONE CAN DO?

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.530
STEALING PEOPLES'
BAGS AND PURSES.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.630
PAINT WINDOWS.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.930
ROB.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.570
KILL PEOPLE WITH GUNS.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:51.030
THE EXTREMES ARE ONE THING,
BUT WHAT ABOUT EVERYDAY LIFE?

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.300
WHERE DO WE GET
OUR VALUES FROM?

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.900
OUR PARENTS?

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.600
OR SOMEWHERE ELSE?

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.500
&nbsp YOU HURT HIS
&nbsp MOUTH, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.400
&nbsp SORRY.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.870
WHO SETS THE RULES?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.770
DADDY.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.900
MOMMY.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.570
MOMMY AND DADDY.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.670
MY CLASS MAKES RULES.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.130
THE HEADMASTER.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.530
THEY WON'T YELL AT ME.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.270
ME! ME! ME!

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.430
SO WHICH RULES ARE PERMANENT
AND WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY BEND?

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.800
WHAT VALUES DO WE WANT TO
PASS ON TO OUR CHILDREN

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.930
AND WHAT ARE THEY
ACTUALLY PICKING UP?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.000
AND IS THERE ANYTHING THAT
WE ALL STILL ALL BELIEVE IN?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.100
TO BE CONFIDENT ABOUT
JUDGING RIGHT AND WRONG,

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.800
YOU NEED TO HAVE LEARNED ONE OF
LIFE'S IMPORTANT LESSONS.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.170
WHICH IS WORSE - BREAKING
ONE GLASS ON PURPOSE

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.670
OR SIX BY ACCIDENT?

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.270
WHAT YOU MEAN TO
DO CAN MATTER.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:06.100
SOMETIMES MORE
THAN WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.730
CAUSE HE DID IT ON PURPOSE.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.870
ON PURPOSE.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.070
ON PURPOSE.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.930
HE MEANT TO BRAKE SOMETHING.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.070
&nbspAND WHAT DO YOU THINK
 &nbspHIS PUNISHMENT SHOULD BEE?

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.530
GROUNDED.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.370
&nbspFOR HOW LONG??

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.430
FOR 600 WEEKS.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.900
SOME ARE LATER TO
GRASP THIS THAN OTHERS.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.270
BUT HE DROPPED MORE
GLASSES THAN THE OTHER ONE.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.130
THIS NEW INSIGHT MEANS
OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.400
THE ADULTS AROUND THEM
TO LEARN HOW THEY

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.330
SHOULD LIVE THEIR LIVES.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.930
AND THEY'RE SEEING SOME
VERY DIFFERENT LESSONS.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.470
ALONG THE THAMES ESTUARY ON
THE EDGE OF LONDON IS ERITH.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.870
IT'S IN THE LOWEST 20 PERCENT
OF DEPRIVED WARDS IN ENGLAND.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.470
AND IT'S WHERE ONE
OF OUR CHILDREN

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.230
HAS SPENT ALL HER LIFE.

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.170
I'M CHARLIE PLASTER!

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.870
CHARLIE IS THE OLDEST
IN THE PLASTER FAMILY.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.470
THAT'S MOMMY, CAYLA AND DADDY.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.100
SHE LIVES WITH HER
MOM TONI, DAD ROB,

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.170
SISTER CAYLA AND NEW
BABY BROTHER ALEX.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.630
LIKE ANY OTHER, THE
FAMILY HAS ITS RULES.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.030
DINNER IS TO BE AT THE TABLE.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.730
ALWAYS SAY
PLEASE AND THANK YOU.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.000
BEDTIME 7 O'CLOCK.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.030
I'M NOT TELLING FIBS!

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.770
ALTHOUGH CHARLIE DOESN'T
ALWAYS CHOOSE TO OBEY THEM.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:36.870
COME UPSTAIRS NOW!

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:37.970
NO!

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.100
ONE, TWO ,THREE!

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.900
CHILDREN AND PARENTS DON'T
ALWAYS AGREE ON WHAT'S RIGHT

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.270
AND WHAT'S WRONG.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.570
I'VE ALWAYS BIN TAUGHT
IF SOMEONE HITS YOU,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.400
YOU HIT THEM BACK.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.030
AND MY MOM'S
ALWAYS GOING TO ME,

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.770
IF YOU DON'T HIT THEM BACK,
I'LL DRIVE YOU UP THERE OR

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:58.900
I'LL BEAT YOU MYSELF.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.730
SO I'M LIKE ALRIGHT GREAT.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.500
WHEN CHARLIE COMES HOME,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.270
SHE'S ALL SO AND SO'S
BEEN HORRIBLE TO ME

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.530
AND I'M ALL WELL
JUST HIT HIM.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.800
HIT HIM BACK. I SAY TO HER.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.900
SHE'S LIKE NO BECAUSE I'LL GET
IN TROUBLE BY THE TEACHER

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.170
AND I'M LIKE WELL YOU TELL
THE TEACHER YOUR MOM SAID

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.770
HIT HIM BACK IF THEY
HURT ME.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.670
AND SHE'S LIKE NO,
IT'S WRONG.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.770
I'LL GET IN TROUBLE.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.030
WHEN TONI WAS A CHILD,
SHE WAS ALWAYS IN TROUBLE.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.200
WHEN SHE GOT
PREGNANT AT 16,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.770
IT CAME AS NO
SURPRISE TO HER MOM.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.070
SHE WAS A BIT OF A
BOISTEROUS CHILD,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.930
BEING EXCLUDED FROM SCHOOL AND
WHENEVER THERE WAS A FIRE

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.100
OR ANYTHING SHE WAS
THERE IN THE FRONT,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.370
EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.830
I JUST LOVED THE ACTION.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.400
I SAID TO HER ONE DAY
YOU'RE GOING TO GROW UP

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.800
AND HAVE A CHILD
JUST LIKE YOURSELF.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.470
MY MOM WAS TOLD THAT
AND SHE WAS CURSED

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.700
BY MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.100
THE GYPSY CURSE CAUSE
SHE WAS A GYPSY .

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.500
AND SHE CURSED HER WITH GIRLS
AND HER GIRLS WITH GIRLS AND

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.000
HER GIRLS WITH GIRLS AND
THEY'D ALL BE LIKE YOU.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.830
AND PERHAPS I'VE CARRIED IT ON
BY WISHING THE SAME ON TONI.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.630
WHO KNOWS?

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.730
ONLY TIME WILL TELL.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.200
CURSED OR OTHERWISE,
TONI ASSISTED BY HER MOM

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.000
AND GRANDMOTHER, GAVE
BIRTH TO CHARLIE.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.500
CHARLIE'S DAD
WASN'T ON THE SCENE.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.870
BUT THEN SHE GOT TOGETHER
WITH AN OLD FRIEND

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:27.870
AND TONI'S LIFE TOOK
A NEW DIRECTION.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.500
THEY HAD TWO MORE
CHILDREN TOGETHER.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.800
AND TWO YEARS AGO, BOUGHT
THEIR FIRST FAMILY HOME.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.030
COMPLETE WITH THE
FIRST FAMILY PET, NEO.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.670
AND IT'S NEO WHO'S NOW
PROVIDING CHARLIE

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.700
WITH A POWERFUL LESSON
IN RIGHT AND WRONG.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.900
HE'S BEEN DOGNAPPED.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.370
&nbsp WHO'S KEEPING NEO?

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:03.430
A OLD MAN WHO PICKED HIM UP
FROM OUR GARDEN AROUND THERE.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.870
&nbspDO YOU KNOW WHO TOOK HIM?

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.970
NO.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.900
HE WAS SITTING ABOUT HERE AND
SOMEONE OBVIOUSLY BENT OVER

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.400
THE FENCE BECAUSE
ALL THIS IS BROKEN.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.900
I WOULD HAVE RATHER SOMEONE
COME IN THE HOUSE,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.030
TAKEN EVERY BIT OF
GOLD I HAD.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:22.770
YOU KNOW THE TELE, ANYTHING.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.130
YOU KNOW, ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:31.570
IT JUST GOT TO ME TO
THINK THEY GOT OUR DOG.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.000
&nbspIS YOUR MOMMY UPSETT?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.830
SOMETIMES.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.130
&nbspHOW DO YOU KNOW WHEEN
 &nbspYOUR MOMMY'S UPSET?

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:44.370
BECAUSE WHEN DADDY SHOUTS
AT HER, SHE CRIES.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.070
HELLO, SORRY TO
BOTHER YOU, I HAD MY DOG,

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.300
I THINK HE WAS STOLEN...

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.900
WHILE TONI GETS
ON THE PHONE,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.370
CHARLIE IS OUT
LOOKING FOR CLUES.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.400
I FOUND SOMETHING!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.400
IT'S GOING THAT WAY.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.300
&nbsp ANY SIGN?

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.370
NO.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:08.430
WITH NO SIGN OF
NEO IN THE GARDEN,

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:16.730
CHARLIE TAKES THE
SEARCH TO SCHOOL.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:20.200
CHARLIE'S TEACHER TURNS IT TO
A LESSON FOR THE WHOLE CLASS.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.200
&nbspOH, WHAT'S THIS?

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.400
&nbspMY DOGGY.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.870
&nbspYOUR DOGGY.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.530
&nbspLETS HOPE THAT
&nbspYOU FIND HIM.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:30.470
&nbspIS HE A KIND DOG?

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.030
&nbspYES?

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:34.570
MORAL VALUES, CODES,
RULES, BOUNDARIES,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.630
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE IN SOCIETY.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.500
SO WE SET ASIDE THE RULES
THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.730
AND THEN WE SORT OF
TRY AND ENFORCE THEM.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.230
BUT AT HOME THE MESSAGES
CHARLIE'S GETTING ARE LESS

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.830
STRAIGHT FORWARD.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.470
BECAUSE I'M STILL
GROWING UP NOW,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.100
I CHANGE VIEWS EVERY
OTHER DAY SO IT'S HARD

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.930
TO TRY AND SIT THERE AND SAY
THIS IS THIS AND THAT'S THAT,

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.870
BECAUSE I MIGHT FEEL DIFFERENT.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.370
ALTHOUGH I'VE SAID TO
HER THIS IS WHAT YOU DO,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.470
SHE'S GOT HER OWN VIEWS AND
SHE'S GOT HER OWN MIND.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:14.800
AND SHE KNOWS SOMETIMES
I&nbsp AM WRONG YOU KNOW.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.970
OUTSIDE SCHOOL, CHARLIE'S
EXPERIENCE OF RIGHT AND WRONG

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.100
IS FULL OF GREY AREAS.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.970
THAT NIGHT NEO TURNS
UP ON THE DOORSTEP

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.470
WITH A STRANGER
DEMANDING CASH.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.570
THE NEXT DAY TONI IS STILL
UPSET ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.030
SHE SAID IF THEY
GIVE OUR DOG BACK

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.000
THEY WANT MONEY
FOR A NEW DOG.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.070
SO ROB OFFERED HER
FIFTY POUNDS

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.700
AND SHE TOOK IT LIKE
WITHOUT ANYTHING.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.430
BUT I SAID TO HIM IF I FOUND IT,
I WOULDN'T EXPECT A REWARD.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.430
I WOULD BE LIKE THERE'S YOUR
DOG. YOU'VE MISSED HIM.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.600
HAVE YOUR BACK SORT OF THING.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:56.300
AND CHARLIE HAS SEEN FIRST
HAND THAT CRIME SOMETIMES PAYS.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.900
WHEN ROB SAID CAN
WE HAVE OUR DOG BACK?

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.930
AND THEN SHE SAID UM,

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:11.130
IF YOU WANT TO BUY
THIS DOG, PAY FOR IT.

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.030
CHARLIE IS SEEING DIFFERENT
MODELS OF RIGHT AND WRONG

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.330
AT HOME AND AT SCHOOL.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.230
SO WHAT'S SHE PICKING UP?

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.130
AT NEARLY SIX WHAT DO
OUR CHILDREN KNOW ABOUT

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.230
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
RIGHT AND WRONG?

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.930
WE SET THEM A TEST.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.170
WHAT IS WORSE, LEAVING
YOUR ROOM UNTIDY,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:43.100
OR KICKING YOUR
FAMILY PET?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.070
THAT ONE.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:54.630
STEALING SWEETS OR
NOT SAYING THANK YOU?

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.030
MOST OF THE CHILDREN KNEW
THAT KICKING OR STEALING

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.130
WERE WORSE THAN
TALKING IN CLASS

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.630
OR LEAVING YOUR
ROOM UNTIDY.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.700
SCIENTIST THINK THIS
ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.800
WHAT IS MORALLY WRONG FROM WHAT
IS MERELY A SOCIAL CONVENTION

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.600
STARTS WHEN WE ARE
AS YOUNG AS 4.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.270
WHAT ABOUT CHARLIE?

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.570
&nbsp NATASHA NEVER SAYS THANK YOU.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.130
&nbsp GWEN STEALS HER FRIENDS TOY.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.070
&nbsp WHO'S THE NAUGHTIEST?

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.400
&nbsp NATASHA?

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.470
&nbsp WHY?

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.100
BECAUSE SHE
DOESN'T SAY THANK YOU.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.400
&nbsp JOE?

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.630
&nbsp WHY?

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.800
CAUSE.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.770
OUT OF FIVE QUESTIONS
CHARLIE ONLY GOT IT RIGHT

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.270
IN TWO CASES.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.130
SHE SEEMS TO FEEL THAT
MANNERS ARE MORE IMPORTANT

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.770
THAN HITTING OR STEALING.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.800
BUT FOR ONE CHILD THERE
WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.300
I THINK THAT ONE.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.530
&nbsp WHO DO YOU THINK
&nbsp IS THE NAUGHTIEST?

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:57.770
&nbsp WHY?

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.400
BECAUSE SHE KICKS.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.100
SO WHERE DID EVE LEARN
WITH SUCH CERTAINTY

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.730
THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
RIGHT AND WRONG?

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.600
IT'S EASTER IN WORCESTERSHIRE.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.400
EVE SCABOROUGH IS LEADING
HER CLASS UP TO CHURCH

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.470
FOR THEIR EASTER SERVICE.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.170
BUT THERE'S
TEMPTATION IN THE WAY.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.730
THESE LOOK YUMMY DON'T THEY?

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.930
I'M NOT TEMPTED TO EAT THESE,
BUT I AM TEMPTED TO EAT

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:30.100
THAT ONE BUT NOT ALL THOSE
ONES, THE RED ONES.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.970
I AM TEMPTED TO EAT THOSE.

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.530
BUT EVE KNOWS WHAT COULD
HAPPEN IF SHE DOESN'T RESIST.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.100
I MIGHT NOT GO TO HEAVEN

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.670
I MIGHT GO TO THE OTHER
BAD PLACE INSTEAD.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.330
I MIGHT GO THERE.

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:52.000
NOW WHAT DOES THIS MAKE YOU
THINK OF IN THE EASTER STORY?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.330
IT'S NOT JUST FROM
SCHOOL AND CHURCH

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.400
THAT SHE'S PICKED
UP HER VALUES.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.430
MOM CAROLINE AND DAD TIM
BELIEVE THAT PRAYER

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.470
CHANGES LIVES.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.470
SIX YEARS AGO THEY'D GIVEN
UP ALL HOPE OF HAVING A BABY.

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.470
AND THEN CAME EVE.

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.830
IT IS A MIRACLE.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.100
IT IS UNEXPLAINABLE.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:18.330
WHEN SHE WAS BORN IT WAS JUST
SUCH A HAPPY MOMENT YOU KNOW.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.800
I JUST KINDA FELT
LIKE A HERO

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.470
AND I WAS SAUNTERING
ALONG YOU KNOW.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.500
BUT THEN TIM LOST HIS JOB AND
CAROLINE WENT THROUGH SEVERE

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.870
POST NATAL DEPRESSION.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:32.500
PRAYER SAVED THEM AGAIN.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.230
AND THEN GAVE THEM THE
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FOR GOD.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.930
THEY NOW MANAGE A
CHRISTIAN RETREAT CENTER.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.900
AND EVE HAS BEEN BROUGHT
UP TO FIRMLY BELIEVE

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.900
THAT RIGHT WILL
TRIUMPH OVER WRONG.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.900
WE DON'T REALLY MENTION ARE
NEEDS TO ANYBODY.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.400
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE PRAY ABOUT
THEM BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.970
WHO WE ARE AND GOD
DELIVERS EVERY TIME.

00:13:52.970 --> 00:14:00.530
DEAR LORD JESUS THANK
YOU FOR THIS LOVELY DAY.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:06.200
PLEASE DON'T WAIT TO SORT HER
WEE BETTER AMEN.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.370
AMEN.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:14.570
THE SCABOROUGH'S IDEA OF
WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.230
COME DIRECTLY
FROM THEIR FAITH.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.800
MOST THINGS THAT
HAPPEN IN MY LIFE,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.030
I DEEM TO HAVE COME
FAIRLY DIRECT FROM GOD.

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.200
GOODNIGHT.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.500
I LOVE YOU.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.470
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE
GOD IS INVOLVED AND HOPEFULLY

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:29.700
DIRECTING TRAFFIC.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.400
SO IF I SEE SOMEONE IN NEED,
AND I'VE GOT THE THING THAT

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:39.600
THEY NEED, THEN I WOULD
CONSIDER GIVING IT TO THEM.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.400
TIM'S PRINCIPLES ARE
ABOUT TO BE PUT TO THE TEST.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.330
ONE HUNDRED MILES AWAY IN
SUSSEX TIM'S BROTHER ANDREW'S

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.630
KIDNEYS HAVE PACKED UP.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.770
THIS IS MY FISTULA WHICH IS AN
OPERATION I HAD WHEN MY KIDNEY

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:57.100
FIRST FAILED, SO THAT
WAS BACK IN 1985.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.970
SO THESE ARE THE
ACTUAL NEEDLES.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:04.330
SO IT'S A BIT MORE THAN THE
KIND OF NEEDLE YOU USE WHEN

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.530
YOU TAKE BLOOD.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.730
YOU CAN SEE THE SIZE OF IT.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:08.030
&nbspDOES IT HURT?

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.730
IF YOU GET A FRESH
BIT YES IT DOES HURT.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.170
AFTER 15 YEARS OF
DIALYSIS THREE TIMES A WEEK,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.500
HE DESPERATELY NEEDS
A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.300
WE CONNECT UP TO
THE OLD MACHINE.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.770
THIS IS PART OF LIFE.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.700
YOU GOTTA GET ON WITH IT.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.200
YOU CAN ACCEPT IT
AND WORK WITH IT.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.900
THERE IS NOT MUCH
OF AN ALTERNATIVE.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.600
SO YA THIS IS ME
TILL TEA TIME.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.870
OR BEYOND.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.500
BUT THERE IS ONE
POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.100
&nbsp SHOW ME WHERE
&nbsp YOUR KIDNEY IS.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.200
JUST UP HERE.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.400
HOW MANY YOU
GOT THERE?

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.600
I MIGHT ONLY HAVE ONE.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.200
&nbsp I THINK YOU'VE
&nbsp GOT TWO.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.230
WHY?

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:55.470
&nbsp EVERYBODY HAS TWO
&nbsp APART FROM ANDREW.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.870
HE HAS NONE!

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.300
EVE'S DAD TIM HAS
OFFERED TO GIVE ONE

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.800
OF HIS KIDNEYS TO ANDREW.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.300
THEY'VE GOT TO TAKE SOMETHING
THAT HELPS YOU...

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.600
DADDY'S GOT TWO AND HE
HAS TO GIVE ONE AWAY.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:17.730
TIM'S IN LONDON TO CONFIRM
WITH A HETO-SUITABLE DONOR.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.530
APPARENTLY I'M AN EXACT MATCH
AS FAR AS BLOOD IS CONCERNED,

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:23.970
WITH MY BROTHER.

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.730
WHICH MEANS TISSUE TYPING WISE
IT'S FAIRLY LIKELY THAT I'LL

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:32.130
BE A GOOD MATCH OR VERY LIKELY
THAT I'LL BE A GOOD MATCH.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.600
DON'T FOR A MINUTE
UNDERESTIMATE THE SIZE

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.200
OF THE OPERATION.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.900
IT'S A MUCH BIGGER OP
FOR YOU

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.600
THAN IT'S GOING TO
BE FOR ANDREW.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.000
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT WORKING ETC.,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.870
AT ALL UNTIL A GOOD SIX
WEEKS HAVE GONE BY

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:46.270
AND IF IT TAKES
TWELVE WEEKS,

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.370
IT TAKES TWELVE WEEKS.

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:51.830
THE STAKES ARE HIGH
FOR TIM AND HIS FAMILY

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.530
BUT HIS BELIEFS DICTATE
THAT IF HE CAN HELP

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.830
HIS BROTHER, HE SHOULD
WHATEVER THE RISKS.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.770
FOR ME DYING ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT I'M FRIGHTENED OF BECAUSE

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.270
OF MY FAITH, SO I DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT FOR MYSELF

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.570
AS A SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.070
IT'S NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:10.430
OBVIOUSLY THERE IS WIVES
AND DAUGHTERS AND MOMS

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:11.600
TO THINK ABOUT.

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.430
AND BROTHERS I GUESS.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.900
&nbsp ARE YOU WORRIED
&nbsp ABOUT DADDY?

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.930
NO.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:18.270
NOT FAIRLY WORRIED.

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:22.700
&nbsp BUT A LITTLE BIT
&nbsp WORRIED?

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.370
AND SUDDENLY THERE IS
SOMEONE ELSE IN THE FAMILY

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:27.730
TO WORRY ABOUT AS WELL.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.470
I WAS FEELING RATHER
ILL I THINK IN APRIL.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.430
I PUT IT DOWN TO FEELING WEIRD
BECAUSE I'D STARTED THE G.I.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:36.530
DIET AND IT BECAME
EVIDENT THAT IT WASN'T

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.530
THE G.I. DIET AND IN FACT I
WAS EIGHT WEEKS PREGNANT.

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:42.930
IT WAS A LARGE SHOCK
BECAUSE WE WERE TOLD

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.300
THAT WE'D NEVER HAVE CHILDREN
ANYWAY, AND THEN EVE CAME ALONG

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.030
AND WE THOUGHT THAT'S
GREAT YOU KNOW,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:49.970
AND I WAS VERY CONTENT
WITH JUST HAVING HER.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:54.230
SHE WAS ENOUGH AND I GOT
PLANS FOR MY LIFE AND THEN...

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.000
SO IT WAS A HUGE
SHOCK TO BOTH OF US

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
AND A LOT OF
READJUSTMENT.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.800
WE WEREN'T PRAYING FOR IT BUT
EVE WAS SINCE SHE COULD SPEAK.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.530
WE BLAME HER ACTUALLY.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:08.770
I'VE BEEN PRAYING THAT THE
BABY WILL BE A BABY GIRL.

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.070
&nbsp WHY?

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:14.830
BECAUSE I WANT IT TO.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.630
BUT CAROLINE'S
PREGNANCY IS TURNING OUT

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.500
TO BE A VERY ROUGH RIDE.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.430
I JUST VOMIT DAY AND NIGHT
AND THEN I DEVELOPED

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.530
AN IRREGULAR HEART PATTERN
AND GOT ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.470
AND PUT ON BETA BLOCKERS AND
THEY STILL DON'T KNOW WHY.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:31.500
IT'S STILL BEING INVESTIGATED.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.970
EVE'S PARENTS' FAITH MAY
PREVENT THEM FROM WORRYING

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.630
ABOUT DEATH BUT ALL THESE
PROBLEMS ARE GETTING TO EVE.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:39.900
YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE BABY?

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.930
MY MOM SAID THE NURSE SAID
THE BABY'S GONNA BE POORLY

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.730
WHEN IT COMES OUT
OF HER TUMMY.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.300
THAT MEANS SHE'LL
DIE SOON, MY MOM WILL.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.670
YOUR MOM
WOULD DIE?

00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:50.000
SOON.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.170
OH NO.

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.370
IF YOUR MOM
DIES...

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.700
OH NO.

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.170
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TALKING THE BABY WOULD DIE?

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.900
NO THE BABY
MIGHT DIE.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.500
MOMMY MIGHT DIE.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.700
I KNOW ALL ABOUT
BABIES AND THINGS.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.000
ME TOO.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.970
WELL I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT I KNOW.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.770
I KNOW HOW THE
BABY'S GONNA BE BORN.

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:14.800
IT'S GONNA BE
BORN DEAD!

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.330
BUT WHAT DOES SIX YEAR OLDS
THINK HAPPENS WHEN YOU DIE?

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.670
I TURN INTO SKIN AND BONES.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:24.900
YOUR BONES GO IN A BOX.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.200
I WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.700
YOU LIVE WITH GOD.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:36.470
SOMETIMES IF YOUR A KID YOU
GET A LITTLE PICTURE OF YOU.

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:39.270
YOU GO TO
HEAVEN.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.970
YOU GO TO HEAVEN.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.970
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO,
OVER HALF OUR CHILDREN

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.230
WERE SENT TO
SUNDAY SCHOOL.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.200
NOW, IT'S WELL UNDER 5%.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.330
SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT
OUR SIX YEAR OLDS

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.000
ARE GROWING UP IN
GODLESS HOUSEHOLDS?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.770
I DO BELIEVE IN GHOSTS.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.570
YOU'RE ONLY HERE
ONCE SO GO FOR IT.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:01.970
ENJOY IT WHILE YOU CAN.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:02.970
I WILL GO TO HEAVEN.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.300
&nbsp BECAUSE?

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.800
BECAUSE I'M AN ANGEL.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.270
&nbsp WHAT DOES GOD
&nbsp LOOK LIKE?

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.500
HOPEFULLY SOMETHING ATTRACTIVE
AND EASY ON THE EYE.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.330
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE
SPENDING ETERNITY WITH HIM

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.900
AFTER ALL SO..

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.800
BEING JEWISH IS NOT JUST
A RELIGION, IT'S A LIFESTYLE.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.870
IT'S A WAY OF LIFE.

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:22.070
IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.170
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT I'M
A RELIGIOUS PERSON,

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.730
BUT I DO BELIEVE IN KARMA.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:27.800
I DO BELIEVE IN CONSEQUENCES
FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:30.600
I THINK PEOPLES VALUES
HAVE CHANGED IMMENSELY.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.600
I THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT
THEMSELVES AND WHAT I WANT OUT

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.730
OF LIFE WHETHER IT BE
GOOD, BAD OR INDIFFERENT,

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.500
YOU JUST GO FOR
WHAT YOU WANT.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.930
AMBITION IS MARIE
BLAKE'S MANTRA.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.000
IS SHE PASSING IT
ON TO HER FAMILY?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.400
THEY LIVE NEAR
SPAGHETTI JUNCTION

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.770
IN INNER CITY BIRMINGHAM.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:54.430
HER SON TYRESE IS THE ONLY
BOY IN A HOUSE FULL OF FEMALES.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.370
AND HE'S LEARNED TO
STAND UP FOR HIMSELF.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.700
I WANT THIS SONG!

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:04.230
YOU CAN'T RECK THE MACHINE!

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:06.570
IF I SEE HIM A BIT AGGRESSIVE,
I DON'T THINK THAT'S JUST

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.800
A BOY THING BUT HE SEEMS
TO STILL BE A BIT..

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.100
KNOCK PEOPLE OUT
OF THE WAY.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.770
I WANT TO GET PAST,
JUST MOVE KINDA THING.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:21.230
IF HE WANTS SOMETHING THEN HE'S
QUITE DETERMINED TO GET IT.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:23.930
WHICH IS A GOOD THING.

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:26.730
WHAT I WANT HIM TO KNOW
IS, YES BE ASSERTIVE,

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.470
GO FOR WHAT YOU WANT BUT
THERE'S WAYS AND MEANS

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.270
OF DOING IT, WITHOUT
UPSETTING OTHER PEOPLE.

00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.730
WHAT'S HE LIKE AS A BROTHER?

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.230
HE'S A PEST TO MAKE
HIMSELF GET WHAT HE WANTS

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.730
AND HE HAS TO BE THE
CENTER OF ATTENTION

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.930
AND IF HE DON'T GET
HIS, HE CRIES.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:51.000
ANNOYING, RUDE, BAD BEHAVIOR.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.430
HE HAS A BAD REPUTATION.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:59.130
TYRESE HAS HAD A
DIFFICULT FEW YEARS.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.200
HIS MOM ALWAYS FELT THAT
HIS LIFE MIGHT NOT BE EASY.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.300
I THINK TYRESE WILL HAVE
A HARDER TIME COMPARED

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.470
TO SOME OF THE
OTHER CHILDREN.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.630
YES, BECAUSE HE'S BLACK.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.170
BUT ALSO BECAUSE
HE'S A BLACK MALE.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:10.330
THE THING THAT I'M WORRIED
ABOUT IS MORE SO ABOUT HIM

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.830
GETTING INTO
TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE,

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.770
GOING DOWN THE DRUGS ROUTE,
GETTING INTO FIGHTS, GUNS,

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.570
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF IS
WHAT I'M REALLY REALLY

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.400
WORRIED ABOUT.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.070
THAT'S WHY MARIE WANTED
TYRESE TO BE TOUGH MINDED

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:28.200
AND TO GET WHAT HE WANTS
JUST LIKE HIS MOM.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.330
MARIE'S ALWAYS GONE
FOR WHAT SHE WANTS.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.270
TWO YEARS AGO, MARIE DECIDED
TO LEAVE TYRESE'S DAD

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.730
AND SHE AND THE CHILDREN
MOVED HOUSE TWICE.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.470
IT HAS AN EFFECT ON TYRESE.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.130
THE SCHOOL SORT OF ASK ME TO
GO IN AND HAVE A WORD AND THEY

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.100
WERE CONCERNED SAYING THAT
HIS BEHAVIOR AT SCHOOL

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.130
IS BECOMING QUITE BAD.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.230
WHERE HE'S NOT
LISTENING TO ANYTHING

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.230
THAT THERE TELLING
HIM TO DO.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:56.430
WHEN THEY SAY SIT DOWN,
HE WILL STAND UP AND,

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.770
ALWAYS THE OPPOSITE OF
WHAT HE IS BEING TOLD.

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:01.130
HE WOULD WET HIMSELF.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.570
HE WOULD BEAT ANYONE
WHO CAME IN HIS PATH.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.500
HE WOULDN'T DO
WHAT HE WAS TOLD.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:13.470
HE WAS JUST REALLY DEFIANT.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:19.700
A YEAR ON NOT
MUCH HAS CHANGED.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:25.230
I'LL PUT THIS IN
YOUR EYE.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:30.930
TYRESE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS
BUT HE HASN'T YET DEVELOPED

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.830
THE WAYS AND MEANS
TO GET IT.

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.570
YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR EYES
OFF HIM FOR TOO LONG YOU KNOW

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.230
OTHERWISE HE MIGHT BE
INTERFERING WITH SOMEBODY

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.930
ELSE'S WORK OR...

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.770
JUST WHAT THEIR DOING.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:43.770
HE STILL HAS ISSUES WITH
SOCIALIZING WITH THE CHILDREN

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.700
AT TIMES, ALTHOUGH HE IS QUITE
A POPULAR MEMBER OF THE CLASS

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.730
AND THEY DO LIKE TO PLAY WITH
HIM, BUT HE TENDS TO ANNOY THEM

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.600
AT TIMES AND IRRITATE THEM.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.870
BUT WHEN HE'S
PUT ON THE SPOT,

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.270
HE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT HE SHOULD DO.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:02.000
&nbspHOW CAN WE BE
&nbspGOOD IN SCHOOL?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.730
&nbspTYRESE, WHAT DID
&nbspYOU SAY WE COULD DO.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.470
SIT QUIETLY.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:08.500
&nbspWHY DO YOU NEED
&nbspTO SIT QUIETLY?

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.000
SO YOU CAN LISTEN.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.830
&nbspCAN YOU THINK OF ANY
&nbspOTHER ONES TYRESE?

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:17.270
PLAY WITH YOUR
FRIENDS NICELY.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:19.270
THE PLAY NICELY CAN
MEAN DIFFERENT THINGS

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:21.070
TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.870
TYRESE THINKS IT'S HIS
FRIEND MICHAEL'S TURN

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.930
TO HAVE THE SCOOTER.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.770
GIVE IT TO MICHAEL.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.100
CAN WE GIVE IT
TO MICHAEL?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.030
NO, YOU HURT
HIM NOW.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.330
&nbspI'M HAVING THE
&nbspSCOOTER.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.570
&nbspYOU COME
&nbspWITH ME.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.500
TYRESE'S WELL
MEANING INTERVENTION,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.700
HAS LANDED HIM IN TROUBLE.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.130
AND HE HASN'T GOT THE
COMMUNICATION SKILLS

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.230
TO GET HIMSELF OUT OF IT.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.300
&nbsp OKAY LOOK, YOU
&nbsp HURT HIS MOUTH.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.370
&nbsp WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.700
SORRY.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.230
THE ONLY LOSER
HERE IS TYRESE.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.330
BUT CAN HE NEGOTIATE
IN OTHER SITUATIONS?

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.800
WE ASKED OUR PARENTS TO
DELIBERATELY KNOCK OVER THESE

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:11.370
MARBLES AND THEN TO ASK THEIR
CHILDREN NOT TO TELL ON THEM.

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:18.730
DON'T TELL THEM
IT WAS MOMMY OKAY?

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:21.300
LYING ON BEHALF OF OTHER
PEOPLE IS A STAGE OF MORAL

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:25.500
DEVELOPMENT NOT USUALLY
REACHED UNTIL EIGHT OR NINE.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:30.000
NOT SURPRISINGLY, MOST OF OUR
CHILDREN WERE NOT THERE YET.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.530
MOM!!

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:36.630
THEY WERE SO EAGER TO
TELL ON THEIR PARENTS,

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.170
THAT THEY CAME
LOOKING FOR US.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:41.030
COME HERE.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:44.070
&nbsp DADDY DROPPED
&nbsp THE MARBLES!

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.000
BUT HOW WOULD
TYRESE GET ON?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.500
&nbspWHO WAS IT?

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.930
&nbspHOW COME THEY'RE ON
&nbspTHE FLOOR?

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.570
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN BEING
TOUGH MINDED, WITHOUT HAVING

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:00.500
THE SKILLS TO CARRY IT
OFF, LEAVES HIM SILENT.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:09.630
&nbspWAS IT MOMMY
&nbspTYRESE?

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.230
&nbspWELL THERE ARE TWO
&nbspPEOPLE IN ONE ROOM...

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:24.370
&nbspDID YOU TOUCH
&nbspTHEM?

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.030
BUT THERE WAS ONE CHILD THAT
SIMPLY DIDN'T TELL ON HIS MOM

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.230
BUT SOLD HER
RIGHT DOWN THE RIVER.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:35.930
PLEASE DON'T TELL
ON MOMMY.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:39.370
DON'T TELL THEM!

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.770
SO WHERE DID NATHAN LEARN
TO TAKE SO MUCH DELIGHT

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:46.730
IN SHOPPING HIS MOM?

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.170
HE'S LIVED ALL HIS LIFE HERE.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.470
IN THE SMALL MARKET
TOWN OF GALSTON,

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:57.670
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
AYRSHIRE HILLS.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.930
AT SCHOOL, NATHAN PRICE IS
A STICKLER FOR THE RULES.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:09.570
WE'RE ALLOWED TO RUN
BUT NOT IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:13.030
WE RUN OUTSIDE.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:15.830
&nbspWHY DO YOU THINK
&nbspWE NEED RULES?

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.930
&nbspNATHAN.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.900
SO WE KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.130
&nbsp SO YOU KNOW EXACTLY
&nbsp WHAT TO DO.

00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:27.870
&nbsp THAT'S RIGHT.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.930
HE'S VERY AWARE
OF HELPING OTHERS.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.430
VERY AWARE YES HE'S
A VERY KIND CHILD.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.570
HE'S A VERY SETTLED CHILD.

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:39.030
HE'S JUST A WEE BOY
THAT'S JUST A PLEASURE

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.370
TO HAVE IN YOUR CLASS.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.900
BUT LIKE ALL CHILDREN HE
ALSO WANTS TO BE POPULAR

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.570
WITH HIS SCHOOLMATES.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.530
AND HE DOES THAT IN A
VERY DIFFERENT WAY.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:28:00.530
HE'S GOOD AT DOING CROUCHING
AND JUMPING AND STUFF.

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.900
HE'S DOING LOADS
OF FIGHTING.

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.200
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.500
AT HOME, THE RULES EVEN
HAVE MORE STRUCTURE

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:16.800
EVEN IF THEY ARE A
LITTLE DIFFERENT.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:22.600
NATHAN IS ENCOURAGED TO
MEDITATE ON A REGULAR BASIS.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.730
HE WAS TAUGHT BY
HIS FATHER RICHARD.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:29.800
A BUDDHIST WHO
MEDITATES EVERY DAY.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.400
I WASN'T BORN A BUDDHIST.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.930
I ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM
WITH THE RELIGIONS...

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.470
THE STUFF THAT YOU
LEARNED AT SCHOOL,

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.670
THE STUFF THAT YOU
LEARNED FROM YOUR FAMILY.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:40.600
THAT NEVER SAT WELL WITH ME.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.730
I THINK NATHAN IS THE TYPE
OF CHILD WHO BENEFITS

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:46.970
WELL FROM STRUCTURE.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:51.070
HIS MOM RUTH IS
EQUALLY UNCONVENTIONAL.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.330
LETS SEE IF YOU CAN
HUG A TREE COME ON.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.170
HANDS AND STRETCH ME.

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.630
I DON'T FIT IN.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.970
THAT'S VERY...

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.600
NO, I DON'T FIT IN.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.300
I'M ONE OF THE MOMS THAT
DROPS THE KIDS OFF AT SCHOOL

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.170
AND I SMILE AT PEOPLE
BUT I DON'T REALLY

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:09.200
KNOW MANY PEOPLE
VERY WELL.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:15.930
THEY NEVER HAVE FITTED IN.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:19.630
WHEN THEY MOVED TO THE AYRSHIRE
COUNTRYSIDE TEN YEARS AGO,

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.600
THEY WERE DETERMINED TO
BRING THEIR CHILDREN UP

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.470
WITH THEIR OWN VALUES.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.900
UNCONTAMINATED BY
MAINSTREAM SOCIETY.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.600
IT'S AN IDEAL THERE
STILL TRYING TO PUT

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:32.100
INTO PRACTICE TODAY.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:33.070
EVEN AT BEDTIME.

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.300
THE STORK STUFFED HIMSELF
WITH ALL THE PEACHES

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.470
HE COULD
POSSIBLY EAT.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.300
WOULD YOU HAVE
DONE THAT?

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.400
I WOULD.

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.970
YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN
ALL THE PEACHES

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:42.770
AND NOT LEFT ANY
FOR ANYONE ELSE?

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.130
I WOULD TAKE SOME.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.770
YOU WOULD HAVE
TAKEN SOME.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:46.700
YES.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.370
WHAT DID THE BUDDHA
DO TO THE MONKEY?

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.270
HE TOLD HIM
WHAT TO DO.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.370
THE RIGHT THING.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:30:00.170
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
TEACHING OF THE BUDDHA?

00:30:00.170 --> 00:30:01.500
DO NO HARM.

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.800
SAY IT AGAIN
NATHAN.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.970
DO NO HARM.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:13.630
COME THE WEEKEND,
NATHAN NEEDS TO GET OUT.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.000
AND NOTHING, NOT EVEN
THE POURING RAIN CAN STOP

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.570
GALSTON'S KEENEST
BIRD WATCHER.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:34.200
I COME IN HERE AND REST.
STAY REALLY QUIET.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.370
SO TELL ME WHAT
BIRDS HAVE YOU SEEN?

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:48.530
WOODPECKERS, WOOD-PIGEON
AND A GREEN FINCH.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:52.170
BUT THE BIRD BOX SERVES
ANOTHER PURPOSE AS WELL.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:57.300
NOT JUST LOOKING FOR BIRDS,
BUT ESCAPING FROM HUMANS.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:00.930
&nbspWHY DID YOU GO
&nbspIN THERE?

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:05.000
&nbsp SO NOBODY CAN
&nbsp FIND ME.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.370
SOMETIMES THOUGH HE
JUST CAN'T GET AWAY.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:14.500
SOMETIMES HE'S NASTY WHEN
WE COME BACK AFTER SCHOOL

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:19.030
AND SOMETIMES HE'S NASTY WHEN
WE'RE TAKING OUR FRIENDS HOME.

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:23.500
AND THEN WE ALWAYS HAVE
A CARRY ON IN THE CAR.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.100
WELL HE HAVE IN
MY NOSE ONCE.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:27.970
&nbspWHY?

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:29.270
OUCH!

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:31.000
BECAUSE WE WERE
FIGHTING TOGETHER.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.530
OUCH!

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.370
AND THEN MEDITATION
SERVES ANOTHER PURPOSE.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.370
&nbsp WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS
&nbsp SHRINE IN YOUR BEDROOM?

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:47.570
BECAUSE IF I'VE BEEN BAD I
HAVE TO THINK WHAT I'VE DONE.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:53.700
&nbsp WHAT ARE YOU
&nbsp THINKING ABOUT?

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:56.600
NEVER GET INTO TROUBLE.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.030
FOR ALL OF US, STRONG
VALUES AND ABSOLUTE RULES

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:06.270
CAN BE VERY HARD
TO LIVE UP TO.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:11.870
IN BIRMINGHAM, TYRESES MOM'S
COMMITMENT TO HER PRINCIPLES

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.030
MEANS THINGS ARE
CHANGING FOR THE FAMILY.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.230
MARIA'S CONCERNED THAT
LIKE MANY BLACK BOYS,

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.930
TYRESE MAY NOT THRIVE
IN BRITAIN AND SO

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:25.070
MISS OUT ON THE OPPORTUNITIES
OPEN TO HIS WHITE PEERS.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.930
SO SHE'S CONTEMPLATING
A BIG GAMBLE,

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:32.670
IN THE GAMBIA.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:42.900
I HAVE A FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN,

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.800
AND BY THE FIFTEEN
YEARS ARE UP

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.930
I WILL HAVE THREE PROPERTIES
IN THREE COUNTRIES.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.500
SO GAMBIA IS THE FIRST,
THEN THE CARIBBEAN

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.230
AND KEEP YOUR FINGERS
CROSSED, MAYBE AMERICA.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:59.870
IT'S NICE TO SEE THE BLACK
PEOPLE IN HIGH POSITIONS

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:04.430
AND YOU GUYS ARE
THE MINORITY.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.970
MARIE HAS DECIDED TO
BUY SOME LAND HERE.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.800
BUT TO DO BUSINESS
IN THE GAMBIA,

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.070
SHE IS FINDING YOU
HAVE TO DUCK AND DIVE

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.600
JUST AS MUCH AS
IN BIRMINGHAM.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.170
THERE IS NO WAY I'M GONNA
BE SPENDING 16 AND 20 GRAND.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:20.400
I AIN'T GOT THAT
KIND OF MONEY.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.100
THEY LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE
PAYING IN ENGLAND

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.570
AND THEY'RE SAYING THEY
WANT THE SAME HERE.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:25.200
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.430
YOU HAVEN'T GOT
THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.330
YOU HAVEN'T GOT RUNNING WATER,
YOU HAVEN'T GOT ELECTRICITY.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.130
AND YOU HAVEN'T GOT
TELEPHONE POINTS.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:31.370
YOU GOTTA LOOK AT THAT.

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.400
IT'S NOT REALISTIC.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.300
WHILE SHE'S AWAY, TYRESE
AND HIS SISTER TANISHA

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.330
ARE WITH THEIR
GRANDMOTHER BEVERLY.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.930
TELL ME WHAT ISN'T BORING?

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.800
EVERYTHING IS BORING.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.030
BEVERLY LIVES
JUST DOWN THE ROAD.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.530
AND OVER THE YEARS HAS SPENT
A LOT OF TIME WITH TYRESE.

00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:57.170
HE'S GOT A VERY
STRONG CHARACTER HERE.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:59.600
HE'S GOT ACTUALLY
A NICE CHARACTER.

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.500
ACTUALLY I LIKE TYRESE.

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.200
HE HAS A TIME WHEN HE
DOESN'T LIKE PEOPLE.

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.570
DOESN'T WANT TO TALK
TO ANYONE

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:10.570
BUT I ALWAYS SEEM TO ABLE
TO SWITCH HIM AROUND.

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:12.830
PEOPLE'S FIRST
IMPRESSION OF TYRESE

00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:16.170
IS THAT HE'S BOISTEROUS,
HE'S A BOY AND ALL THAT.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.170
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:23.430
I THINK A CHILD HAS A RIGHT TO
BE ANGRY OR EXPRESS HIMSELF

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:25.370
IN A CERTAIN WAY.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.630
YOU KNOW I DO THINK
THE CHILD SHOULD,

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.070
AND HE DID.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.230
IT MAY BE THIS INSIGHT
THAT SETS TYRESE

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:36.970
AT EASE IN HER COMPANY AND
HELPS HIS STRENGTHS COME OUT.

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:39.270
IF YOU GIVE HIM
PROJECTS TO DO

00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.200
HIS TAKES IT RIGHT
THROUGH TO THE END.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.170
HE'S VERY GOOD THAT WAY.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:47.300
SO HE'S PICKED UP
THAT VALUE FROM HIS MOM.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.970
SHE'S NEGOTIATED BUYING A
PLOT OF LAND WHICH SHE HOPES

00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:54.070
WILL BECOME THE FIRST OF THE
FAMILIES PROPERTY EMPIRE.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:55.130
YOU'VE GOT THE SUN.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.570
YOU'VE GOT
THE SEA.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:58.570
IT'S A MORE LEISURELY PACE.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.330
PEOPLE ARE STILL
MAKING A LIVING,

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.830
BUT IT'S NOT THAT
CUT THROAT, FAST PACE.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.530
EVEN IF YOU LOOK
AT PEOPLE WALKING,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.700
IT'S A LEISURELY STROLL.

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.830
WHEN I SHOW THIS GAMBIAN
PERSON HOW WE WALK IN ENGLAND,

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.830
SHE'S LIKE NO
AND I'M LIKE YAH.

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.670
MARIE HOPES THAT THE GAMBIA
WILL BE A LITTLE MORE

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.730
THAN JUST AN ENTREPRENEURIAL
OPPORTUNITY.

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.370
I WANT MY CHILDREN
TO EXPERIENCE LIFE,

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.970
NOT JUST ONE
PART OF THE WORLD.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.230
I WANT THEM TO KNOW DIFFERENT
ASPECTS OF THE WORLD..

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.800
STIMULATE THEIR
IMAGINATION A BIT MORE.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.000
&nbspCOAT ON.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.270
NO!

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.300
&nbspGET IT ON THEN.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:39.230
A FEW WEEKS LATER, THE
GAMBIA SEEMS A LONG WAY AWAY

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:44.430
AS THE FAMILY HEADS INTO
BIRMINGHAM'S RUSH HOUR.

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.970
BUT THE EXPERIENCE
HASN'T BEEN WASTED.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:48.970
GAMBIA'S BRING ME ON TO
SORT OF SAY THE THINGS

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.730
THAT I WANT TO
ACHIEVE.

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.000
THAT IF I WANT THE LIFE
THAT I WANT TO LIVE IN GAMBIA,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.700
I GOT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:59.170
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS
WHY I WANT TO OPEN UP A SHOP.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.130
MARIA'S FURTHERING
HER AMBITION

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.370
TO MAKE LIFE BETTER
FOR HER FAMILY.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:10.470
BUT IS TYRESE DEVELOPING HIS
ABILITY TO GET WHAT HE WANTS?

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:13.800
WE ASKED THE CHILDREN TO MOVE
THESE BALLS FROM ONE CONTAINER

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:19.470
TO ANOTHER USING A
COMPLETELY UNSUITABLE SPOON.

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.830
IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE
TASK, SO WILL THEY CHEAT?

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:35.570
IN SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS,
SCIENTIST ALL OVER THE WORLD

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.970
HAVE OBSERVED THAT VIRTUALLY
ALL YOUNG CHILDREN

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.470
WILL HAVE A GO.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:40.600
THEN,

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.030
THEY WILL CHEAT.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.700
EVEN UNDER COMMUNISM.

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.730
BUT WILL THEY ADMIT IT?

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:52.930
THE RUSSIAN CHILDREN DIDN'T.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.200
ALL OUR CHILDREN
CHEATED TOO.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:04.900
THEY'RE LEARNING THAT
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.870
BEND THE RULES TO
GET THINGS DONE.

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.700
BUT WOULD THEY ADMIT IT?

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.270
&nbspDID YOU USE
&nbspYOUR HANDS?

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:15.770
NO.

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:17.600
HOW ABOUT TYRESE?

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.170
&nbspDID YOU TOUCH THEM
&nbspWITH YOUR HANDS?

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.600
YES.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.530
SOME.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:24.830
SOME WITH MY HANDS.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.770
THE ONES THAT FALLED OUT.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:35.230
COURAGEOUSLY, TYRESE WAS
ONE OF THE FEW WHO DIDN'T LIE.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:37.270
IT SEEMS HE'S FINDING
OUT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:39.570
TO ARGUE YOUR
CORNER.

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.800
WHAT ABOUT EVE?

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.270
&nbsp DID YOU USE
&nbsp YOUR HANDS?

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:44.200
NO.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.930
NOT VERY MUCH.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:52.030
I DON'T THINK
I DID.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.870
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LIE
BUT SHE ALSO DOESN'T WANT

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:58.670
TO BE SEEN TO BE BREAKING
THE RULES.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:01.130
IT'S ONLY ONE OF THE MANY
DILEMMAS IN HER LIFE

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.600
AT THE MOMENT.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.870
IT'S SPORTS DAY
REHEARSAL AT SCHOOL

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:13.400
BUT EVE'S MIND IS ON HER
MOM AND THE UNBORN BABY.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.170
IT'S STRANGE REALLY.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:20.070
SHE WENT TO THE
HOSPITAL YESTERDAY.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:28.030
WELL, THERE'S JUST A
LITTLE SORT OF AN OPERATION.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:32.200
TIP THERE WINGS LIKE THAT...

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.330
I WAS QUITE ILL, VERY SICK.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.400
I HAD TOO MUCH ADRENALINE
WHICH WAS MAKING ME FEEL

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.470
LIKE I JUST HAD A
CAR SMASH.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.530
THEY THOUGHT THE CAUSE OF THE
ADRENALINE RUSH MIGHT BE

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.830
THAT I HAD A TUMOR IN
MY ADRENAL GLAND.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:52.100
WHICH I DON'T HAVE BUT I
STILL HAVE ALL THE SYMPTOMS.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.900
AND I THINK I JUST GOT
TO THE POINT WHERE

00:38:53.900 --> 00:39:00.470
I THOUGHT THIS IS NEVER ENDING
AND COULDN'T HANDLE IT REALLY.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:05.400
IN SUSSEX, EVE'S UNCLE
ANDREW IS FINDING LIFE

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.570
INCREASINGLY HARD
TO HANDLE TOO.

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:12.930
I'M STARTING TO BECOME
A LITTLE BIT WEAKER.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.070
NOT DAY BY DAY.

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.000
IT'S NOT AS RAPID AS THAT.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.630
IT'S SORT OF TIRED AND WEAK
RATHER THAN ILL PARTICULARLY.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:29.800
JUST GRADUALLY YOUR
QUALITY OF LIFE GOES DOWNHILL.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.200
EVE'S AUNT HALEY IS
CONFIDENT THAT TIM

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.870
WILL HONOR HIS PROMISE.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.030
KNOWING TIM AS I DO, HE'S GOT
A VERY STRONG CHRISTIAN FAITH

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.930
AS I HAVE AS WELL AND HE'S THE
SORT OF PERSON THAT WILL THINK

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.900
ABOUT THINGS AND IF HE CAN
HELP TIM WOULD WANT TO HELP.

00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.000
AND HE DOES WANT TO HELP.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.730
BUT TIM HAS BEEN TOLD BY THE
DOCTORS THAT HE'S GOT TO LOSE

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:55.870
TWO STONE BEFORE THE
TRANSPLANT CAN GO AHEAD.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.030
HE'S ALLOWED
THINGS LIKE OATS.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.600
BREAD IS GOOD.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.200
COUNTING TIM'S CALORIES ON
TOP OF A DIFFICULT PREGNANCY

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.270
IS A BURDEN.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:07.000
&nbspHOW ABOUT FRUIT?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.630
FRUIT WITH
CARE REALLY.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:10.270
DEPENDS ON THE SORT
OF FRUIT

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:12.900
AND SLIGHTLY
UNDER-RIPE REALLY.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.030
&nbspDOES HE EVER
&nbspCHEAT?

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.470
OH GOSH YES.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.300
NO I DON'T CHEAT.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.670
I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT
I'VE RIDDEN OFF THE RAILS.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:27.400
FOR WHAT WE ARE ABOUT
TO RECEIVE MAY THE...

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.400
AAH....MEN.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.970
ALL DONE.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:39.370
EAGLE EYED EVE CAN
SEE IT'S A STRUGGLE.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.470
HE'S LOST HALF A STONE.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:46.070
NOW JUST LOSE THE
WHOLE STONE.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:54.530
HE ONLY EATS PORRIDGE AND
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS NOW.

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:58.730
&nbsp DOES HE EVER
&nbsp CHEAT?

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:02.400
HE ATE SHORTBREAD
LAST WEEK.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.230
THERE ARE TEMPTATIONS
THAT I'VE DEALT WITH

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:12.370
AND CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO
DEAL WITH EFFECTIVELY.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.530
FOOD ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.400
CHIPS AND MANY OTHER
THINGS ARE NOT ONE OF THEM.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.770
I KNOW THE RIGHT THING
TO DO IS TO KNUCKLE DOWN.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:28.700
STOP HAVING THE
PASTAS AND THE CHIPS

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:32.500
AND STICK TO THE PORRIDGE.

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.770
I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO BELIEVE
IS THAT I WILL LOSE THE WEIGHT

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:37.870
AND WE'LL GET SORTED.

00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:44.970
THREE MONTHS AGO
THERE WAS NO QUESTION.

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:49.530
THAT'S RIGHT, YEA
THAT'S VERY COMMON.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.700
TIM'S BEING FORCED TO
MAKE A DIFFICULT CHOICE.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.100
REALLY GO FOR THE TRANSPLANT
THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.570
HIS OWN HEALTH, OR FOCUS
ON HIS OWN FAMILY

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.930
AND HELP CAROLINE THROUGH
HER DIFFICULT PREGNANCY.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.370
HOW WOULD OTHER FAMILIES
DEAL WITH SUCH A DIFFICULT

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.270
MORAL DILEMMA?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.330
WELCOME TO MORAL MASTERMIND.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:16.730
DON'T GET CLOSE TO
THE MICROPHONE

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.200
BECAUSE IT WON'T
WORK TYRESE.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:23.700
DON'T DO THAT.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:30.300
YOUR NAME PLEASE.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.770
TONI PLASTER.

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:33.970
AND YOU'RE THE
PARENT OF?

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:35.670
CHARLIE PLASTER.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.400
RIGHT.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.730
YOU'VE FINALLY MANAGED
TO SELL YOUR HOUSE

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.500
AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO
EXCHANGE HOUSES

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.800
AND YOU SUDDENLY NOTICED
THE ROOF IS LEAKING.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.170
DO YOU JUST KICK CLEAR OUT
OR DO YOU OWN UP

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.830
AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT
IT BEFORE YOU GO?

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.330
CLEAR OUT AND
NOT SAY A WORD.

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.900
OKAY.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.070
GET IT FIXED.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.800
WHY?

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.830
I THINK THE REPERCUSSIONS
THAT WOULD COME AFTER,

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.270
WOULD BE NOT WORTH
THE HASSLE.

00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:09.830
I'D OWN UP BECAUSE THINGS
ALWAYS HAVE A WAY

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:11.630
OF CATCHING YOU
BACK UP.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.270
OKAY.

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:18.270
YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK AT HOME
AND YOU BRING IT IN TO SHOW

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:21.330
YOUR TEACHER AND YOUR TEACHER
SAYS THIS IS REALLY GOOD WORK

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:23.970
BUT YOU KNOW THAT YOUR
MOM REALLY DID MOST OF IT.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.270
WOULD YOU TELL YOUR TEACHER
IT WAS REALLY YOUR MOMS WORK

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:29.530
OR WOULD YOU SAY
IT WAS YOURS?

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:31.070
IT WAS MINE.

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:33.300
YOU'D TELL THE
TEACHER IT WAS YOURS.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:38.330
YOU'D TELL THE
TEACHER IT WAS YOUR MOM?

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.430
I DON'T KNOW.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:41.970
YOU DON'T KNOW.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.730
YOU JUST THINKS IT'S
BEST TO BE HONEST?

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:50.330
YEA.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:54.770
YOUR CRUISE SHIP HAS JUST HIT
A ROCK AND THERE IS JUST ABOUT

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.700
ENOUGH RAFTS TO GO AROUND
BUT YOUR RAFT IS OVERLOADED.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.730
YOU'VE GOT A VERY BADLY
INJURED PERSON ON THE RAFT

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:03.430
AND IT'S SINKING.

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.670
THEY'RE GONNA DIE ANYWAY DO
YOU THROW THEM OVERBOARD

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.030
TO SAVE THE OTHERS?

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:09.230
LAUGHTER.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:12.330
NO, I DON'T THINK I COULD
LIVE WITH MYSELF AFTERWARDS.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.770
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:17.400
AND YOU'RE HALF
DEAD ANYWAY SO...

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.470
SO YOU'D BE QUITE
BRUTALLY FRANK AND PRAGMATIC.

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.730
YES.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.230
I'D GIVE HIM A
CHANCE.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:29.370
THROW THEM OVERBOARD?

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:36.700
UM..NOT ALIVE.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.530
YOU'D KILL THEM FIRST?

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:38.970
YES.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.470
BUT THEN NATHAN'S DAD IS
PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF OUR

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:47.770
PARENTS WHO'S SKILLFUL ENOUGH
TO KILL WITH HIS BARE HANDS.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:53.000
EVERY MONDAY NIGHT THE PRICE
FAMILY GO FOR KARATE LESSONS.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.070
RICHARD IS THE INSTRUCTOR.

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:58.100
HE'S GOT A BLACK BELT.

00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.330
WE FACE EACH OTHER.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.700
WE SHOW THAT RESPECT FOR EACH
OTHER AND THEN WE GRAB EACH

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.430
OTHER AND WE TRY TO GET
EACH OTHER DOWN ON THEIR BACK.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.570
IT MAY SEEM A CONTRADICTION
TO THE BUDDHIST TEACHING

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.530
OF DO NO HARM.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:12.070
BUT RICHARD THINKS THAT
KARATE AND MEDITATION

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:15.700
ARE TWO FACES OF
THE SAME COIN.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.570
I WOULD SAY STRUCTURE
MORE THAN DISCIPLINE BECAUSE

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:20.300
DISCIPLINE OFTEN SEEMS THAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO CONTROL.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.300
WE ARE NOT TRYING TO CONTROL.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:22.930
WE ARE TRYING TO SORT
OF STRUCTURE AND GUIDE

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:26.030
RATHER THEN CONTROL.

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:28.970
THE PRICES THINK THAT KARATE
WILL GIVE NATHAN A WAY

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:32.370
TO EXPEND HIS ENERGY,
CONTROL HIS ANGER

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:36.270
AND MANAGE HIS
NATURAL AGGRESSION.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.400
AND HE LOVES IT.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.870
GOOD WELL DONE.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.730
&nbspYOU HURT
&nbspTHAT BOY.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:57.700
[LAUGHS]

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:00.270
WE ARE NOT ALLOW
TO FIGHT AT SCHOOL.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:01.970
&nbspWHY?

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.930
BECAUSE THE
TEACHER SAYS.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:05.770
BECAUSE IT'S BAD.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.070
BUT HERE IT'S GOOD.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.300
IF I GOT NATHAN DOWN, AND HE
CAN'T TAP BECAUSE I GOT HIS

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:14.470
LEGS AND ARMS TIED UP,

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.300
THE PRICES HOPE NATHAN WILL
CONTROL HIS OWN BEHAVIOR

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.600
AND MAKE HIS OWN CHOICES.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.870
I WOULD CHOP
THE HEAD OFF.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.270
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S A BIT SEVERE?

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:27.500
I'LL CHOP YOUR
HEAD OFF.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.700
LETS NOT DO NO HARM.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.830
NO NO NOT MORE.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:34.600
I THINK HE'S LEARNING TO
BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.700
HOW DO I WANT TO
DEAL WITH THIS?

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:41.630
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT
HOPEFULLY HE'LL CARRY ON DOING

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:47.370
AND NOT JUST RESPOND AND GO
WITH THE HERD SO TO SPEAK.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.600
THAT YOU CAN STAND ALONE.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.170
AND NATHAN HAS LEARNED TO
STAND BY HIS PRINCIPLES.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:58.130
&nbspWHY ARE YOU A
&nbspVEGETARIAN NATHAN?

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:03.200
BECAUSE WE DON'T
LIKE KILLING.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:07.830
&nbspHAVE YOU EVER
&nbspHAD FISH OR MEAT?

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.030
I'VE HAD MEAT
BEFORE.

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.230
YOU TRIED IT ONCE.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:17.230
WHEN I WAS ONLY 4.

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.930
IT WASN'T MEAT
IT WAS TUNA FISH.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:20.970
WAS IT TUNA?

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:22.370
YES.

00:47:22.370 --> 00:47:24.430
SO THAT'S FISH.

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:26.170
&nbsp WHAT DO THE OTHER CHILDREN
&nbsp THINK WHEN YOU SAY YOU DON'T

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.630
EAT MEAT AND FISH?

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:30.600
THEY SAY TRY IT.

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.270
&nbsp WHAT DO THINK OF YOUR
&nbsp FRIENDS WHEN THEY EAT MEAT?

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:34.300
THEY'RE WRONG.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.130
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE WRONG.

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:38.230
EVERYONE'S GOT A
CHOICE TO MAKE.

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.270
AND THEY'RE JUST
DIFFERENT.

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.900
HIS PARENTS ARE KEEN HE
ALSO LEARNS TOLERANCE

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.970
AND ADAPTABILITY BECAUSE
THINGS ARE CHANGING.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:50.630
FOR ALL OF NATHAN'S LIFE
RICHARD HAS WORKED AT HOME AS

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.570
AN ARTIST AND SCULPTOR.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:55.300
BUT NOW HE'S GOT A JOB.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.630
IN A CALL CENTER.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.800
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S
AROUND THE CORNER DO YOU?

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.200
I THINK I KINDA STUMBLED INTO
THIS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:06.070
AND IT'S GOOD FUN.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:09.530
&nbsp IS THE CORRECT AMOUNT
&nbsp BEING PAID FOR YOU?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.300
IT'S DEFINITELY
CHANGED ME YA.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.430
THERE'S A BIT OF A
JUMP IN MY STEP AGAIN.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:18.970
I THINK I WAS
GETTING A BIT JADED

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:21.930
WITH BEING IN THE
STUDIO ALL THE TIME.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.330
OR BEING OUT WORKING ON A PIECE
OF SCULPTURE ALL THE TIME.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:28.870
IT WAS JUST GETTING A
BIT LONELY I SUPPOSE

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:31.330
AND I THINK IT'S TAKEN
THAT PART AWAY.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:37.830
RUTH ALSO FEELS THERE
IS SOMETHING IN THE AIR.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.570
THINGS ARE CHANGING FOR US.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:42.000
A LOT OF IT IS TO DO
WITH RICHARD'S WORK

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.070
BUT I ALSO THINK THE
KIDS ARE GROWING UP.

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:51.930
THEY'RE CHANGING,
I'M CHANGING.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.700
I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY
FROM MYSELF AS MUCH.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.700
THEY'VE COME TO A DECISION WHICH
WILL AFFECT ALL THE FAMILY.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.430
THEY'RE GOING TO SELL THE
HOUSE, WHICH EMBODIES

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.930
ALL THE VALUES THAT
SETS THEM APART,

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:06.070
AND MOVE BACK
NEARER THE CITY.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.030
JOY IS SAD BUT NATHAN ISN'T.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.100
I DON'T WANT TO
MOVE HOUSE.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.300
I DO.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.030
WHAT YOU LOOKING
FORWARD TO?

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:18.530
GETTING ANOTHER HOUSE AND
MAYBE A LOVELY GARDEN.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.130
AND A BIGGER ONE
THAN THIS.

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.630
I ALWAYS USED TO LAUGH AND
SAY I NEVER REALLY WANTED

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:25.700
TO LIVE IN SUBURBIAN
MARSHMELLOWDOM.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:30.470
THERE ARE THINGS TO DO WITH
SUBURBIAN MARSHMELLOWDOM

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.530
THAT MAYBE ARE DIFFERENT NOW
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE KIDS.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:38.230
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY COULD
RIDE THEIR BIKES SOMEWHERE SAFE,

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.970
AND ALSO PLAY WITH KIDS
IN THE AREA AFTER SCHOOL

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:44.970
AND HAVE SOME
FRIENDS LOCALLY.

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.530
WHAT ABOUT ALL
OF YOUR FRIENDS?

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:49.730
AH YES I'LL MISS
MY FRIENDS.

00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.600
BUT IF IT'S FAR FAR FOR ME
I CAN'T MEET THEM ANYMORE.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.900
MY FRIENDS LIVES
ON THE FARM.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:50:00.200
WE DON'T GET TO
SEE THEM ANYMORE.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.600
&nbsp SO ARE YOU GONNA MISS YOUR
&nbsp FRIENDS AT SCHOOL NATHAN?

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.630
NOPE.

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:11.270
NATHAN, JOY AND THEIR
PARENTS WILL HAVE TO SEE

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:18.130
HOW THEIR PRINCIPLES SURVIVE
AT TIME OF CHANGE.

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:20.830
IN BIRMINGHAM, THERE'S
NO STOPPING MARIE.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:23.900
CHANGE IS THE
PRINCIPLE SHE LIVES BY.

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.930
I DECIDED TO GO INTO
PARTNERSHIP AND OPEN

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:30.930
AN EXCLUSIVE, DESIGNER,
ESTABLISHMENT.

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:33.370
HER PARTNER IS
HER MOM BEVERLY.

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:37.070
AND ALL THE FAMILY
ARE LENDING A HAND.

00:50:37.070 --> 00:50:41.270
BLUE IS TOO COLD.

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:44.870
IT HAS TO BE
WARM AND INVITING.

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:46.530
RED IS TOO DARK.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:55.830
I'M HOPING THAT TYRESE WILL
GET THE VALUES OF HARD WORK.

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:57.400
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO DO

00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.000
IF YOU PUT YOUR
MIND TO IT.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
AND THAT YOU CAN ACHIEVE
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.800
AND ONE OF THE THINGS TANISHA
SAID TO ME WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.670
WAS THAT SHE
WANTED TO BE A DUSTMAN.

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.500
I SAID GREAT GO BE A
DUSTMAN BUT OWN THE COMPANY.

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.100
NOT IF TYRESE HAS
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.070
AHHHH.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:16.270
&nbspWHAT WOULD YOU
&nbspLIKE?

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:20.230
A BROTHER.

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:24.770
GOAL!!

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:27.100
EVEN THOUGHT THEY BICKER AND
ARGUE ALL THE TIME HE DOES

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.630
THINK ABOUT HER AND HE'LL
THINK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:35.230
HE'S GETTING A LOT BETTER WITH
HIS COMMUNICATION SKILLS BUT

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:40.000
HE DOESN'T EXPRESS HIMSELF AS
WELL AS PROBABLY HE COULD DO

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.230
AND I JUST PUT IT DOWN TO
THE FACT HE'S FIVE YOU KNOW.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:44.370
SO IT WILL BE QUITE
INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:46.630
HE'S LIKE AT EIGHT.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:50.800
HE'S GONE THROUGH ISSUES THAT
HE HAD AND HE'S COME THROUGH

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.430
HE'S DOING WELL NOW AND HE'S
FINE AND NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.330
HE'S A LOT SOFTER.

00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:00.500
MARIE HOPES HER SENSE OF
PURPOSE AND SELF BELIEF

00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:05.830
WILL CONTINUE TO RUB
OFF ON TYRESE.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.470
A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND SELF
BELIEF SEEMS DIFFICULT

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:12.000
AT THE MOMENT IN THE
PLASTER HOUSEHOLD.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.570
CHARLIE.

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.700
LOOK OUT FOR SCHOOL NOW.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:22.000
ROB'S BEEN OUT OF WORK
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.930
AND HAS TAKEN OVER MUCH
OF THE CHILDCARE.

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:29.130
FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF
WEEKS IT WASN'T TOO BAD

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:31.900
BECAUSE IT WAS LIKE HAVING
TWO WEEKS OFF REALLY.

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.300
BUT OBVIOUSLY LOOKING AFTER
THE KIDS IS AN EYE OPENER

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.970
TO SEE WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO AT HOME,

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:37.300
WHEN YOU HAVE
THREE KIDS.

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:40.700
I MUCH RATHER BE AT
WORK THAN AT HOME.

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.830
IT'S NOT WHAT THEY WANTED.

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.130
THE RIGHT THING FOR ME AND
MY FAMILY IS THAT WE WORK AND

00:52:47.130 --> 00:52:50.870
THEY GROW UP AND SEE THAT.

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:56.770
THEY'VE GOT SOME SORT OF
AN INSPIRATION I HOPE

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:58.900
FROM ME AND ROB.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.330
SO WITH ROB UNABLE TO FIND
WORK AND MONEY TIGHT,

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.600
TONI HAS STEPPED IN
AS THE BREAD WINNER.

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.670
HELLO.

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:16.000
TWICE A DAY TONI AND HER
COLLEAGUE SARA COME IN TO HELP

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.330
ALLAN, ONE OF THEIR
25 CLIENTS.

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:23.770
HE'S BEEN CRIPPLED WITH
POLIO VIRTUALLY ALL HIS LIFE.

00:53:23.770 --> 00:53:25.000
I LOVE IT.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.300
FULFILLING AIN'T IT SARA?

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.070
IT'S JUST DIFFERENT.

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.630
YOU'RE NOT STUCK IN
AN OFFICE ON A PHONE

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.130
OR YOU KNOW IT'S JUST
DIFFERENT EVERYDAY

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:38.200
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU GET USED
TO THE SAME PEOPLE IT'S...

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.700
I LOVE COMING
HERE IN THE MORNING.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.800
FOR ME TEA AND BISCUITS.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.230
TONI.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:47.930
MIND YOU IT MAKES MY
LIFE HARD, WINDING ME UP,

00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:50.070
CALLING ME HELEN.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.330
JUST MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.800
I DON'T GET UP IN THE
MORNING AND GO YOU KNOW...

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.670
I LOOK FORWARD TO
COMING TO WORK.

00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.200
I'D SAY I WAS A
BETTER PERSON NOW.

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.400
AS I GOT OLDER...

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.670
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY.

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:05.970
I'VE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.

00:54:05.970 --> 00:54:07.430
I LIKE WHAT I DO.

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:09.770
I LIKE THE PERSON I AM.

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:12.070
I LIKE THE FACT THAT I COULD
GO INTO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:19.330
AND JUST BY ASKING HOW THEY ARE,
CAN BRIGHTEN UP THEIR DAY.

00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:23.000
I THINK IT MUST BE LIKE SPLIT
PERSONALITY BECAUSE IN SCHOOL

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.530
I USED TO BE HORRIBLE.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:25.930
REALLY HORRIBLE.

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:31.030
SO I WENT FROM BIG TUFF GIRL
BIT AND THEN I STILL HAD THIS

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:34.600
SOFTER SIDE THAT I WANTED TO
SHOW AS WELL SO I DON'T KNOW

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.570
MAYBE THAT WAS MY WAY OF
SAYING I AIN'T ALL THAT BAD.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.200
IT'S THE LAST DAY OF
CHARLIE'S SCHOOL YEAR.

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:48.730
SO WHICH SIDE OF HER
MOM HAS CHARLIE GOT?

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.000
SHE'S KIND, SHE IS HELPFUL.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.330
SHE'S VERY CARING.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:55.330
SHE SHOWS A LOVELY CARING
NATURE TOWARDS OTHER CHILDREN

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.500
AND I THINK THAT'S A
LOVELY QUALITY TO HAVE.

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:01.030
SHE'S GOT VERY ENDEARING
QUALITIES AND SHE CAN PLAY

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:02.330
BY THE RULES.

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:05.000
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE IS ALLOWED
TO DO AND WHAT SHE IS NOT.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.230
AND IT SHOWS IN
HER SCHOOL REPORT.

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:11.070
IT'S LOOKING
REALLY GOOD ACTUALLY.

00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:16.670
CHARLIE IS A VERY WELL
MANNERED GIRL UNLIKE ME.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:18.900
SHE SHOWS EXCELLENT
LEARNING POTENTIAL.

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.530
SHE'S MADE EXCELLENT PROGRESS.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.430
VERY GOOD!

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:28.930
BUT BY THE END OF THE SUMMER,
ROB'S BEEN UNEMPLOYED

00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.330
FOR NINE MONTHS.

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:33.100
AT HOME THE
PRESSURE IS MOUNTING.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.900
ROB AND TONI ARE STARTING TO
SEE ANOTHER SIDE TO CHARLIE.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:38.570
THE ONE THAT WILL
SPEAK OUT

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:43.670
IF SHE DOESN'T LIKE
WHAT IS GOING ON.

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:45.770
WE WAS ARGUING AND
SHE'S SHOUTING,

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:48.800
WILL YOU JUST STOP
SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER!

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:52.000
AND WE SAT DOWN ONE
NIGHT AND I SAID TO HIM

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.670
THEY'RE PICKING UP ON IT.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:56.070
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:58.630
BUT IT'S ONE THING TO
STAND UP TO YOUR PARENTS

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:00.970
AND QUITE ANOTHER TO STAND
UP FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE

00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:05.670
TO STRANGERS.

00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:09.630
SO AT SIX, HOW GOOD ARE OUR
CHILDREN AT STANDING UP

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:13.770
AND BEING COUNTED?

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:17.000
WHAT WE DID WAS TO GIVE
OUR CHILDREN A PHOTOGRAPH

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.170
OF A SWEET ELDERLY COUPLE,
WHO OUR EXPERIMENTER SAYS

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:24.330
IS ACTUALLY HER MOM AND DAD
AND VERY SPECIAL TO HER.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:27.730
THEN SHE ASKED THE
CHILDREN TO TEAR IT UP.

00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.700
&nbsp I WANT YOU TO TEAR IT UP.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:32.170
BUT WOULD THEY OBEY?

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:35.070
TYRESE TORE UP THE PHOTO
BUT THEN HE TRIED TO

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:40.100
PUT IT BACK TOGETHER
STRAIGHT AFTERWARDS.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:43.230
EVE QUESTIONED
THE INSTRUCTION.

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:45.470
WHY?

00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:50.200
&nbsp I JUST WANT YOU TO
&nbsp TEAR IT UP.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.370
&nbsp OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:53.870
BUT THEN OBEYED.

00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:55.600
SHE WILL STILL BOW
TO AUTHORITY

00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.970
EVEN IF IT GOES AGAINST
HER INSTINCTS.

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:02.730
NATHAN COULDN'T
BRING HIMSELF TO DO IT.

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:11.900
&nbsp I'D LIKE YOU TO
&nbsp RIP IT UP.

00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.470
&nbsp DO YOU NOT WANT
&nbsp TO RIP IT UP?

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:18.530
BUT CHARLIE WAS THE ONLY
CHILD WHO ACTIVELY REFUSED

00:57:18.530 --> 00:57:28.370
TO FOLLOW THE ORDER.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:31.170
&nbsp WHY DON'T YOU
&nbsp WANT TO RIP IT UP?

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:35.270
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:37.470
CHARLIE DISPLAYS THE
MOST IMPRESSIVE SENSE

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:39.630
OF MORAL INTEGRITY.

00:57:39.630 --> 00:57:41.230
BUT SHE ISN'T ALONE.

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.930
MOST OF OUR CHILDREN ARE
MUCH MORE MORAL THEN ADULTS

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:48.670
WHO DID SIMILAR OBEDIENCE
TESTS WORLD WIDE.

00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:52.130
THEIR FAMILIES ALL HAVE VERY
DIFFERENT VALUES AND BELIEFS

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:55.200
BUT ONE THING THEIR PARENTS
ALL WANT IS THEIR CHILDREN

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.300
TO HAVE RESPECT
FOR OTHER PEOPLE.

00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.800
AND IT SEEMS THAT
THEY HAVE.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.800
SOME PEOPLE SAY
THAT OUR SOCIETY

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.200
IS ON THE DOWNWARD SLIDE.

00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.670
WELL OUR CHILDREN
CERTAINLY AREN'T.

00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:11.630
THE SCABOROUGHS
HAVE MADE A DECISION.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:14.070
THEY'VE POSTPONED THE
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT

00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:17.000
UNTIL AFTER THEIR NEW
BABY HAS BEEN BORN.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.070
WITH THE FAMILY'S
DILEMMA LIFTED,

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:21.030
EVE CAN LOOK AHEAD.

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:24.900
I JUST SAW WHAT THE
BABY ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:28.930
IT JUST LOOKED SORT OF LIKE
THE SAME LIKE A REAL BABY

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:30.630
EXCEPT SO SMALL.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:34.000
JUST ABOUT THAT
LONG AND THAT FAT.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.630
&nbsp LIKE A LITTLE TADPOLE?

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:37.800
YA JUST LIKE A
LITTLE TADPOLE.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.700
IT WAS ACTUALLY LIKE
A LITTLE TADPOLE

00:58:39.700 --> 00:59:20.800
BUT WAS ABOUT THAT
LONG AND THAT FAT.
