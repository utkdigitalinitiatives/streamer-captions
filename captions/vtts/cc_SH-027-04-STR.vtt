00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.700


2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.200
Sir, the Germans have come

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.530
and desire to havethree of your horses:

4
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.500
the duke himself willbe at court to-morrow,

5
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.400
and they are going to meet him.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.070
What duke should thatbe comes so secretly?

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.400
I hear not of him in the court.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
Let me speak withthe gentlemen:

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.800
they speak English?

10
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.930
Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.030
They shall have my horses;but I'll make them pay;

12
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.700
I'll sauce them:

13
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.000
they have had my housea week at command;

14
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.230
I have turned away my otherguests: they must come off;

15
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.070
I'll sauce them. Come.

16
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:03.630
Is he at Master Ford'salready, think'st thou?

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.970
Sure he is by this,

18
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.770
or will be presently:

19
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.000
but, truly, he is verycourageous mad

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.170
about his throwing intothe water.

21
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.330
Mistress Ford desires youto come suddenly.

22
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.930
I'll be with her by andby;

23
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.170
I'll but bring my youngman here to school.

24
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.470
Look, where his mastercomes;

25
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.500
'tis a playing-day, I see.

26
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.930
How now, Sir Hugh! noschool to-day?

27
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.700
No; Master Slender

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.570
is let the boys leave toplay.

29
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.170
Blessing of his heart!

30
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.500
Sir Hugh, my husband saysmy son

31
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.530
profits nothing in theworld at his book.

32
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.130
I pray you, ask him somequestions in his accidence.

33
00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.370
Come hither, William;

34
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.800
hold up your head; come.

35
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.230
Come on, sirrah; hold upyour head;

36
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.570
answer your master, be notafraid.

37
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.400
What is 'fair,' William?

38
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.570
Pulcher.

39
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.800
Polecats! there are fairerthings than polecats, sure.

40
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.070
Peace your tattlings!

41
00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.800
You are a very simplicity'oman:

42
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.830
I pray you peace.

43
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.370
What is 'lapis,' William?

44
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.630
A stone.

45
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.930
And what is 'a stone,'William?

46
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.530
A pebble.

47
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.730
No, it is 'lapis:'

48
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.900
I pray you, remember inyour prain.

49
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.770
Lapis.

50
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.030
That is a good William.

51
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.730
What is he, William,

52
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.200
that does lend articles?

53
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.430
Articles are borrowedof the pronoun,

54
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.430
and be thus declined,Singulariter,

55
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.600
nominativo,

56
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.170
hic, haec, hoc.

57
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.070
Accusativo, hinc.

58
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.730
I pray you, have yourremembrance, child,

59
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.000
accusativo...

60
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.800
hinc...

61
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.970
...hang, hog.

62
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.000
'Hang-hog' is Latin forbacon, I warrant you.

63
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.170
Cease your prabbles.

64
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.570
What is your genitive caseplural, William?

65
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.230
Genitive case!

66
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.230
Ay.

67
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.930
Genitive,--horum, harum,horum.

68
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.370
Vengeance of Jenny'scase! fie on her!

69
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.230
never name her, child, ifshe be a whore.

70
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.270
For shame, 'oman.

71
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.470
You do ill to teachthe child such words:

72
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.270
he teaches him to hick andto hack,

73
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.230
which they'll do fastenough of themselves,

74
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.670
and to call 'horum:' shameon you!

75
00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.670
'Oman, art thou lunatics?

76
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.370
hast thou no understandingsfor thy cases

77
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.300
and the numbers of the genders?

78
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.570
You art as foolish Christiancreatures as I would desires.

79
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.100
I prithee, hold thy peace.

80
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.100
Go your ways, and play;go.

81
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.900
He is a better scholar

82
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.230
than I thought he was.

83
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.870
He is a good sprag memory.

84
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.270
Farewell, Mistress Page.

85
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.000
Adieu, good Sir Hugh.

86
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.230
Get you home, boy. Come,we stay too long.

87
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.100
Mistress Ford,

88
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.530
your sorrow hath eaten upmy sufferance.

89
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.470
I see you are obsequiousin your love,

90
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.700
and I profess requital

91
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.900
to a hair's breadth;

92
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.630
not only, Mistress Ford,

93
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.000
in the simple office oflove,

94
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.270
but in all theaccoutrement,

95
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.270
complement and ceremony ofit.

96
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.700
But are you sure of yourhusband now?

97
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.700
He's a-birding, sweet SirJohn.

98
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.330
What, ho, gossip Ford!what, ho!

99
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.030
Step into the chamber, SirJohn.

100
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.030
How now, sweetheart!

101
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.370
who's at home besidesyourself?

102
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.070
Why, none but mine ownpeople.

103
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.370
Indeed!

104
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.400
No, certainly.

105
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.000
Truly, I am so glad youhave nobody here.

106
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.100
Why?

107
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.970
Why, woman, your husband isin his old lunes again:

108
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.670
he so takes on yonderwith my husband;

109
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.700
so rails against allmarried mankind;

110
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.000
so curses all Eve'sdaughters,

111
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.600
of what complexion soever;

112
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600
and so buffets himself onthe forehead, crying,

113
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.030
'Peer out, peer out!

114
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.800
' that any madness I everyet beheld

115
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.930
seemed but tameness,civility and patience,

116
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.800
to this his distemper heis in now:

117
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.230
I am glad the fat knightis not here.

118
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.230
Why, does he talk of him?

119
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.630
Of none but him;

120
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.700
and swears he was carriedout,

121
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.100
the last time he searchedfor him, in a basket;

122
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.500
protests to my husband heis now here,

123
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.570
and hath drawn him

124
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.200
and the rest of theircompany from their sport,

125
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.330
to make another experimentof his suspicion:

126
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.470
but I am glad theknight is not here;

127
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.770
now he shall see his ownfoolery.

128
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.800
How near is he, MistressPage?

129
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.430
Hard by; at street end;

130
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.170
he will be here anon.

131
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.330
I am undone! The knight ishere.

132
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.830
Why then you are utterlyshamed,

133
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.070
and he's but a dead man.

134
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.300
What a woman are you!

135
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.170
--Away with him, away with him!

136
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.570
better shame than murder.

137
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.330
Which way should be go?

138
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.470
how should I bestow him?

139
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.470
Shall I put him into thebasket again?

140
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.900
No, I'll come no more i'the basket.

141
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.900
May I not go out ere hecome?

142
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.670
Alas, three of MasterFord's brothers

143
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.070
watch the door withpistols,

144
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.070
that none shall issue out;

145
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.000
otherwise you mightslip away ere he came.

146
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.970
But what make you here?

147
00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.370
What shall I do?

148
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.930
I'll creep up into thechimney.

149
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.200
There they always use

150
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.130
to discharge theirbirding-pieces.

151
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.370
Creep into the kiln-hole.

152
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:39.200
Where is it?

153
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.030
He will seek there, on myword.

154
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.270
Neither press, coffer,chest, trunk, well, vault,

155
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.230
but he hath an abstract

156
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:46.630
for the remembrance ofsuch places,

157
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.730
and goes to them by hisnote:

158
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.200
there is no hiding you inthe house.

159
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.870
I'll go out then.

160
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.800
If you go out in your ownsemblance, you die, Sir John.

161
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.530
Unless you go outdisguised--

162
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.870
How might we disguise him?

163
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.130
Alas the day, I know not!

164
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.830
There is no woman's gownbig enough for him

165
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.830
otherwise he might put ona hat,

166
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.170
a kerchief and a muffler,and so escape.

167
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.270
Good hearts, devisesomething:

168
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.300
any extremity rather thana mischief.

169
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.100
My maid's aunt, the fat woman ofBrentford, has a gown above.

170
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.400
On my word, it will servehim;

171
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.170
she's as big as he is:

172
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.900
and there's her thrummedhat and her muffler too.

173
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.400
Run up, Sir John.

174
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.600
Go, go, sweet Sir John:

175
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.770
Mistress Page and I will looksome linen for your head.

176
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.400
Quick, quick!

177
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.330
we'll come dress youstraight:

178
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.700
put on the gown the while.

179
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.430
I would my husband wouldmeet him in this shape:

180
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.170
he cannot abide the oldwoman of Brentford;

181
00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.970
he swears she's a witch;

182
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.870
forbade her my house and haththreatened to beat her.

183
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.770
Heaven guide him to thyhusband's cudgel,

184
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.400
and the devil guide hiscudgel afterwards!

185
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.900
But is my husband coming?

186
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.100
Ah, in good sadness, ishe;

187
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:52.430
and talks of the baskettoo,

188
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.570
howsoever he hath hadintelligence.

189
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.800
We'll try that;

190
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.870
for I'll appoint my men tocarry the basket again,

191
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.970
to meet him at the door withit, as they did last time.

192
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.800
Nay, but he'll be herepresently:

193
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.270
let's go dress him likethe witch of Brentford.

194
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.530
I'll first direct my men whatthey shall do with the basket.

195
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.000
Oh John! Robert!

196
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.470
Go up; I'll bring linenfor him straight.

197
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.530
Hang him, dishonestvarlet!

198
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.700
we cannot misuse himenough.

199
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.530
Go, sirs, carry this basketagain on your shoulders:

200
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.730
your master is hard atdoor;

201
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:25.500
if he bid you set it down,obey him:

202
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.170
quickly, dispatch.

203
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.600
Come, come, take it up.

204
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.600
Pray heaven it be notfull of knight again.

205
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.730
I hope not;

206
00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:39.070
I had as lief bear so muchlead.

207
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.630
Ay, but if it prove true,

208
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.870
Master Page,

209
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.430
have you any way thento unfool me again?

210
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.500
Set down the basket,villain!

211
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.330
Somebody call my wife.

212
00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.200
Youth in a basket!

213
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.930
O you panderly rascals!

214
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.300
there's a knot, a ging,

215
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.370
a pack, a conspiracyagainst me:

216
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.770
now shall the devil beshamed.

217
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.630
What, wife, I say! Come,come forth!

218
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:21.930
Behold what honest clothesyou send forth to bleaching!

219
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.570
Why, this passes, Master Ford;

220
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.670
you are not to goloose any longer;

221
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.630
you must be pinioned.

222
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.700
Why, this is lunatics!

223
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.100
this is mad as a mad dog!

224
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.170
Indeed, Master Ford, thisis not well, indeed.

225
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.370
So say I too, sir.

226
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.830
Come hither, MistressFord;

227
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:40.470
Mistress Ford the honestwoman,

228
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.570
the modest wife, thevirtuous creature,

229
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.200
that hath the jealousfool to her husband!

230
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.970
I suspect without cause,mistress, do I?

231
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.100
Heaven be my witness youdo,

232
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.500
if you suspect me in anydishonesty.

233
00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:01.670
Well said, brazen-face!hold it out.

234
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.730
Come forth, sirrah!

235
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.900
This passes!

236
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.900
Are you not ashamed? letthe clothes alone.

237
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.970
I shall find you anon.

238
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.470
'Tis unreasonable!

239
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.000
Will you take up yourwife's clothes?

240
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.570
Come away.

241
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.400
Empty the basket, I say!

242
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.430
Why, man, why?

243
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.100
Master Page, as I am aman,

244
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.270
there was one conveyed out of myhouse yesterday in this basket:

245
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.900
why may not he be thereagain?

246
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.900
In my house I am sure heis:

247
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:35.300
my intelligence is true;

248
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.430
my jealousy is reasonable.

249
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:44.300
Pluck me out all thelinen.

250
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.500
If you find a man there, heshall die a flea's death.

251
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.530
Here's no man.

252
00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.600
By my fidelity, Master Ford,this is not well,

253
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.630
this wrongs you.

254
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.470
Master Ford, you mustpray,

255
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.130
and not follow the imaginationsof your own heart:

256
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.100
this is jealousies.

257
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.000
Well, he's not here I seekfor.

258
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.170
No, nor nowhere else butin your brain.

259
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.070
Help to search my housethis one time.

260
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.100
If I find not what I seek,

261
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.500
show no colour for myextremity;

262
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.500
let me for ever be yourtable-sport;

263
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.670
let them say of me,

264
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:23.700
'As jealous as Ford,

265
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.000
Chat searched a hollowwalnut

266
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.130
for his wife's leman.'

267
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.570
Satisfy me once more;

268
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.670
once more search with me.

269
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.600
Mistress Page! come youand the old woman down;

270
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.130
my husband will come intothe chamber.

271
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.500
Old woman! what oldwoman's that?

272
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.630
Nay, it is my maid's auntof Brentford.

273
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:50.500
A witch, a quean, an oldcozening quean!

274
00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.170
Have I not forbid her myhouse?

275
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.230
She comes of errands, doesshe?

276
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.100
We are simple men;

277
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.030
we do not know what'sbrought to pass

278
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.330
under the profession offortune-telling.

279
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:05.600
She works by charms, byspells, by the figure,

280
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.370
and such daubery as thisis,

281
00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.730
beyond our element we knownothing.

282
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.930
Come down, you witch,

283
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.930
you hag, you; come down, Isay!

284
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.370
Nay, good, sweet husband!

285
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.570
Good gentlemen, let himnot strike the old woman.

286
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.000
Come, Mother Prat;

287
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.730
come, give me your hand.

288
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.500
I'll prat her.

289
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.100
Out of my door, you witch,

290
00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:36.030
you hag, you baggage,

291
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:38.100
you polecat, you runyon!

292
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:44.830
out, out! I'll conjureyou,

293
00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:48.800
I'll fortune-tell you.

294
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.400
Are you not ashamed?

295
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.970
I think you have killedthe poor woman.

296
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.800
Nay, he will do it.

297
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.200
'Tis a goodly credit foryou.

298
00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.370
Hang her, witch!

299
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.300
By the yea and no,

300
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.570
I think the 'oman is awitch indeed:

301
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.800
I like not when a 'omanhas a great peard;

302
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.130
I spy a great peard underhis muffler.

303
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.300
Will you follow,gentlemen?

304
00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:56.470
I beseech you, follow;

305
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.730
see but the issue of myjealousy:

306
00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.270
if I cry out thus upon notrail,

307
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.900
never trust me when I openagain.

308
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.330
Let's obey his humour alittle further:

309
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.930
come, gentlemen.

310
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:25.630
Trust me, he beat him mostpitifully.

311
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.970
Nay, by the mass, that hedid not;

312
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.170
he beat him mostunpitifully, methought.

313
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.270
I'll have the cudgel hallowedand hung o'er the altar;

314
00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.000
it hath done meritoriousservice.

315
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.230
What think you? may we,

316
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.000
with the warrant ofwomanhood

317
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.430
and the witness of a goodconscience,

318
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.000
pursue him with anyfurther revenge?

319
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.170
The spirit of wantonnessis,

320
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.630
sure, scared out of him:

321
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:49.430
he will never, I think,attempt us again.

322
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:57.230
(laughing like a maniac)

323
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.070
(gunshots)

324
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.330
Shall we tell our husbandshow we have served him?

325
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.830
Yes, by all means;

326
00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.130
if it be but to scrape thefigures

327
00:15:33.130 --> 00:15:36.530
out of your husband'sbrains.

328
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.030
If they can find in theirhearts

329
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.870
the poor unvirtuous fatknight

330
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.030
shall be any furtherafflicted,

331
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.770
we two will still be theministers.

332
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.300
I'll warrant they'll havehim publicly shamed:

333
00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.770
and methinks there wouldbe no period to the jest,

334
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.970
should he not be publiclyshamed.

335
00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.770
Come, to the forge withit then; shape it:

336
00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.000
I would not have thingscool.

337
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:18.330
(dogs barking)

338
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.330
I would all the worldwere cozened;

339
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:34.400
for I have been cozenedand beaten too.

340
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.400
If it should come

341
00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:36.170
to the ear of the court,

342
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:37.830
how I have been transformed

343
00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.800
and how my transformation hathbeen washed and cudgelled,

344
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.200
they would melt me outof my fat drop by drop

345
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.000
and liquor fisherman'sboots with me.

346
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.270
I warrant they would whipme with their fine wits

347
00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:55.370
till I were as crest-fallenas a dried pear.

348
00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:00.230
I never prospered since Iforswore myself at primero.

349
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.100
Well, if I had wind enough tosay my prayers,

350
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:09.530
I would repent.

351
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.470
(barking)

352
00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.630
'Tis one of the bestdiscretions

353
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.230
of a 'oman as ever I didlook upon.

354
00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:21.800
And did he send you boththese letters at an instant?

355
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.430
Within a quarter of anhour.

356
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:36.170
Pardon me, wife.

357
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.430
Henceforth do what thouwilt;

358
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.170
I rather will suspect thesun with cold

359
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.300
Than thee with wantonness:

360
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:45.930
now doth thy honour stand

361
00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.700
In him that was of late anheretic,

362
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:54.370
As firm as faith.

363
00:17:54.370 --> 00:18:01.300
'Tis well, 'tis well; nomore:

364
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.600
Be not as extreme insubmission

365
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.030
As in offence.

366
00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.770
But let our plot goforward:

367
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.770
let our wives Yet onceagain,

368
00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.130
to make us public sport,

369
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.730
Appoint a meeting withthis old fat fellow,

370
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.670
Where we may take him anddisgrace him for it.

371
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.770
There is no better waythan that they spoke of.

372
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.000
How? to send him word

373
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.830
they'll meet him inthe park at midnight?

374
00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:24.470
Fie, fie! he'll nevercome.

375
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.900
You say he has beenthrown in the rivers

376
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.030
and has been grievouslypeaten as an old 'oman:

377
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:31.330
methinks there should beterrors

378
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.270
in him that he should notcome;

379
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.330
methinks his flesh ispunished,

380
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.070
he shall have no desires.

381
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.270
So think I too.

382
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.600
Devise but how you'll usehim when he comes,

383
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.230
And let us two devise tobring him thither.

384
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:47.370
There is an old tale goesthat Herne the hunter,

385
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.000
Sometime a keeper here inWindsor forest,

386
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.300
Doth all the winter-time,at still midnight,

387
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:58.870
Walk round about an oak,with great ragg'd horns;

388
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:02.700
And there he blasts thetree and takes the cattle

389
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:07.700
And makes milch-kine yieldblood and shakes a chain

390
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.830
In a most hideous anddreadful manner:

391
00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:11.970
You have heard of such aspirit,

392
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.930
and well you know thesuperstitious idle-headed eld

393
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.570
Received and did deliverto our age

394
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:18.830
This tale of Herne thehunter for a truth.

395
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.300
Why, yet there want notmany

396
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.770
that do fear in deep ofnight

397
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.430
to walk by this Herne'soak:

398
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.570
But what of this?

399
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.030
Marry, this is our device;

400
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.870
That Falstaff at that oakshall meet with us.

401
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.130
Diguised like hern with hugehorns on his head.

402
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.730
Well, let it not bedoubted but he'll come:

403
00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:35.530
And in this shape when youhave brought him thither,

404
00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.670
What shall be done withhim?

405
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:37.730
what is your plot?

406
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.670
That also have wethought upon, and thus:

407
00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.300
Nan Page my daughter andmy little son

408
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.300
And three or four more

409
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.430
of their growth we'lldress like urchins,

410
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:49.600
ouphes and fairies, greenand white,

411
00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.370
With rounds of waxentapers on their heads,

412
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.200
And rattles in theirhands:

413
00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.070
upon a sudden,

414
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:57.700
As Falstaff, she and I,are newly met,

415
00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.130
Let them from forth asawpit rush at once

416
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.070
With some diffused song:

417
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.930
upon their sight,

418
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.400
We two in great amazednesswill fly:

419
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.670
Then let them all encirclehim about

420
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.970
And, fairy-like,

421
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.470
to-pinch the uncleanknight,

422
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.830
And ask him why,

423
00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.330
that hour of fairy revel,

424
00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.930
In their so sacred paths

425
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.070
he dares to tread

426
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:18.670
In shape profane.

427
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.200
And till he tell thetruth,

428
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.000
Let the supposed fairiespinch him sound

429
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.470
And burn him with theirtapers.

430
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.570
The truth being known,

431
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.400
We'll all presentourselves,

432
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.630
dis-horn the spirit,

433
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.800
And mock him home toWindsor.

434
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.270
The children must bepractised well

435
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.400
to this, or they'll ne'erdo't.

436
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.700
I will teach the childrentheir behaviors;

437
00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.430
and I will be like ajack-an-apes

438
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.970
also, to burn the knightwith my taber.

439
00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.670
That will be excellent.

440
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:46.870
I'll go and buy themvizards.

441
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.130
My Nan shall be the queenof all the fairies,

442
00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.370
Finely attired in a robeof white.

443
00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.200
That silk will I go buy.

444
00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:57.830
And in that time

445
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.200
Shall Master Slender stealmy Nan away

446
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.000
And marry her at Eton.

447
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.800
Go send to Falstaffstraight.

448
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.670
Nay I'll to him again inname of Brook

449
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.370
He'll tell me all hispurpose:

450
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.600
sure, he'll come.

451
00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.500
Fear not you that.

452
00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.400
Go get us properties

453
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.030
And tricking for ourfairies.

454
00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.030
Let us about it:

455
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.400

456
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.970
and fery honest knaveries.

457

And none but he, to marrywith Nan Page.

And he my husband best ofall affects.

468
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.030
Though twenty thousandworthier come to crave her.

What wouldst thou have,boor?

470

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.800
and I paid nothing for itneither,

548
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.800
but was paid for mylearning.

549
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:49.770
Out, alas, sir! cozenage,mere cozenage!

550
00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.000

Run away with thecozeners;

553
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.330
for so soon as I camebeyond Eton,

554
00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.900
they threw me off frombehind

555
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.130
one of them, in a sloughof mire;

556
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:04.430
and set spurs and away,

557
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.270
like three German devils,

558
00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.670
three Doctor Faustuses.

559
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:11.570
They are gone

560
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.930

562
00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.200

Now, whence come you?

I have suffered more fortheir sakes,

598
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.200
more than the villanousinconstancy

599
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.800
of man's disposition isable to bear.

600
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.530

What tellest thou me ofblack and blue?

607
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:07.670

Who mutually hath answer'dmy affection,

So far forth as herselfmight be her chooser,

639
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.470
Even to my wish:

640
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.370
I have a letter from her

641
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:28.700
Of such contents as youwill wonder at;

642
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.370
The mirth whereof solarded with my matter,

643
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.270
That neither singly can bemanifested,

644
00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.700
Without the show of both;

fat Falstaff hath a greatscene:

646
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:40.500

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.630
I'll show you here atlarge.

648
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.700
Hark, good mine host.

649
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.970
To-night at Herne's oak,

650
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.670
just 'twixt twelve andone,

651
00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.200
Must my sweet Nan presentthe Fairy Queen;

652
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.530
The purpose why, is here:

653
00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.700
in which disguise,

654
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.130
While other jests

655
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.900
are something rank onfoot,

656
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.770
Her father hath commandedher

657
00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.070
to slip away with Slender

658
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.130
and with him at Eton

659
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.500
Immediately to marry:

660
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:05.700
she hath consented:

661
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:07.000
Now, sir, Her mother,

662
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.570
ever strong against thatmatch

663
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.000
And firm for Doctor Caius,

664
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.330
hath appointed

665
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.770
that he shall likewiseshuffle her away,

666
00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:14.770
While other sports

667
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:16.370
are tasking of theirminds,

668
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:17.430
And at the deanery,

669
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:18.470
where a priest attends,

670
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.370
Straight marry her:

671
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:22.100
to this her mother's plot

672
00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:23.330
She seemingly obedientlikewise hath

673
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:24.870
Made promise to thedoctor.

674
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:26.630
Now, thus it rests:

675
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:29.530
Her father means she shallbe all in white,

676
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:30.600
And in that habit,

677
00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.770
when Slender sees his time

678
00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.070
To take her by the hand

679
00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:33.800
and bid her go,

680
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.370
She shall go with him:

681
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.770
her mother hath intended,

682
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.270
The better to denote herto the doctor,

683
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:40.400
For they must all bemask'd and vizarded,

684
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.430
That quaint in green

685
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.830
she shall be looseenrobed,

686
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:45.070
With ribands pendent,

687
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.370
flaring 'bout her head;

688
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:48.570
And when the doctor spieshis vantage ripe,

689
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.570
To pinch her by the hand,

690
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:50.530
and, on that token,

691
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.730
The maid hath givenconsent to go with him.

692
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.200
Which means she todeceive, father or mother?

693
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.000
Both, my good host, to goalong with me:

694
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.200
And here it rests,

695
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.830
that you'll procure thevicar

696
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:03.970

'twixt twelve and one,

698
00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.300
And, in the lawful name ofmarrying,

699
00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.730
To give our hearts unitedceremony.

700
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:11.170
