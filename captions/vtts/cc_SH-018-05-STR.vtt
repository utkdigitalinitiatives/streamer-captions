00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070


2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.870
Sir, you have done enough,

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.200
and have perform'd asaint-like sorrow:

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.630
no fault could youmake,

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.530
Which you have notredeem'd;

6
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.300
indeed, paid down morepenitence

7
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.970
than done trespass:

8
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.700
at the last,

9
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.370
Do as the heavens havedone, forget your evil;

10
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.030
With them forgiveyourself.

11
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.300
Whilst I remember her andher virtues,

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.930
I cannot forget myblemishes in them,

13
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.930
and so still think ofthe wrong I did myself;

14
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.870
which was so much,

15
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.400
That heirless it hath mademy kingdom

16
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.070
and destroy'd the sweet'stcompanion

17
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.400
that e'er manbred his hopes out of.

18
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.830
True, too true, my lord:

19
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.470
If, one by one, you weddedall the world,

20
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.330
Or from the all that aretook something good,

21
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.870
To make a perfect woman,

22
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.500
she you kill'd would beunparallel'd.

23
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.800
I think so. Kill'd!

24
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.500
She I kill'd! I did so:

25
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.600
but thou strikest mesorely, to say I did;

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.070
it is as bitter upon thytongue as in my thought:

27
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.270
now, good now,

28
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.230
Say so but seldom.

29
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.700
Not at all, good lady:

30
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.200
You might have spoken athousand things

31
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.900
that would have donethe time more benefit

32
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.230
and graced yourkindness better.

33
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.770
You are one of those wouldhave him wed again.

34
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.370
If you would not so,

35
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.730
You pity not the state,

36
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.000
nor the remembrance of hismost sovereign name;

37
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.870
consider little whatdangers,

38
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.000
by his highness'fail of issue,

39
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.800
May drop upon his kingdom

40
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.770
and devour incertainlookers on.

41
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.800
What were more holy

42
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.400
than to rejoice the formerqueen is well?

43
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.970
What holier than, forroyalty's repair,

44
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.830
For present comfort andfor future good,

45
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.430
To bless the bed ofmajesty again

46
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.070
with a sweetfellow to't?

47
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.930
There is none worthy,

48
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.870
Respecting her that'sgone.

49
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.830
Besides, the gods will

50
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.200
have fulfill'd theirsecret purposes;

51
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.600
For has not the divineApollo said,

52
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.670
Is't not the tenor of hisoracle,

53
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.570
That King Leontes shallnot have an heir

54
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.230
till hislost child be found?

55
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.430
which that it shall, isall as monstrous

56
00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.570
to ourhuman reason

57
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.530
As my Antigonus to breakhis grave

58
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.100
and come againto me; who, on my life,

59
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.270
Did perish with theinfant.

60
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.670
'Tis your counsel my lord

61
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.400
should to the heavensbe contrary,

62
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.100
Oppose against theirwills.

63
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.670
Care not for issue;

64
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.600
The crown will find anheir:

65
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.500
great Alexander left histo the worthiest;

66
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.670
so his successor was liketo be the best.

67
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.970
Good Paulina,

68
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.230
Who hast the memory ofHermione,

69
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.830
I know, in honour,

70
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.300
O, that ever I had squaredme to thy counsel!

71
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.300
then, even now,

72
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.800
I might have look'd uponmy queen's full eyes,

73
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.400
Have taken treasure fromher lips--

74
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.070
And left them more richfor what they yielded.

75
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.830
Thou speak'st truth.

76
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.200
No more such wives;

77
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.730
therefore, no wife: oneworse,

78
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.930
And better used,

79
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.000
would make her sainted spiritagain possess her corpse,

80
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and on this stage,

81
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.900
Where we're offenders now,appear soul-vex'd,

82
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.230
And begin, 'Why to me?'

83
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.070
Had she such power,

84
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.870
She had just cause.

85
00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.630
She had; and would incenseme to murder her I married.

86
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.500
I should so.

87
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.730
Were I the ghost thatwalk'd,

88
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.800
I'ld bid you mark her eye,

89
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.230
and tell me for what dullpart in't you chose her;

90
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.770
then I'ld shriek, thateven your ears should rift

91
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.330
to hear me;

92
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.130
and the words thatfollow'd should be

93
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.070
'Remember mine.'

94
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.100
Stars, stars, And all eyeselse dead coals!

95
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.270
Fear thou no wife;

96
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.300
I'll have no wife,Paulina.

97
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.070
Will you swear never tomarry

98
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.100
but by my freeleave?

99
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.330
Never, Paulina; so beblest my spirit!

100
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.000
Then, good my lords, bearwitness to his oath.

101
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.370
You tempt him over-much.

102
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.900
Unless another,

103
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.930
As like Hermione as is herpicture,

104
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.730
Affront his eye.

105
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.370
Good madam,--

106
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.030
I have done.

107
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.930
Yet, if my lord willmarry,--if you will, sir,

108
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.430
No remedy, but you will,

109
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.170
--give me the office tochoose you a queen:

110
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.370
she shall not be so youngas was your former;

111
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.970
but she shall be such

112
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.730
as,walk'd your firstqueen's ghost,

113
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.900
it should take joy to seeher in your arms.

114
00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.530
My true Paulina,

115
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.570
We shall not marry tillthou bid'st us.

116
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.370
That shall be when your firstqueen's again in breath;

117
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.770
Never till then.

118
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.470
One that gives out himselfPrince Florizel,

119
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.130
Son of Polixenes, with hisprincess,

120
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.400
she the fairest I have yetbeheld,

121
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.270
desires access to yourhigh presence.

122
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.730
What with him?

123
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.030
he comes not like to hisfather's greatness:

124
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.200
his approach, so out ofcircumstance and sudden,

125
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.830
tells us 'Tis not avisitation framed,

126
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.570
but forced by need andaccident. What train?

127
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.570
But few, and those butmean.

128
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.700
His princess, say you,with him?

129
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.670
Ay, the most peerlesspiece of earth, I think,

130
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.770
That e'er the sun shonebright on.

131
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.270
O Hermione,

132
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.200
As every present time dothboast itself

133
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.570
above abetter gone,

134
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.630
so must thy grave give wayto what's seen now!

135
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.200
Sir, you yourself havesaid and writ so,

136
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.970
but your writing now iscolder than that theme,

137
00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.970
'She had not been, Nor wasnot to be equall'd;'

138
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.230
--thus your verse flow'dwith her beauty once:

139
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.330
'tis shrewdly ebb'd,

140
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.930
to say you have seena better.

141
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.070
Pardon, madam:

142
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.500
The one I have almostforgot,--your pardon,--

143
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.870
The other, when she hasobtain'd your eye,

144
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.170
Will have your tongue too.This is a creature,

145
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.270
Would she begin a sect,

146
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.830
might quench the zeal o fall professors else,

147
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.100
make proselytes of who shebut bid follow.

148
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.470
How! not women?

149
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.530
Women will love her,

150
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.730
that she is a woman moreworth than any man; men,

151
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.030
that she is the rarest ofall women.

152
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:39.770
Go, Cleomenes;

153
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.470
Yourself, assisted withyour honour'd friends,

154
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.000
Bring them to ourembracement.

155
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.600
Still, 'tis strange

156
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.900
He thus should steal uponus.

157
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.770
Had our prince,

158
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.230
Jewel of children, seenthis hour,

159
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.170
he had pair'd well withthis lord:

160
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.600
there was not full a monthbetween their births.

161
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.670
Prithee, no more; cease;

162
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.530
thou know'st he dies to meagain when talk'd of:

163
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.570
sure, When I shall seethis gentleman,

164
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.170
thy speeches will bring meto consider

165
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.300
that which mayunfurnish me of reason.

166
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.200
They are come.

167
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.500
Your mother was most trueto wedlock, prince;

168
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.130
For she did print yourroyal father off,

169
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.900
Conceiving you: were I buttwenty-one,

170
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.930
Your father's image is sohit in you,

171
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.470
His very air, that Ishould call you brother,

172
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.400
As I did him,

173
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.470
and speak ofsomething wildly by us

174
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.700
perform'd before.

175
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.800
Most dearly welcome!and your fair princess,

176
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.730
--goddess!--O,alas!

177
00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.500
I lost a couple,

178
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.470
that 'twixt heaven andearth

179
00:06:58.470 --> 00:06:59.430
might thus have stood

180
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:02.630
begetting wonder as you,gracious couple, do:

181
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.370
and then I lost--

182
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.170
All mine own folly--thesociety,

183
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.470
Amity too, of your bravefather, whom,

184
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:08.430
Though bearing misery,

185
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.900
I desire my life once moreto look on him.

186
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.800
By his command have I heretouch'd Sicilia

187
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.670
and from him give you allgreetings

188
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:17.670
that a king, at friend,

189
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.530
Can send his brother:

190
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.000
and, but infirmity whichwaits upon worn times

191
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.070
hath something seized hiswish'd ability,

192
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.330
he had himself the lands andwaters 'twixt your throne

193
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.200
and his measured to lookupon you; whom he loves--

194
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.000
He bade me say so--

195
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.970
more than all the sceptres

196
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.870
and those that bear themliving.

197
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.600
O my brother,

198
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.430
Good gentleman!

199
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.770
the wrongs I have done theestir afresh within me,

200
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.200
and these thy offices, Sorarely kind,

201
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.770
are as interpreters of mybehind-hand slackness.

202
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.300
Welcome hither, As is thespring to the earth.

203
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.130
And hath he too exposedthis paragon

204
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.130
to thefearful usage,

205
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.700
At least ungentle, of thedreadful Neptune,

206
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.070
To greet a man not worthher pains,

207
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.970
much less the adventure ofher person?

208
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:02.630
Good my lord,

209
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:04.830
She came from Libya.

210
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.030
Where the warlike Smalus,

211
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.030
That noble honour'd lord,is fear'd and loved?

212
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.930
Most royal sir, fromthence; from him,

213
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.400
whose daughter his tearsproclaim'd his,

214
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.030
parting with her: thence,

215
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.300
A prosperous south-windfriendly, we have cross'd,

216
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.870
To execute the charge myfather gave me

217
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.330
for visiting your highness:

218
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.970
my best train I have from yourSicilian shores dismiss'd;

219
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.370
Who for Bohemia bend,

220
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.470
to signify not only mysuccess in Libya, sir,

221
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.830
But my arrival

222
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:33.200
and my wife's in safetyhere where we are.

223
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.230
The blessed gods purge allinfection from our air

224
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.570
whilst you do climatehere!

225
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.500
You have a holy father, Agraceful gentleman;

226
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.370
against whose person,

227
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.900
So sacred as it is, I havedone sin:

228
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.530
For which the heavens,taking angry note,

229
00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:00.330
Have left me issueless;and your father's blest,

230
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.570
As he from heaven meritsit,

231
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.770
with you worthy hisgoodness.

232
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.800
What might Ihave been,

233
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.500
Might I a son and daughternow have look'd on,

234
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.670
Such goodly things as you!

235
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.830
Most noble sir,

236
00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.230
That which I shall reportwill bear no credit,

237
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.070
Were not the proof so nigh.Please you, great sir,

238
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.800
Bohemia greets you fromhimself by me;

239
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.600
Desires you to attach hisson, who has--

240
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.800
His dignity and duty bothcast off--

241
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.100
Fled from his father, fromhis hopes,

242
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:31.300
and with a shepherd'sdaughter.

243
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.870
Where's Bohemia? speak.

244
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.070
Here in your city; I nowcame from him:

245
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.170
I speak amazedly;

246
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.970
and it becomes my marveland my message.

247
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.200
To your court whiles he washastening, in the chase,

248
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.970
it seems, of this faircouple,

249
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:47.230
meets he on the way thefather of this seeming lady

250
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.430
and her brother,

251
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.000
having both their countryquitted with this young prince.

252
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.600
Camillo has betray'd me;

253
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.730
Whose honour and whosehonesty

254
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.930
till now enduredall weathers.

255
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.330
Lay't so to his charge:

256
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:57.870
He's with the king yourfather.

257
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.730
Who? Camillo?

258
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.970
Camillo, sir; I spake withhim;

259
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.130
who now has these poor menin question.

260
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.700
Never saw I wretches soquake: they kneel,

261
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.670
they kiss the earth;

262
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.670
Forswear themselves asoften as they speak:

263
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.500
Bohemia stops his ears,

264
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.430
and threatens them withdivers deaths in death.

265
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:16.770
O my poor father!

266
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.630
The heaven sets spies uponus,

267
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.570
will not have our contractcelebrated.

268
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.700
You are married?

269
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.770
We are not, sir, nor arewe like to be;

270
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.000
The stars, I see, willkiss the valleys first:

271
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.800
The odds for high andlow's alike.

272
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.900
My lord, Is this thedaughter of a king?

273
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:45.370
She is, when once she ismy wife.

274
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.270
That 'once' I see by yourgood father's speed

275
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.570
will come on very slowly.

276
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.270
I am sorry,

277
00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.500
Most sorry, you have brokenfrom his liking

278
00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.430
Where you were tied induty,

279
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.770
and as sorry your choiceis not so rich in worthas beauty,

280
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.970
That you might well enjoyher.

281
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.600
Dear, look up:

282
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.270
Though Fortune, visible anenemy,

283
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.230
Should chase us with myfather,

284
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:11.070
power no jot hath she tochange our loves.

285
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.730
Beseech you, sir, remembersince you owed no more

286
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.830
to time than I do now:

287
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.070
with thought of suchaffections,

288
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.070
Step forth mine advocate;at your request

289
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.400
my father will grantprecious things as trifles.

290
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.270
Would he do so, I'ld begyour precious mistress,

291
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.330
Which he counts but atrifle.

292
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.870
Sir, my liege,

293
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.270
Your eye hath too muchyouth in't:

294
00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.270
not a month 'Fore yourqueen died,

295
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.630
she was more worth suchgazes

296
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.470
than what you look onnow.

297
00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:42.430
I thought of her,

298
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.430
Even in these looks Imade.

299
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.770
But your petition is yetunanswer'd.

300
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.030
I will to your father:

301
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.870
your honour not o'erthrownby your desires,

302
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.170
I am friend to them andyou:

303
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.900
upon which errand I now gotoward him;

304
00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:01.700
therefore follow me andmark what way I make:

305
00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.900
come, good my lord.

306
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:18.270
Beseech you, sir, were youpresent at this relation?

307
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.970
I was by at the opening ofthe fardel,

308
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.670
heard the old shepherddeliver the manner

309
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:23.970
how he found it:

310
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.730
whereupon, after a littleamazedness,

311
00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.470
we were all commanded outof the chamber;

312
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.470
only this methought Iheard the shepherd say,

313
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.300
he found the child.

314
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.800
I would most gladly knowthe issue of it.

315
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.430
I make a broken deliveryof the business;

316
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.370
but the changes I perceivedin the king and Camillo

317
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.930
were very notes ofadmiration:

318
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.030
they seemed almost, withstaring on one another,

319
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.030
to tear the cases of theireyes;

320
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.670
there was speech intheir dumbness,

321
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.130
language in their verygesture;

322
00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.230
they looked as they hadheard of a world ransomed,

323
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:59.830
or one destroyed:

324
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.000
a notable passion ofwonder appeared in them;

325
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.630
but the wisest beholder,

326
00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.600
that knew no more butseeing,

327
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.230
could not say if theimportance were joy or sorrow;

328
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:13.270
but in the extremity ofthe one, it must needs be.

329
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.370
Here comes a gentlemanthat haply knows more.

330
00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:17.900
The news, Rogero?

331
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.300
Nothing but bonfires: theoracle is fulfilled;

332
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.230
the king's daughter isfound:

333
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:25.330
such a deal of wonder isbroken out within this hour

334
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.370
that ballad-makers cannotbe able to express it.

335
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.770
Here comes the LadyPaulina's steward:

336
00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.030
he can deliver you more.How goes it now, sir?

337
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.600
this news which is calledtrue

338
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.070
is so like an old tale

339
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.430
that the verity of it isin strong suspicion:

340
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.670
has the king found hisheir?

341
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.400
Most true, if ever truth werepregnant by circumstance:

342
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.170
that which you hear you'llswear you see,

343
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.400
there issuch unity in the proofs.

344
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.000
The mantle of QueenHermione's,

345
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.470
her jewelabout the neck of it,

346
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.300
the letters of Antigonusfound with it

347
00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.270
which theyknow to be his character,

348
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:59.170
the majesty of the creaturein resemblance of the mother,

349
00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.500
the affection of nobleness

350
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.430
which nature shows aboveher breeding,

351
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.970
and many other evidencesproclaim her with all certainty

352
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.930
to be the king's daughter.

353
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.830
Did you see the meeting ofthe two kings?

354
00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:12.870
No.

355
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:14.100
Then have you lost asight,

356
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.170
which was to be seen,

357
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.030
cannot be spoken of.

358
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:19.700
There might you have beheldone joy crown another,

359
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.970
so and in such manner thatit seemed sorrow

360
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.300
wept totake leave of them,

361
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.900
for their joy waded intears.

362
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.300
There was castingup of eyes,

363
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:28.830
holding up of hands,

364
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.700
with countenances of suchdistraction

365
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.200
that they wereto be known by garment,

366
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.930
not by favour.

367
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.870
Our king, being ready toleap out of himself

368
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.700
for joy of hisfound daughter,

369
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.830
as if that joy were nowbecome a loss,

370
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.830
cries 'O, thy mother, thymother!'

371
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:45.530
then asks Bohemiaforgiveness;

372
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.270
then embraceshis son-in-law;

373
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.170
then again worries he hisdaughter with clipping her;

374
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:51.800
now he thanks the oldshepherd,

375
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.770
which stands by like aweather-bitten conduit

376
00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.900
of many kings' reigns.

377
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.030
I never heard of suchanother encounter,

378
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.870
which lames report tofollow it

379
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.230
and undoesdescription to do it.

380
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.000
What, pray you, became ofAntigonus,

381
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.030
that carriedhence the child?

382
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:07.770
Like an old tale still,

383
00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.500
which will have matter torehearse,

384
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.900
though credit be asleepand not an ear open.

385
00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.300
He was torn to pieces witha bear:

386
00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.670
this avouches theshepherd's son;

387
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.270
who has not only hisinnocence,

388
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.270
which seemsmuch, to justify him,

389
00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.530
but a handkerchief andrings

390
00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.500
of his that Paulinaknows.

391
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.030
What became of his barkand his followers?

392
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.300
Wrecked the same instantof their master's death

393
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.970
and in the view of theshepherd:

394
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.230
so that all theinstruments

395
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.800
which aided toexpose the child

396
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.770
were even then lost whenit was found.

397
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:42.130
But O, the noble combatthat 'twixt joy and sorrow

398
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.000
was fought in Paulina!

399
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.430
She had one eye declined

400
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:47.000
for the loss of herhusband,

401
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.500
another elevated that theoracle was fulfilled:

402
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.130
she lifted the princessfrom the earth,

403
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.800
and solocks her in embracing,

404
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.130
as if she would pinher to her heart

405
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.970
that she might no morebe in danger of losing.

406
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.570
The dignity of this actwas worth the audience

407
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:06.070
of kings and princes; forby such was it acted.

408
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:08.300
One of the prettiesttouches of all

409
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.700
and that which angledfor mine eyes,

410
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.730
caught the water thoughnot the fish, was when,

411
00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:13.700
at the relation of thequeen's death,

412
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.330
with the manner how she cameto't bravely confessed

413
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:18.230
and lamented by the king,

414
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:21.230
how attentivenesswounded his daughter;

415
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.200
till, from one sign ofdolour to another, she did,

416
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.700
with an 'Alas,'

417
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.730
I would fain say, bleedtears,

418
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.470
for I am sure my heartwept blood.

419
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.330
Who was most marble therechanged colour;

420
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:37.000
someswooned, all sorrowed:

421
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.070
if all the world couldhave seen 't,

422
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:42.430
the woe hadbeen universal.

423
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.400
Are they returned to thecourt?

424
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.000
No: the princess hearingof her mother's statue,

425
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.870
which is in the keeping ofPaulina,

426
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.100
--a piece many years in doingand now newly performed

427
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.930
by that rareItalian master,

428
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.830
Julio Romano, who, had hehimself eternity

429
00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.930
and couldput breath into his work,

430
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.800
would beguile Nature ofher custom,

431
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.300
so perfectly he is herape:

432
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.130
he so near to Hermionehath done Hermione

433
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:09.970
that they say one wouldspeak to her

434
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.430
and stand inhope of answer:

435
00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.070
thither with allgreediness of affection

436
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:14.770
are they gone,

437
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:16.300
and there they intend tosup.

438
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.030
I thought she had somegreat matter there in hand;

439
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.030
for she hath privatelytwice or thrice a day,

440
00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.800
ever since the death ofHermione,

441
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.900
visited that removedhouse.

442
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.200
Shall we thither and with ourcompany piece the rejoicing?

443
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:31.570
Who would be thence thathas the benefit of access?

444
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.430
every wink of an eye somenew grace will be born:

445
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:38.330
our absence makes usunthrifty to our knowledge.

446
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.400
Let's along.

447
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:50.200
Now, had I not the dash ofmy former life in me,

448
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.530
would preferment drop onmy head.

449
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.700
I brought the old man andhis son aboard the prince:

450
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.100
told him I heard them talk ofa fardel and I know not what:

451
00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.670
but he at that time,overfond

452
00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.370
of the shepherd'sdaughter,

453
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.230
so he then took her to be,

454
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:05.800
who began to be muchsea-sick,

455
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.970
and himself little better,

456
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.000
extremity of weathercontinuing,

457
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.630
this mystery remainedundiscovered.

458
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.670
But 'tis all one tome; for had I been

459
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.570
the finder out of this secret,

460
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.500
it would not have relishedamong my other discredits.

461
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.100
Here come those I have donegood to against my will,

462
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.430
and already appearing in theblossoms of their fortune.

463
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:34.170
Come, boy; I am past moechildren,

464
00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:39.430
but thy sons and daughterswill be all gentlemen born.

465
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.100
You are well met, sir.

466
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.900
You denied to fight withme this other day,

467
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.830
becauseI was no gentleman born.

468
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.970
See you these clothes?

469
00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.830
say you see them not

470
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.000
and think me stillno gentleman born:

471
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:55.930
you were best say theserobes

472
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.170
are not gentlemenborn:

473
00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.470
give me the lie, do,

474
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.630
and try whether I am not nowa gentleman born.

475
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.700
I know you are now, sir, agentleman born.

476
00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.470
Ay, and have been so anytime these four hours.

477
00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.470
And so have I, boy.

478
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.700
So you have:

479
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:10.570
but I was a gentleman bornbefore my father;

480
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.070
for the king's son took meby the hand,

481
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.500
and called me brother;

482
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.500
and then the two kingscalled my father brother;

483
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.570
and then the prince my brother

484
00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.930
and the princess my sistercalled my father father;

485
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.000
and so we wept, and there wasthe first gentleman-like tears

486
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.470
that ever we shed.

487
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.130
We may live, son, to shedmany more.

488
00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:30.970
Ay; or else 'twere hard luck,

489
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.570
being in so preposterousestate as we are.

490
00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.900
I humbly beseech you, sir,

491
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.800
to pardon me all thefaults I have committed

492
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.670
to your worship

493
00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.700
and to give me your good report

494
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.770
to the prince my master.

495
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.930
Prithee, son, do; for wemust be gentle,

496
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.770
now we aregentlemen.

497
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.530
Thou wilt amend thy life?

498
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.270
Ay, an it like your goodworship.

499
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.800
Give me thy hand:

500
00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.230
I will swear to theprince thou art

501
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.730
as honest a true fellowas any is in Bohemia.

502
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.530
You may say it,but not swear it.

503
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.500
Not swear it, now I am agentleman?

504
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.770
Let boors and franklinssay it, I'll swear it.

505
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.270
How if it be false, son?

506
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.500
If it be ne'er so false,

507
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.430
a true gentleman may swearit in the behalf of hisfriend:

508
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.400
and I'll swear to theprince thou art a tallfellow of thy hands

509
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.530
and that thou wilt not bedrunk;

510
00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.800
but I know thou art notall fellow of thy hands

511
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.800
and that thou wilt bedrunk: but I'll swear it,

512
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.200
and I would thou wouldst bea tall fellow of thy hands.

513
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.530
I will prove so, sir, tomy power.

514
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.500
Ay, by any means prove atall fellow:

515
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.670
if I do not wonder how thoudarest venture to be drunk,

516
00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.470
not being a tall fellow,trust me not.

517
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:43.670
Hark! the kings and theprinces, our kindred,

518
00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.800
are going to see thequeen's picture.

519
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:52.230
Come, follow us: we'll bethy good masters.

520
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.900
O grave and good Paulina,the great comfort

521
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.600
That Ihave had of thee!

522
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.470
What, sovereign sir,

523
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:50.630
I did not well I meantwell.

524
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.170
All my services you havepaid home:

525
00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:54.670
but that you havevouchsafed,

526
00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.000
With your crown'd brother

527
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.400
and these your contractedHeirs of your kingdoms,

528
00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.800
my poor house to visit,

529
00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.530
It is a surplus of yourgrace,

530
00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.170
which never my life maylast to answer.

531
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.000
O Paulina,

532
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.870
We honour you withtrouble:

533
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.200
but we came to see thestatue of our queen:

534
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.800
your gallery have wepass'd through,

535
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.400
not without much contentin many singularities;

536
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.770
but we saw not that which mydaughter came to look upon,

537
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.600
The statue of her mother.

538
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.930
As she lived peerless,

539
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.070
So her dead likeness, I dowell believe,

540
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:25.330
Excels whatever yet youlook'd upon

541
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.600
Or hand of man hath done;

542
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:32.600
therefore I keep itlonely, apart.

543
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.700
But here it is:

544
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.100
prepare to seethe life

545
00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:47.600
as lively mock'd as everstill sleep mock'd death:

546
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:07.800
behold, and say 'tis well.

547
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.900
I like your silence,

548
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:17.700
it the more shows off yourwonder: but yet speak;

549
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.900
first, you, my liege,

550
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.330
Comes it not somethingnear?

551
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.130
Her natural posture!

552
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.270
Chide me, dear stone,

553
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.070
that I may say indeed thouart Hermione; or rather,

554
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.800
thou art she in thy notchiding,

555
00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.700
for she was as tender asinfancy and grace.

556
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:41.070
But yet, Paulina, Hermionewas not so much wrinkled,

557
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.900
nothing so aged as thisseems.

558
00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.270
O, not by much.

559
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.230
So much the more ourcarver's excellence;

560
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.270
Which lets go by somesixteen years

561
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:50.370
and makesher as she lived now.

562
00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.270
As now she might havedone,

563
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.500
So much to my goodcomfort,

564
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:59.300
as it is now piercing tomy soul.

565
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.970
O, thus she stood, evenwith such life of majesty,

566
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.070
warm life,

567
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:11.070
As now it coldly stands,when first I woo'd her!

568
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.270
I am ashamed:

569
00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.300
does not the stone rebukeme

570
00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.300
for being more stonethan it?

571
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:25.070
O royal piece, there'smagic in thy majesty,

572
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.470
which has my evilsconjured to remembrance

573
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.200
and from thy admiringdaughter took the spirits,

574
00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.200
Standing like stone withthee.

575
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.130
And give me leave,

576
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.300
And do not say 'tissuperstition,

577
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:45.370
that I kneel and thenimplore her blessing.

578
00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:53.570
Lady, Dear queen, thatended when I but began,

579
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.930
Give me that hand of yoursto kiss.

580
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:57.470
O, patience!

581
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:04.530
The statue is but newlyfix'd, the colour's not dry.

582
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:09.900
My lord, your sorrow wastoo sore laid on,

583
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.970
Which sixteen winterscannot blow away,

584
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.600
So many summers dry;

585
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.100
scarce any joy did ever solong live;

586
00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.930
no sorrow but kill'ditself much sooner.

587
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:25.670
Dear my brother,

588
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:29.070
Let him that was the causeof this have power

589
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:31.500
to take off so much grieffrom you

590
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.700
as he will pieceup in himself.

591
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.130
Indeed, my lord,

592
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.230
If I had thought the sight

593
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.270
of my poor image wouldthus have wrought you,

594
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.570
--for the stone is mine--

595
00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:40.700
I'ld not have show'd it.

596
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.730
Do not draw the curtain.

597
00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:43.700
No longer shall you gazeon't,

598
00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.970
lest your fancy may thinkanon it moves.

599
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.630
Let be, let be.

600
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.730
Would I were dead, butthat,

601
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.630
methinks, already--

602
00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.930
What was he that did makeit?

603
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.030
See, my lord,

604
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:56.100
Would you not deem itbreathed?

605
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.070
and that those veins didverily bear blood?

606
00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.430
Masterly done:

607
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:03.430
The very life seems warmupon her lip.

608
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:05.870
The fixture of her eye hasmotion in't,

609
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.470
As we are mock'd with art.

610
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.870
I'll draw the curtain:

611
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.770
My lord's almost so fartransported

612
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:12.330
that he'llthink anon it lives.

613
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:13.270
O sweet Paulina,

614
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.470
Make me to think so twentyyears together!

615
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:17.000
No settled senses of theworld

616
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.070
can match thepleasure of that madness.

617
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.230
Let 't alone.

618
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.900
I am sorry, sir, I havethus far stirr'd you:

619
00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.970
but I could afflict youfarther.

620
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:27.870
Do, Paulina;

621
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.100
For this affliction has ataste

622
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.170
as sweet as anycordial comfort.

623
00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.030
Still, methinks, there isan air comes from her:

624
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.770
what fine chisel couldever yet cut breath?

625
00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.130
Let no man mock me, for Iwill kiss her.

626
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:43.430
Good my lord, forbear:

627
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.000
The ruddiness upon her lipis wet;

628
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.070
You'll mar it if you kissit,

629
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.330
stain your own with oilypainting.

630
00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:50.600
Shall I draw thecurtain?

631
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.170
No, not these twentyyears.

632
00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:56.630
So long could I stand by,a looker on.

633
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.370
Either forbear,

634
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:59.900
Quit presently the chapel,

635
00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.830
or resolve you for moreamazement.

636
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:08.970
If you can behold it, I'llmake the statue move indeed,

637
00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.500
descend and take you bythe hand;

638
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.230
but then you'll think--Which I protest against--

639
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.870
I am assisted by wickedpowers.

640
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:17.730
What you can make her do

641
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:20.270
I am content to look on:what to speak,

642
00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.070
I am content to hear;

643
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.170
for 'tis as easy to makeher speak as move.

644
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.330
It is required

645
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.100
You do awake your faith.

646
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.400
Then all stand still;

647
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.270
On: those that think it isunlawful business I amabout,

648
00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.400
let them depart.

649
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.730
Proceed:

650
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.500
No foot shall stir.

651
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.700
Music, awake her; strike!

652
00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:58.100
'Tis time; descend; bestone no more; approach;

653
00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.570
Strike all that look uponwith marvel.

654
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:12.070
Come, I'll fill your graveup: stir, nay, come away,

655
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:15.430
Bequeath to death yournumbness,

656
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:21.130
for from him dear liferedeems you.

657
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:22.530
You perceive she stirs:

658
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.100
Start not; her actionsshall be holy

659
00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.500
as you hearmy spell is lawful:

660
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.770
do not shun her until yousee her die again;

661
00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:36.030
for then you kill herdouble.

662
00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.630
Nay, present your hand:

663
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.400
When she was young youwoo'd her;

664
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.600
now in age is she becomethe suitor?

665
00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.230
O, she's warm!

666
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.970
If this be magic, let itbe an art

667
00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.270
Lawful as eating.

668
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:21.230
She embraces him.

669
00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:25.030
She hangs about his neck:

670
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.700
If she pertain to life lether speak too.

671
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:34.830
Ay, and make't manifestwhere she has lived,

672
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.470
Or how stolen from thedead.

673
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:38.570
That she is living,

674
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:39.600
Were it but told you,

675
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.170
should be hooted at likean old tale:

676
00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.000
but itappears she lives,

677
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.270
Though yet she speak not.Mark a little while.

678
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.530
Please you to interpose,fair madam:

679
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.500
kneel and pray yourmother's blessing.

680
00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.370
Turn, good lady;

681
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:03.170
Our Perdita is found.

682
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.630
You gods, look down andfrom your sacred vials

683
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.930
pour your graces upon mydaughter's head!

684
00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:21.100
Tell me, mine own.

685
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.000
Where hast thou beenpreserved?

686
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.970
where lived?

687
00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.600
how found thy father'scourt?

688
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.100
for thou shalt hearthat I,

689
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.400
Knowing by Paulina

690
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.200
that the oracle gave hope thouwast in being,

691
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.230
have preserved myself tosee the issue.

692
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.570
There's time enough forthat;

693
00:30:40.570 --> 00:30:42.170
Lest they desire upon thispush

694
00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.600
to trouble your joyswith like relation.

695
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.400
Go together, you preciouswinners all;

696
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.930
your exultation partake toevery one.

697
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:55.430
I, an old turtle,

698
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.670
will wing me to some wither'dbough and there

699
00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:01.800
My mate, that's never tobe found again,

700
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.700
Lament till I am lost.

701
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.870
O, peace, Paulina!

702
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.000
Thou shouldst a husbandtake by my consent,

703
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.830
As I by thine a wife: thisis a match,

704
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.330
And made between's byvows.

705
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.800
Thou hast foundmine;

706
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.270
But how, is to bequestion'd; for I saw her,

707
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.470
As I thought, dead,

708
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.170
and have in vain said manya prayer upon her grave.

709
00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.230
I'll not seek far--

710
00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:30.170
For him, I partly know hismind

711
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.970
--to find thee Anhonourable husband.

712
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:36.700
Come, Camillo, and takeher by the hand,

713
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.800
whose worth and honesty isrichly noted

714
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.670
and here justified

715
00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.600
By us, a pair of kings.

716
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.270
Let's from this place.

717
00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.200
What! look upon mybrother:

718
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:01.830
both your pardons,

719
00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.370
that e'er I put betweenyour holy

720
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:06.070
looks my illsuspicion.

721
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:07.500
This is your son-in-law,

722
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.970
