WEBVTT

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
IN HIS LIFE AND IN HIS WORK,
THE SPANISH PLAYWRIGHT

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
PEDRO CALDERON DE LA
BARCA BROUGHT TOGETHER

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
THE MAGNIFICENCE,
THE HORROR, AND THE

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
INHERENT CONTRADICTIONS
OF THE SPANISH GOLDEN AGE.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
ALTHOUGH HE LIVED TO BE
81, BY THE AGE OF 40

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
HE HAD ALREADY WRITTEN
THE PLAYS THAT WOULD

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
MAKE HIM A MAJOR FIGURE
OF WORLD THEATRE.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
AMONG THEM WERE "THE
MAYOR OF ZALAMEA",

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
AND HIS MASTERPIECE,
"LA VIDA ES SUEÑO".

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
HIS EXTENSIVE BODY OF
THEATRICAL WORK IS RIFE

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
WITH CONTRADICTIONS
AND COMPLEXITIES.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
HIS STYLE IS DIVERSE
IN ITS TONES,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
REVEALING MULTIPLE AND
PROFOUND MEANINGS, AND

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
MAINTAINS AN AURA OF VIGOR
AND EXCITEMENT TO THIS DAY.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000
*

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:50.000
*

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000
*

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:07.000
*

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
AND I, TOO,
 DREAM AND BEHOLD.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I DREAM I AM BOUND WITH
 CHAINS, AND I DREAMED THAT

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
THESE PRESENT PAINS WERE
 FORTUNATE WAYS OF OLD.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
WHAT IS LIFE?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
A TALE THAT IS TOLD.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
WHAT IS LIFE?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
A FRENZY EXTREME, A SHADOW
 OF THINGS THAT SEEM;

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
AND THE GREATEST
 GOOD IS BUT SMALL,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
THAT ALL LIFE IS
 A DREAM TO ALL,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
AND THAT DREAMS
 THEMSELVES ARE A DREAM.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
PEDRO CALDERÓN DE LA BARCA
WAS BORN IN MADRID

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
ON JANUARY 17, 1600.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
DESPITE HIS MOTHER'S EARLY
DEATH AND HIS FATHER'S

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
STERN, AUTHORITARIAN
ATTITUDE, YOUNG PEDRO

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
HAD A HAPPY CHILDHOOD
WITH HIS TWO BROTHERS,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
DIEGO AND JOSÉ.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
AT THE AGE OF NINE HE
ENTERED THE IMPERIAL SCHOOL

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
OF THE JESUITS WHERE
HE STUDIED HUMANITIES

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
AND BECAME FAMILIAR
WITH THE LATIN CLASSICS.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
FIVE YEARS LATER HE
ENTERED THE UNIVERSITY

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
OF ALCALÁ TO CONTINUE
HIS EDUCATION.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
UPON THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER
HE MOVED TO SALAMANCA

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
TO STUDY CANONS AND LAW IN
ORDER TO BECOME A PRIEST.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
BUT IN 1620 HE DECIDED
TO ABANDON SCHOOL

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
AND HIS PURSUIT
OF THE PRIESTHOOD.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
HE BECAME FASCINATED
BY THE NEW COMEDY

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
THAT WAS FLOURISHING
IN MADRID AT THE TIME

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
AND SOON FOUND HIMSELF
TAKING THE FIRST

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
TENTATIVE STEPS ON
HIS LITERARY JOURNEY.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
IN 1621 PHILIP IV WAS
CROWNED KING OF SPAIN

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF THE
COUNT DUKE OF OLIVARES.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF
A NEW AGE IN WHICH SPAIN

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
WOULD BE A EUROPEAN POWER
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
THIS PERIOD OF
POLITICAL AGGRESSIVENESS

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
CORRESPONDED WITH
THE ARTISTIC SUCCESS

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
OF CALDERÓN DE LA BARCA.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
IN 1623, WITH THE PRINCE
OF WALES' VISIT TO MADRID,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
CALDERÓN PRESENTED
"LOVE, HONOR, AND POWER",

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
HIS FIRST SUCCESSFUL PLAY,
AT THE ROYAL PALACE.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
CALDERÓN CAME TO ADOPT THE
AESTHETICS OF LOPE DE VEGA,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
THE GREAT ARCHITECT
OF SPANISH THEATER.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
HE ESCHEWED CLASSICAL
CONCEPTS, HELD IMAGINATIVE

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
DISCOURSE IN HIGH REGARD,
AND HE WAS WILLING TO

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
TAKE ON ANY SUBJECT
AND EXAMINE IT

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
THROUGH THE PRISM
OF SPANISH FOLKLORE.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
HE DISCOUNTED ANACHRONISMS
AND FOREIGN SCENES IN FAVOR

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
OF A THEATER THAT WAS
QUINTESSENTIALLY SPANISH.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
IN HIS QUEST FOR
AUTHENTICITY,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
CALDERÓN WOULD
PROVIDE THE THEATER

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
WITH A NEW, HIGHLY
POETIC STYLE,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
ONE IN WHICH IDEOLOGY
SUPERSEDES ACTION,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
WHERE THE CHARACTERS
DRIFT AWAY FROM REALITY

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
AND ACQUIRE ANOTHER,
HIGHLY SYMBOLIC EXISTENCE.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
OH, CRUEL HEAVEN.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW
 WHY I AM TREATED SO.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
HAVE I SOMEHOW OFFENDED
 YOU IN BEING BORN?

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:36.000
THOUGH IT IS TRUE MAN'S
 GREATEST CRIME IS TO BE BORN.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
IN 1629 CALDERÓN PRESENTED
"THE CONSTANT PRINCE",

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
AN EXAMPLE OF ANOTHER
STRONG THEME OF HIS DRAMA:

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
LYRICAL PRESENCE, A BLEND OF
POETRY AND DRAMATIC ACTION.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
THAT SAME YEAR, CALDERÓN
WROTE THE COMEDIES

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000
"THE PHANTOM LADY"

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
AND "A HOUSE WITH TWO DOORS
IS DIFFICULT TO GUARD".

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
IN THESE WITTY PLAYS, RIFE
WITH COINCIDENCES THAT

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
STRAIN BELIEF, THE THEATER
BECOMES A SORT OF COMIC GAME.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
HOWEVER, THESE COMEDIES
CONTAINED ASTUTE

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
OBSERVATIONS OF THE
CUSTOMS, IDEAS, FEELINGS

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
AND STANDARDS OF
CALDERÓN'S TIME.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
RESPECT AND JEALOUSY
ARE RECURRENT THEMES

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
THROUGHOUT
CALDERÓN'S WORK.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
IN HIS COMEDIES, THERE IS
OFTEN A SINGLE WOMAN WHO

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
REMAINS UNDER THE CARE OF
HER PARENTS AND BROTHERS,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
WHO TEND TO COME UP WITH
EXAGGERATED AND OFTEN

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
RUTHLESS SOLUTIONS
TO EVERYDAY PROBLEMS.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
IN THE END, HOWEVER,
A MARRIAGE TYPICALLY

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
PAVES THE WAY TO
A HAPPY ENDING.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
BY CONTRAST, IN HIS
TRAGEDIES, CALDERÓN OFTEN

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
SETS THE CONFLICT AROUND
A MARRIED WOMAN WITH AN

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
OUTCOME THAT IS
INEVITABLY HEARTBREAKING.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
HONOR IS ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT SUBJECTS

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
IN CALDERÓN'S WORK.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
LOPE DE VEGA DEFINED THE
FORMULAS OF THE SPANISH

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
DRAMATIC CANON AND TURNED
HONOR, WITH ALL ITS

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
CONVENTIONS, INTO
A THEATRICAL THEME.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
BUT IT WAS CALDERÓN
WHO TOOK THIS THEME

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
WITH THE HELP OF HIS
PATRON, PHILIP IV,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
CALDERÓN BEGAN TO WRITE
AND DIRECT FOR THE COURT.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
FROM THIS POINT ON, HIS
FAME WOULD CONTINUE

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
TO GROW TO THE
END OF HIS DAYS.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
IN 1634 HE WROTE THE
PHILOSOPHICAL DRAMA

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
"LA VIDA ES SUEÑO", A PLAY
THAT IS CONSIDERED BY MANY

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT OF HIS WORKS.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
FOR ALL OF ITS
PHILOSOPHICAL WEIGHTINESS,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
THE DOMINANT THEME OF
"LA VIDA ES SUEÑO"

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
IS A PROFOUND SENSE OF
PESSIMISM GROUNDED IN

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
THE VANITY AND FRAILTY
OF ALL THAT IS HUMAN.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
THIS SENSIBILITY,
EXPRESSED IN THE TITLE

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
"LIFE IS A DREAM", IS
SUSTAINED THROUGHOUT

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
THE PLAY.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
YET AT THE SAME TIME, THIS
WORK AFFIRMS THE REALITY

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
OF FREE WILL, LAYING THE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
CHARACTERS' WOES SQUARELY
AT THEIR OWN FEET.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
IN 1636, CALDERÓN
PRESENTED ANOTHER

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
IMPORTANT WORK, "THE MAYOR
OF ZALAMEA", BASED ON A

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
DRAMA OF THE SAME
NAME BY LOPE DE VEGA.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
IN 1637, PEDRO CALDERÓN DE
LA BARCA WAS MADE A KNIGHT

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
OF THE ORDER OF SANTIAGO.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
THAT SAME YEAR HE ENTERED
MILITARY SERVICE,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
SERVING UNDER THE
DUKE OF THE INFANTRY.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
THE FRENCH ARMY HAD
SURROUNDED FUENTERRABIA,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
AND CALDERÓN JOINED THE
ARMY THAT SET OUT TO

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
ITS RESCUE AND FREED
THE TOWN SQUARE.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
IT WAS IN THIS SAME TIME
PERIOD THAT HE WROTE

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
"THE MAYOR OF ZALAMEA".

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000
IN A WORD, THE CRIMSON
 DAWN, SUN, STREAM,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
ROSEBUD, MAY BIRD THAT
 SINGS AMOROUSLY, APRIL'S

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
LAUGH THAT GEMS THE LAWN,
 PINK THAT SIPS THE DEWS OF

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
DRAWN, ROCK THAT STANDS
 IN STORM AND SHINE, LACRY

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
THAT DELIGHTS TO TWINE
 ROUND ITS FADEST LEAVES,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THE SUN.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
ALL ARE PARTS WHICH MET
 IN ONE, FORM THIS WOMAN

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
WHO IS DIVINE.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
IN 1640 A GREAT COLISEUM
WAS OPENED AT THE

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
PALACIO DEL BUEN
RETIRO IN MADRID.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
IT WAS HERE THAT
THE FIRST OPERAS AND

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
INDIGENOUS MUSICAL
DRAMAS CALLED "ZARZUELAS"

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
OF SPANISH THEATER WOULD
BE SET UPON THE STAGE.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
THIS WAS THE IDEAL SETTING
FOR CALDERÓN'S PLAYS -

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
EXTRAVAGANT AND DARING,
BOTH IN THEIR EFFECTS

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
AND IN THEIR
ALLEGORICAL COMPLEXITY.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
THIS INTENSELY CREATIVE
PERIOD WAS FOLLOWED BY ONE

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
OF POLITICAL CRISIS.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
THE SPANISH MONARCHY UNDER
PHILIP IV WAS UNABLE TO

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
HOLD THE FRACTIOUS UNION
OF STATES TOGETHER.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
REBELLIONS AROSE IN
CATALONIA, PORTUGAL,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
ARAGÓN AND ANDALUSIA.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
IN 1643, THE COUNT DUKE
OF OLIVARES CEASED TO BE

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
PHILIP'S PROTECTOR.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA
IN 1648 AND THE TREATY

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
OF MÜNSTER MARKED THE
INDEPENDENCE OF FLANDERS

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
AND LED TO A NEW EUROPEAN
ORDER THAT WOULD GRADUALLY

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
MAKE SPAIN INCREASINGLY
IRRELEVANT.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
AS A CAVALRY SOLDIER,
CALDERÓN HAD TAKEN PART IN

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
THE WAR WITH CATALONIA.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
HE WITNESSED THE DEATH
OF HIS BROTHER JOSÉ,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
A PRESTIGIOUS
MILITARY OFFICER.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
HIS BROTHER DIEGO
DIED TWO YEARS LATER.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
IN 1644, PUBLIC
THEATERS WERE SHUT DOWN.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
CALDERÓN WAS LEFT WITH
NOWHERE TO PRESENT HIS PLAYS

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
AND HE WENT INTO THE
SERVICE OF THE DUKE OF ALBA.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
AT ABOUT THIS TIME,
CALDERÓN HAD A SON OUT OF

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
WEDLOCK, PEDRO JOSÉ, WHO
DIED AT AN EARLY AGE.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
LITTLE IS KNOWN OF THE
MOTHER, CALDERÓN'S MISTRESS,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
WHO ALSO DIED
IN THIS PERIOD.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
THE COUNTRY'S INTERNAL
CONFLICTS, THE STATE OF

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
THE COURT, AND THE
CONSTANT DRUMBEAT OF DEATH

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
DISILLUSIONED AND
DISPIRITED CALDERÓN.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
IT WAS A TIME OF
REFLECTION AND RENEWAL

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
FOR HIM, AND IN 1649 WHEN
THE THEATERS WERE RE-OPENED,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
CALDERÓN TURNED HIS
BACK ON HIS PAST

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
AND ENTERED
THE PRIESTHOOD.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
TWO YEARS LATER, AS CHAPLAIN
OF THE NEW KINGS OF TOLEDO,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
HE MOVED TO THAT
CITY AND BEGAN

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
A NEW STAGE IN HIS
DRAMATIC CAREER.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
HE TURNED TO THE COMPOSITION
OF AUTOS SACRAMENTALES

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
- ALLEGORICAL PIECES
IN WHICH THE MYSTERY

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
OF THE EUCHARIST WAS
ILLUSTRATED DRAMATICALLY

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
AND WHICH WERE PERFORMED
WITH GREAT CEREMONY

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
ON THE FEAST
OF CORPUS CHRISTI.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
IN 1663, HE ESTABLISHED
HIMSELF ONCE AGAIN IN

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
COURT WHERE HE CONTINUED
TO DIRECT HIS OWN PLAYS.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
HE ENTERED THE
CONGREGATION OF

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
NATURAL PRIESTS OF
MADRID, OF WHICH HE

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
EVENTUALLY BECAME
PRINCIPAL CHAPLAIN.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
CALDERÓN LIVED IN
ISOLATION, DEVOTED TO HIS

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
PRODUCTIONS, HIS STUDIES
AND HIS MEDITATIONS.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
DURING THE LAST FEW
DECADES OF HIS LIFE,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
HE DEDICATED HIMSELF
PRIMARILY TO WRITING PLAYS

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
ON RELIGIOUS THEMES.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
THE RELIGIOUS GENRE OF
THE AUTOS SACRAMENTALES

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
REACHED ITS PEAK WITH
THE WORK OF CALDERÓN.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
IN THESE ALLEGORICAL PLAYS
HE ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN TO

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
THE AUDIENCE THE MEANING
OF RELIGIOUS DOGMAS.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
IN CALDERÓN'S HANDS,
HUMANITY, SIN, JUDAISM,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
PAGANISM, THE HOLY
SACRAMENTS, AND GOD HIMSELF

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
ARE TRANSFORMED INTO
DRAMATIC CHARACTERS.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
SCENERY, MUSIC AND COSTUMES
ALL PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
IN THE PRESENTATION OF
THE AUTOS SACRAMENTALES.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
CITIES COMPETED WITH EACH
OTHER IN THE MAGNIFICENCE

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
OF THEIR PRODUCTIONS,
DEDICATING ENORMOUS

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
AMOUNTS OF MONEY AND
EFFORT TO SECURE THE

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
SERVICES OF CELEBRITY
WRITERS AND ACTORS.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
EACH PLAYER I SHALL
 CAST AS I DEEM BEST;

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
AND TO ENSURE THE PLAY
 IS TO ADVANTAGE DRESSED,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
WITH SPLENDID COSTUMES
 AND WITH EVERY MACHINE

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
THAT MAY ADORN THE SCENE
 IS WITH YOU PRESENTLY

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
TO EQUIP THE STAGE
 WITH SUCH MACHINERY,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I SHALL WITH FAIR
 EFFECTS TAKE EVERY EYE,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
CAUSING ALL DOUBT TO FLY,
 AND GIVING THE SPECTATOR

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
CERTAINTY OF FAITH
 IN ALL THEY SEE.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
AND NOW IT'S TIME THAT WE
 BEGAN - I, THE DIRECTOR,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
YOU, THE STAGE,
 THE ACTOR MAN.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
UPON THE DEATH OF
PHILIP IV IN 1665,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
CHARLES II WAS
CROWNED KING.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
CHARLES WAS PHYSICALLY
DISABLED AND DISFIGURED,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
AND WAS BARELY ABLE
TO WALK AND SPEAK.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
HIS MOTHER,
MARIANA OF AUSTRIA,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
WAS ACTUALLY RULING
AND SHE ORDERED

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
THAT THEATRES BE
SHUT DOWN ONCE AGAIN.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
HOWEVER, THEY WERE
OPENED FIVE YEARS LATER

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
WITH CALDERÓN'S
MYTHOLOGICAL PLAY

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
"WILD BEASTS ARE
TAMED BY LOVE".

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
CALDERÓN WAS, IN EFFECT,
THE LAST GREAT PUBLIC

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
INTELLECTUAL IN SPAIN.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
OVER TIME, HIS DRAMATIC
WRITINGS BECAME MORE

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AND MORE ALLEGORICAL
AND ABSTRACT.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
THIS TREND IN HIS WORK,
HOWEVER, DID NOT MEAN THAT

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
HE HAD TURNED HIS
BACK ON THE WORLD.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
WHILE ALREADY IN HIS
SEVENTIES, HE OVERSAW

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
PRODUCTION OF "THE
STATUE OF PROMETHEUS",

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
A METAPHORICAL PIECE THAT
PUT UPON THE STAGE

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
THE STATE'S STRUGGLE FOR
REFORM AND SALVATION,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
AND THE DESIRE TO ACHIEVE
A UTOPIAN REPUBLIC -

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
ONE IN WHICH WISDOM AND
POWER CAN CO-EXIST.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
AT THE CARNIVAL OF 1680,
THE LAST OF HIS PLAYS

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
WAS PRESENTED
AT THE PALACE:

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
"FATE AND THE INSIGNIA
OF LEONIDO AND MARFISA",

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
A COMEDY THAT FEATURED
SCENERY BY JOSEF CAUDÍ.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
PEDRO CALDERÓN DE LA BARCA
DIED ON MAY 25, 1681,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
AT THE AGE OF 81.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
HE WAS BURIED DRESSED IN
THE RELIGIOUS ORNAMENTS

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
AND HABITS OF THE
ORDER OF SANTIAGO.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
DEATH HAD TAKEN
CALDERÓN BY SURPRISE.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
HE HAD BEEN WORKING ON A
COMEDY FOR MARIA LUISA -

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
THE WIFE OF CHARLES
II - AS WELL AS AN

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
AUTO SACRAMENTAL TO
BE PRESENTED AT THE

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
CORPUS CHRISTI
FESTIVAL THAT YEAR.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
THROUGHOUT HIS LONG LIFE,
PEDRO CALDERÓN DE LA BARCA

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
GREW IN FAME AND HIS
POPULARITY WOULD ENDURE

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
WELL INTO THE
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
THE ADVENT OF
NEO-CLASSICISM

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
SAW CALDERÓN
FALL INTO DISFAVOR;

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
HIS BAROQUE
SENSIBILITIES AND

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
TRADITIONALIST CATHOLIC
THEMES WENT AGAINST

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
THE GRAIN OF CLASSICAL
SENSIBILITIES.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
HOWEVER, LATE EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY ROMANTICISM

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
RESTORED HIS GLORY AND
HE WAS PRAISED FOR THOSE

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
VERY QUALITIES THAT HAD
LED TO THE CENSURE

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
OF NEO-CLASSICISTS:
IN PARTICULAR,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
HIS CATHOLICISM AND
HIS NATIONALISM.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
AS A RESULT OF HIS
NEWFOUND FAVOR,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
MANY OF HIS WORKS WERE
TRANSLATED AND PUBLISHED,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
AND THEY HAD A
PROFOUND INFLUENCE

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
ON THE PLAYWRIGHTS
OF THE TIME.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
CALDERÓN BECAME THE MODEL
FOR THIS NEW KIND OF THEATER.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
THE RENAISSANCE OF THE
BAROQUE STYLE IN THE

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
TWENTIETH CENTURY ONLY
ENHANCED CALDERÓN'S

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
REPUTATION, ALONG WITH
THOSE OF OTHER AUTHORS

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
AND PAINTERS OF THE
SPANISH GOLDEN AGE.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
TODAY, PEDRO CALDERÓN DE LA
BARCA IS CONSIDERED TO BE

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:35.000
AN OUTSTANDING FIGURE AMONG
THE WORLD'S DRAMATISTS.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:48.000
*

00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:00.000
*

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:12.000
*
