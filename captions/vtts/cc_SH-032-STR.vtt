00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:37.830


2
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.500
You are all resolved rather todie than to famish?

3
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.970
Resolved; resolved.

4
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.070
First, you know Caius Marcius ischief enemy to the people.

5
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.130
Let us kill him, and we'll havecorn at our own price.

6
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.170
For the gods know I speak thisin hunger for bread,

7
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.930
not in thirst for revenge.

8
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.300
He's a very dog to thecommonalty.

9
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700
Consider you what services hehas done for his country?

10
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.370
Very well; and could be contentto give him good report for it

11
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.100
but that he pays himself withbeing proud.

12
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.700
Nay, but speak not maliciously.

13
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.500
I say unto you, what he hathdone famously,

14
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.400
he did it to that end.

15
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
Though soft-conscienced men

16
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230
can be content to say it was forhis country,

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.500
he did it to please his motherand to be partly proud,

18
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.230
which he is, even till thealtitude of his virtue.

19
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.670
What he cannot help in hisnature

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.670
you account a vice in him.

21
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.770
What shouts are these?

22
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.570
The other side of the city isrisen.

23
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.600
Soft.

24
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.370
Who comes here?

25
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.900
Worthy Menenius Agrippa,

26
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.830
one that hath always loved thepeople.

27
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.670
Where go you with bats andclubs?

28
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.770
The matter?

29
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.530
Speak, I pray you.

30
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.500
Our business is not unknown tothe senate.

31
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.070
They have had inkling thisfortnight

32
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.200
what we intend to do,

33
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.400
which now we'll show them indeeds.

34
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.300
Why, masters, my good friends,

35
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.030
mine honest neighbors,

36
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030
will you undo yourselves?

37
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.500
We cannot, sir.

38
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.330
We are undone already.

39
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.670
I tell you, friends,

40
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.230
most charitable care have thepatricians of you.

41
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.670
Care for us?

42
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.670
True, indeed.

43
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.200
They ne'er cared for us, yetsuffer us to famish,

44
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.870
and their storehouses crammedwith grain;

45
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.000
make edicts for usury, tosupport usurers;

46
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.430
repeal daily any wholesome actestablished against the rich;

47
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.000
and provide more piercingstatutes daily

48
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to chain up and restrain thepoor.

49
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.630
If the wars eat us not up, theywill,

50
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.670
and there's all the love theybear us.

51
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.430
Either you must confessyourselves wondrous malicious

52
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.400
or be accused of folly.

53
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.300
I shall tell you a pretty tale.

54
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.930
It may be you have heard it, butsince it serves my purpose,

55
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.230
I'll venture to stale it alittle more.

56
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.270
Well, I'll hear it, sir, yet youmust not think

57
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.470
to fob off our disgrace with atale.

58
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.170
But, and it please you, deliver.

59
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.830
There was a time when all thebody's members

60
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.000
rebelled against the belly,

61
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.700
thus accused it that only like agulf it did remain

62
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.670
in the midst of the body, idleand unactive,

63
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.470
still cupboarding the viand,

64
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.030
never bearing like labor withthe rest,

65
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.200
where the other instruments didsee and hear, devise,

66
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.100
instruct, walk, feel, andmutually participate,

67
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.930
did minister unto the appetitesand affection

68
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.930
common of the whole body.

69
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.970
The belly answered

70
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.930
Well, sir, what answer made thebelly?

71
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.270
Sir, I shall tell you.

72
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.700
With a kind of smile,

73
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.870
which ne'er came from the lungs,but even thus

74
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.070
for, look you,

75
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.730
I may make the belly smile aswell as speak.

76
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.330
It tauntingly replied to thediscontented members,

77
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
the mutinous parts that enviedhis receipt,

78
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.600
even so most fitly as you malignour senators

79
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.500
for that they are not such asyou.

80
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.230
Your belly's answer, what?

81
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.730
Your most grave belly wasdeliberate,

82
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.370
not rash like his accusers, andthus answered:

83
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.500
"True is it, my incorporatefriends,"

84
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.430
quoth he, "That I receive thegeneral food at first,

85
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.130
"which you do live upon, and fitit is,

86
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.370
"because I am the storehouse andthe shop of the whole body.

87
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.100
"But, if you do remember,

88
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.770
"I send it through the rivers ofyour blood,

89
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.970
"even to the court, the heart,to the seat of the brain,

90
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.900
"and through the cranks andoffices of man,

91
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.170
"the strongest nerves and smallinferior veins

92
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.800
"from me receive that naturalcompetency

93
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.130
"whereby they live,

94
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.970
and though that all at once,you, my good friends

95
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.430
this said the belly, mark me

96
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.030
Ay, sir; well, well.

97
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.470
"Though all at once cannot seewhat I do deliver out to each,

98
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.370
"yet I can make my audit up,

99
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.330
"that all from me do backreceive the flour of all,

100
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.730
and leave me but the bran."

101
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.500
What say you to it?

102
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.030
It was an answer.

103
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.630
How apply you this?

104
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.300
The senators of Rome are thisgood belly,

105
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.770
and you the mutinous members.

106
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.630
For examine their counsels andtheir cares,

107
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.600
digest things rightly touchingthe weal of the common.

108
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.370
You shall find no public benefitthat you receive,

109
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.670
but it proceeds or comes fromthem to you

110
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.930
and no way from yourselves.

111
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.300
What's the matter, youdissentious rogues,

112
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.800
that rubbing the poor itch ofyour opinion,

113
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.900
make yourselves scabs?

114
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.630
We have ever your good word.

115
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.200
He that will give good words tothee

116
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.130
will flatter beneath abhorring.

117
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.530
What would you have, you curs,that like nor peace nor war?

118
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.970
The one affrights you; the othermakes you proud.

119
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.570
He that trusts to you,

120
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.900
where he should find you lions,finds you hares;

121
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.200
where foxes, geese.

122
00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.270
You are no surer, no,

123
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.770
than is the coal of fire uponthe ice

124
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.130
or hailstone in the sun.

125
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.430
Your virtue is to make himworthy whose offense subdues him

126
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.570
and curse that justice did it.

127
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.600
Who deserves greatness deservesyour hate.

128
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.070
Trust ye?

129
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.700
Hang ye.

130
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.100
What's the matter

131
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.830
that in these several places ofthe city

132
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.470
you cry against the noblesenate,

133
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.170
who, under the gods, keep you inawe,

134
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.270
which else would feed on oneanother?

135
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.970
What's their seeking?

136
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.770
For corn at their own rates,

137
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.400
whereof, they say, the city iswell stored.

138
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.670
Hang them!

139
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.400
They say!

140
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.730
They'll sit by the fire

141
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.570
and presume to know what's donein the capitol;

142
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.070
who's like to rise, who thrivesand who declines;

143
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.400
side factions and give outconjectural marriages;

144
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.930
making parties strong andfeebling such as stand

145
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.530
not in their liking below theircobbled shoes.

146
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.130
They say there's grain enough.

147
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.430
What says the other troop?

148
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.300
O, they're dissolved.

149
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.470
Hang them!

150
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.600
They said they were an-hungry,

151
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.500
sighed forth proverbs, thathunger broke stone walls,

152
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.870
that dogs must eat, that meatwas made for mouths,

153
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.230
that the gods sent not corn forthe rich men only.

154
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.300
With these shreds, they ventedtheir complainings,

155
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.030
which being answered and apetition granted them,

156
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:20.330
a strange oneó

157
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.900
to break the heart ofgenerosity,

158
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.400
and make bold power look pale.

159
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.630
They threw their caps

160
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.700
as they would hang them on thehorns of the moon,

161
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.400
shouting their emulation.

162
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.930
What is granted them?

163
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.170
Five tribunes to defend theirvulgar wisdoms

164
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.330
of their own choice.

165
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.600
One's Junius Brutus, SiciniusVelutus,

166
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.970
and I know notó 'Sdeath!

167
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.870
The rabble should have firstunroofed the city,

168
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.500
ere so prevailed with me.

169
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.130
It will, in time, win upon power

170
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.730
and throw forth greater themesfor insurrection's arguing.

171
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.500
This is strange.

172
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.030
Go, get you home, you fragments!

173
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.270
What's the matter?

174
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.370
The news is, sir, the Volscesare in arms.

175
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.470
I am glad on it.

176
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.570
Then we shall have means to ventour musty superfluity.

177
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.470
They have a leader, TullusAufidius,

178
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.030
that will put you to it.

179
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.330
I sin in envying his nobility,

180
00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.170
and were I any thing but what Iam,

181
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.230
I would wish me only he.

182
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.270
You have fought together.

183
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.530
Were half to half the world bythe ears and he.

184
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.330
Upon my party, I'd revolt onlyto make my wars with him.

185
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.030
He is a lion that I am proud tohunt.

186
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:39.400
Then, worthy Marcius, attendupon Cominius to these wars.

187
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.930
It is your former promise.

188
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:47.730
Sir, it is, and I am constant.

189
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.070
Titus Lartius,

190
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.570
thou shalt see me once morestrike at Tullus' face.

191
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.570
What, art thou stiff?

192
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.600
Stand'st out.

193
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.100
No, Caius Marcius, I'll leanupon one crutch

194
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.370
and fight with t'other, ere staybehind this business.

195
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.600
O, true-bred.

196
00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.270
Was ever man so proud as is thisMarcius?

197
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.800
He has no equal.

198
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.470
When we were chosen tribunes forthe peopleó

199
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:10.830
Marked you his lip and eyes?

200
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.100
Nay, but his taunts.

201
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.170
Being moved, he will not spareto gird the gods.

202
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.730
Be-mock the modest moon.

203
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.770
And the present wars devour him.

204
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.500
He is grown too proud to be sovaliant.

205
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.000
Such a nature, tickled with goodsuccess,

206
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.570
disdains the shadow which hetreads on at noon.

207
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.370
But I do wonder his insolence

208
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.300
can brook to be commanded underCominius.

209
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.730
Fame, at the which he aims,

210
00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.670
in whom already he's wellgraced,

211
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:36.430
cannot better be held nor moreattained

212
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.830
than by a place below the first,

213
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.870
for what miscarries shall be thegeneral's fault,

214
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.100
though he perform to the utmostof a man,

215
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.300
and giddy censure will then cryout of Marcius,

216
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.270
"O if he had borne thebusiness."

217
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.930
Besides, if things go well,

218
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.030
opinion that so sticks onMarcius

219
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.900
shall of his demerits robCominius.

220
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.870
So your opinion is, Aufidius,

221
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.030
that they of Rome are entered inour counsels

222
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.370
and know how we proceed.

223
00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.700
Is it not yours?

224
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.570
What ever have been thought onin this state

225
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.000
that could be brought to bodilyact

226
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.170
ere Rome had circumvention?

227
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:13.500
"Tis not four days gone since Iheard thence."

228
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.070
These are the words.

229
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:18.430
I think I have the letter here;yes, here it is.

230
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.130
"They have pressed a power,

231
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.600
"but it is not known whether foreast or west.

232
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.030
"The dearth is great, the peoplemutinous,

233
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.200
"and it is rumored, Cominius,Marcius, your old enemy,

234
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.100
"who is of Rome worse hated thanof you,

235
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.730
"and Titus Lartius, a mostvaliant Roman,

236
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.070
"these three lead on thispreparation whither 'tis bent.

237
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.270
"Most likely, 'tis for you.

238
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.330
Consider of it."

239
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.700
Our army's in the field.

240
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.670
We never yet made doubt but Romewas ready to answer us.

241
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.670
Nor did you think it folly

242
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.500
to keep your great pretensesveiled

243
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.370
till when they needs must showthemselves,

244
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.900
which in the hatching, itseemed,

245
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.900
appeared to Rome.

246
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.670
By the discovery, we shall beshortened in our aim,

247
00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.470
which was to take in many towns

248
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.670
ere almost Rome should know wewere afoot.

249
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.530
Noble Aufidius,

250
00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.430
take your commission, hie you toyour bands.

251
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.430
Let us alone to guard Corioli.

252
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.470
If they set down before us,

253
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.900
for the remove, bring up yourarmy,

254
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.270
but, I think, you'll findthey've not prepared for us.

255
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.630
O, doubt not that; I speak fromcertainties.

256
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.730
I leave your honors.

257
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.070
If we and Caius Marcius chanceto meet,

258
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:33.500
'tis sworn between us

259
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.900
we shall ever strike till onecan do no more.

260
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.130
I pray thee, daughter,

261
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:48.330
sing or express yourself in amore comfortable sort.

262
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.800
If my son were my husband,

263
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.930
I should freelier rejoice inthat absence

264
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.430
wherein he won honor

265
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:55.130
than in the embracements of hisbed

266
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.570
where he would show most love.

267
00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:59.600
When yet he was buttender-bodied

268
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.900
and the only son of my womb,

269
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:06.870
when youth with comelinessplucked all gaze his way,

270
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.500
when for a day of kings'entreaties

271
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.470
a mother should not sell him anhour from her beholding,

272
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.470
I, considering how honor wouldbecome such a person,

273
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.430
was pleased to let him seekdanger

274
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.470
where he was like to find fame.

275
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.430
To a cruel war I sent him fromwhence he returned,

276
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.330
his brows bound with oak.

277
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.170
I tell thee, daughter, I sprangnot more in joy

278
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.370
at first hearing he was aman-child

279
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:36.200
than now in first seeing he'dproved himself a man.

280
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.730
But had he died in the business,madam, how then?

281
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:47.030
Then his good report should havebeen my son.

282
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.530
I therein would have foundissue.

283
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.570
Hear me profess sincerely:

284
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:54.470
had I a dozen sons,

285
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.170
each in my love alike and noneless dear

286
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.200
than thine and my good Marcius.

287
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:03.000
I had rather had eleven dienobly for their country

288
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.800
than one voluptuously surfeitout of action.

289
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.470
Madam, the Lady Valeria is cometo visit you.

290
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.870
Beseech you, give me leave toretire myself.

291
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.500
Indeed, you shall not.

292
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.830
Methinks I hear hither yourhusband's drum.

293
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.370
See him pluck Aufidius down bythe hair,

294
00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.930
as children from a bear, theVolsces shunning him.

295
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.300
Methinks I see him stamp thusand call thus:

296
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.630
"Come on, you cowards.

297
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:34.570
You were got in fear, though youwere born in Rome,"

298
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.730
his bloody brow with his mailedhand then wiping,

299
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:39.100
forth he goesó

300
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.100
His bloody brow.

301
00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.530
O, Jupiter, no blood.

302
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.730
Away, you fool.

303
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.870
It more becomes a man than gilthis trophy.

304
00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.970
The breasts of Hecuba, when shedid suckle Hector,

305
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.630
looked not lovelier thanHector's forehead

306
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.870
when it spit forth blood atGrecian sword, contemning.

307
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.970
Tell Valeria we are fit to bidher welcome.

308
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:10.730
Heavens bless my lord from fellAufidius.

309
00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:13.170
He'll pluck Aufidius' head belowhis knee

310
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:15.370
and tread upon his neck.

311
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.170
My ladies both, good day to you.

312
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.400
Sweet madam.

313
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.100
I am glad to see your ladyship.

314
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.670
How do you both?

315
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.530
You are manifest housekeepers.

316
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.170
What are you sewing here?

317
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.100
A fine spot, in good faith.

318
00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.630
How does your little son?

319
00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:35.100
I thank your ladyship; well,good madam.

320
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.330
He'd rather see the swords andhear a drum

321
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.100
than look upon his schoolmaster.

322
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.070
On my word, the father's son.

323
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.430
I'll swear, 'tis a very prettyboy.

324
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.770
On my troth,

325
00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.670
I looked upon him on Wednesdayhalf an hour together.

326
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.370
Has such a confirmedcountenance.

327
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.970
I saw him run after a gildedbutterfly,

328
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:56.700
and when he caught it, he let itgo again,

329
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.630
and after it again.

330
00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.300
And over and over he comes.

331
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.530
And up again, catched it again.

332
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.200
Or whether his fall enraged him,or how 'twas,

333
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.570
he did so set his teeth and tearit.

334
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.870
O, I warrant, how he mammockedit.

335
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:16.470
One on 's father's moods.

336
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:19.230
Indeed; la, 'tis a noble child.

337
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.800
A crack, madam.

338
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.930
Come, lay aside your stitchery.

339
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.630
I must have you play the idlehousewife

340
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.730
with me this afternoon.

341
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.000
No, good madam; I will not outof doors.

342
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.130
Not out of doors.

343
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.100
She shall; she shall.

344
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.400
Indeed, no, by your patience.

345
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.070
I'll not over the threshold

346
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:38.970
till my lord return from thewars.

347
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.130
Fie, you confine yourself mostunreasonably.

348
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:47.270
Come, you must go visit the goodlady that lies in.

349
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.070
I will wish her speedy strengthand visit her with my prayers,

350
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.130
but I cannot go thither.

351
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:56.600
Why, I pray you?

352
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.500
'Tis not to save labor, nor thatI want love.

353
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.930
You would be another Penelope.

354
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.070
Yet, they say, all the yarn shespun in Ulysses' absence

355
00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:08.430
did but fill Ithaca full ofmoths.

356
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.970
Come; I would your cambric weresensible as your finger

357
00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.400
that you might leave pricking itfor pity.

358
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.270
Come, you shall go with us.

359
00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.030
No, good madam, pardon me.

360
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:22.300
Indeed, I will not forth.

361
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.930
In truth, la, go with me,

362
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:28.700
and I'll tell you excellent newsof your husband.

363
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.300
O, good madam, there can be noneyet.

364
00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.230
Verily, I do not jest with you.

365
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.470
There came news from him lastnight.

366
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.870
Indeed, madam?

367
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.200
In earnest, it's true; I heard asenator speak it.

368
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.600
Thus it is: the Volsces have anarmy forth,

369
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.500
against whom Cominius thegeneral is gone,

370
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.870
with one part of our Romanpower.

371
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.400
Your lord and Titus Lartius areset down

372
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.370
before their city, Corioli.

373
00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:01.900
They nothing doubt prevailingand to make it brief wars.

374
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.870
This is true, on mine honor.

375
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.470
And so, I pray, go with us.

376
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.500
Give me excuse, good madam.

377
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.500
I will obey you in everythinghereafter.

378
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.630
Let her alone, lady.

379
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.870
As she is now, she will butdisease our better mirth.

380
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:31.370
In troth, I think she would.

381
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.230
Summon the town.

382
00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.330
Tutus Aufidius, is he withinyour walls?

383
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.730
No, nor a man that fears youless than he.

384
00:17:57.730 --> 00:17:59.300
That's lesser than a little.

385
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.200
Hark you; far off.

386
00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.370
There is Aufidius.

387
00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.270
List what work he makes amongstyour cloven army.

388
00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.570
O, they are at it.

389
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.300
Their noise be our instruction.

390
00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.400
Ladders, ho!

391
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.470
All the contagion of the southlight on you,

392
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.030
you shames of Rome,

393
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.730
you herd of boils and plagues.

394
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.300
Plaster you o'er that you may beabhorred

395
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.800
farther than seen

396
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.570
and one infect another againstthe wind a mile.

397
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:24.070
You souls of geese that bear theshapes of men,

398
00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:29.270
how have you run from slavesthat apes would beat.

399
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:32.070
Pluto and hell.

400
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.700
All hurt behind, backs red andfaces pale

401
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.730
with flight and agued fear.

402
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.530
Mend and charge home or, by thefires of heaven,

403
00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:44.400
I'll leave the foe and make mywars on you.

404
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.070
Look to it.

405
00:20:05.530 --> 00:20:07.470
What is become of Marcius?

406
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.170
Slain, sir, doubtless.

407
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.970
Following the fliers at the veryheels,

408
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.130
with them he enters,

409
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.300
who, upon the sudden, clapped totheir gates.

410
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.200
He is himself alone to answerall the city.

411
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:20.530
Look, sir.

412
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.200
'Tis Marcius.

413
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.800
Let's fetch him off or makeremain alike.

414
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.070
Come I too late?

415
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:12.230
The shepherd knows not thunderfrom a tabor

416
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.100
more than I know the sound ofMarcius' tongue

417
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.900
from every meaner man.

418
00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.130
Come I too late?

419
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.370
Ay, if you come not in the bloodof others

420
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:20.700
but mantled in your own.

421
00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:21.900
But how prevailed you?

422
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:23.000
Will the time serve to tell?

423
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I do not think.

424
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Where is the enemy?

425
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.030
Are you lords of the field?

426
00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.470
If not, why cease you till youare so?

427
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:29.130
Marcius, we have at disadvantagefought

428
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.530
and did retire to win ourpurpose.

429
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.630
I do beseech you,

430
00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.300
by all the battles wherein wehave fought,

431
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.100
by the blood we have shedtogether,

432
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.230
by the vows we have made toendure friends,

433
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.900
that you directly set me againstAufidius and his Antiates

434
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.470
and that you not delay thepresent

435
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.600
but, filling the air with swordsadvanced and darts,

436
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.070
we prove this very hour.

437
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:48.400
Though I could wish you were

438
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.700
conducted to a gentle bath andbalms applied to you,

439
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.030
yet dare I never deny yourasking.

440
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.000
Take your choice of those thatbest can aid your action.

441
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.370
Those are they that most arewilling.

442
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.200
If any such be here as it weresin to doubt

443
00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.700
that love this painting whereinyou see me smeared,

444
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.530
if any fear lesser his personthan an ill report,

445
00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.200
if any think brave deathoutweighs bad life

446
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.400
and that his country's dearerthan himself,

447
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:19.030
let him alone, or so many sominded, wave thus

448
00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:23.570
to express his disposition andfollow Marcius.

449
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.600
O, me alone.

450
00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:38.930
Make you a sword of me?

451
00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.500
I'll fight with none but thee,

452
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:48.430
for I do hate thee worse than apromise breaker.

453
00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:50.430
We hate alike.

454
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.470
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhormore than thy fame and envy.

455
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.130
Fix thy foot.

456
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.430
Let the first budger die theother's slave,

457
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.270
and the gods doom him after.

458
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.570
If I fly, Marcius, holloa melike a hare.

459
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.970
Within these three hours,Tullus, alone I fought

460
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.400
in your Corioli walls and madewhat work I pleased.

461
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.700
'Tis not my blood wherein thouseest me masked,

462
00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:42.100
for thy revenge wrench up thypower to the highest.

463
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.230
Wert thou the Hector that wasthe whip of thy bragged progeny.

464
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.970
Thou shouldst not 'scape mehere.

465
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.070
The augurer tells me we shallhave news tonight.

466
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.100
Good or bad?

467
00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.800
Not according to the prayers ofthe people,

468
00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.900
for they love not Marcius.

469
00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.700
Nature teaches beasts to knowtheir friends.

470
00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.470
Pray you, who does the wolflove?

471
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:05.500
The lamb.

472
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:06.630
Ay, to devour him,

473
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.570
as the hungry plebeians wouldthe noble Marcius.

474
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.400
He's a lamb indeed that baaslike a bear.

475
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.670
He's a bear indeed that liveslike a lamb.

476
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.800
You two are old men.

477
00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.500
Tell me one thing that I shallask you.

478
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500
Well, sir.

479
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.070
In what enormity is Marcius poor

480
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.870
that you two have not inabundance?

481
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:22.230
He's poor in no one fault butstored with all.

482
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.270
Especially in pride.

483
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.700
Topping all others in boasting.

484
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.600
This is strange now.

485
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.170
Do you two know how you arecensured here in the city,

486
00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:31.600
I mean of us of the right-handfile; do you?

487
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.870
Why, how are we censured?

488
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.370
Because you talk of pride now.

489
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.570
Will you not be angry?

490
00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.930
Well, well, sir.

491
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:39.930
Well?

492
00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.070
Why, 'tis no great matter,

493
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:42.900
for a very little thief ofoccasion will rob you

494
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.470
of a great deal of patience.

495
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.000
Give your dispositions the reinsand be angry at your pleasures,

496
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.630
at the least if you take it as apleasure to you in being so.

497
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.370
You blame Marcius for beingproud?

498
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:53.970
We do it not alone, sir.

499
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.470
I know you do very little alonefor your helps are many,

500
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:59.570
or else your actions would growwondrous single.

501
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.400
Your abilities are tooinfant-like

502
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.170
to do much alone.

503
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.870
You talk of pride.

504
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.500
O, that you could turn your eyestoward the napes of your necks

505
00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.500
and make but an interior surveyof your good selves.

506
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.500
O, that you could.

507
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.730
What then, sir?

508
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.930
Why, then you should discover abrace of unmeriting, proud,

509
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.530
violent, testy magistrates,alias fools, as any in Rome.

510
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.730
Come, sir, come, we know youwell enough.

511
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.000
You know neither me, yourself,nor anything.

512
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.300
You are ambitious for poorknaves' caps and legs.

513
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:27.900
You'd wear out a good wholesomeforenoon

514
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.000
hearing a cause

515
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.730
between an orange wife and afosset-seller

516
00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.670
and then rejourn the controversyof three pence

517
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.370
to a second day of audience.

518
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.770
But when you're hearing a matterbetween party and party,

519
00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.930
if you chance to be pinched withthe colic,

520
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.830
you make faces like mummers,

521
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:43.700
set up the bloody flag againstall patience,

522
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.830
and, in roaring for a chamberpot,

523
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.700
dismiss the controversy bleedingthe more entangled

524
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.170
by your hearing.

525
00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:51.830
All the peace you make in theircause

526
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.230
is calling both the partiesknaves.

527
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.370
You are a pair of strange ones.

528
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.570
God-den to your worships.

529
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.900
More of your conversation wouldinfect my brain,

530
00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.730
being the herdsmen of thebeastly plebeians.

531
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.000
I'll be bold to take my leave ofyou.

532
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.800
If I should tell thee over thisthy day's work,

533
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.600
thou'd not believe thy deeds.

534
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:11.830
But I'll report it

535
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.330
where senators shall mingletears with smiles,

536
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.870
where great patricians shallattend and shrug,

537
00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.130
in the end admire,

538
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.130
where ladies shall be frighted,and, gladly quaked, hear more,

539
00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.630
where the dull tribunes that,with the fusty plebeians,

540
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.270
hate thine honors, shall sayagainst their hearts,

541
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.200
"We thank the gods our Rome hathsuch a soldier."

542
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.230
Pray now, no more.

543
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.970
My mother, who has a charter toextol her blood,

544
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.100
when she does praise me, grievesme.

545
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.630
I have done as you have done,that's what I can,

546
00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.500
induced as you have been, that'sfor my country.

547
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.770
He that has but effected hisgood will

548
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.570
hath overta'en mine act.

549
00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.730
You shall not be the grave ofyour deserving.

550
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.330
Rome must know the value of herown.

551
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.070
Therefore, I beseech you, insign of what you are,

552
00:28:55.070 --> 00:29:00.300
not to reward what you have donebefore our army hear me.

553
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.630
I have some wounds upon me andthey smart

554
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:04.330
to hear themselves remembered.

555
00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:05.330
Should they not,

556
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:07.100
well might they fester againstingratitude

557
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.430
and tent themselves with death.

558
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:16.030
Of all the treasure in thisfield achieved and city,

559
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.600
we render you the tenth to betaken forth

560
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.600
before the common distributionat your only choice.

561
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.700
I thank you, General,

562
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.970
but cannot make my heart consentto take a bribe to pay my sword.

563
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:35.930
I do refuse it and stand upon mycommon part

564
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:38.430
with those that have beheld thedoing.

565
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.170
May these same instruments,

566
00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.630
which you profane, never soundmore!

567
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.870
When drums and trumpets shall inthe field prove flatterers,

568
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:55.630
let courts and cities all bemade of false-faced soothing!

569
00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.600
For that I have not washed mynose that bled

570
00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.670
or foiled some debile wretch

571
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.530
which, without note, here's manyelse have done.

572
00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:10.100
You shout me forth inacclamations hyperbolical,

573
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.700
as if I loved my little shouldbe dieted

574
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.000
in praises sauced with lies.

575
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.100
Too modest are you,

576
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.400
more cruel to your good report

577
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:22.670
than grateful to us that giveyou truly.

578
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.000
By your patience, if againstyourself you be incensed,

579
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.130
we'll put you,

580
00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.570
like one that means his properharm,

581
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.700
in manacles, then reason safelywith you.

582
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.630
Therefore, be it known, as tous, to all the world,

583
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.000
that Caius Marcius wears thiswar's garland,

584
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.430
and from this time, for what hedid before Corioli,

585
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:51.230
call him, with all the applauseand clamor of the host,

586
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:56.200
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

587
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.600
Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

588
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.030
Coriolanus!

589
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:05.200
Bear the addition nobly ever.

590
00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:16.000
I will go wash,

591
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.230
and when my face is fair,

592
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:24.670
you shall perceive whether Iblush or no.

593
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.700
The gods begin to mock me.

594
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.770
I, that now refused mostprincely gifts,

595
00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.030
am bound to beg of my lordgeneral.

596
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.300
Take it; 'tis yours.

597
00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.370
What is it?

598
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:45.730
I sometime lay here in Corioliat a poor man's house.

599
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.700
He used me kindly.

600
00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.900
He cried to me.

601
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.370
I saw him prisoner.

602
00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:00.500
But then Aufidius was within myview,

603
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:04.900
and wrath o'erwhelmed my pity.

604
00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.870
I request you to give my poorhost freedom.

605
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:15.070
O, well begged.

606
00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:16.900
Were he the butcher of my son,

607
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.200
he should be free as is thewind.

608
00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.470
Deliver him, Titus.

609
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:23.870
Marcius, his name?

610
00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.300
By Jupiter, forgot.

611
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.070
I am weary.

612
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:45.930
Yea, my memory is tired.

613
00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.070
Have we no wine here?

614
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.930
The town is ta'en.

615
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:56.400
'Twill be delivered back on goodcondition.

616
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.600
Condition.

617
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.270
I would I were a Roman,

618
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.670
for I cannot, being a Volsce, bethat I am.

619
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:09.430
Condition.

620
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.700
What good condition can a treatyfind

621
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.570
in the part that is at mercy?

622
00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.530
Five times, Marcius, I've foughtwith thee.

623
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.330
So often hast thou beat me andwouldst do so, I think,

624
00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:26.770
should we encounter as often aswe eat.

625
00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.670
By the elements, if e'er again Imeet him beard to beard,

626
00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.000
he's mine,

627
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.230
or I am his.

628
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.470
Mine emulation hath not thathonor in it it had

629
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.100
for where I thought to crush himin an equal force.

630
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.300
True sword to sword,

631
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.500
I'll potch at him some way

632
00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:56.600
or wrath or craft may get him.

633
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.370
He is the devil.

634
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:04.630
Bolder, though not so subtle.

635
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.670
My valor's poisoned with onlysuffering stain by him,

636
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:12.430
for him shall fly out of itself.

637
00:34:12.430 --> 00:34:15.970
Nor sleep nor sanctuary,

638
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:20.800
being naked, sick, nor fane norcapitol,

639
00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.570
the prayers of priests nor timesof sacrifice,

640
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:26.500
embarquements all of fury,

641
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.600
shall lift up their rottenprivilege

642
00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:34.000
and custom against my hate toMarcius.

643
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.570
Where I find him,

644
00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.170
were it at home, upon mybrother's guard,

645
00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:44.270
even there, against thehospitable canon,

646
00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:51.430
would I wash my fierce hand inhis heart.

647
00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:55.870
How now, my as fair as nobleladies?

648
00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:59.070
And the moon, were she earthly,no nobler.

649
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.070
Whither do you follow your eyesso fast?

650
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:04.330
Honorable Menenius, my boyMarcius approaches.

651
00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.970
For the love of Juno, let's go.

652
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:07.200
Marcius coming home?

653
00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.370
Ay, worthy Menenius, and withmost prosperous approbation.

654
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.900
Take my cap, Jupiter, and Ithank thee.

655
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.900
Marcius coming home!

656
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.070
Nay, 'tis true.

657
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.130
Is he not wounded?

658
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.430
He was wont to come homewounded.

659
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:16.630
O, no, no, no.

660
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:18.100
O, he is wounded.

661
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.700
I thank the gods for it.

662
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.970
So do I too, and it be not toomuch,

663
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.370
brings a victory in his pocket?

664
00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.430
The wounds become him.

665
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.730
On's brows, Menenius,

666
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.470
he comes the third time homewith the oaken garland.

667
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.400
Has he disciplined Aufidiussoundly?

668
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.030
Titus Lartius writes they foughttogether,

669
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.300
but Aufidius got off.

670
00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.230
And 'twas time for him too, I'llwarrant him that.

671
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:37.430
And he had stayed by him,

672
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:40.270
I would not be so fidiused forall the chests in Corioli

673
00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.370
and the gold that's in them.

674
00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.130
Is the senate possessed of this?

675
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.830
Good ladies, let's go.

676
00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.130
Yes, yes, yes.

677
00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:50.470
The senate has letters from thegeneral

678
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:54.430
in which he gives my son thewhole name of the war.

679
00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:58.370
He has in this action outdonehis former deeds doubly.

680
00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.030
In troth, there's wondrousthings spoke of him.

681
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:02.030
Wondrous.

682
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:03.200
Ay, I warrant you,

683
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.830
and not without his truepurchasing.

684
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.570
The gods grant them true.

685
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:07.570
True.

686
00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:08.600
Pow, wow.

687
00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.670
True; I'll be sworn they aretrue.

688
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.030
Where is he wounded?

689
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.030
Where is he wounded?

690
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:15.600
In the shoulder and in the leftarm.

691
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.670
There will be large cicatricesto show the people

692
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.200
when he shall stand for hisplace.

693
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.000
He received in the repulse ofTarquin

694
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.300
seven hurts in the body.

695
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.600
One in the neck; two in thethigh.

696
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:24.700
That's nine that I know.

697
00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.300
He had, before this lastexpedition,

698
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.600
25 wounds upon him.

699
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.300
Now it is 27.

700
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.670
Every gash an enemy's grave.

701
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.130
Hark, the trumpets.

702
00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:37.630
These are the ushers of Marcius.

703
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:42.370
Before him he carries noise, andbehind him he leaves tears.

704
00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:46.770
Death, that dark spirit, in hisnervy arm doth lie,

705
00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:52.430
which, being advanced, declines,and then men die.

706
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:54.530
Know, Rome, that all alone

707
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.930
Marcius did fight within Corioligates,

708
00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:02.730
where he hath won, with fame, aname to Caius Marcius.

709
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:07.330
These in honor followsCoriolanus.

710
00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:12.000
Welcome to Rome, renownedCoriolanus.

711
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.630
No more of this.

712
00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.400
It does offend my heart.

713
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.870
Pray now, no more.

714
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.300
Look, sir, your mother.

715
00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:26.400
O, you have, I know, petitionedall the gods for my prosperity.

716
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.270
Nay, my good soldier, up.

717
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.770
My gentle Marcius,

718
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.170
worthy Caius,

719
00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:44.730
and by deed-achieving honornewly namedó

720
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.500
What is it?

721
00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:51.070
Coriolanus must I call thee?

722
00:37:51.070 --> 00:37:54.600
But O, thy wife.

723
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.170
My gracious silence,

724
00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:02.000
hail.

725
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.200
Wouldst thou have laughed had Icome coffined home,

726
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.330
that weepest to see me triumph?

727
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:10.930
Ah, my dear, such eyes thewidows in Corioli wear,

728
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:15.330
and mothers that lack sons.

729
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:18.600
Now, the gods crown thee.

730
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.730
And live you yet?

731
00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.430
O, sweet lady, pardon.

732
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:38.400
I know not where to turn.

733
00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.430
O, welcome home.

734
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:43.330
Welcome, General.

735
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.230
And you're welcome all.

736
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:52.430
100,000 welcomes.

737
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.430
I could weep, and I could laugh.

738
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:57.770
I am light and heavy.

739
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.270
Welcome.

740
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.970
The good patricians must bevisited,

741
00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.070
from whom I have received notonly greetings,

742
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.170
but with them change of honors.

743
00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:16.970
I have lived to see inherited myvery wishes

744
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:20.000
and the buildings of my fancy.

745
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.770
Only there's one thing wanting,

746
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:25.070
which I doubt not but our Romewill cast upon thee.

747
00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.700
Know, good mother, I had ratherbe their servant in my way

748
00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.100
than sway with them in theirs.

749
00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.900
On the sudden, I warrant himconsul.

750
00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:41.530
Then our office may, during hispower, go sleep.

751
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.930
He cannot temperately transporthis honors

752
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.500
from where he should begin andend,

753
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.070
but will lose those he hath won.

754
00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.100
In that, there's comfort.

755
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.570
Doubt not the commoners, withwhom we stand,

756
00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.230
but they upon their ancientmalice

757
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:59.600
will forget with the least causethese his new honors,

758
00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.930
which that he will give them

759
00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.100
make I as little question as heis proud to do it.

760
00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.900
I heard him swear, were he tostand for consul,

761
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.030
never would he appear in themarketplace,

762
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.300
nor on him put the naplessvesture of humility,

763
00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.900
nor showing, as the manner is,

764
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.030
his wounds to the people, begtheir stinking breaths.

765
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.030
'Tis right.

766
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:17.500
It was his word.

767
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.030
O, he would miss it rather thancarry it

768
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:20.370
but by the suit of the gentry tohim

769
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.300
and the desire of the nobles.

770
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.570
I wish no better than have himhold that purpose

771
00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:25.830
and to put it in execution.

772
00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:27.170
'Tis most like he will.

773
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:31.400
It shall be to him then as ourgood wills a sure destruction.

774
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.600
So it must fall out to him

775
00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.900
or our authorities for an end.

776
00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.800
We must suggest to the people

777
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.530
in what hatred he still hathheld them,

778
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.730
that to his power he would havemade them mules,

779
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:49.030
silenced their pleaders

780
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:50.930
and dispropertied theirfreedoms,

781
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.000
holding them, in human actionand capacity,

782
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.100
of no more soul nor fitness forthe world than...

783
00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.200
Camels in the war?

784
00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.100
Camels in the war

785
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.830
who have their provand only forbearing burdens

786
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.030
and sore blows for sinking underthem.

787
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.630
This, as you say, suggested atsome time

788
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:13.630
when his soaring insolence shalltouch the peopleó

789
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:16.030
which time shall not want, if hebe put upon it,

790
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.600
and that's as easy as to setdogs on sheepó

791
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:22.870
will be his fire to kindle theirdry stubble,

792
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.370
and their blaze shall darken himforever.

793
00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:27.570
What's the matter?

794
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.900
You are sent for to the capitol.

795
00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:33.230
'Tis thought that Marcius shallbe consul.

796
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.630
I have seen the dumb men throngto see him

797
00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:40.030
and the blind to hear him speak.

798
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.500
Matrons flung gloves,

799
00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.430
ladies and maids their scarfsand handkerchiefs

800
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.470
upon him as he passed.

801
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.470
The nobles bended as to Jove'sstatue,

802
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.530
and the commons made a showerand thunder

803
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.400
with their caps and shouts.

804
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.730
I never saw the like.

805
00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:00.630
Having determined of the Volscesand to send for Titus Lartius,

806
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:03.030
it remains, as the main point inthis our after-meeting,

807
00:42:03.030 --> 00:42:04.830
to gratify his noble service

808
00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:06.900
that hath thus stood for hiscountry.

809
00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.800
Therefore, please you, mostreverend and grave elders,

810
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.470
to desire the present consul,

811
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.200
and last general in ourwell-found successes,

812
00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.600
to report a little of the worthywork performed

813
00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.030
by Caius Marcius Coriolanus,

814
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.730
whom we met here both to thank

815
00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:23.530
and to remember with honors likehimself.

816
00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.700
Speak, good Cominius.

817
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.030
Leave nothing out for length,

818
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:28.400
and make us think rather ourstate's defective

819
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.630
for requital than we to stretchit out.

820
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:33.130
Masters of the people, we dorequest your kindest ears,

821
00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:36.770
and after, your loving motiontoward the common body

822
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:40.500
to yield what passes here.

823
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.430
We are convented upon a pleasingtreaty

824
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.400
and have hearts inclinable

825
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.300
to honor and advance the themeof our assembly.

826
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.430
Which the rather we shall beblessed to do,

827
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:52.370
if he remember a kinder value ofthe people

828
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.830
than he hath hereto prized themat.

829
00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:56.200
That's off; that's off.

830
00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.230
I would you rather had beensilent.

831
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:00.470
Please you to hear Cominiusspeak?

832
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:03.330
Most willingly, but yet mycaution was more pertinent

833
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.200
than the rebuke you give it.

834
00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.230
He loves your people

835
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:08.530
but tie him not to be theirbedfellow.

836
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.130
Worthy Cominius, speak.

837
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:11.130
Nay, keep your place.

838
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.170
Sit, Coriolanus;

839
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.600
never shame to hear what youhave nobly done.

840
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.730
Your honor's pardon.

841
00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.630
I'd rather have my wounds toheal again

842
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.470
than hear say how I got them.

843
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:21.100
Sir, I hope my words disbenchedyou not.

844
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:22.330
No, sir.

845
00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.230
Yet oft, when blows have made mestay,

846
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:25.970
I fled from words.

847
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:29.070
You soothed not, therefore hurtnot.

848
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.830
But your people, I love them asthey weigh.

849
00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:33.830
Pray now, sit down.

850
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.670
I had rather have one scratch myhead in the sun

851
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:36.770
when the alarum were struck

852
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.600
than idly sit to hear mynothings monstered.

853
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.370
Proceed, Cominius.

854
00:43:51.370 --> 00:43:54.900
I shall lack voice.

855
00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.400
The deeds of Coriolanus shouldnot be uttered feebly.

856
00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:02.370
It is held that valor is thechiefest virtue

857
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.270
and most dignifies the haver.

858
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.500
If it be, the man I speak of

859
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.430
cannot in the world be singlycounterpoised.

860
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:14.400
At 16 years, when Tarquin made ahead for Rome,

861
00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.970
he fought beyond the mark ofothers.

862
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:18.100
Our then dictator,

863
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.000
whom with all praise I point at,saw him fight,

864
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.070
when with his Amazonian chin

865
00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.070
he drove the bristled lipsbefore him.

866
00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.630
He bestrid an o'er-pressed Roman

867
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.100
and in the consul's view slewthree opposers.

868
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:38.670
Tarquin's self he met and struckhim on his knee.

869
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.030
In that day's feats,

870
00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:41.670
when he might act the woman inthe scene,

871
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.170
he proved best man in the field,

872
00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.730
and for his meed was brow-boundwith the oak.

873
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:54.070
His pupil age man-entered, thus,he waxed like a sea,

874
00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:57.670
and in the brunt of 17 battlessince,

875
00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.400
he lurched all swords of thegarland.

876
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.100
For this last,

877
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.630
before and in Corioli,

878
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.400
let me say, I cannot speak himhome.

879
00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.870
He stopped the fliers

880
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.830
and, by his rare example,

881
00:45:17.830 --> 00:45:22.200
made the coward turn terror intosport.

882
00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.230
As weeds before a vessel undersail,

883
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:29.770
so men obeyed and fell below hisstem.

884
00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:35.370
His sword, death's stamp whereit did mark, it took.

885
00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:42.930
From face to foot, he was athing of blood

886
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:47.730
whose every motion was timedwith dying cries.

887
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.600
Alone he entered the mortal gateof the city,

888
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.930
which he painted with shunlessdestiny,

889
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.530
aidless came off

890
00:45:56.530 --> 00:46:02.230
and with a sudden reinforcementstruck Corioli like a planet.

891
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.100
Now all's his.

892
00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:09.430
When, by and by, the din of wargan pierce his ready sense,

893
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.200
then straight his doubledspirit,

894
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.430
re-quickened what in flesh wasfatigate,

895
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.370
and to the battle came he,

896
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:18.800
where he did run reeking overthe lives of men

897
00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.330
as if 'twere a perpetual spoil.

898
00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:27.400
And till we called both fieldand city ours,

899
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:31.870
he never stood to ease hisbreast with panting.

900
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:33.470
Worthy man.

901
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:35.570
He cannot but with measure fitthe honors

902
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:36.830
which we devise him.

903
00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:40.970
Our spoils he kicked at andlooked upon things precious

904
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:43.570
as they were the common muck ofthe world.

905
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.130
He covets less than miseryitself would give,

906
00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.770
rewards his deeds with doingthem,

907
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:54.300
and is content to spend the timeto end it.

908
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.030
He's right noble.

909
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.270
Let him be called for.

910
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:58.370
Call Coriolanus.

911
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:04.530
The senate, Coriolanus,

912
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.370
are well pleased to make theeconsul.

913
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:10.700
I do owe them still my life andservices.

914
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.930
It then remains that you dospeak to the people.

915
00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:15.930
I do beseech you, let meo'erleap that custom,

916
00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.700
for I cannot put on the gown,stand naked and entreat them

917
00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:20.470
for my wounds' sake to givetheir suffrage.

918
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:22.230
Please you that I may pass thisdoing.

919
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:26.800
Sir, the people must have theirvoices,

920
00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.470
neither will they bate one jotof ceremony.

921
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.270
Put them not to it.

922
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:33.900
Pray you, go fit you to thecustom and take to you,

923
00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:37.030
as your predecessors have, yourhonor with your form.

924
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.070
It is apart that I shall blushin acting

925
00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.630
and might well be taken from thepeople.

926
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:41.630
Mark you that?

927
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.270
To brag unto them, thus I did,and thus,

928
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:45.830
to show them the unaching scarswhich I should hide

929
00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.130
as if I had received them

930
00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:48.730
for the hire of their breathonly.

931
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.100
Do not stand upon it.

932
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.370
We recommend to you, tribunes ofthe people,

933
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.170
our purpose to them,

934
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:58.200
and to our noble consul wish weall joy and honor.

935
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:02.500
Once, if he do require ourvoices,

936
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:04.400
we ought not to deny him.

937
00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.570
We may, sir, if we will.

938
00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.330
We have power in ourselves to doit,

939
00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:11.000
but it is a power that we haveno power to do,

940
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.430
for if he show us his wounds andtell us his deeds,

941
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:15.300
we are to put our tongues intothose wounds

942
00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.230
and speak for them.

943
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.530
So if he tell us his nobledeeds,

944
00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.100
we must also tell him our nobleacceptance of them.

945
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:25.830
Ingratitude is monstrous,

946
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.030
and for the multitude to beingrateful

947
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:29.730
were to make a monster of themultitude,

948
00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:31.230
of the which we being members,

949
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.930
should bring ourselves to bemonstrous members.

950
00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:37.330
And to make us no better thoughtof, a little help will serve,

951
00:48:37.330 --> 00:48:40.000
for once we stood up about thecorn,

952
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.870
he himself stuck not to call usthe many-headed multitude.

953
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:45.700
We have been called so of many;

954
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.270
not that our head are somebrown, some black,

955
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:50.200
some auburn, some bald,

956
00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:52.970
but that our wits are sodiversely colored.

957
00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:54.270
And truly, I think,

958
00:48:54.270 --> 00:48:57.570
if all our wits were to issueout of one skull,

959
00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:00.370
they would fly east, west,north, south,

960
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:02.870
and their consent of one directway

961
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:05.070
should be at once to all thepoints of the compass.

962
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:06.330
Think you so?

963
00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.800
Which way do you judge my witwould fly?

964
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.100
Nay, your wit will not so soonout as another man's will.

965
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.230
'Tis strongly wedged up in ablockhead,

966
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.030
but if it were at liberty,'twould, sure, southward.

967
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.330
Why that way?

968
00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.970
To lose itself in a fog,

969
00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:22.900
where being three parts meltedaway with rotten dews,

970
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.900
the fourth would return forconscience sake

971
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.130
to help to get thee a wife.

972
00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.730
You are never without yourtricks.

973
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:29.130
O, you may, you may.

974
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.370
Are you all resolved to giveyour voices?

975
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:32.470
- No - Yes.

976
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.930
But that's no matter; thegreater part carries it.

977
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.470
I say, if he would incline tothe people,

978
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:42.270
there never was a worthier man.

979
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:43.800
Here he comes,

980
00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.830
and in the gown of humility.

981
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.700
Mark his behavior.

982
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.170
We are not to stay all together

983
00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:51.800
but to come by him where hestands,

984
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:53.300
by ones, by twos, by threes.

985
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.330
He's to make his requests byparticulars.

986
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:59.570
Have you not known the worthiestmen have done it?

987
00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:10.630
What must I say?

988
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.870
"I pray, sir"ó

989
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:13.930
plague upon it.

990
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.070
I cannot bring my tongue to sucha pace.

991
00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.500
"Look, sir, my wounds.

992
00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.000
"I got them in my country'sservice,

993
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.500
"when some certain of yourbrethren

994
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.500
roared and ran from the noise ofour own drums."

995
00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.530
O, me, the gods.

996
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:26.800
You must not speak of that.

997
00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.470
You must desire them to thinkupon you.

998
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.930
Think upon me?

999
00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:33.500
Hang them.

1000
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.000
I would they would forget me,

1001
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.830
like the virtues which ourdivines lose by them.

1002
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:41.600
You'll mar all.

1003
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:42.800
I'll leave you.

1004
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.400
Pray you, speak to them, I prayyou, in wholesome manner.

1005
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.200
Bid them wash their faces andkeep their teeth clean.

1006
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.500
So here comes a brace.

1007
00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:27.730
You know the cause, sir, of mystanding here.

1008
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:30.430
We do, sir.

1009
00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:34.000
Tell us what hath brought you toit.

1010
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.070
Mine own desert.

1011
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:36.170
Your own desert.

1012
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:37.530
Ay, but not mine own desire.

1013
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:38.600
How not your own desire?

1014
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.900
No, sir, 'twas never my desire

1015
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.030
yet to trouble the poor withbegging.

1016
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:44.030
You must think, if we give youany thing,

1017
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.300
we hope to gain by you.

1018
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:49.600
Well, then, I pray, your priceof the consulship?

1019
00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.100
The price is to ask it kindly.

1020
00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:54.230
Kindly, sir.

1021
00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.730
I pray, let me have it.

1022
00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:09.430
I have wounds to show you,

1023
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.900
which shall be yours in private.

1024
00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:25.100
Your good voice, sir.

1025
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:27.930
What say you?

1026
00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:29.330
You shall have it, worthy sir.

1027
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:30.330
A match, sir.

1028
00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:32.770
There's in all two worthy voicesbegged.

1029
00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:37.070
I have your alms.

1030
00:52:39.130 --> 00:52:40.700
Adieu.

1031
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:44.400
But this is something odd.

1032
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.000
An 'twere to give againó

1033
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.230
'tis no matter.

1034
00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:57.930
Pray you now,

1035
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:00.800
if it may stand with the tune ofyour voices

1036
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.670
that I may be consul,

1037
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:06.930
I have here the customary gown.

1038
00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.170
You have deserved nobly of yourcountry,

1039
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.800
and you have not deserved nobly.

1040
00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:13.600
Your enigma?

1041
00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.470
You have been a scourge to herenemies;

1042
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:17.370
you have been a rod to herfriends.

1043
00:53:17.370 --> 00:53:19.230
You have not indeed loved thecommon people.

1044
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:20.800
You should account me the morevirtuous

1045
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.030
that I have not been common inmy love.

1046
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.830
I will, sir, flatter my swornbrother, the people,

1047
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.530
to earn a dearer estimation ofthem.

1048
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:30.330
'Tis a condition they accountgentle,

1049
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.070
and since the wisdom of theirchoice

1050
00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:34.530
is rather to have my hat than myheart,

1051
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:37.870
I will, sir, practice theinsinuating nod

1052
00:53:37.870 --> 00:53:40.030
and be off to them mostcounterfeitly.

1053
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:41.670
That is, sir, I will counterfeit

1054
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.270
the bewitchment of some popularman

1055
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:45.570
and give it bountiful to thedesirers.

1056
00:53:45.570 --> 00:53:47.630
Therefore, beseech you, I may beconsul.

1057
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:49.200
We hope to find you our friend

1058
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.370
and therefore give you ourvoices heartily.

1059
00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:53.230
You have received many woundsfor your country.

1060
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.130
I will not seal your knowledgewith showing them.

1061
00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:57.630
I will make much of your voices,and so trouble you no further.

1062
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:00.170
The gods give you joy, sir,heartily.

1063
00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.830
Most sweet voices.

1064
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:11.830
Better it is to die,

1065
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.700
better to starve,

1066
00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:18.230
than crave the hire which firstwe do deserve.

1067
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:22.030
Why in this woolvish toge shouldI stand here

1068
00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:23.330
to beg of Hob and Dick,

1069
00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:28.370
that does appear, their needlessvouches?

1070
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:32.270
Custom calls me to it.

1071
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:36.300
What custom wills, in all thingsshould we do it,

1072
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.800
the dust on antique time wouldlie unswept

1073
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.570
and mountainous error be toohighly heapt

1074
00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:47.170
for truth to over-peer.

1075
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:48.570
Rather than fool it so,

1076
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:49.870
let the high office and thehonor

1077
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:52.370
go to one that would do thus.

1078
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:54.230
I am half through.

1079
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:57.570
The one part suffered; the otherwill I do.

1080
00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.600
Here come more voices.

1081
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:04.600
Your voices.

1082
00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:08.430
For your voices, I have fought,

1083
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.630
watched for your voices,

1084
00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:16.870
for your voices bear of woundstwo dozen odd,

1085
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:20.400
battles thrice six I have seenand heard of,

1086
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.830
for your voices have done manythings,

1087
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:26.470
some less, some more;

1088
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:28.670
your voices.

1089
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:33.530
Indeed, I would be consul.

1090
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:34.530
He has done nobly

1091
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:36.600
and cannot go without any honestman's voice.

1092
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.370
Therefore, let him be consul.

1093
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:39.370
Amen.

1094
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:42.570
God save thee, noble consul.

1095
00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:44.330
Worthy voices.

1096
00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:45.630
You have stood your limitation,

1097
00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:47.800
and the tribunes endue you withthe people's voice.

1098
00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:49.700
Remains that, in the officialmarks invested,

1099
00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.230
you anon do meet the senate.

1100
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:52.270
Is this done?

1101
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:54.830
The custom of request you havedischarged.

1102
00:55:54.830 --> 00:55:57.770
The people do admit you and aresummoned to meet anon

1103
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:59.230
upon your approbation.

1104
00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.400
Where, at the senate house?

1105
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.930
- There, Coriolanus. - May Ichange these garments?

1106
00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.070
You may, sir.

1107
00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:04.930
That I'll straight do, and,knowing myself again,

1108
00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:06.000
repair to the senate house.

1109
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
I'll keep you company.

1110
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:10.230
He has it now,

1111
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:14.130
and by his looks, methinks 'tiswarm at his heart.

1112
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:17.570
With a proud heart he wore hishumble weeds.

1113
00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:21.000
Will you dismiss the people?

1114
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.170
How now, my masters?

1115
00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:26.700
Have you chose this man?

1116
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.130
He has our voices, sir.

1117
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:29.530
To my poor unworthy notice,

1118
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:31.530
he mocked us when he begged ourvoices.

1119
00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:33.570
Certainly, he flouted usdownright.

1120
00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:35.900
No, 'tis his kind of speech.

1121
00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.400
He did not mock us.

1122
00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.900
Not one amongst us, saveyourself,

1123
00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.800
but says he used us scornfully.

1124
00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:42.600
He should have showed us hismarks of merit,

1125
00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.230
wounds received for his country.

1126
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:45.470
Why, so he did, I'm sure.

1127
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.500
No, no;

1128
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:48.900
no man saw them.

1129
00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.600
He said he had wounds, which hecould show in private.

1130
00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.530
And with his hat, thus waving itin scorn,

1131
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:56.870
"I would be consul," says he.

1132
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.600
"Aged custom, but by yourvoices,

1133
00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.930
"will not so permit me.

1134
00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:01.830
Your voices therefore."

1135
00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:03.670
When we granted that, here was,

1136
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:05.100
"I thank you for your voices.

1137
00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.170
"Thank you for your most sweetvoices.

1138
00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:10.000
Now you have left your voices, Ihave no further with you."

1139
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.430
Was not this mockery?

1140
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:19.530
Why either were you ignorant tosee it, or, seeing it,

1141
00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:23.630
of such childish friendliness toyield your voices?

1142
00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:27.670
Did you perceive he did solicityou in free contempt

1143
00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:30.170
when he did need your loves,

1144
00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:31.500
and do you think that hiscontempt

1145
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.870
shall not be bruising to you,

1146
00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:35.670
when he hath power to crush?

1147
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:38.200
Why had your bodies no heartamong you?

1148
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.770
Or had you tongues to cry

1149
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:41.630
against the rectorship ofjudgment?

1150
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:44.800
Have you ere now denied theasker?

1151
00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.630
And now again of him that didnot ask but mock,

1152
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:51.770
bestow your sued-for tongues?

1153
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:52.930
He's not confirmed.

1154
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:54.400
We may deny him yet.

1155
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.430
And will deny him.

1156
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:57.800
I'll have 500 voices of thatsound.

1157
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.800
Let them assemble, and on asafer judgment,

1158
00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:03.530
all revoke your ignorantelection.

1159
00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:18.370
Tullus Aufidius then had madenew head?

1160
00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:19.470
He had, my lord,

1161
00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:21.670
and that it was which caused ourswifter composition.

1162
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:23.770
So then the Volsces stand but asat first,

1163
00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:25.530
ready, when time shall promptthem,

1164
00:58:25.530 --> 00:58:27.000
to make road upon us again.

1165
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.200
They are worn, lord consul,

1166
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:29.700
so that we shall hardly in ourages

1167
00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.670
see their banners wave again.

1168
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:34.230
Saw you Aufidius?

1169
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:35.400
On safeguard he came to me

1170
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.800
and did curse against theVolsces,

1171
00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.100
for they had so vilely yieldedthe town.

1172
00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.500
He's retired to Antium.

1173
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.500
Spoke he of me?

1174
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:42.500
He did, my lord.

1175
00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:45.000
How; what?

1176
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.030
How often he had met you, swordto sword;

1177
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:48.530
that of all things upon theearth,

1178
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.170
he hated your person most;

1179
00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:52.570
that he would pawn all hisfortunes

1180
00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:53.930
to hopeless restitution

1181
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:56.030
so he might be called yourvanquisher.

1182
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:57.300
At Antium lives he?

1183
00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.370
At Antium.

1184
00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.970
I wish I had a cause to seek himthere

1185
00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:06.000
to oppose his hatred fully.

1186
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.870
Welcome home.

1187
00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:19.500
Behold, these are the tribunesof the people,

1188
00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.630
the tongues of common mouth.

1189
00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:27.570
I do despise them for they doprank them in authority

1190
00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.170
against all noble sufferance.

1191
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:40.670
Pass no further.

1192
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:41.800
Ha, what is that?

1193
00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.470
It will be dangerous to go on.

1194
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:45.600
No further.

1195
00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.700
What makes this change?

1196
00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:47.800
The matter?

1197
00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.500
Hath he not passed the noble andthe common?

1198
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.070
Cominius, no.

1199
00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:53.100
Have I had children's voices?

1200
00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:55.130
Tribunes, give way; he shall tothe marketplace.

1201
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:56.670
The people are incensed againsthim.

1202
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:59.100
Stop or all will fall in broil.

1203
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.300
Are these your herd?

1204
01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.230
Must these have voices that canyield them now

1205
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.270
and straight disclaim theirtongues?

1206
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:07.170
What are your offices?

1207
01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:10.630
You being their mouths, why ruleyou not their teeth?

1208
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:12.330
Have you not set them on?

1209
01:00:12.330 --> 01:00:14.100
Be calm; be calm.

1210
01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:17.730
It is a purposed thing and growsby plot

1211
01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.830
to curb the will of thenobility.

1212
01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:21.970
Suffer it and live with such ascannot rule

1213
01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:23.370
nor ever will be ruled.

1214
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:25.200
Call it not a plot.

1215
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.970
The people cry you mocked them,

1216
01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:29.370
and of late, when corn was giventhem gratis,

1217
01:00:29.370 --> 01:00:30.770
you repined,

1218
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:32.470
scandaled the suppliants for thepeople,

1219
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:35.530
called them time-pleasers,flatterers, foes to nobleness.

1220
01:00:35.530 --> 01:00:36.600
Why, this was known before.

1221
01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600
Not to them all.

1222
01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.900
Have you informed them sithence?

1223
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:39.900
How I inform them?

1224
01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:40.970
You are like to do suchbusiness.

1225
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:42.000
Not unlike, each way, to betteryours.

1226
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.730
Why then should I be consul?

1227
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:46.070
By yond clouds, let me deserveso ill as you

1228
01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.200
and make me your fellow tribune.

1229
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.200
You show too much of that forwhich the people stir.

1230
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.730
If you will pass to where youare bound,

1231
01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:56.400
you must inquire your way,

1232
01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.830
which you are out of, with agentler spirit,

1233
01:00:59.830 --> 01:01:02.400
or never be so noble as aconsul,

1234
01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.370
nor yoke with him for tribune.

1235
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:09.770
Let's be calm.

1236
01:01:09.770 --> 01:01:11.570
The people are abused, set on.

1237
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:13.630
This paltering becomes not Rome,

1238
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.600
nor hath Coriolanus deservedthis so dishonored rub

1239
01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:18.800
laid falsely in the plain way ofhis merit.

1240
01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.430
Tell me of corn.

1241
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:23.200
This was my speech, and I willspeak it againó

1242
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.600
Not now; not now.

1243
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.400
Not in this heat, sir, now.

1244
01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.730
Now, as I live, I will.

1245
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:31.370
My nobler friends, I crave theirpardon.

1246
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:33.470
For the mutable, rank-scentedmany,

1247
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:36.730
let them regard me as I do notflatter

1248
01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:38.830
and therein behold themselves.

1249
01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.200
I say, again, in soothing them,

1250
01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.530
we nourish against our senatethe cockle of rebellion,

1251
01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:46.070
insolence, sedition,

1252
01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:49.670
which we ourselves have ploughedfor, sowed, and scattered,

1253
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:52.400
by mingling them with us, thehonored number,

1254
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.330
who lack not virtue, no, norpower,

1255
01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:56.330
but that which they have givento beggars.

1256
01:01:56.330 --> 01:01:57.330
Well, no more.

1257
01:01:57.330 --> 01:01:58.730
No more words, we beseech you.

1258
01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:00.770
How no more?

1259
01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:03.330
As for my country, I have shedmy blood,

1260
01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:04.630
not fearing outward force,

1261
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:06.930
so shall my lungs coin words

1262
01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.470
till their decay against thosemeasles,

1263
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:11.430
which we disdain, should tatterus,

1264
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:13.130
yet sought the very way to catchthem.

1265
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.000
You speak of the people as ifyou were a god to punish,

1266
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.800
not a man of their infirmity.

1267
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.430
'Twere well we let the peopleknow it.

1268
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:21.270
What; what?

1269
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:22.330
His choler?

1270
01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:23.330
Choler.

1271
01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:24.900
Were I as patient as themidnight sleep,

1272
01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.230
by Jove, 'twould be my mind.

1273
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:30.370
It is a mind that shall remain apoison where it is,

1274
01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:32.100
not poison any further.

1275
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:34.830
Shall remain?

1276
01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:46.030
Hear you this, Triton of theminnows.

1277
01:02:46.030 --> 01:02:50.700
Mark you his absolute "shall"?

1278
01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.830
'Twas from the canon.

1279
01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:55.670
"Shall"?

1280
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:59.100
O, good but most unwisepatricians.

1281
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.730
Why, you grave but recklesssenators,

1282
01:03:02.730 --> 01:03:05.930
have you thus given Hydra hereto choose an officer,

1283
01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:08.530
that with his peremptory"shall,"

1284
01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:11.300
being but the horn and noise ofthe monster's,

1285
01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.030
wants not spirit to say

1286
01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.130
he'll turn your current in aditch

1287
01:03:15.130 --> 01:03:17.270
and make your channel his?

1288
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:20.300
If he have power, then vail yourignorance;

1289
01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.530
if none, awake your dangerouslenity.

1290
01:03:23.530 --> 01:03:26.130
You are plebeians if they besenators,

1291
01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:29.400
and they are no less when, bothyour voices blended,

1292
01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.930
the greatest taste most palatestheirs.

1293
01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.200
They choose their magistrate,

1294
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.400
and such a one as he who putshis "shall,"

1295
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.470
his popular "shall,"

1296
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:43.570
against a graver bench than everfrowned in Greece.

1297
01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:47.000
By Jove himself, it makes theconsuls base.

1298
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.200
And my soul aches to know

1299
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.230
when two authorities are up,neither supreme,

1300
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:55.200
how soon confusion may enter'twixt the gap of both

1301
01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.700
and take the one by the other.

1302
01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:59.630
Well, on to the marketplace.

1303
01:03:59.630 --> 01:04:01.030
Whoever gave that counsel,

1304
01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:03.130
to give forth the corn of thestorehouse gratis,

1305
01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:04.870
as 'twas used sometime inGreeceó

1306
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:06.200
Well, well, no more of that.

1307
01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.500
Though there the people had moreabsolute power, I say,

1308
01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.800
they nourished disobedience andfed the ruin of the state.

1309
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.400
Why shall the people give onethat speaks thus their voice?

1310
01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:23.470
I'll give my reasons, moreworthier than their voices.

1311
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.030
They know the corn was not ourrecompense,

1312
01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:28.830
resting well assured they ne'erdid service for it.

1313
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:30.030
Being pressed to the war,

1314
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.200
even when the navel of the statewas touched,

1315
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.830
they would not thread the gate.

1316
01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:36.630
This kind of service did notdeserve corn gratis.

1317
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:39.300
Being in the war, their mutiniesand revolts,

1318
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.670
wherein they showed most valor,spoke not for them.

1319
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.300
Well, what then?

1320
01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:47.130
How shall this bosom multiplieddigest the senate's courtesy?

1321
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:50.700
Let deeds express what's like tobe their words.

1322
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.730
"We did request it.

1323
01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:55.230
"We are the greater poll, and intrue fear,

1324
01:04:55.230 --> 01:04:57.900
they gave us our demand."

1325
01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:01.300
Thus we debase the nature of ourseat

1326
01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.870
and make the rabble call ourcares fears,

1327
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:07.770
which will in time break ope'the locks of the senate

1328
01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:10.370
and bring in the crows to peckthe eagles.

1329
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:11.500
Come, enough.

1330
01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.000
Enough with over-measure.

1331
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
No, take more.

1332
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.700
What may be sworn by both divineand human

1333
01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.100
seal what I end withal.

1334
01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.770
This double worship,

1335
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:20.830
where one part does disdain withcause,

1336
01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:23.230
the other insult without allreason,

1337
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:25.830
where gentry, title, wisdom,

1338
01:05:25.830 --> 01:05:26.870
cannot conclude

1339
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:29.200
but by the yea and no of generalignorance.

1340
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.930
It must omit real necessities

1341
01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:34.130
and give way the while tounstable slightness.

1342
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:39.530
Purpose so barred, it follows,nothing is done to purpose.

1343
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:41.630
Therefore, beseech you,

1344
01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:44.200
you that will be less fearfulthan discreet,

1345
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.370
that love the fundamental partof state

1346
01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:48.070
more than you doubt the changeon it,

1347
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.670
that prefer a noble life beforea long,

1348
01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:53.770
that wish to jump a body with adangerous physic

1349
01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:55.300
that's sure of death without it,

1350
01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:58.870
at once pluck out themultitudinous tongue.

1351
01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:01.600
Let them not lick the sweetwhich is their poison.

1352
01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.700
Your dishonor mangles truejudgment

1353
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.870
and bereaves the state of thatintegrity

1354
01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:07.900
which should become it,

1355
01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.070
not having the power to do thegood it would,

1356
01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:11.730
for the ill which doth controlit.

1357
01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:12.970
Has said enough.

1358
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:16.400
Hath spoken like a traitor andshall answer as traitors do.

1359
01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.300
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelmthee.

1360
01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.400
What should the people do withthese bald tribunes

1361
01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.470
on whom depending,

1362
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:25.570
their obedience fails to thegreater bench?

1363
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:27.400
In a rebellion, when what's notmeet,

1364
01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.270
but what must be was law, thenwere they chosen.

1365
01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:31.370
In a better hour,

1366
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:33.500
let what is meet be said it mustbe meet,

1367
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.370
and throw their power i' thedust.

1368
01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:38.270
Manifest treason.

1369
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:40.400
This a consul?

1370
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:41.630
No.

1371
01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.800
Aediles, ho.

1372
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.970
Go, call the people,

1373
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:49.470
in whose name myself attach theeas a traitorous innovator,

1374
01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.870
a foe to the public weal.

1375
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:54.330
Obey, I charge thee, and followto thine answer.

1376
01:06:54.330 --> 01:06:56.400
Hence, old goat.

1377
01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:57.600
Hence, rotten thing,

1378
01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.700
or I'll shake thy bones out ofthy garments.

1379
01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:01.200
Help, ye citizens!

1380
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.570
Here's he that would take fromyou all your power.

1381
01:07:05.570 --> 01:07:07.930
Seize him, aediles.

1382
01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:09.500
Down with him!

1383
01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.770
Hear me.

1384
01:07:11.770 --> 01:07:14.170
Hear me, people; peace.

1385
01:07:14.170 --> 01:07:16.770
You are at point to lose yourliberties.

1386
01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.830
Marcius would have all from you,

1387
01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:21.630
Marcius, whom late you havenamed for consul.

1388
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:22.770
Fie, fie, fie.

1389
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:24.800
This is the way to kindle not toquench.

1390
01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.170
To unbuild the city and to layall flat.

1391
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:28.600
What is the city but the people?

1392
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.700
True, the people are the city.

1393
01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.200
By the consent of all,

1394
01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.530
we were established the people'smagistrates.

1395
01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.530
You so remain.

1396
01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.200
And so are like to do.

1397
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.830
That is the way to lay the cityflat,

1398
01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:41.870
to bring the roof to thefoundation and bury all,

1399
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:44.400
which yet distinctly ranges inheaps and piles of ruin.

1400
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.800
This deserves death.

1401
01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.930
Or let us stand to ourauthority,

1402
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.870
or let us lose it.

1403
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:50.800
We do here pronounce, upon thepart of the people,

1404
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:54.430
in whose power we were electedtheirs,

1405
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:58.200
Marcius is worthy of presentdeath.

1406
01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.130
Therefore lay hold of him,

1407
01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:02.670
bear him to the rock Tarpeian,

1408
01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:06.530
and from thence into destructioncast him!

1409
01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.470
Aediles, seize him.

1410
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:10.630
Beseech you, tribunes!

1411
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:15.400
Hear me but a word.

1412
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.300
Be that you seem truly yourcountry's friend,

1413
01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.900
and temperately proceed

1414
01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:23.300
in what you would thus violentlyredress.

1415
01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:26.470
Sir, those cold ways that seemlike prudent helps

1416
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:30.230
are very poisonous where thedisease is violent.

1417
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:33.430
Lay hands upon him and bear himto the rock.

1418
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:36.730
No.

1419
01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:40.200
I'll die here.

1420
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:46.070
There's some among you havebeheld me fighting.

1421
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:47.570
Come;

1422
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:53.100
try upon yourselves what youhave seen me.

1423
01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:00.270
Down with that sword.

1424
01:09:11.370 --> 01:09:14.200
Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

1425
01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:36.670
Go, get you to your house; begone.

1426
01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:38.300
Come, sir, along with us.

1427
01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:40.030
I would they were barbarians asthey are,

1428
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:42.600
though in Rome littered notRomans as they are not,

1429
01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.370
though calved in the porch ofthe Capitol

1430
01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:45.600
Be gone.

1431
01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.400
Put not your worthy rage intoyour tongue.

1432
01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.600
One time will owe another.

1433
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:54.100
On fair ground, I could beat 40of them.

1434
01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.130
Please, you, be gone.

1435
01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:00.130
I'll try whether my old wit bein request

1436
01:10:00.130 --> 01:10:01.900
with those that have but little.

1437
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:06.730
This must be patched with clothof any color.

1438
01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:08.130
Nay, come away.

1439
01:10:23.530 --> 01:10:26.030
This man has marred his fortune.

1440
01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:32.530
Where is this viper that woulddepopulate the city

1441
01:10:32.530 --> 01:10:34.300
and be every man himself?

1442
01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.700
You worthy tribunesó

1443
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.500
He shall be thrown down theTarpeian rock

1444
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.630
with rigorous hands.

1445
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:39.800
He hath resisted law,

1446
01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.130
and therefore law shall scornhim further trial

1447
01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:44.300
than the severity of the publicpower

1448
01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.130
which he so sets at nought.

1449
01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:47.700
Sir, sir, do not cry havoc

1450
01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:50.100
where you should but hunt withmodest warrant.

1451
01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:53.130
Sir, how comes it that you haveholp to make this rescue?

1452
01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:54.570
Hear me speak.

1453
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:56.400
As I do know the consul'sworthiness,

1454
01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:57.700
so can I name his faultsó

1455
01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.300
Consul; what consul?

1456
01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.130
The consul Coriolanus.

1457
01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:03.300
He consul?

1458
01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:06.300
If, by the tribunes' leave, andyours, good people,

1459
01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.270
I may be heard, I would crave aword or two,

1460
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:09.930
the which shall turn you to nofurther harm

1461
01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:10.970
than so much loss of time.

1462
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:12.000
Speak briefly then,

1463
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.100
for we are peremptory todispatch

1464
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.730
this viperous traitor.

1465
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.700
To eject him hence were but ourdanger

1466
01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.300
and to keep him here our certaindeath.

1467
01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:23.000
Therefore, it is decreed, hedies tonight.

1468
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.130
Now the good gods forbid thatour renowned Rome,

1469
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:29.070
whose gratitude towards herdeserved children

1470
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:31.130
is enrolled in Jove's own book,

1471
01:11:31.130 --> 01:11:34.600
like an unnatural dam should noweat up her own.

1472
01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:37.070
He's a disease that must be cutaway.

1473
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:39.330
O, he's a limb that has but adisease.

1474
01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:41.070
This is clean kam.

1475
01:11:41.070 --> 01:11:42.800
We'll hear no more.

1476
01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.870
Pursue him to his house andpluck him thence

1477
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:47.300
lest his infection, being ofcatching nature,

1478
01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:48.900
spread further.

1479
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:50.330
One word more.

1480
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:51.930
One word.

1481
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:53.370
This tiger-footed rage,

1482
01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:56.230
when it shall find the harm ofunscanned swiftness,

1483
01:11:56.230 --> 01:11:58.630
will too late tie leaden poundsto his heels.

1484
01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:01.170
Proceed by process.

1485
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:04.570
Lest parties, as he is beloved,break out

1486
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:06.870
and sack great Rome with Romans.

1487
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.070
If it were so

1488
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:09.270
What do ye talk?

1489
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:11.500
Have we not had a taste of hisobedience?

1490
01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.030
Our aediles smote?

1491
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:14.170
Ourselves resisted?

1492
01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:15.170
Come.

1493
01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.570
Consider this.

1494
01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:18.830
He has been bred in the warssince he could draw a sword

1495
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:21.570
and is ill schooled in boltedlanguage.

1496
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:25.100
Meal and bran together he throwswithout distinction.

1497
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:26.570
Give me leave.

1498
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:28.170
I'll go to him

1499
01:12:28.170 --> 01:12:30.930
and undertake to bring him wherehe shall answer,

1500
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.630
by a lawful form, in peace, tohis utmost peril.

1501
01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:38.130
Noble tribunes, it is the humaneway.

1502
01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:40.130
The other course will prove toobloody

1503
01:12:40.130 --> 01:12:43.400
and the end of it unknown to thebeginning.

1504
01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.230
Noble Menenius, be you then asthe people's officer.

1505
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:50.700
Masters, lay down your weapons.

1506
01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.470
Go not home.

1507
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:54.200
Meet on the marketplace.

1508
01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.130
We'll attend you there

1509
01:12:56.130 --> 01:12:58.530
where if you bring not Marcius,

1510
01:12:58.530 --> 01:13:01.300
we'll proceed in our first way.

1511
01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:06.500
I'll bring him to you.

1512
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:09.370
Let them pull all about mineears,

1513
01:13:09.370 --> 01:13:13.200
present me death on the wheel orat wild horses' heels,

1514
01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.230
or pile ten hills on theTarpeian rock

1515
01:13:16.230 --> 01:13:17.400
that the precipitation

1516
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.230
might down stretch below thebeam of sight,

1517
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:23.670
yet will I still be thus tothem.

1518
01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:29.030
Why did you wish me milder?

1519
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:31.730
Would you have me false to mynature?

1520
01:13:31.730 --> 01:13:34.570
Rather say I play the man I am.

1521
01:13:34.570 --> 01:13:36.270
O, sir, sir, sir,

1522
01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:38.630
I would have had you put yourpower well on

1523
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:40.070
before you'd worn it out.

1524
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:41.130
Let go.

1525
01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:43.530
You might have been enough theman you are

1526
01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:45.670
with striving less to be so.

1527
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:47.930
Lesser had been the thwartingsof your dispositions

1528
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:50.300
if you'd not showed them how youwere disposed

1529
01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.070
ere they lacked power to crossyou.

1530
01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:54.000
Let them hang.

1531
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.730
Ay, and burn too.

1532
01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.270
Come, come, you have been toorough, something too rough.

1533
01:13:58.270 --> 01:14:00.270
You must return and mend it.

1534
01:14:00.270 --> 01:14:02.230
There's no remedy, unless, bynot so doing,

1535
01:14:02.230 --> 01:14:04.270
our good city cleave in themidst and perish.

1536
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:06.070
O, pray, be counseled.

1537
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:07.930
I have a heart as little apt asyours

1538
01:14:07.930 --> 01:14:09.000
but yet a brain

1539
01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.600
that leads my use of anger tobetter vantage.

1540
01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.630
Well said, noble woman.

1541
01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:15.400
Before he should thus stoop tothe herd

1542
01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:17.200
but that the violent fit of thetime

1543
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.100
craves it as physic for thewhole state,

1544
01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.870
I would put mine armor on, whichI can scarcely bear.

1545
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:25.430
What must I do?

1546
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:26.730
Return to the tribunes.

1547
01:14:26.730 --> 01:14:28.030
Well, what then; what then?

1548
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.330
Repent what you have spoke.

1549
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:30.470
For them?

1550
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:32.530
I cannot do it to the gods; mustI then do it to them?

1551
01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:35.400
You are too absolute;

1552
01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.170
though therein you can never betoo noble

1553
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:41.630
but when extremities speak.

1554
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:44.400
I have heard you say honor andpolicy,

1555
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:45.700
like unsevered friends,

1556
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.400
in the war do grow together.

1557
01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.400
Grant that, and tell me in peace

1558
01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.170
what each of them by the otherlose

1559
01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:52.700
that they combine not there.

1560
01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:53.700
Tush, tush.

1561
01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.000
A good demand.

1562
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.170
If it be honor in your wars toseem the same you are not,

1563
01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:01.570
which, for your best ends, youadopt your policy,

1564
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:03.970
how is it less or worse that itshould hold

1565
01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:08.100
companionship in peace withhonor, as in war,

1566
01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.670
since that to both it stands inlike request?

1567
01:15:10.670 --> 01:15:13.370
Why force you this?

1568
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:16.770
Because that now it lies you onto speak to the people,

1569
01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:18.830
not by your own instruction,

1570
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:21.700
nor by the matter which yourheart prompts you,

1571
01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:25.370
but with such words that are butrooted in your tongue,

1572
01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:28.130
though but bastards andsyllables of no allowance

1573
01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:29.900
to your bosom's truth.

1574
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.300
Now, this no more dishonors youat all

1575
01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.870
than to take in a town withgentle words

1576
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:38.730
which else would put you to yourfortune

1577
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:40.770
and the hazard of much blood.

1578
01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:45.000
I would dissemble with my naturewhere my fortunes

1579
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.800
and my friends at stake requiredI should do so in honor.

1580
01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.330
I am in this your wife,

1581
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:53.900
your son, these senators, thenobles.

1582
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:57.800
And you will rather show ourgeneral louts

1583
01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.730
how you can frown than spend afawn upon them

1584
01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:02.270
for the inheritance of theirloves

1585
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:05.270
and safeguard of what that wantmight ruin.

1586
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:07.030
Noble lady.

1587
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:08.830
Come, go with us; speak fair.

1588
01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:11.000
You may salve so not what isdangerous present,

1589
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.330
but the loss of what is past.

1590
01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:14.030
I prithee now, my son,

1591
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:16.930
go to them with thy bonnet inthy hand,

1592
01:16:16.930 --> 01:16:19.470
and thus far having stretchedit,

1593
01:16:19.470 --> 01:16:21.330
here be with them.

1594
01:16:21.330 --> 01:16:23.170
This but done, even as shespeaks,

1595
01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:24.400
why, their hearts were yours.

1596
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:27.530
Here is Cominius.

1597
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:29.000
I have been in the marketplace,

1598
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.070
and, sir, 'tis fit you makestrong party

1599
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:33.330
or defend yourself by calmnessor by absence.

1600
01:16:33.330 --> 01:16:34.600
All's in anger.

1601
01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:36.630
Only fair speech.

1602
01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:37.700
I think 'twill serve,

1603
01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.170
if he can thereto frame hisspirit.

1604
01:16:39.170 --> 01:16:40.830
He must and will.

1605
01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.030
Prithee now; say you will and goabout it.

1606
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:47.700
Must I go show them my unbarbedsconce?

1607
01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:51.170
Must I, with my base tongue,give to my noble heart

1608
01:16:51.170 --> 01:16:54.670
a lie that it must bear?

1609
01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:03.200
Well, I will do it.

1610
01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.770
But were there but this singleplot to lose,

1611
01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:07.270
this mold of Marcius,

1612
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:11.800
they to dust should grind it andthrow it against the wind.

1613
01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.530
To the marketplace.

1614
01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:15.970
You have put me now to such apart

1615
01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:18.370
that never shall I discharge tothe life.

1616
01:17:18.370 --> 01:17:20.070
Come, come; we'll prompt you.

1617
01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:24.330
I prithee now, my son, as thouhast said,

1618
01:17:24.330 --> 01:17:26.970
my praises made thee first asoldier,

1619
01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:29.500
so to have my praise for this,

1620
01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.430
perform a part thou hast notdone before.

1621
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:37.070
Well, I must do it.

1622
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:43.030
Away, my disposition.

1623
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:46.430
Possess me some harlot's spirit.

1624
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:48.030
My throat of war be turned,

1625
01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:53.100
which, quired with my drum, intoa pipe small as an eunuch

1626
01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:57.630
or the virgin voice that babieslull asleep.

1627
01:17:57.630 --> 01:18:01.330
The smiles of knaves tent in mycheeks,

1628
01:18:01.330 --> 01:18:05.430
and schoolboys' tears take upthe glasses of my sight.

1629
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:06.700
I will not do it,

1630
01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.600
lest I surcease to honor mineown truth

1631
01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.100
and by my body's action

1632
01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.370
teach my mind a most inherentbaseness.

1633
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:16.600
At thy choice then.

1634
01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.700
To beg of thee,

1635
01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.900
it is my more disgrace than thouof them.

1636
01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:25.000
Come all to ruin.

1637
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:29.730
Let thy mother rather feel thypride

1638
01:18:29.730 --> 01:18:32.300
than fear thy dangerousstoutness,

1639
01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:34.800
for I mock at death with as bigheart as thou.

1640
01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.230
Do as thou list.

1641
01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:41.400
Thy valiantness was mine.

1642
01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.370
Thou suck'dst it from me.

1643
01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:46.270
But owe thy pride thyself.

1644
01:18:46.270 --> 01:18:48.270
Pray, be content.

1645
01:18:54.730 --> 01:19:00.370
Mother, I am going to themarketplace.

1646
01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:02.400
Chide me no more.

1647
01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:06.400
I'll mountebank their loves andcog their hearts from them

1648
01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.430
and come home beloved of all thetrades in Rome.

1649
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:14.430
Look, I am going.

1650
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:18.430
Commend me to my wife.

1651
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:20.030
I'll return consul,

1652
01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:22.370
or never trust to what my tonguecan do

1653
01:19:22.370 --> 01:19:24.800
i' the way of flattery further.

1654
01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.700
Do your will.

1655
01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.700
In this point charge him home,

1656
01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.270
that he affects tyrannicalpower.

1657
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:34.400
If he evade us there,

1658
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.070
enforce him with his envy to thepeople,

1659
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:37.670
and that the spoil got on theAntiates

1660
01:19:37.670 --> 01:19:39.930
was ne'er distributed.

1661
01:19:41.570 --> 01:19:42.570
What, will he come?

1662
01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:44.170
- He's coming. - Howaccompanied?

1663
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.270
With old Menenius

1664
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:47.270
and those senators that alwaysfavored him.

1665
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:49.130
Have you a catalog of all thevoices

1666
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.030
that we have procured set downby the poll?

1667
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:52.270
I have; 'tis ready.

1668
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:53.700
Have you collected them bytribes?

1669
01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:54.900
I have.

1670
01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.700
Assemble presently the peoplehither,

1671
01:19:56.700 --> 01:19:58.230
and when they hear me say,

1672
01:19:58.230 --> 01:20:01.570
"It shall be so in the right andstrength of the commons,"

1673
01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:04.300
be it either for death, forfine, or banishment,

1674
01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.400
then let them,

1675
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:09.770
if I say fine, cry "Fine," ifdeath, cry "Death,"

1676
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:11.400
insisting on the old prerogative

1677
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.970
and power in the truth of thecause.

1678
01:20:12.970 --> 01:20:13.970
I shall inform them.

1679
01:20:13.970 --> 01:20:16.270
And when such time they havebegun to cry,

1680
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:17.400
let them not cease,

1681
01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:20.130
but with a din confused enforcethe present execution

1682
01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.070
of what we chance to sentence.

1683
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:23.070
Very well.

1684
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:24.730
Make them be strong and readyfor this hint

1685
01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:26.170
when we shall hap to give itthem.

1686
01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:27.230
Go about it.

1687
01:20:29.100 --> 01:20:30.970
Put him to choler straight.

1688
01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:32.570
He hath been used ever toconquer

1689
01:20:32.570 --> 01:20:35.030
and to have his worth ofcontradiction.

1690
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:36.630
Being once chafed,

1691
01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:39.130
he cannot be reined again totemperance.

1692
01:20:39.130 --> 01:20:40.870
Then he speaks what's in hisheart,

1693
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:45.030
and that is there which lookswith us to break his neck.

1694
01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:49.700
Well, here he comes.

1695
01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:51.200
Calmly, I do beseech you.

1696
01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.970
Ay, as an ostler, that for thepoorest piece

1697
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:56.500
will bear the knave by thevolume.

1698
01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:08.100
The honored gods keep Rome insafety,

1699
01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:15.330
her chairs of justice suppliedwith worthy men,

1700
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:19.670
plant love among us,

1701
01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:23.230
and throng our large templeswith the shows of peace

1702
01:21:23.230 --> 01:21:26.730
and not our streets with war.

1703
01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:28.070
Amen, amen.

1704
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:29.830
A noble wish.

1705
01:21:31.570 --> 01:21:34.200
Shall I be charged no furtherthan this present?

1706
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:37.270
Must all determine here?

1707
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:39.130
I do demand,

1708
01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:42.600
if you submit you to thepeople's voices,

1709
01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.970
allow their officers,

1710
01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:47.730
and are content to suffer lawfulcensure

1711
01:21:47.730 --> 01:21:53.770
for such faults as shall beproved upon you?

1712
01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:54.770
I...

1713
01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:00.470
am content.

1714
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:03.430
Lo, citizens, he says he iscontent.

1715
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:06.170
The warlike service he has done,consider.

1716
01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:08.330
Think upon the wounds his bodybears,

1717
01:22:08.330 --> 01:22:10.370
which show like graves in theholy churchyard.

1718
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:11.500
Scratches with briers;

1719
01:22:11.500 --> 01:22:13.070
scars to move laughter only.

1720
01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:16.230
Consider further that when hespeaks not like a citizen,

1721
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:18.170
you find him like a soldier.

1722
01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:21.930
Do not take his rougher accentsfor malicious sounds,

1723
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:23.070
but, as I say,

1724
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:25.770
such as become a soldier ratherthan envy you.

1725
01:22:25.770 --> 01:22:26.900
What is the matter

1726
01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.470
that being passed for consulwith full voice,

1727
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:30.830
I am so dishonored

1728
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:32.770
that the very hour you take itoff again?

1729
01:22:32.770 --> 01:22:35.330
Answer to us.

1730
01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:40.800
Say, then.

1731
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.870
'Tis true.

1732
01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:45.400
I ought so.

1733
01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.870
We charge you that you

1734
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:50.000
have contrived to take from Romeall seasoned office

1735
01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.030
and to wind yourself into apower tyrannical,

1736
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:55.230
for which you are a traitor tothe people.

1737
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:57.770
How, traitor?

1738
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:59.200
Nay, temperately; your promise.

1739
01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.970
The fires i' the lowest hellfold in the people.

1740
01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:05.230
Call me their traitor.

1741
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:07.200
Thou injurious tribune.

1742
01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:09.970
Within thine eyes sat 20,000deaths,

1743
01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:12.670
in thy hands clutched as manymillions,

1744
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.930
in thy lying tongue bothnumbers.

1745
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:16.930
I would say, "Thou liest," untothee

1746
01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:19.500
with a voice as free as I dopray the gods.

1747
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:20.830
Mark you this, people?

1748
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:23.470
We need not put new matter tohis charge.

1749
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:25.430
What you have seen him do andheard him speak,

1750
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:27.670
beating your officers, cursingyourselves,

1751
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.100
opposing laws with strokes

1752
01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:32.600
and here defying those whosegreat power must try him;

1753
01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:36.570
even this, so criminal and insuch capital kind,

1754
01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:39.270
deserves the extremest death.

1755
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:42.600
But since he hath served wellfor Romeó

1756
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.230
What do you prate of service?

1757
01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:45.370
I talk of that that know it.

1758
01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:46.400
You?

1759
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.170
Is this the promise that youmade your mother?

1760
01:23:48.170 --> 01:23:49.830
- Know, I pray you - I'll knowno further.

1761
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:51.700
Let them pronounce the steepTarpeian death,

1762
01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:53.800
vagabond exile, flaying,

1763
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.770
pent to linger but with a graina day.

1764
01:23:55.770 --> 01:23:59.130
I would not buy their mercy atthe price of one fair word.

1765
01:23:59.130 --> 01:24:01.370
For that he has, as much as inhim lies,

1766
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:04.370
from time to time envied againstthe people,

1767
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:07.200
seeking means to pluck awaytheir power,

1768
01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.430
as now at last given hostilestrokes,

1769
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:12.630
and that not in the presence ofdreaded justice,

1770
01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:14.930
but on the ministers that dodistribute it,

1771
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:16.700
in the name of the people

1772
01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.630
and in the power of us, thetribunes,

1773
01:24:18.630 --> 01:24:24.800
we, even from this instant,banish him our city,

1774
01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:28.500
in peril of precipitation fromoff the rock Tarpeian

1775
01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.100
never more to enter our Romegates.

1776
01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:36.930
In the people's name, I say itshall be so.

1777
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:38.700
Hear me, my masters and mycommon friends

1778
01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:40.170
He's sentenced; no more hearing.

1779
01:24:40.170 --> 01:24:41.170
Let me speak.

1780
01:24:41.170 --> 01:24:42.270
I have been consul

1781
01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:44.070
and can show for Rome herenemies' marks upon me.

1782
01:24:44.070 --> 01:24:47.400
I do love my country's good witha respect more tender,

1783
01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.400
more holy and profound than mineown life,

1784
01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:52.800
my dear wife's estimate, herwomb's increase,

1785
01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.900
and treasure of my loins; thenif I would speak tható

1786
01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.670
We know your drift; speak what?

1787
01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:59.000
There's no more to be said,

1788
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.170
but he is banished as enemy tothe people and his country.

1789
01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:06.000
It shall be so.

1790
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.030
It shall be so; it shall be so.

1791
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:15.170
You common cry of curs

1792
01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:19.670
whose breath I hate as reek ofthe rotten fens,

1793
01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:21.300
whose loves I prize

1794
01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:23.600
as the dead carcasses ofunburied men

1795
01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:25.530
that do corrupt my air,

1796
01:25:25.530 --> 01:25:30.500
I banish you

1797
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:33.670
and here remain with youruncertainty.

1798
01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:36.900
Let every feeble rumor shakeyour hearts.

1799
01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.370
Your enemies, with nodding oftheir plumes,

1800
01:25:39.370 --> 01:25:42.900
fan you into despair.

1801
01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.900
Have the power still to banishyour defenders

1802
01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:50.170
till at length your ignorance,which finds not till it feels,

1803
01:25:50.170 --> 01:25:52.900
deliver you as most abatedcaptives to some nation

1804
01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:56.400
that won you without blows.

1805
01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:00.970
Despising for you, the city,

1806
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:04.830
thus I turn my back.

1807
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:23.500
There is a world elsewhere.

1808
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:28.330
Come, leave your tears.

1809
01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:30.330
A brief farewell.

1810
01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:34.100
The beast with many heads buttsme away.

1811
01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.730
Nay, mother, where is yourancient courage?

1812
01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:44.730
You were used to say extremitieswas the trier of spirits;

1813
01:26:44.730 --> 01:26:47.770
that common chances common mencould bear;

1814
01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:49.730
that when the sea was calm,

1815
01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:53.700
all boats alike showedmastership in floating.

1816
01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.030
You were used to load me withprecepts

1817
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:58.800
that would make invincible theheart that conned them.

1818
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.370
O, heavens; O, heavens.

1819
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:02.570
Nay, good woman

1820
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:05.700
Now the red pestilence strikeall trades in Rome

1821
01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.270
and occupations perish.

1822
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:11.970
What, what, what?

1823
01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:15.830
I shall be loved when I amlacked.

1824
01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:19.130
Nay, good mother.

1825
01:27:19.130 --> 01:27:21.500
Resume that spirit when you werewont to say

1826
01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:23.270
if you had been the wife ofHercules,

1827
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:24.970
six of his labors you'd havedone

1828
01:27:24.970 --> 01:27:27.770
and saved your husband so muchsweat.

1829
01:27:32.330 --> 01:27:34.000
Thy tears are salter than ayounger man's

1830
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.870
and venomous to thine eyes.

1831
01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:41.070
My sometime general, I have seenthee stern

1832
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:44.730
and thou hast oft beheldheart-hardening spectacles.

1833
01:27:44.730 --> 01:27:46.770
Tell these sad women

1834
01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:49.770
'tis fond to wail inevitablestrokes

1835
01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:53.700
as 'tis to laugh at them.

1836
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:56.930
My mother,

1837
01:27:56.930 --> 01:28:01.070
you wot well my hazards stillhave been your solace.

1838
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:05.270
and believed, not lightly,though I go alone,

1839
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:08.170
like to a lonely dragon,

1840
01:28:08.170 --> 01:28:11.530
that his fen makes feared andtalked of more than seen.

1841
01:28:11.530 --> 01:28:14.570
Your son will or exceed thecommon

1842
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:19.930
or be caught with cautelousbaits and practice.

1843
01:28:19.930 --> 01:28:23.230
My first son.

1844
01:28:23.230 --> 01:28:27.230
Whither wilt thou go?

1845
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:29.670
Take good Cominius with theeawhile.

1846
01:28:29.670 --> 01:28:31.000
Determine on some course

1847
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.100
more than a wild exposture toeach chance

1848
01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:36.330
that starts in the way beforethee.

1849
01:28:36.330 --> 01:28:38.430
O, the gods.

1850
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:39.470
I'll follow thee a month,

1851
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:41.030
devise with thee where thoushalt rest,

1852
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:43.130
that thou shalt hear of us andwe of thee,

1853
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:46.470
so if the time thrust forth acause for thy repeal,

1854
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:48.070
we shall not send over the vastworld

1855
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:49.970
to seek a single man and loseadvantage,

1856
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:52.200
which doth ever cool in theabsence of the needer.

1857
01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.370
O, fare ye well.

1858
01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.370
Thou hast years upon thee.

1859
01:28:54.370 --> 01:28:55.900
Thou art too full of the wars'surfeits

1860
01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:57.800
to go rove with one that's yetunbruised.

1861
01:28:57.800 --> 01:29:00.130
Bring me but out at gate.

1862
01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:03.730
Come now, my sweet wife, mydearest mother,

1863
01:29:03.730 --> 01:29:05.730
and my friends of nobler touch.

1864
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:11.830
When I am forth, bid me farewelland smile.

1865
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:14.600
I pray you, come.

1866
01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.830
While I remain above the ground,you shall hear from me still

1867
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:24.900
and never of me aught but whatis like me

1868
01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:26.430
formerly.

1869
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:31.430
Pray, come.

1870
01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:34.670
The nobility are vexed,

1871
01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:37.070
whom we see have sided in hisbehalf.

1872
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:38.400
Now we've shown our power,

1873
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.600
let us seem humbler after it isdone

1874
01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:43.800
than when it was a-doing.

1875
01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.800
Here comes his mother.

1876
01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:45.900
Let's not meet her.

1877
01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:47.170
- Why? - They say she's mad.

1878
01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:48.870
They have taken note of us; keepon your way.

1879
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:50.130
O, ye're well met.

1880
01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:52.530
The hoarded plague of the godsrequite your love.

1881
01:29:52.530 --> 01:29:54.170
Peace, peace; be not so loud.

1882
01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:56.830
If that I could for weeping, youshould hear

1883
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:59.400
Nay, and you shall hear some.

1884
01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:00.500
Will you be gone?

1885
01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.770
You shall stay too.

1886
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:04.000
I would I had the power to sayso to my husband.

1887
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.270
Are you mankind?

1888
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:07.230
Ay, fool; is that a shame?

1889
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:08.770
Note but this, fool.

1890
01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:11.400
Was not a man my father?

1891
01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:13.900
Hadst thou foxship to banish him

1892
01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:17.700
that struck more blows for Romethan thou has spoken words?

1893
01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:19.200
O, blessed heavens.

1894
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.900
More noble blows than ever thouwise words,

1895
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:23.830
and for Rome's good.

1896
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:26.770
I'll tell thee what.

1897
01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:28.930
Yet go.

1898
01:30:31.330 --> 01:30:33.300
Nay, thou shalt stay too.

1899
01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.430
I would my son were in Arabia,and thy tribe before him,

1900
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:37.700
his good sword in his hand.

1901
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.430
- What then? - What then?

1902
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:41.330
He'd make an end of thyposterity.

1903
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:43.070
Bastards and all.

1904
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:47.870
Good man, the wounds that hedoes bear for Rome.

1905
01:30:47.870 --> 01:30:49.430
O, come, come, peace.

1906
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:52.500
I would he had continued to hiscountry as he began

1907
01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.100
and not unknit himself the nobleknot he made.

1908
01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.130
I would he had.

1909
01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:57.270
"I would he had."

1910
01:30:57.270 --> 01:30:59.830
'Twas you incensed the rabble.

1911
01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:02.700
Cats that can judge as fitly ofhis worth

1912
01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:04.370
as I can of those mysteries

1913
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:06.400
which heaven will not have Earthto know.

1914
01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.670
Pray, let's go.

1915
01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:09.970
Now, pray, sir, get you gone.

1916
01:31:09.970 --> 01:31:12.800
You have done a brave deed.

1917
01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:15.770
Ere you go, hear this:

1918
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:17.370
As far as doth the capitol

1919
01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:21.530
exceed the meanest house inRome, so far my son,

1920
01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:24.970
this lady's husband here, this,do you see,

1921
01:31:24.970 --> 01:31:27.970
whom you've banished does exceedyou all.

1922
01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:30.930
Well, well; we'll leave you.

1923
01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:33.970
Why stay we to be baited withone that wants her wits?

1924
01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:36.570
Take my prayers with you.

1925
01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:42.030
I would the gods had nothingelse to do

1926
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:44.700
but to confirm my curses.

1927
01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.900
Could I meet them but once aday,

1928
01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:52.300
it would unclog my heart withwhat lies heavy to it.

1929
01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.600
You have told them home,

1930
01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:56.730
and, by my troth, you havecause.

1931
01:31:56.730 --> 01:31:58.070
You'll sup with me?

1932
01:32:00.570 --> 01:32:02.830
Anger's my meat.

1933
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:05.470
I sup upon myself

1934
01:32:05.470 --> 01:32:08.370
and so shall starve withfeeding.

1935
01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:09.930
Come, let's go.

1936
01:32:16.770 --> 01:32:21.170
Leave this faint puling andlament as I do,

1937
01:32:21.170 --> 01:32:23.670
in anger, Juno-like.

1938
01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:26.630
Come.

1939
01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:32.700
Come.

1940
01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:40.670
Come.

1941
01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:47.800
There hath been in Rome strangeinsurrections,

1942
01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:51.700
the people against the senators,patricians, and nobles.

1943
01:32:51.700 --> 01:32:53.170
Hath been?

1944
01:32:53.170 --> 01:32:55.000
Is it ended then?

1945
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.270
Our state thinks not so.

1946
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:59.700
They are in most warlikepreparation

1947
01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:03.330
and hope to come upon them inthe heat of their division.

1948
01:33:03.330 --> 01:33:04.500
The main blaze of it is past,

1949
01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.930
but a small thing would make itflame again,

1950
01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:09.930
for the nobles receive so toheart

1951
01:33:09.930 --> 01:33:13.500
the banishment of that worthyCoriolanus

1952
01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:15.300
that they are in a ripe aptness

1953
01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:17.300
to take all power from thepeople

1954
01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:20.600
and to pluck from them theirtribunes forever.

1955
01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.270
This lies glowing, I can tellyou,

1956
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:24.670
and is almost mature for theviolent breaking out.

1957
01:33:24.670 --> 01:33:27.470
Coriolanus banished?

1958
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:29.870
Banished, sir.

1959
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:34.170
You will be welcome with thisintelligence.

1960
01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:36.800
The day serves well for themnow.

1961
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.870
I've heard it said,

1962
01:33:37.870 --> 01:33:39.430
the fittest time to corrupt aman's wife

1963
01:33:39.430 --> 01:33:42.670
is when she's fallen out withher husband.

1964
01:33:42.670 --> 01:33:45.330
Your noble Tullus Aufidius willappear well in these wars,

1965
01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:47.730
his great opposer, Coriolanus,

1966
01:33:47.730 --> 01:33:50.970
being now in no request of hiscountry.

1967
01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:55.030
A goodly city is this Antium.

1968
01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:03.570
City, 'tis I that made thywidows.

1969
01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:08.130
Many an heir of these fairedifices

1970
01:34:08.130 --> 01:34:14.930
'fore my wars have I heard groanand drop.

1971
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:19.700
Then know me not,

1972
01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:25.430
lest that thy wives with spitsand boys with stones

1973
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:29.730
in puny battle slay me.

1974
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:37.670
Save you, sir.

1975
01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:39.530
And you.

1976
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:45.630
Direct me, if it be your will,where great Aufidius lies.

1977
01:34:45.630 --> 01:34:47.530
Is he in Antium?

1978
01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:48.530
He is.

1979
01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:51.270
Which is his house, beseech you?

1980
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:53.070
This here before you.

1981
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:55.630
I'll thank you, sir.

1982
01:34:55.630 --> 01:34:56.630
Farewell.

1983
01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:04.130
O, world, thy slippery turns.

1984
01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:06.800
Friends now fast sworn,

1985
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.370
whose double bosom seems to wearone heart,

1986
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:14.300
whose hours, whose bed, whosemeal and exercise

1987
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.630
are still together,

1988
01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:19.570
who twin, as 'twere, in loveunseparable,

1989
01:35:19.570 --> 01:35:24.030
shall, within this hour, on adissension of a doit,

1990
01:35:24.030 --> 01:35:27.770
break out to bitterest enmity.

1991
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:32.630
So, fellest foes, whose passionsand whose plots

1992
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:35.630
have broke their sleep to takethe one the other,

1993
01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:41.870
by some chance, some trick notworth an egg,

1994
01:35:41.870 --> 01:35:48.270
shall grow dear friends andinterjoin their issues.

1995
01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:53.230
So with me.

1996
01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:56.700
My birthplace hate I,

1997
01:35:56.700 --> 01:36:01.970
and my love's upon this enemytown.

1998
01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:09.530
I'll enter.

1999
01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:13.470
If he slay me, he does fairjustice.

2000
01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:22.900
If he give me way, I'll do hiscountry service.

2001
01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.630
Whence comest thou?

2002
01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:27.700
What wouldst thou?

2003
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:31.200
Thy name?

2004
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:34.530
Why speak'st not?

2005
01:36:34.530 --> 01:36:35.800
Speak, man; what's thy name?

2006
01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:39.000
If, Tullus, not yet thou knowestme,

2007
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.170
and, seeing me,

2008
01:36:40.170 --> 01:36:42.930
does not think me for the man Iam,

2009
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:46.870
necessity commands me namemyself.

2010
01:36:46.870 --> 01:36:47.870
What is thy name?

2011
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:50.770
A name unmusical to the Volscianears

2012
01:36:50.770 --> 01:36:52.800
and harsh in sound to thine.

2013
01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.000
Say, what's thy name?

2014
01:36:58.330 --> 01:37:00.730
Thou hast a grim appearance,

2015
01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:03.530
and thy face bears a command init,

2016
01:37:03.530 --> 01:37:05.030
though thy tackle's torn.

2017
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:08.470
Thou show'st a noble vessel.

2018
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:11.600
What's thy name?

2019
01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.130
Prepare thy brow to frown.

2020
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:21.270
Know'st thou me yet?

2021
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:24.130
I know thee not.

2022
01:37:24.130 --> 01:37:25.930
Thy name?

2023
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:31.370
My name is Caius Marcius

2024
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:34.000
who hath done to theeparticularly

2025
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.830
and to all the Volsces greathurt and mischief;

2026
01:37:40.830 --> 01:37:46.570
thereto witness may my surname,Coriolanus.

2027
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:53.170
The painful service, the extremedangers,

2028
01:37:53.170 --> 01:37:57.130
and the drops of blood shed formy thankless country

2029
01:37:57.130 --> 01:38:01.800
are requited but with thatsurname,

2030
01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.970
a good memory,

2031
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:05.270
and witness of the malice anddispleasure

2032
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:07.300
which thou shouldst bear me.

2033
01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.430
Only that name remains.

2034
01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:19.230
The cruelty and envy of thepeople,

2035
01:38:19.230 --> 01:38:23.300
permitted by our dastard nobles,who have all forsook me,

2036
01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:25.970
hath devoured the rest andsuffered me

2037
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:32.500
by the voice of slaves to bewhooped out of Rome.

2038
01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:37.400
Now this extremity hath broughtme to thy hearth,

2039
01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.770
not out of hope, mistake me not,to save my life,

2040
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:42.800
for if I had feared death,

2041
01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:47.270
of all the men in the world, Iwould have 'voided thee,

2042
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:51.430
but in mere spite,

2043
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:53.900
to be full quit of those mybanishers,

2044
01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:56.500
stand I before thee here.

2045
01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:59.770
Then if thou hast a heart ofwreak in thee,

2046
01:38:59.770 --> 01:39:02.270
that will revenge thine ownparticular wrongs

2047
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:06.100
and stop those maims of shameseen through thy country,

2048
01:39:06.100 --> 01:39:07.370
speed thee straight

2049
01:39:07.370 --> 01:39:11.730
and make my misery serve thyturn.

2050
01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:14.930
So use it that my revengefulservices

2051
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:17.270
may prove as benefits to thee,

2052
01:39:17.270 --> 01:39:22.070
for I will fight against mycankered country

2053
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:25.870
with the spleen of all the underfiends.

2054
01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:30.270
But if so be thou darest notthis

2055
01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:33.830
and that to prove more fortunesthou art tired,

2056
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:40.600
then, in a word, I also amlonger to live most weary,

2057
01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:46.770
and present my throat to theeand to thy ancient malice,

2058
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:50.100
which not to cut would show theebut a fool,

2059
01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:52.230
since I have ever followed theewith hate,

2060
01:39:52.230 --> 01:39:55.670
drawn tuns of blood from thycountry's breast,

2061
01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:58.670
and cannot live but to thyshame,

2062
01:39:58.670 --> 01:40:04.430
unless it be to do thee service.

2063
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:13.430
O, Marcius, Marcius.

2064
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:18.170
Each word thou hast spoke hathweeded from my heart

2065
01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:21.430
a root of ancient envy.

2066
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:24.230
If Jupiter should from yondcloud speak divine things

2067
01:40:24.230 --> 01:40:25.330
and say, "Tis true,"

2068
01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:27.730
I'd not believe them more thanthee,

2069
01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:30.870
all noble Marcius.

2070
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:38.030
Let me twine mine arms aboutthat body

2071
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:41.400
where against my grained ash anhundred times hath broke

2072
01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.930
and scarred the moon withsplinters.

2073
01:40:44.930 --> 01:40:49.870
Here I clip the anvil of mysword

2074
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:53.930
and do contest as hotly and asnobly with thy love

2075
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:59.270
as ever in ambitious strength Idid contend against thy valor.

2076
01:40:59.270 --> 01:41:02.930
Know thou first, I loved themaid I married;

2077
01:41:02.930 --> 01:41:04.400
Never man sighed truer breath

2078
01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:10.470
but that I see thee here, thounoble thing,

2079
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:13.400
more dances my rapt heart thanwhen I first

2080
01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:17.270
my wedded mistress saw bestridemy threshold.

2081
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:23.030
Why, thou Mars.

2082
01:41:26.300 --> 01:41:31.070
I tell thee, we have a power onfoot,

2083
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:32.500
and I had purpose once more

2084
01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:34.200
to hew thy target from thy brawn

2085
01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:37.470
or lose mine arm for it.

2086
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:40.430
Thou hast beat me out twelveseveral times,

2087
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:43.730
and I have nightly since dreamtof encounters

2088
01:41:43.730 --> 01:41:46.000
'twixt thyself and me.

2089
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.470
We've been down together in mysleep,

2090
01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:51.770
unbuckling helms, fixing eachother's throats,

2091
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:55.370
and waked half dead withnothing.

2092
01:41:58.370 --> 01:42:00.600
Worthy Marcius.

2093
01:42:03.330 --> 01:42:05.300
Had we no other quarrel else toRome

2094
01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:07.500
but that thou art thencebanished,

2095
01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.230
we would muster all from twelveto seventy

2096
01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:13.200
and pouring war into the bowelsof ungrateful Rome

2097
01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.400
like a bold flood o'er-bear it.

2098
01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:22.800
Come, go in

2099
01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.230
and take our friendly senatorsby the hands

2100
01:42:25.230 --> 01:42:26.500
who now are here,

2101
01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:28.070
taking their leaves of me,

2102
01:42:28.070 --> 01:42:30.870
who am prepared against yourterritories,

2103
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:32.830
though not for Rome itself.

2104
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:34.970
You bless me, gods.

2105
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:38.100
Therefore, most absolute sir,

2106
01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:42.430
if thou wilt have the leading ofthine own revenges,

2107
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:46.400
take the one half of mycommission

2108
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.170
and set down, as best thou artexperienced,

2109
01:42:48.170 --> 01:42:50.870
since thou know'st thy country'sstrength and weakness,

2110
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:53.230
thine own ways,

2111
01:42:53.230 --> 01:42:55.270
whether to knock against thegates of Rome

2112
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:58.570
or rudely visit them in partsremote,

2113
01:42:58.570 --> 01:43:00.570
to fright them, ere destroy.

2114
01:43:02.970 --> 01:43:05.070
But come in.

2115
01:43:05.070 --> 01:43:06.670
Let me commend thee first

2116
01:43:06.670 --> 01:43:09.200
to those that shall say yea tothy desires.

2117
01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:16.430
A thousand welcomes

2118
01:43:16.430 --> 01:43:22.200
and more a friend than ever anenemy,

2119
01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.600
yet, Marcius, that was much.

2120
01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:32.070
We hear not of him, neither needwe fear him.

2121
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:34.100
His remedies are tame.

2122
01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:36.730
The present peace and quietnessof the people,

2123
01:43:36.730 --> 01:43:38.470
which before were in wild hurry,

2124
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:42.500
here do we make his friendsblush that the world goes well,

2125
01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.070
who rather had,

2126
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:46.730
though they themselves didsuffer by it,

2127
01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:51.770
behold dissentious numberspestering streets

2128
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:55.170
than see our tradesmen singingin their shops

2129
01:43:55.170 --> 01:43:57.800
and going about their functionsfriendly.

2130
01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:01.000
We stood to it in good time.

2131
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:02.470
Is this Menenius?

2132
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:05.930
'Tis he; 'tis he.

2133
01:44:07.530 --> 01:44:09.200
Hail sir.

2134
01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.130
Hail to you both.

2135
01:44:11.130 --> 01:44:14.970
Your Coriolanus is not muchmissed

2136
01:44:14.970 --> 01:44:17.430
but with his friends.

2137
01:44:17.430 --> 01:44:19.470
The commonwealth doth stand,

2138
01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:24.100
and so would do, were he moreangry at it.

2139
01:44:24.100 --> 01:44:25.270
Where is he, hear you?

2140
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:27.300
No, I hear nothing.

2141
01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.400
His mother and his wife hearnothing from him.

2142
01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.400
Worthy tribunes,

2143
01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.170
there is a slave whom we haveput in prison,

2144
01:44:34.170 --> 01:44:37.600
reports the Volsces with twoseveral powers

2145
01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.570
are entered in the Romanterritories,

2146
01:44:39.570 --> 01:44:41.830
and with the deepest malice ofthe war

2147
01:44:41.830 --> 01:44:43.770
destroy what lies before them.

2148
01:44:44.730 --> 01:44:48.330
'Tis Aufidius who, hearing ofour Marcius' banishment,

2149
01:44:48.330 --> 01:44:50.830
thrusts forth his horns againinto the world

2150
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:53.730
which were inshelled whenMarcius stood for Rome

2151
01:44:53.730 --> 01:44:55.630
and durst not once peep out.

2152
01:44:55.630 --> 01:44:57.770
Come, what talk you of Marcius?

2153
01:44:57.770 --> 01:44:59.730
Go, see this rumorer whipped.

2154
01:44:59.730 --> 01:45:01.770
It cannot be the Volsces darebreak with us.

2155
01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:03.700
Cannot be.

2156
01:45:03.700 --> 01:45:06.070
I have record that very well itcan,

2157
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:08.630
and three examples of the likehave been within my age.

2158
01:45:08.630 --> 01:45:09.630
Tell not me.

2159
01:45:09.630 --> 01:45:10.700
I know this cannot be.

2160
01:45:10.700 --> 01:45:11.970
Not possible.

2161
01:45:11.970 --> 01:45:13.830
The nobles in great earnestness

2162
01:45:13.830 --> 01:45:15.230
are coming all to the senatehouse.

2163
01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:18.100
Some news there is that stirstheir countenances.

2164
01:45:18.100 --> 01:45:20.370
Well, 'tis this slave.

2165
01:45:20.370 --> 01:45:22.530
Go, whip him 'fore the people'seyes.

2166
01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:24.670
His raising, nothing but hisreport.

2167
01:45:24.670 --> 01:45:26.570
The slave's report is seconded,

2168
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:28.930
and more, more fearful isdelivered.

2169
01:45:28.930 --> 01:45:30.570
What more fearful?

2170
01:45:30.570 --> 01:45:32.130
It is spoke freely out of manymouths,

2171
01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:33.770
how probably, I do not know,

2172
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:36.200
that Marcius, joined withAufidius,

2173
01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:39.430
leads a power against Rome andvows revenge as spacious

2174
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:41.700
as between the youngest andoldest thing.

2175
01:45:41.700 --> 01:45:44.600
O, you have made good work.

2176
01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.170
What news?

2177
01:45:46.170 --> 01:45:48.270
If Marcius should be joined withthe Volsciansó

2178
01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:49.870
If?

2179
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:52.470
He is their god.

2180
01:45:52.470 --> 01:45:54.730
He leads them like a thing madeby some other deity

2181
01:45:54.730 --> 01:45:56.900
than nature that shapes manbetter,

2182
01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:00.300
and they follow him against usbrats,

2183
01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:01.770
with no less confidence

2184
01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:04.630
than boys pursuing summerbutterflies

2185
01:46:04.630 --> 01:46:07.100
or butchers killing flies.

2186
01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:10.030
You have made good work, you andyour apron-men

2187
01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:12.570
that stood so much upon thevoice of occupation

2188
01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:14.530
and the breath of garlic eaters.

2189
01:46:14.530 --> 01:46:17.370
All the regions do smilinglyrevolt

2190
01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:19.900
and who resist are mocked forvaliant ignorance

2191
01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:22.430
and perish constant fools.

2192
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:23.970
Who is it can blame him?

2193
01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:26.500
Your enemies and his findsomething in him.

2194
01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:30.400
We are all undone unless thenoble man have mercy.

2195
01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.330
Who shall ask it?

2196
01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:34.330
The tribunes cannot do it forshame.

2197
01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:36.070
The people deserve such pity ofhim

2198
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:37.970
as the wolf does of theshepherds.

2199
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:40.470
For his best friends, if theyshould say,

2200
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:41.630
"Be good to Rome,"

2201
01:46:41.630 --> 01:46:43.200
they charged him even as thoseshould do that

2202
01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:44.970
had deserved his hate, andtherein showed like enemies.

2203
01:46:44.970 --> 01:46:45.970
'Tis true.

2204
01:46:45.970 --> 01:46:47.070
If he were putting to my house

2205
01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:48.500
the brand that should consumeit,

2206
01:46:48.500 --> 01:46:50.700
I have not the face to say,"Beseech you, cease."

2207
01:46:50.700 --> 01:46:52.870
You have brought a tremblingupon Rome.

2208
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:54.170
Say not we brought it.

2209
01:46:54.170 --> 01:46:55.830
How; was it we?

2210
01:46:55.830 --> 01:47:00.830
We loved him but, like beastsand cowardly nobles,

2211
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:02.430
gave way unto your clusters

2212
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:03.970
who did hoot him out of thecity.

2213
01:47:03.970 --> 01:47:06.230
But I fear they'll roar him inagain.

2214
01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:08.600
Tullus Aufidius, the second nameof men,

2215
01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.830
obeys his points as if he werehis officer.

2216
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:15.000
Desperation is all the policy,strength, and defense

2217
01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.630
that Rome can make against them.

2218
01:47:17.630 --> 01:47:20.230
Here come the clusters

2219
01:47:20.230 --> 01:47:21.770
that made the air unwholesome

2220
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:24.470
when you cast your stinking,greasy caps

2221
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:26.070
in hooting at Coriolanus' exile.

2222
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:28.130
Faith, we hear fearful news.

2223
01:47:28.130 --> 01:47:30.300
For mine own part, when I said,"Banish him,"

2224
01:47:30.300 --> 01:47:31.300
I said 'twas pity.

2225
01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:32.300
And so did I.

2226
01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:33.300
And so did I,

2227
01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:35.230
and, to say the truth, so didvery many of us.

2228
01:47:35.230 --> 01:47:36.500
That we did, we did for thebest,

2229
01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:38.570
and though we willinglyconsented to his banishment,

2230
01:47:38.570 --> 01:47:40.970
yet it was against our will.

2231
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:44.870
You're goodly things, youvoices.

2232
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:48.070
You have made good work, you andyour cry.

2233
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:51.370
Do they still fly to the Roman?

2234
01:47:51.370 --> 01:47:53.800
I do not know what witchcraft'sin him,

2235
01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:56.700
but your soldiers use him as thegrace 'fore meat,

2236
01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.900
their talk at table, and theirthanks at end,

2237
01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:03.330
and you are darkened by thisaction, sir,

2238
01:48:03.330 --> 01:48:05.430
even by your own.

2239
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:07.870
I cannot help it now,

2240
01:48:07.870 --> 01:48:13.630
unless, by using means, I lamethe foot of our design.

2241
01:48:13.630 --> 01:48:16.130
He bears himself more proudlier,even to my person,

2242
01:48:16.130 --> 01:48:19.870
than I thought he would whenfirst I did embrace him.

2243
01:48:19.870 --> 01:48:21.970
Yet his nature in that's nochangeling;

2244
01:48:21.970 --> 01:48:25.930
and I must excuse what cannot beamended.

2245
01:48:25.930 --> 01:48:29.770
Yet I wish, sir I mean for yourparticular

2246
01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:32.600
you had not joined in commissionwith him,

2247
01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:36.470
but either had borne the actionof yourself

2248
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:39.100
or else to him had left itsolely.

2249
01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:41.430
I understand thee well, and bethou sure,

2250
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:42.770
when he shall come to hisaccount,

2251
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:45.900
he knows not what I can urgeagainst him.

2252
01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.770
Although it seems, and so hethinks,

2253
01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:49.830
and is no less apparent to thevulgar eye,

2254
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:51.800
that he bears all things fairly

2255
01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:54.630
and shows good husbandry for theVolscian state,

2256
01:48:54.630 --> 01:48:56.900
fights dragon-like

2257
01:48:56.900 --> 01:49:00.330
and does achieve as soon as drawhis sword,

2258
01:49:00.330 --> 01:49:04.500
yet he hath left undone thatwhich shall break his neck

2259
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:08.900
or hazard mine whenever we cometo our account.

2260
01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:14.500
Sir, I beseech you, think youhe'll carry Rome?

2261
01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:18.070
All places yield to him ere hesits down

2262
01:49:18.070 --> 01:49:20.130
and the nobility of Rome arehis.

2263
01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:22.900
The senators and patricians lovehim too.

2264
01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:24.470
The tribunes are no soldiers,

2265
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:26.430
and their people will be as rashin the repeal,

2266
01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:28.030
as hasty to expel him thence.

2267
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:31.230
I think he'll be to Rome as isthe osprey to the fish

2268
01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:34.130
who takes it by sovereignty ofnature.

2269
01:49:39.930 --> 01:49:42.070
First he was a noble servant tothem,

2270
01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:46.070
but he could not carry hishonors even.

2271
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:48.530
Whether 'twas pride,

2272
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:52.830
which, out of daily fortune,ever taints the happy man;

2273
01:49:52.830 --> 01:49:56.030
whether defect of judgment,

2274
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:58.230
to fail in the disposing ofthose chances

2275
01:49:58.230 --> 01:49:59.870
which he was lord of;

2276
01:49:59.870 --> 01:50:03.630
or whether nature,

2277
01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:05.630
not to be other than one thing,

2278
01:50:05.630 --> 01:50:07.970
not moving from the casque tothe cushion

2279
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:11.500
but commanding peace even withthe same austerity and garb

2280
01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.000
as he controlled the war;

2281
01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.970
but one of these, as he hathspices of them all

2282
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:21.000
not all, for I dare so far freehimó

2283
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:27.530
made him feared, so hated, andso banished.

2284
01:50:27.530 --> 01:50:31.770
But he has a merit to choke itin the utterance.

2285
01:50:31.770 --> 01:50:37.800
So our virtues lie in theinterpretation of the time.

2286
01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:42.700
And power, unto itself mostcommendable,

2287
01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:45.000
hath not a tomb so evident

2288
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.700
as a chair to extol what it hathdone.

2289
01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:57.170
One fire drives out one fire;one nail, one nail;

2290
01:50:57.170 --> 01:51:01.130
rights by rights falter,

2291
01:51:01.130 --> 01:51:05.300
strengths by strengths do fail.

2292
01:51:20.100 --> 01:51:22.300
I tell you, he does sit in gold,

2293
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:25.500
his eye red as 'twould burn Rome

2294
01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:28.470
and his injury the jailer to hispity.

2295
01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:32.030
I kneeled before him.

2296
01:51:32.030 --> 01:51:35.330
'Twas very faintly he said,"Rise,"

2297
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:40.230
dismissed me thus, with hisspeechless hand.

2298
01:51:40.230 --> 01:51:43.130
You hear what he hath said whichwas sometime his general

2299
01:51:43.130 --> 01:51:46.230
who loved him in a most dearparticular.

2300
01:51:46.230 --> 01:51:48.130
He called me father.

2301
01:51:48.130 --> 01:51:50.100
But what of that?

2302
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:51.630
Go, you that banished him,

2303
01:51:51.630 --> 01:51:53.370
a mile before his tent fall down

2304
01:51:53.370 --> 01:51:55.500
and knee the way into his mercy.

2305
01:51:55.500 --> 01:51:57.570
Nay, if he coyed to hearCominius speak,

2306
01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:58.570
I'll keep at home.

2307
01:51:58.570 --> 01:51:59.630
He would not seem to know me.

2308
01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:00.700
Do you hear?

2309
01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:03.570
Yet one time he did call me bymy name.

2310
01:52:03.570 --> 01:52:05.670
I urged our old acquaintance

2311
01:52:05.670 --> 01:52:08.000
and the drops that we have bledtogether.

2312
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.230
Coriolanus he would not answerto,

2313
01:52:10.230 --> 01:52:11.570
forbad all names.

2314
01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:15.830
He was a kind of nothing,

2315
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:17.400
titleless,

2316
01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:18.930
till he had forged himself

2317
01:52:18.930 --> 01:52:21.270
a name in the fire of burningRome.

2318
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:22.800
Why, so.

2319
01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:25.030
You have made good work.

2320
01:52:25.030 --> 01:52:27.370
A pair of tribunes that haveracked for Rome

2321
01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:30.030
to make coals cheap, a noblememory.

2322
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:31.900
I minded him how royal 'twas topardon

2323
01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:33.730
when it was less expected.

2324
01:52:33.730 --> 01:52:36.400
He replied, it was a barepetition of a state

2325
01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.200
to one whom they had punished.

2326
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.100
Very well; could he say less?

2327
01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:43.130
I offered to awaken his regardfor his private friends.

2328
01:52:43.130 --> 01:52:45.030
His answer to me was,

2329
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:47.400
he could not stay to pick them

2330
01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:51.570
in a pile of noisome, mustychaff.

2331
01:52:51.570 --> 01:52:53.770
He said 'twas folly for one poorgrain or two

2332
01:52:53.770 --> 01:52:55.500
to leave unburnt

2333
01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.470
and still to nose the offense.

2334
01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:00.530
For one poor grain or two.

2335
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:02.070
I am one of those;

2336
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:03.230
his mother, wife, his child,

2337
01:53:03.230 --> 01:53:05.170
and this brave fellow too, weare the grains.

2338
01:53:05.170 --> 01:53:06.770
You are the musty chaff,

2339
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:09.130
and you are smelt above themoon.

2340
01:53:09.130 --> 01:53:10.900
We must be burnt for you.

2341
01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:13.900
Nay, pray, be patient.

2342
01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:17.230
If you refuse your aid in thisso never-needed help,

2343
01:53:17.230 --> 01:53:21.770
yet do not upbraid us for ourdistress.

2344
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:25.300
But, sure, if you would be yourcountry's pleader,

2345
01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:26.830
your good tongue,

2346
01:53:26.830 --> 01:53:28.900
more than the instant army wecan make,

2347
01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:30.370
might stop our countryman.

2348
01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:32.500
No, I'll not meddle.

2349
01:53:32.500 --> 01:53:34.470
Pray you, go to him.

2350
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:36.370
What should I do?

2351
01:53:36.370 --> 01:53:39.000
Only make trial what your lovecan do for Rome

2352
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.500
towards Marcius.

2353
01:53:40.500 --> 01:53:42.370
Well, and say that Marciusreturn me,

2354
01:53:42.370 --> 01:53:46.100
as Cominius is returned,unheard; what then?

2355
01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:50.600
But as a discontented friendgrief-shot with his unkindness?

2356
01:53:50.600 --> 01:53:51.700
Say it be so?

2357
01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:55.800
Yet your good will must havethat thanks from Rome,

2358
01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:58.470
after the measure as youintended well.

2359
01:53:58.470 --> 01:54:00.430
I'll undertake it.

2360
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:01.800
I think he'll hear me.

2361
01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:04.270
And the glorious gods love theeno worse

2362
01:54:04.270 --> 01:54:06.370
than thy old father Meneniusdoes.

2363
01:54:09.070 --> 01:54:13.770
O, my son; my son.

2364
01:54:15.670 --> 01:54:17.800
Thou art preparing fire for us.

2365
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:24.570
Look thee, here is water toquench it.

2366
01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.770
I was hardly moved to come tothee,

2367
01:54:29.770 --> 01:54:32.630
but being assured that none butmyself could move thee,

2368
01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:36.700
I have been blown out of thygates with sighs

2369
01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:41.200
and conjure thee to pardon Rome

2370
01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:43.470
and thy petitionary countrymen.

2371
01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.170
Away.

2372
01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:52.330
How, away?

2373
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:58.030
Wife, mother, child,

2374
01:54:58.030 --> 01:55:00.830
I know not.

2375
01:55:00.830 --> 01:55:03.830
My affairs are servanted toothers.

2376
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:06.770
Though I owe my revengeproperly,

2377
01:55:06.770 --> 01:55:09.970
my remission lies in Volscianbreasts.

2378
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:14.270
That we have been familiar,

2379
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:16.600
ingrate forgetfulness shallpoison

2380
01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:20.200
rather than pity note how much.

2381
01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.300
Therefore, be gone.

2382
01:55:22.300 --> 01:55:27.030
My ears against your suits arestronger

2383
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:30.100
than your gates against myforce.

2384
01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:35.600
Yet, for I loved thee, take thisalong.

2385
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:39.170
I writ it for thy sake and wouldhave sent it.

2386
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:42.570
Another word, Menenius, I willnot hear thee speak.

2387
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:56.630
This man, Aufidius,

2388
01:55:56.630 --> 01:55:59.170
was my beloved in Rome.

2389
01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:04.830
Yet thou behold'st.

2390
01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:09.970
You keep a constant temper.

2391
01:56:09.970 --> 01:56:12.530
See you yond coign of thecapitol,

2392
01:56:12.530 --> 01:56:14.170
yond cornerstone?

2393
01:56:15.170 --> 01:56:16.970
Why, what of that?

2394
01:56:16.970 --> 01:56:17.970
If it be possible

2395
01:56:17.970 --> 01:56:20.530
for you to displace it with yourlittle finger,

2396
01:56:20.530 --> 01:56:22.530
there is some hope that theladies of Rome,

2397
01:56:22.530 --> 01:56:26.730
especially his mother, mayprevail with him.

2398
01:56:26.730 --> 01:56:28.870
But I say there is no hope init.

2399
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:31.930
Our throats are sentenced andstay upon execution.

2400
01:56:31.930 --> 01:56:34.130
Is it possible that so short atime

2401
01:56:34.130 --> 01:56:36.170
can alter the condition of aman?

2402
01:56:36.170 --> 01:56:38.230
There is differency between agrub and a butterfly,

2403
01:56:38.230 --> 01:56:40.100
yet your butterfly was a grub.

2404
01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:43.500
This Marcius is grown from manto dragon.

2405
01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:44.900
He has wings.

2406
01:56:44.900 --> 01:56:47.070
He is more than a creepingthing.

2407
01:56:47.070 --> 01:56:49.200
He loved his mother dearly.

2408
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:53.830
So did he me.

2409
01:56:53.830 --> 01:56:56.030
And he no more remembers hismother now

2410
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:58.630
than an eight-year-old horse.

2411
01:56:58.630 --> 01:57:03.530
The tartness of his face soursripe grapes.

2412
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:06.030
He sits in his state like athing made for Alexander.

2413
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:08.930
What he bids be done is finishedwith his bidding.

2414
01:57:08.930 --> 01:57:11.970
He wants nothing of a god buteternity

2415
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:13.630
and a heaven to throne in.

2416
01:57:13.630 --> 01:57:16.770
Yes, mercy, if you report himtruly.

2417
01:57:16.770 --> 01:57:19.730
I paint him in the character.

2418
01:57:19.730 --> 01:57:23.700
Mark what mercy his mother shallbring from him.

2419
01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:25.330
There's no more mercy in him

2420
01:57:25.330 --> 01:57:27.870
than there is milk in a maletiger,

2421
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:30.430
that shall our poor city find,

2422
01:57:30.430 --> 01:57:32.170
and all this is long of you.

2423
01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.370
The gods be good unto us.

2424
01:57:35.370 --> 01:57:39.300
No, in such a case, the godswill not be good unto us.

2425
01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:43.070
When we banished him, werespected not them,

2426
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:47.800
and, he returning to break ournecks,

2427
01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:49.500
they respect not us.

2428
01:57:51.670 --> 01:57:53.200
This last old man,

2429
01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:56.600
whom with a cracked heart I havesent to Rome,

2430
01:57:56.600 --> 01:58:00.730
loved me above the measure of afather,

2431
01:58:00.730 --> 01:58:04.330
nay, godded me, indeed.

2432
01:58:05.230 --> 01:58:08.870
Their latest refuge was to sendhim,

2433
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:12.430
for whose old love I have,though I showed sourly to him,

2434
01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:15.670
once more offered the firstconditions,

2435
01:58:15.670 --> 01:58:20.600
which they did refuse and cannotnow accept

2436
01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:24.770
to grace him only that thoughthe could do more,

2437
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:27.770
a very little I have yielded to.

2438
01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:31.670
Fresh embassies and suits,

2439
01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:33.670
nor from the state nor privatefriends

2440
01:58:33.670 --> 01:58:36.530
hereafter will I lend ear to.

2441
01:58:46.170 --> 01:58:49.770
My wife comes foremost,

2442
01:58:49.770 --> 01:58:55.370
then the honored mold whereinthis trunk was framed

2443
01:58:55.370 --> 01:58:59.600
and in her hand the grandchildto her blood.

2444
01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:04.930
But out, affection.

2445
01:59:04.930 --> 01:59:09.130
All bond and privilege of naturebreak.

2446
01:59:09.130 --> 01:59:13.470
Let it be virtuous to beobstinate.

2447
01:59:16.270 --> 01:59:20.070
What is that curt'sy worth,

2448
01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:24.600
or those doves' eyes which canmake gods forsworn?

2449
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:32.030
I melt and am not of strongerearth than others.

2450
01:59:32.930 --> 01:59:38.570
My mother bows as if Olympus toa molehill

2451
01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:41.230
should in supplication nod,

2452
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:45.600
and my young boy hath an aspectof intercession

2453
01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:50.670
which great nature cries, "Denynot."

2454
01:59:53.130 --> 01:59:57.670
Let the Volsces plow Rome andharrow Italy.

2455
01:59:57.670 --> 02:00:01.530
I'll never be such a gosling toobey instinct

2456
02:00:01.530 --> 02:00:05.770
but stand as if a man wereauthor of himself

2457
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:08.370
and knew no other kin.

2458
02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:14.630
My lord and husband.

2459
02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:19.270
These eyes are not the same Iwore in Rome.

2460
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:23.630
The sorrow that delivers us thuschanged makes you think so.

2461
02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:28.570
Like a dull actor now, I haveforgot my part,

2462
02:00:28.570 --> 02:00:32.530
and I am out, even to a fulldisgrace.

2463
02:00:35.070 --> 02:00:40.100
Best of my flesh, forgive mytyranny,

2464
02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:43.530
but do not say for that,"Forgive our Romans."

2465
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:55.530
O, a kiss long as my exile,

2466
02:00:55.530 --> 02:00:59.300
sweet as my revenge.

2467
02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:01.100
Now, by the jealous queen ofHeaven,

2468
02:01:01.100 --> 02:01:02.700
that kiss I carried from thee,dear,

2469
02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:08.030
and my true lip hath virgined itever since.

2470
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:09.570
Ye gods, I prate,

2471
02:01:09.570 --> 02:01:13.170
and the most noble mother in theworld leave unsaluted.

2472
02:01:13.170 --> 02:01:15.800
Sink my knee in the earth.

2473
02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:17.030
Of thy deep duty,

2474
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:20.130
more impression show than thatof common sons.

2475
02:01:20.130 --> 02:01:22.070
O, stand up blest.

2476
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:24.600
Whilst, with no softer cushionthan the flint,

2477
02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.030
I kneel before thee andunproperly show duty,

2478
02:01:28.030 --> 02:01:32.970
as mistaken all this whilebetween the child and parent.

2479
02:01:32.970 --> 02:01:34.170
What's this?

2480
02:01:34.170 --> 02:01:35.470
Your knees to me?

2481
02:01:35.470 --> 02:01:37.930
To your corrected son?

2482
02:01:37.930 --> 02:01:39.830
Then let the pebbles on thehungry beach

2483
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:41.570
fillip the stars,

2484
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:43.000
then let the mutinous winds

2485
02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.670
strike the proud cedars 'gainstthe fiery sun,

2486
02:01:45.670 --> 02:01:47.500
murdering impossibility

2487
02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:52.000
to make what cannot be slightwork.

2488
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.330
Thou art my warrior.

2489
02:01:55.330 --> 02:01:57.800
I holp to frame thee.

2490
02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:06.770
Do you know this lady?

2491
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:08.970
The noble sister of Publicola,

2492
02:02:08.970 --> 02:02:11.030
the moon of Rome,

2493
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:13.730
chaste as the icicle that'scurdied by the frost

2494
02:02:13.730 --> 02:02:18.270
from purest snow and hangs onDian's temple.

2495
02:02:18.270 --> 02:02:20.000
Dear Valeria.

2496
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:25.500
This is a poor epitome of yours,

2497
02:02:25.500 --> 02:02:28.200
which by the interpretation offull time

2498
02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:31.100
may show like all yourself.

2499
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:32.470
The god of soldiers,

2500
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:34.970
with the consent of supremeJove,

2501
02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:40.330
inform thy thoughts withnobleness.

2502
02:02:40.330 --> 02:02:42.000
Your knee, sirrah.

2503
02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:50.070
That's my brave boy.

2504
02:02:51.130 --> 02:02:55.900
Even he, your wife, this lady,and myself are suitors to you.

2505
02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:57.400
I beseech you, peace.

2506
02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:00.330
Or, if you'd ask, remember thisbefore:

2507
02:03:00.330 --> 02:03:02.300
The thing I have forsworn togrant

2508
02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:06.100
may never be held by youdenials.

2509
02:03:06.100 --> 02:03:07.870
Bid me not dismiss my soldiers

2510
02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:10.170
or capitulate again with Rome'smechanics.

2511
02:03:10.170 --> 02:03:12.430
Tell me not wherein I seemunnatural.

2512
02:03:12.430 --> 02:03:15.300
Desire not to ally my rages andrevenges

2513
02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:17.100
with your colder reasons.

2514
02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:18.730
O, no more; no more.

2515
02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.870
You have said you will not grantus any thing

2516
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:23.100
for we have nothing else to ask

2517
02:03:23.100 --> 02:03:24.700
but that which you deny already,

2518
02:03:24.700 --> 02:03:27.300
yet we will ask

2519
02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:31.730
that if you fail in our request,

2520
02:03:31.730 --> 02:03:34.900
the blame may hang upon yourhardness.

2521
02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:36.570
Therefore, hear us.

2522
02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:43.600
Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark,

2523
02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:46.300
for we'll hear nought from Romein private.

2524
02:03:50.170 --> 02:03:51.930
Your request?

2525
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:58.600
Should we be silent and notspeak,

2526
02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:00.100
our raiment and state of bodies

2527
02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:03.170
would bewray what life we haveled since thy exile.

2528
02:04:03.930 --> 02:04:06.130
Think with thyself how moreunfortunate

2529
02:04:06.130 --> 02:04:08.900
than all living women are wecome hither.

2530
02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:10.630
Since that thy sight,

2531
02:04:10.630 --> 02:04:12.630
which should make our eyes flowwith joy,

2532
02:04:12.630 --> 02:04:14.270
hearts dance with comforts,

2533
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:17.730
constrains them weep and shakewith fear and sorrow,

2534
02:04:17.730 --> 02:04:20.800
making the mother, wife, andchild

2535
02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:27.930
to see the son, the father, thehusband

2536
02:04:27.930 --> 02:04:30.730
tearing his country's bowelsout.

2537
02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:37.270
And to poor we thine enmity'smost capital.

2538
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:40.500
Thou barr'st us our prayers tothe gods,

2539
02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:44.400
which is a comfort that all butwe enjoy,

2540
02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:49.430
for how can we

2541
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:55.270
alas,

2542
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:57.900
how can we for our country pray

2543
02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:58.900
whereto we are bound,

2544
02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.600
together with thy victory,

2545
02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:04.570
whereto we are bound?

2546
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:09.470
Alack, or we must lose thecountry, our dear nurse,

2547
02:05:09.470 --> 02:05:12.630
or else thy person,

2548
02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:15.400
our comfort in the country.

2549
02:05:16.770 --> 02:05:18.570
We must find an evidentcalamity,

2550
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:21.200
though we had our wish whichside should win.

2551
02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.700
For either thou must, as aforeign recreant,

2552
02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:25.900
be led with manacles thoroughour streets,

2553
02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:29.170
or else triumphantly tread onthy country's ruin

2554
02:05:29.170 --> 02:05:32.300
and bear the palm for havingbravely shed

2555
02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:35.930
thy wife and children's blood.

2556
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:41.330
For myself, son,

2557
02:05:41.330 --> 02:05:45.900
I purpose not to wait on fortunetill these wars determine.

2558
02:05:49.230 --> 02:05:51.970
If I cannot persuade thee ratherto show a noble grace

2559
02:05:51.970 --> 02:05:56.700
to both sides than seek the endof one,

2560
02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:59.500
thou shalt no sooner march toassault thy country

2561
02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:02.170
than to tread trust to it, thoushalt not

2562
02:06:02.170 --> 02:06:06.070
on thy mother's womb thatbrought thee to this world.

2563
02:06:06.070 --> 02:06:10.530
Ay, and mine that brought youforth this boy

2564
02:06:10.530 --> 02:06:13.370
to keep your name living totime.

2565
02:06:14.670 --> 02:06:16.970
A' shall not tread on me.

2566
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:19.030
I'll run away till I am bigger,

2567
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:21.770
but then I'll fight.

2568
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:23.630
Not of a woman's tenderness tobe

2569
02:06:23.630 --> 02:06:27.030
requires nor child nor woman'sface to see.

2570
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:28.430
I have sat too long.

2571
02:06:28.430 --> 02:06:31.330
Nay, go not from us thus.

2572
02:06:31.330 --> 02:06:34.870
If it were so that our requestdid tend to save the Romans

2573
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:37.570
thereby to destroy the Volsceswhom you serve,

2574
02:06:37.570 --> 02:06:40.100
you might condemn us aspoisonous of your honor.

2575
02:06:40.100 --> 02:06:41.870
No.

2576
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:44.670
Our suit is that you reconcilethem.

2577
02:06:46.270 --> 02:06:49.970
while the Volsces may say, "Thismercy we've showed,"

2578
02:06:49.970 --> 02:06:53.830
the Romans, "This we received,"

2579
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:57.800
and each in either side give theall hail to thee

2580
02:06:57.800 --> 02:07:03.030
and cry, "Be blest for making upthis peace."

2581
02:07:08.370 --> 02:07:14.270
Thou know'st, great son, the endof war's uncertain,

2582
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:17.400
but this certain,

2583
02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:20.670
that if thou conquer Rome,

2584
02:07:20.670 --> 02:07:22.870
the benefit which thou shaltthereby reap

2585
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:24.500
is such a name whose repetition

2586
02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:26.570
shall be dogged with curses,

2587
02:07:26.570 --> 02:07:28.230
whose chronicle thus writ:

2588
02:07:28.230 --> 02:07:29.630
"The man was noble,

2589
02:07:29.630 --> 02:07:31.730
"but with his last attempt, hewiped it out,

2590
02:07:31.730 --> 02:07:34.630
"destroyed his country,

2591
02:07:34.630 --> 02:07:39.500
and his name remains to theensuing age abhorred."

2592
02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:07.030
Speak to me, son.

2593
02:08:09.500 --> 02:08:13.470
Thou hast affected the finestrains of honor,

2594
02:08:13.470 --> 02:08:16.830
to imitate the graces of thegods,

2595
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:20.200
to tear with thunder the widecheeks of the air,

2596
02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:22.900
and yet to charge thy sulphurwith a bolt

2597
02:08:22.900 --> 02:08:25.900
that should but rive an oak.

2598
02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:29.500
Why dost not speak?

2599
02:08:30.930 --> 02:08:33.970
Think'st thou it honorable for anoble man

2600
02:08:33.970 --> 02:08:36.730
still to remember wrongs?

2601
02:08:38.270 --> 02:08:40.830
Daughter, speak you.

2602
02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:43.830
He cares not for your weeping.

2603
02:08:45.570 --> 02:08:47.870
Thou hast never in thy life

2604
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:50.800
showed thy dear mother anycourtesy

2605
02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:53.900
when she, poor hen fond of nosecond brood,

2606
02:08:53.900 --> 02:08:56.830
has clucked thee to the wars andsafely home,

2607
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:58.700
loaden with honor.

2608
02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:04.200
Say my request's unjust andspurn me back,

2609
02:09:04.200 --> 02:09:05.530
but if it be not so,

2610
02:09:05.530 --> 02:09:06.870
thou art not honest

2611
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:10.830
and the gods will plague theethat thou restrain'st from me

2612
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:13.030
the duty which to a mother'spart belongs.

2613
02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:15.000
He turns away.

2614
02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:18.400
Down, ladies.

2615
02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:22.370
Let us shame him with our knees.

2616
02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:35.000
To his surname, Coriolanus,

2617
02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.800
'longs more pride than pity toour prayers.

2618
02:09:48.170 --> 02:09:49.330
Down.

2619
02:10:00.970 --> 02:10:02.330
An end.

2620
02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.770
This is the last.

2621
02:10:14.100 --> 02:10:17.930
So we will home to Rome and dieamong our neighbors.

2622
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:27.200
Nay, behold us.

2623
02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.800
This boy that cannot tell whathe would have

2624
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:35.870
but kneels and holds up handsfor fellowship

2625
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:37.700
does reason our petition withmore strength

2626
02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:39.330
than thou hast to deny it.

2627
02:10:46.230 --> 02:10:47.800
Come, let us go.

2628
02:10:53.230 --> 02:10:55.500
This fellow had a Volscian tohis mother.

2629
02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:57.170
His wife is in Corioli

2630
02:10:57.170 --> 02:11:00.530
and his child like him bychance.

2631
02:11:09.330 --> 02:11:10.570
Nay.

2632
02:11:13.630 --> 02:11:15.300
Give us our dispatch.

2633
02:11:27.570 --> 02:11:34.130
I am hushed until our city beafire,

2634
02:11:34.130 --> 02:11:36.500
and then I'll speak a little.

2635
02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:14.130
O, mother.

2636
02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:17.930
Mother.

2637
02:12:21.170 --> 02:12:23.530
What have you done?

2638
02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:29.670
Behold, the heavens do ope,

2639
02:12:29.670 --> 02:12:32.630
the gods look down,

2640
02:12:32.630 --> 02:12:39.300
and this unnatural scene

2641
02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:41.530
they laugh at.

2642
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:46.800
O, my mother.

2643
02:12:48.070 --> 02:12:49.600
Mother.

2644
02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.400
O.

2645
02:12:54.330 --> 02:12:57.600
You have won a happy victory toRome,

2646
02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:59.800
but, for your son

2647
02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:03.900
Believe it; O, believe it,

2648
02:13:03.900 --> 02:13:07.370
most dangerously you have withhim prevailed,

2649
02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:12.830
if not most mortal to him.

2650
02:13:15.570 --> 02:13:21.870
But, let it come.

2651
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:37.470
Aufidius,

2652
02:13:37.470 --> 02:13:40.730
though I cannot make true wars,

2653
02:13:40.730 --> 02:13:43.430
I'll frame convenient peace.

2654
02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:50.030
And, good Aufidius, were you inmy stead,

2655
02:13:50.030 --> 02:13:52.430
would you have heard a motherless

2656
02:13:52.430 --> 02:13:57.570
or granted less, Aufidius?

2657
02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:04.370
I was moved withal.

2658
02:14:04.370 --> 02:14:06.400
I dare be sworn you were.

2659
02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:08.470
And, sir, it is no little thing

2660
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:14.970
to make mine eyes to sweatcompassion.

2661
02:14:19.530 --> 02:14:21.800
What, good sir, what peaceyou'll make,

2662
02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:23.700
advise me.

2663
02:14:23.700 --> 02:14:25.070
For my part, I'll not to Rome,

2664
02:14:25.070 --> 02:14:30.270
I'll back with you and pray you,

2665
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:32.670
stand to me in this cause.

2666
02:14:34.330 --> 02:14:37.900
O, mother.

2667
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:45.000
Wife.

2668
02:14:46.470 --> 02:14:49.000
I am glad thou hast set thymercy and thy honor

2669
02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.500
at difference in thee.

2670
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:56.900
Out of that, I'll work myself aformer fortune.

2671
02:14:56.900 --> 02:15:01.970
Behold our patroness, the lifeof Rome.

2672
02:15:03.070 --> 02:15:06.470
Call all your tribes together,praise the gods,

2673
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:08.870
and make triumphant fires.

2674
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:11.930
Strew flowers before them.

2675
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:15.600
Unshout the noise that banishedMarcius,

2676
02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:19.070
repeal him with the welcome ofhis mother,

2677
02:15:19.070 --> 02:15:23.100
cry, "Welcome, ladies; welcome."

2678
02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:26.300
Welcome, ladies;

2679
02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:27.800
welcome.

2680
02:15:33.470 --> 02:15:35.400
Go tell the lords of the city Iam here.

2681
02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:36.730
Deliver them this paper.

2682
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:40.470
Most noble sir,

2683
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:44.900
if you do hold the same intentwherein you wished us parties,

2684
02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:47.300
we'll deliver you of your greatdanger.

2685
02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:49.400
Sir, I cannot tell.

2686
02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:52.000
We must proceed as we do findthe people.

2687
02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.130
The people will remain uncertain

2688
02:15:54.130 --> 02:15:57.130
whilst 'twixt you there'sdifference,

2689
02:15:57.130 --> 02:16:02.730
but the fall of either makes thesurvivor heir of all.

2690
02:16:02.730 --> 02:16:04.900
I know it,

2691
02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:08.930
and my pretext to strike at himadmits a good construction.

2692
02:16:08.930 --> 02:16:11.300
He came unto my hearth,

2693
02:16:11.300 --> 02:16:13.830
presented to my knife histhroat.

2694
02:16:13.830 --> 02:16:15.170
I took him;

2695
02:16:15.170 --> 02:16:17.030
made him joint servant with me;

2696
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:19.230
gave him way in all his owndesires;

2697
02:16:19.230 --> 02:16:21.030
nay, let him choose out of myranks

2698
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:22.600
his projects to accomplish,

2699
02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:25.770
my best and freshest men;

2700
02:16:25.770 --> 02:16:29.900
served his designments in mineown person;

2701
02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:36.130
holp to reap the fame which hedid end all his;

2702
02:16:36.130 --> 02:16:39.970
and took some pride to do myselfthis wrong.

2703
02:16:39.970 --> 02:16:41.100
Till, at the last,

2704
02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:45.870
I seemed his follower notpartner,

2705
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:48.170
and he waged me with hiscountenance

2706
02:16:48.170 --> 02:16:50.100
as if I had been mercenary.

2707
02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:51.570
So he did, my lord.

2708
02:16:51.570 --> 02:16:53.970
The army marveled at it, and, inthe last,

2709
02:16:53.970 --> 02:16:55.400
when he had carried Rome

2710
02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:57.730
and that we looked for no lessspoil than gloryó

2711
02:16:57.730 --> 02:16:59.970
There was it.

2712
02:16:59.970 --> 02:17:03.670
For the which my sinews shall bestretched upon him.

2713
02:17:03.670 --> 02:17:06.870
At a few drops of women's rheum,

2714
02:17:06.870 --> 02:17:09.200
which are as cheap as lies,

2715
02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:13.130
he sold the blood and labor ofour great action.

2716
02:17:13.130 --> 02:17:23.500
Therefore shall he die and I'llrenew me in his fall.

2717
02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:30.930
Hail, lords.

2718
02:17:32.770 --> 02:17:38.900
I am returned your soldier,

2719
02:17:38.900 --> 02:17:41.070
no more infected with mycountry's love

2720
02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:42.170
than when I parted hence

2721
02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:46.030
but still subsisting under yourgreat command.

2722
02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:47.830
You are to know

2723
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:49.670
that prosperously I haveattempted

2724
02:17:49.670 --> 02:17:50.970
and with bloody passage

2725
02:17:50.970 --> 02:17:54.470
led your wars even to the gatesof Rome.

2726
02:17:54.470 --> 02:17:58.070
Our spoils we have brought homedoth more than counterpoise

2727
02:17:58.070 --> 02:18:01.730
a full third part the charges ofthe action.

2728
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:06.330
We have made peace

2729
02:18:06.330 --> 02:18:08.700
with no less honor to theAntiates

2730
02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:10.300
than shame to the Romans

2731
02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:11.470
and here deliver,

2732
02:18:11.470 --> 02:18:14.700
subscribed by the consuls andpatricians,

2733
02:18:14.700 --> 02:18:17.170
together with the seal of thesenate,

2734
02:18:17.170 --> 02:18:19.770
what we have compounded on.

2735
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:28.970
Read it not, noble lords,

2736
02:18:28.970 --> 02:18:31.900
but tell the traitor in thehighest degree

2737
02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:34.370
he hath abused your powers.

2738
02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:36.870
Traitor?

2739
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:37.870
How now?

2740
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:39.770
Ay, traitor, Marcius.

2741
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:40.770
Marcius.

2742
02:18:40.770 --> 02:18:42.100
Ay, Marcius,

2743
02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:43.470
Caius Marcius.

2744
02:18:45.270 --> 02:18:47.370
Dost thou think I'll grace theewith that robbery,

2745
02:18:47.370 --> 02:18:53.030
thy stolen name Coriolanus inCorioli?

2746
02:18:53.730 --> 02:18:56.000
You lords and heads of thestate,

2747
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:59.970
perfidiously he has betrayedyour business and given up,

2748
02:18:59.970 --> 02:19:04.100
for certain drops of salt, yourcity Rome.

2749
02:19:04.100 --> 02:19:12.270
I say "your city," to his wifeand mother,

2750
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:16.030
breaking his oath and resolutionlike a twist of rotten silk,

2751
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:18.370
never admitting counsels of thewar,

2752
02:19:18.370 --> 02:19:21.030
but at his nurse's tears,

2753
02:19:21.030 --> 02:19:25.470
he whined and roared away yourvictory

2754
02:19:25.470 --> 02:19:27.730
that pages blushed at him

2755
02:19:27.730 --> 02:19:31.300
and men of heart lookedwondering each at other.

2756
02:19:31.300 --> 02:19:33.470
Hear'st thou, Mars?

2757
02:19:33.470 --> 02:19:37.330
Name not the god, thou boy oftears.

2758
02:19:38.970 --> 02:19:39.970
No more.

2759
02:19:39.970 --> 02:19:42.670
Measureless liar,

2760
02:19:42.670 --> 02:19:46.470
thou hast made my heart toogreat for what contains it.

2761
02:19:46.470 --> 02:19:48.400
Boy.

2762
02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:51.400
O, slave.

2763
02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:52.630
Pardon me, lords.

2764
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:56.070
'Tis the first time that ever Iwas forced to scold.

2765
02:19:56.070 --> 02:20:01.100
Your judgments, my grave lords,Must give this cur the lie

2766
02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:02.700
and his own notion,

2767
02:20:02.700 --> 02:20:06.200
who wears my stripes impressedupon him,

2768
02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:08.970
that must bear my beating to hisgrave,

2769
02:20:08.970 --> 02:20:12.130
shall join to thrust the lieunto him.

2770
02:20:12.130 --> 02:20:15.870
Cut me to pieces, Volsces.

2771
02:20:15.870 --> 02:20:20.900
Men and lads, stain all youredges on me.

2772
02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:22.330
Boy.

2773
02:20:22.330 --> 02:20:23.830
False hound.

2774
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:25.530
If you have writ your annalstrue,

2775
02:20:25.530 --> 02:20:29.900
'tis there that, like an eaglein a dovecote,

2776
02:20:29.900 --> 02:20:32.930
I fluttered your Volscians inCorioli.

2777
02:20:32.930 --> 02:20:34.930
Alone I did it.

2778
02:20:34.930 --> 02:20:35.930
Boy.

2779
02:20:35.930 --> 02:20:36.930
Why, noble lords,

2780
02:20:36.930 --> 02:20:39.200
will you be put in mind of hisblind fortune,

2781
02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.230
which was your shame,

2782
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:42.730
by this unholy braggart?

2783
02:20:42.730 --> 02:20:44.100
Peace, ho.

2784
02:20:44.100 --> 02:20:45.500
No outrage.

2785
02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:47.000
Peace.

2786
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:48.070
The man is noble

2787
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:50.800
and his fame folds in this orbof the earth.

2788
02:20:50.800 --> 02:20:53.570
His last offenses to us shallhave judicious hearing.

2789
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:56.230
Stand, Aufidius, and trouble notthe peace.

2790
02:20:56.230 --> 02:21:00.870
O, that I had him, with sixAufidiuses

2791
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:06.900
or more, his tribe, to use mylawful sword.

2792
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:14.430
Insolent villain.

2793
02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:21.230
Kill.

2794
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:40.400
Kill.

2795
02:21:44.770 --> 02:21:45.770
Kill.

2796
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:48.030
Kill.

2797
02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:50.100
Kill.

2798
02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Kill.

2799
02:21:53.470 --> 02:21:54.470
Kill.

2800
02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:57.500
Kill.

2801
02:21:59.570 --> 02:22:00.630
Kill.

2802
02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:03.430
Kill.

2803
02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Kill!

2804
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:29.200
My lords,

2805
02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:30.200
when you shall know

2806
02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:34.200
as in this rage, provoked byhim, you cannot

2807
02:22:34.200 --> 02:22:38.470
the great danger this man's lifedid owe you,

2808
02:22:38.470 --> 02:22:43.230
you'll rejoice that he is thuscut off.

2809
02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:50.630
My rage is gone,

2810
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:52.670
and I am struck with sorrow.

2811
02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:56.400
Though in this city

2812
02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:59.900
he hath widowed and unchildedmany a one

2813
02:22:59.900 --> 02:23:06.300
which to this hour bewail theinjury,

2814
02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:09.770
yet he shall have a noblememory.

2815
02:25:16.900 --> 02:25:19.900
