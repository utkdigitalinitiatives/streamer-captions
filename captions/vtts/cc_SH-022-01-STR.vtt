00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:28.730
His valour, coin andpeople, in the wars?

87
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.470
Did he so often lodge inopen field,

88
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.330
In winter's cold andsummer's parching heat,

89
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:38.130

With all the learnedcouncil of the realm,

Studied so long,

96

sat in the council-house Earlyand late, debating to and fro

97
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.530
How France and Frenchmenmight be kept in awe,

98
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:09.330
And shall these laboursand these honours die?

99
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:14.670
O peers of England,shameful is this league!

100
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:20.600
Fatal this marriage,cancelling your fame,

101
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.270
Blotting your names frombooks of memory,

102
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.000
Razing the characters ofyour renown,

103
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.700
Defacing monuments ofconquer'd France,

104
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.470
Undoing all, as all hadnever been!

105
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.130
Nephew, what means thispassionate discourse,

106
00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:42.600
This peroration with suchcircumstance?

107
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.670
For France, 'tis ours; andwe will keep it still.

108
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:53.930
Ay, we will keepit, if we can;

109
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.000
But now it is impossiblewe should:

110
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.930
Suffolk, the new-made dukethat rules the roast,

111
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.000
Hath given the duchy ofAnjou and Maine

112
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.300
Unto the poor King Reignier,

113
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.030
whose large style Agrees notwith the leanness of his purse.

114
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.800
By the death of Himthat died for all,

115
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.170
These counties were thekeys of Normandy.

116
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.330
(Crying)

117
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.300
But wherefore weepsWarwick, my valiant son?

118
00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.800
For grief that they arepast recovery:

119
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.570
For, were there hope toconquer them again,

120
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:39.600
My sword should shed hotblood, mine eyes no tears.

121
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.770
Anjou and Maine! myselfdid win them both;

122
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.670
Those provinces these armsof mine did conquer:

123
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.470
And are the cities, that Igot with wounds,

124
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:57.470
Delivered up again withpeaceful words?

125
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.570
Mort Dieu!

126
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.300
For Suffolk's duke, may hebe suffocate,

127
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.500
That dims the honour ofthis warlike isle!

128
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.070
France should have tornand rent my very heart,

129
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.630
Before I would haveyielded to this league.

130
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.700
I never read butEngland's kings

131
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.770
have had Large sums of goldand dowries with their wives:

132
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.470
And our King Henrygives away his own,

133
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.970
To match with her thatbrings no vantages.

134
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.900
She should have stayed inFrance and starved

135
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.630
in France.

136
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:38.570
My Lord of Gloucester, nowye grow too hot:

137
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.370
It was the pleasure of mylord the King.

138
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.600
My Lord of Winchester, Iknow your mind;

139
00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.470
'Tis not my speeches thatyou do mislike,

140
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.170
But 'tis my presence thatdoth trouble ye.

141
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.000
Rancour will out:proud prelate,

142
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.670
in thy face I see thyfury: if I longer stay,

143
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.070
We shall begin our ancientbickerings.

144
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:02.870
Lordings, farewell; andsay, when I am gone,

145
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.630
I prophesied France willbe lost ere long.

146
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:16.600
So, there goes ourprotector in a rage.

147
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:21.170
'Tis known to you he ismine enemy,

148
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.400
Nay, more, an enemy untoyou all,

149
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.700
And no great friend, Ifear me, to the king.

150
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.600
Consider, lords, he is thenext of blood,

151
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.100
And heir apparent to theEnglish crown:

152
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.530
Had Henry got an empire byhis marriage,

153
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.530
With all the wealthykingdoms of the west,

154
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:43.230
There's reason he shouldbe displeased at it.

155
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.300
Look to it, lords!

156
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.770
let not his smoothing wordsbewitch your hearts;

157
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.770
be wise and circumspect.

158
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.530
What though the commonpeople favour him,

159
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.630
Calling him 'Humphrey, thegood Duke of Gloucester,'

160
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.100
Clapping their hands, andcrying with loud voice,

161
00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.170
'Jesu maintain your royalexcellence!'

162
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.170
With 'God preserve thegood Duke Humphrey!'

163
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:11.100
I fear me, lords, for allthis flattering gloss,

164
00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.330
He will be found adangerous protector.

165
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:18.330
Why should he, then,protect our sovereign,

166
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:23.900
He being of age to governof himself?

167
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.530
Cousin of Somerset, joinyou with me,

168
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.470
And all together, with theDuke of Suffolk,

169
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:36.330
We'll quickly hoise DukeHumphrey from his seat.

170
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.900
This weighty business willnot brook delay:

171
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.300
I'll to the Duke ofSuffolk presently.

172
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:49.670
Cousin of Buckingham,

173
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.670
though Humphrey's pride

174
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.170
and greatness of hisplace be grief to us,

175
00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:54.830
Yet let us watch thehaughty cardinal:

176
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.270
His insolence is moreintolerable

177
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.570
Than all the princes inthe land beside:

178
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.200
If Gloucester be displaced,he'll be protector.

179
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.400
Or thou or I, Somerset,will be protector,

180
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.600
Despite Duke Humphrey orthe cardinal.

181
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.830
Pride went before,ambition follows him.

182
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.370
While these do labour fortheir own preferment,

183
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.370
Behoves it us to labourfor the realm.

184
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.030
I never saw but HumphreyDuke of Gloucester

185
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.730
Did bear him like a noblegentleman.

186
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.300
Oft have I seen thehaughty cardinal,

187
00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.030
More like a soldier than aman o' the church,

188
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.570
As stout and proud as hewere lord of all,

189
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.400
Swear like a ruffian anddemean himself

190
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.670
Unlike the ruler of acommonweal.

191
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.430
Warwick, my son, thecomfort of my age,

192
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.970
Thy deeds, thy plainnessand thy housekeeping,

193
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:57.970
Hath won the greatestfavour of the commons,

194
00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.100
Excepting none but goodDuke Humphrey:

195
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.300
And, cousin York, thyacts in Ireland,

196
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.130
In bringing them to civildiscipline,

197
00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.630
Thy late exploits done inthe heart of France,

198
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.100
When thou wert regent forour sovereign,

199
00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:16.730
Have made thee fear'd andhonour'd of the people:

200
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:18.730
The reverence of mineage and Nevelle's name

201
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.330
is of no littleforce if I command.

202
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:25.270
Join we together, for thepublic good,

203
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.030
In what we can, to bridleand suppress

204
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.900
The pride of Suffolk andthe cardinal,

205
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.230
With Somerset's andBuckingham's ambition;

206
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.870
And, as we may, cherishDuke Humphrey's deeds,

207
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.370
While they do tend theprofit of the land.

208
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.670
So God help Warwick, as heloves the land,

209
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.830
And common profit of hiscountry!

210
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:50.900
And so says York, for hehath greatest cause.

211
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.200
Then let's make haste away,and look unto the main.

212
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.600
Unto the main! O father,Maine is lost;

213
00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.670
That Maine which by mainforce Warwick did win,

214
00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:03.500
And would have kept solong as breath did last!

215
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.470
Main chance, father, youmeant; but I meant Maine,

216
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:15.300
Which I will win fromFrance, or else be slain,

217
00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:23.870
Anjou and Maine are givento the French;

218
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.130
Paris is lost; the stateof Normandy

219
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:33.030
Stands on a tickle point,now they are gone:

220
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.230
Suffolk concluded on thearticles,

221
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:40.730
The peers agreed, and Henrywas well pleased to change

222
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:48.230
two dukedoms for aduke's fair daughter.

223
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:54.500
I cannot blame them all:what is't to them?

224
00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:00.200
'Tis thine they give away,and not their own.

225
00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.770
Pirates may make cheappennyworths of their pillage

226
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:08.470
And purchase friends andgive to courtezans,

227
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:13.430
Still revelling like lordstill all be gone;

228
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:19.700
While as the silly owner ofthe goods weeps over them

229
00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.100
and wrings his hapless hands

230
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.300
And shakes his head andtrembling stands aloof,

231
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.600
While all is shared andall is borne away,

232
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.630
Ready to starve and darenot touch his own:

233
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.900
So York must sit and fretand bite his tongue,

234
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:43.570
While his own lands arebargain'd for and sold.

235
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:48.730
Anjou and Maine both givenunto the French!

236
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:58.170
Cold news for me, for Ihad hope of France,

237
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.930
Even as I have of fertileEngland's soil.

238
00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:05.870
A day will come when Yorkshall claim his own;

239
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:10.500
And therefore I will takethe Nevils' parts

240
00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:14.530
And make a show of love toproud Duke Humphrey,

241
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.930
And, when I spy advantage,claim the crown,

242
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:22.630
For that's the golden markI seek to hit:

243
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:26.330
Nor shall proud Lancasterusurp my right,

244
00:17:26.330 --> 00:17:29.330
Nor hold the sceptre inhis childish fist,

245
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.200
Nor wear the diadem uponhis head,

246
00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:36.500
Whose church-like humoursfits not for a crown.

247
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:42.870
Then, York, be stillawhile, till time do serve:

248
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.800
Watch thou and wake whenothers be asleep,

249
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.800
To pry into the secrets ofthe state;

250
00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.000
Till Henry, surfeiting injoys of love,

251
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.130
With his new bride andEngland's dear-bought queen,

252
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.000
And Humphrey with thepeers be fall'n at jars:

253
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.970
Then will I raise aloftthe milk-white rose,

254
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.970
With whose sweet smell theair shall be perfumed;

255
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.300
And in my standard, bearthe arms of York

256
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.600
To grapple with the houseof Lancaster;

257
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.530
And, force perforce, I'llmake him yield the crown,

258
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:30.100
Whose bookish rule hathpull'd fair England down.

259
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:44.000
Why droops my lord, likeover-ripen'd corn,

260
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.770
Hanging the head at Ceres'plenteous load?

261
00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.730
Why are thine eyes fixedto the sullen earth,

262
00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:54.670
Gazing on that which seemsto dim thy sight?

263
00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.530
What seest thou there?King Henry's diadem,

264
00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:02.000
Enchased with all thehonours of the world?

265
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.530
If so, gaze on, and grovelon thy face,

266
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:08.370
Until thy head be circledwith the same.

267
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:13.870
Put forth thy hand, reachat the glorious gold.

268
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:18.170
What, is't too short? I'lllengthen it with mine:

269
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.230
And, having both togetherheaved it up,

270
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.470
We'll both together liftour heads to heaven,

271
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.730
And never more abase oursight so low

272
00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.530
As to vouchsafe one glanceunto the ground.

273
00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:33.200
O Nell, sweet Nell, ifthou dost love thy lord,

274
00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.030
Banish the canker ofambitious thoughts.

275
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.170
And may that hour, when Iimagine ill against my king

276
00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:41.200
and nephew, virtuous Henry,

277
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:48.900
Be my last breathing inthis mortal world!

278
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.970
My troublous dream thisnight doth make me sad.

279
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.900
What dream'd my lord? tellme, and I'll requite it

280
00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:00.770
with sweet rehearsal ofmy morning's dream.

281
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:06.770
Methought this staff, mineoffice-badge in court,

282
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.330
Was broke in twain; bywhom I have forgot,

283
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.830
But, as I think, it was bythe cardinal;

284
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.870
And on the pieces of thebroken wand

285
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:22.900
Were placed the heads ofEdmund Duke of Somerset,

286
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.430
And William de la Pole,first duke of Suffolk.

287
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:34.170
This was my dream: what itdoth bode, God knows.

288
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:36.670
Tut, this was nothing butan argument

289
00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.900
That he that breaks a stickof Gloucester's grove

290
00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.830
Shall lose his head forhis presumption.

291
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:48.070
But list to me, myHumphrey, my sweet duke:

292
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.670
Methought I sat in seat ofmajesty

293
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.730
In the cathedral church ofWestminster,

294
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:58.430
And in that chair where kingsand queens are crown'd;

295
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.800
Where Henry and dameMargaret kneel'd to me

296
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.900
And on my head did set thediadem.

297
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.130
Art thou not second womanin the realm,

298
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.130
And the protector's wife,beloved of him?

299
00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.230
Hast thou not worldlypleasure at command,

300
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.200
Above the reach or compassof thy thought?

301
00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.470
And wilt thou still behammering treachery,

302
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.000
To tumble down thy husbandand thyself

303
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.400
From top of honour todisgrace's feet?

304
00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.470
Away from me, and let mehear no more!

305
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.700
What, what, my lord! are youso choleric with Eleanor,

306
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.300
for telling but her dream?

307
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.800
Next time I'll keep mydreams unto myself,

308
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.630
And not be cheque'd.

309
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:48.830
Nay, be not angry; I ampleased again.

310
00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:50.900
My lord protector,

311
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.700
'tis his highness'pleasure you do prepare

312
00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.430
to ride unto Saint Alban's,

313
00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.370
Where as the king andqueen do mean to hawk.

314
00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:08.900
I go. Come, Nell, thouwilt ride with us?

315
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.570
Yes, my good lord, I'llfollow presently.

316
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.030
Follow I must; I cannot gobefore,

317
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.170
While Gloucester bearsthis base and humble mind.

318
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:33.130
Were I a man, a duke, andnext of blood,

319
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.900
I would remove thesetedious stumbling-blocks

320
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.530
And smooth my way upontheir headless necks;

321
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.170
And, being a woman, I willnot be slack

322
00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:47.830
To play my part inFortune's pageant.

323
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:53.870
Where are you there? SirJohn! nay, fear not, man,

324
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:57.000
We are alone; here's nonebut thee and I.

325
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.700
Jesus preserve your royalmajesty!

326
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.370
What say'st thou? majesty!I am but grace.

327
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:11.800
But, by the grace of God,and Hume's advice,

328
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.870
Your grace's titles shallbe multiplied.

329
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.030
What say'st thou, man?

330
00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.600
hast thou as yet conferr'dWith Margery Jourdain,

331
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.970
the witch of I,With Bolingbroke,

332
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.430
the cunning conjurer? And willthey undertake to do me good?

333
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.930
This they have promised me,to show your highness

334
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:38.600
A spirit raised from depthof under-ground,

335
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.170
That shall make answer tosuch questions

336
00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:43.200
As by your grace shall bepropounded him.

337
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:48.970
It is enough; I'll thinkupon the questions:

338
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.030
When from St. Alban's wedo make return,

339
00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.930
We'll see these thingseffected to the full.

340
00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:02.070
Here, Hume, take thisreward; make merry, man,

341
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:06.170
With thy confederates inthis weighty cause.

342
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.470
Hume must make merry withthe duchess' gold;

343
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.400
(Laughing)

344
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.130
Marry, and shall. But hownow, Sir John Hume!

345
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:21.670
Seal up your lips, andgive no words but mum:

346
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.900
The business asketh silentsecrecy.

347
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.200
Dame Eleanor gives gold tobring the witch:

348
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.630
Gold cannot come amiss,were she a devil.

349
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:36.970
Yet have I gold flies fromanother coast;

350
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.070
I dare not say, from therich cardinal

351
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.100
And from the great andnew-made Duke of Suffolk,

352
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:45.570
Yet I do find it so; forto be plain,

353
00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:50.200
They, knowing DameEleanor's aspiring humour,

354
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.470
Have hired me to underminethe duchess

355
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:57.470
And buz these conjurationsin her brain.

356
00:24:57.470 --> 00:25:01.530
They say 'A crafty knavedoes need no broker;'

357
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.430
Yet am I Suffolk and thecardinal's broker.

358
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:09.170
Hume, if you take not heed,

359
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.430
you shall go nearto call them both

360
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.230
a pair of crafty knaves.

361
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:20.300
Well, so it stands;and thus, I fear,

362
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:25.230
at last Hume's knavery willbe the duchess' wreck,

363
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:30.070
And her attainture will beHumphrey's fall:

364
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:36.430
Sort how it will, I willhave gold for all.

365
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.700
(Laughing)

366
00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.830
My masters, let's stand close:

367
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.930
my lord protector willcome this way by and by,

368
00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:02.800
and then we may deliver oursupplications in the quill.

369
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.230
Marry, the Lord protecthim, for he's a good man!

370
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:09.430
Jesu bless him!

371
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:14.700
Here a' comes, methinks,and the queen with him.

372
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:15.870
I'll be the first, sure.

373
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.370
Come back, fool; this isthe Duke of Suffolk,

374
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.430
and not my lord protector.

375
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.570
How now, fellow! would'stanything with me?

376
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:24.530
Pardon me my lord; I tookye for my lord protector.

377
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:30.230
'To my Lord Protector!' Are yoursupplications to his lordship?

378
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.000
Let me see them:

379
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.270
what is thine?

380
00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.270
Pardon me maam. Mine is,an't please your grace,

381
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:37.870
against John Goodman, mylord cardinal's man,

382
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.300
for keeping my house, and lands,and wife and all, from me.

383
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:44.530
Thy wife, too! that'ssome wrong, indeed.

384
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:53.530
What's yours? What's here!

385
00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.700
'Against the Duke ofSuffolk, for enclosing the

386
00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:01.230
commons of Long Melford.' Hownow, sir knave!

387
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.300
Alas, sir,

388
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.470
I am but a poor petitionerof our whole township.

389
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.530
Against my master,Thomas Horner,

390
00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.670
for saying that the Dukeof York was rightful

391
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.100
heir to the crown.

392
00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.000
What sayst thou? did the Dukeof York say he was rightful

393
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.870
heir to the crown?

394
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.370
That my master was? no,forsooth: my master said

395
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:28.500
that he was, and that theking was an userer.

396
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:34.130
A usurper, thou would'st say.

397
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.300
Ay usurper user

398
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.100
Who is there?

399
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.230
Take this fellow in,

400
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.500
and send for his master witha presently: we'll hear

401
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.570
more of your matter beforethe King.

402
00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.270
And as for you, that loveto be protected

403
00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.600
Under the wings of ourprotector's grace,

404
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.900
Begin your suits anew, andsue to him.

405
00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:02.470
Away, base cullions!Suffolk, let him go.

406
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.170
Come, let's be gone.

407
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:18.130
My Lord of Suffolk, say,is this the guise,

408
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.700
Is this the fashion in thecourt of England?

409
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.470
Is this the government ofBritain's isle,

410
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:27.370
And this the royalty ofAlbion's king?

411
00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.800
What shall King Henry be apupil still

412
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.130
Under the surlyGloucester's governance?

413
00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.900
Am I a queen in title andin style,

414
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.000
And must be made a subjectto a duke?

415
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.100
I tell thee, Pole, when inthe city Tours

416
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.330
Thou ran'st a tilt inhonour of my love

417
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:49.470
And stolest away theladies' hearts of France,

418
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.170
I thought King Henry hadresembled thee in courage,

419
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:57.870
courtship and proportion:

420
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.930
But all his mind isbent to holiness,

421
00:28:58.930 --> 00:29:02.800
To number Ave-Maries onhis beads;

422
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.700
His champions are theprophets and apostles,

423
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.800
His weapons holy saws ofsacred writ,

424
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.000
His study is histilt-yard, and his loves

425
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.470
Are brazen images ofcanonized saints.

426
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.800
I would the college of thecardinals

427
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.600
Would choose him pope, andcarry him to Rome,

428
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.370
And set the triple crownupon his head:

429
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.100
That were a state fit forhis holiness.

430
00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.070
Madam, be patient: as Iwas cause

431
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.400
Your highness came to England,

432
00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.370
so will I In England workyour grace's full content.

433
00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.430
Beside the haughty protector,have we Beaufort,

434
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:40.970
The imperious churchman,Somerset, Buckingham,

435
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:43.830
And grumbling York: andnot the least of these

436
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.370
But can do more in Englandthan the king.

437
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.870
And he of these that cando most of all

438
00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.030
Cannot do more in Englandthan the Nevils:

439
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.170
Salisbury and Warwick areno simple peers.

440
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.400
Not all these lords do vexme half so much

441
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.800
As that proud dame, thelord protector's wife.

442
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.630
She sweeps it through thecourt with troops of ladies,

443
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.100
More like an empress thanDuke Humphrey's wife:

444
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:13.470
Strangers in court do takeher for the queen:

445
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.670
She bears a duke'srevenues on her back,

446
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.830
And in her heart shescorns our poverty:

447
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.630
Shall I not live to beavenged on her?

448
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:29.900
Contemptuous base-borncallet as she is,

449
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.830
She vaunted 'mongst herminions t'other day,

450
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.500
The very train of herworst wearing gown

451
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.270
Was better worth than allmy father's lands,

452
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.670
Till Suffolk gave twodukedoms for his daughter.

453
00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.770
Madam, myself have limed abush for her,

454
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.230
And placed a quire of suchenticing birds,

455
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.530
That she will light tolisten to the lays,

456
00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:56.530
And never mount to troubleyou again.

457
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:00.300
So, let her rest: and,madam, list to me;

458
00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.770
For I am bold to counselyou in this.

459
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.930
Although we fancy not thecardinal,

460
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.870
Yet must we join with himand with the lords,

461
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:13.170
Till we have brought DukeHumphrey in disgrace.

462
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.070
As for the Duke of York,this late complaint

463
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:19.330
Will make but little forhis benefit.

464
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:24.000
So, one by one, we'll weedthem all at last,

465
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.970
And you yourself shallsteer the happy helm.

466
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.230
For my part, noble lords,I care not which;

467
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.830
Or Somerset or York, all'sone to me.

468
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:35.670
(Bugles play)

469
00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:39.430
If York have ill demean'dhimself in France,

470
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:40.730
Then let him be denay'dthe regentship.

471
00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.170
If Somerset be unworthy ofthe place,

472
00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.330
Let York be regent; I willyield to him.

473
00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:46.070
Whether your grace beworthy, yea or no,

474
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.070
Dispute not that: York isthe worthier.

475
00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.700
Ambitious Warwick, let thybetters speak.

476
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:51.900
The cardinal's not mybetter in the field.

477
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:54.270
All in this presence arethy betters, Warwick.

478
00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.030
Warwick may live to be thebest of all.

479
00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:59.100
Peace, son! and show somereason, Buckingham,

480
00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.870
Why Somerset should bepreferred in this.

481
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:06.000
Because the king,forsooth, will have it so.

482
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.470
Madam, the king is old enoughhimself to give his censure:

483
00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:10.000
these are no women's matters.

484
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.570
If he be old enough,what needs your grace

485
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.870
To be protector of hisexcellence?

486
00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.430
Madam, I am protector ofthe realm;

487
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.030
And, at his pleasure, willresign my place.

488
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:28.300
Resign it then and leavethine insolence.

489
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.530
Since thou wert king--aswho is king but thou?--

490
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.230
The commonwealth hathdaily run to wreck;

491
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.370
The Dauphin hath prevail'dbeyond the seas;

492
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.470
And all the peers andnobles of the realm

493
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.470
Have been as bondmen tothy sovereignty.

494
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.270
The commons hast thou rack'd;

495
00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.470
the clergy's bags Are lank andlean with thy extortions.

496
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.130
Thy sumptuous buildingsand thy wife's attire

497
00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.600
Have cost a mass of publictreasury.

498
00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:50.630
Thy cruelty in execution

499
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.700
Upon offenders, hathexceeded law,

500
00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.230
And left thee to the mercyof the law.

501
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.230
They sale of offices andtowns in France,

502
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.270
If they were known, as thesuspect is great,

503
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.770
Would make thee quicklyhop without thy head.

504
00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:15.700
Give me my fan: what,minion! can ye not?

505
00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.370
I cry you mercy, madam;was it you?

506
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:23.930
Was't I! yea, I it was,proud Frenchwoman:

507
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.970
Could I come near yourbeauty with my nails,

508
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.200
I'd set my tencommandments in your face.

509
00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.370
Sweet aunt, be quiet;'twas against her will.

510
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.500
Against her will! goodking, look to't in time;

511
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.630
She'll hamper thee, anddandle thee like a baby:

512
00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:42.170
Though in this place mostmaster wear no breeches,

513
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.900
She shall not strike DameEleanor unrevenged.

514
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.770
Lord cardinal, I willfollow Eleanor,

515
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.730
And listen after Humphrey,how he proceeds:

516
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.830
She's tickled now; herfury needs no spurs,

517
00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:00.170
She'll gallop far enoughto her destruction.

518
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:05.870
Now, lords, my cholerbeing over-blown

519
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:08.770
With walking once aboutthe quadrangle,

520
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.770
I come to talk ofcommonwealth affairs.

521
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.470
As for your spiteful falseobjections,

522
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:19.130
Prove them, and I lie opento the law:

523
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.230
But God in mercy so dealwith my soul,

524
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.800
As I in duty love my kingand country!

525
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.300
But, to the matter that wehave in hand:

526
00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.370
I say, my sovereign, Yorkis meetest man

527
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.530
To be your regent in therealm of France.

528
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.830
Before we make election,

529
00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.170
give me leave to show somereason, of no little force,

530
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.470
That York is most unmeetof any man.

531
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:48.030
I'll tell thee, Suffolk,why I am unmeet:

532
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:51.370
First, for I cannotflatter thee in pride;

533
00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.430
Next, if I be appointedfor the place,

534
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:59.070
My Lord of Somerset willkeep me here,

535
00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:01.630
Without discharge, money,or furniture,

536
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:05.800
Till France be won intothe Dauphin's hands:

537
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.170
Last time, I dancedattendance on his will

538
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:12.130
Till Paris was besieged,famish'd, and lost.

539
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.130
That can I witness; and afouler fact

540
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.770
Did never traitor in theland commit.

541
00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:17.800
Peace, headstrong Warwick!

542
00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:19.470
Image of pride, why shouldI hold my peace?

543
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:22.300
Because here is a manaccused of treason:

544
00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.770
Pray God the Duke of Yorkexcuse himself!

545
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:31.630
Doth any one accuse Yorkfor a traitor?

546
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.870
What mean'st thou, Suffolk;tell me, what are these?

547
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.630
Please it your majesty,this is the man

548
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:38.930
That doth accuse hismaster of high treason:

549
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.900
His words were these: thatRichard, Duke of York,

550
00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.970
Was rightful heir unto theEnglish crown

551
00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:47.400
And that your majesty wasa usurper.

552
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.830
Say, man, were these thywords?

553
00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:52.630
An't shall please your majesty,

554
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.770
I never said nor thoughtany such matter:

555
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:59.670
God is my witness, I am falselyaccused by the villain.

556
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:01.930
By these ten bones, my lords,he did speak them to me

557
00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:03.870
in the garret one night,as we were scouring my

558
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.130
Lord of York's armour.

559
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.870
Base dunghill villain andmechanical,

560
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:10.630
I'll have thy head forthis thy traitor's speech.

561
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.200
I do beseech your royalmajesty,

562
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.100
Let him have all the rigorof the law.

563
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.670
Alas, my lord, hang me, ifever I spake the words.

564
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:20.530
My accuser is my 'prentice;and when I did correct

565
00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.100
him for his fault the otherday, he did vow upon his knees

566
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:28.130
he would be even with me: Ihave good witness of this:

567
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.970
therefore I beseechyour majesty,

568
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:36.970
do not cast away an honest manfor a villain's accusation.

569
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:40.270
Uncle, what shall wesay to this in law?

570
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.270
This doom, my lord, if Imay judge my case:

571
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:58.330
Let Somerset be regentover the French,

572
00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:02.700
Because in York thisbreeds suspicion:

573
00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.970
And let these have a dayappointed them

574
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.570
For single combat inconvenient place,

575
00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.070
For he hath witness of hisservant's malice:

576
00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.430
This is the law, and thisDuke Humphrey's doom.

577
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.070
I humbly thank your royalmajesty.

578
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:20.230
And I accept the combatwillingly.

579
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:25.970
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight;for God's sake, pity my case.

580
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.100
The spite of manprevaileth against me.

581
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.900
O Lord, have mercy upon me!

582
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.500
I shall never be able to fighta blow. O Lord, my heart!

583
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:38.030
Sirrah, or you must fight,or else be hang'd.

584
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.870
Away with them to prison;and the day of combat

585
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.870
shall be the lastof the next month.

586
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.000
Come, Somerset, we'llsee thee sent away.

587
00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:23.870
(Cymbals clanging)

588
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.730
Come master Bolingbroke;the duchess, I tell you,

589
00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:35.130
expects performanceof your promises.

590
00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:37.400
Master Hume, we aretherefore provided:

591
00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:41.370
will her ladyship beholdand hear our exorcisms?

592
00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.500
Ay, what else? fearyou not her courage.

593
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.570
I have heard her reported to be

594
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.400
a woman of anexceptional spirit:

595
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.270
but it shall be convenient,

596
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.970
Master Hume, that yoube by her aloft,

597
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.970
while we be busy below; and so,I pray you, go, in God's name,

598
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.000
and leave us.

599
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.900
Mother Jourdain,

600
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.230
be you prostrate and grovel onthe earth; John Southwell,

601
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:12.130
read you; and let us toour work.

602
00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:13.670
Well said, my masters;

603
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:15.500
To this gear thesooner the better.

604
00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.330
Patience, good lady;wizards know their times:

605
00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.900
(drumming)

606
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:39.830
Deep night, dark night,the silent of the night,

607
00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.670
The time of night whenTroy was set on fire;

608
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:47.270
The time when screech-owlscry and ban-dogs howl,

609
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:54.330
And spirits walk and ghostsbreak up their graves,

610
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.270
That time best fits thework we have in hand.

611
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:02.730
Madam, stay you and fearnot: whom we raise,

612
00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:06.530
We will make fast within ahallow'd verge.

613
00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:18.930
(chanting magic spell)

614
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:39.900
(chanting magic spell)

615
00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:53.430
Adsum,

616
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.530
Asmath,

617
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.670
By the eternal God, whosename and power

618
00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:03.470
Thou tremblest at, answerthat I shall ask;

619
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:08.030
For, till thou speak, thoushalt not pass from hence.

620
00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:15.670
Ask what thou wilt. That Ihad said and done!

621
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:21.830
'First of the king: whatshall of him become?'

622
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:29.100
The duke yet lives thatHenry shall depose;

623
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:36.170
Yet him outlive, and die aviolent death.

624
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:43.230
Tell me 'What fate awaits theDuke of Suffolk?'

625
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:48.570
By water shall he die, andtake his end.

626
00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:53.500
'What shall betide theDuke of Somerset?'

627
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.800
Let him shun castles;

628
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.070
Safer shall he be upon thesandy plains

629
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:04.270
Than where castles mountedstand.

630
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:10.230
Have done, for more Ihardly can endure.

631
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:15.770
Descend to darkness andthe burning lake!

632
00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.770
False fiend, avoid!

633
00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:29.800
Lay hands upon thesetraitors and their trash.

634
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:34.830
Lay hands upon thesetraitors and their trash.

635
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:41.170
Beldam, I think we watch'dyou at an inch.

636
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:45.970
What, madam, are you there?the king and commonweal

637
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:49.230
Are deeply indebted forthis piece of pains:

638
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.830
My lord protector will, Idoubt it not,

639
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.170
See you well guerdon'd forthese good deserts.

640
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:57.200
Not half so bad as thineto England's king,

641
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.430
Injurious duke, thatthreatest where's no cause.

642
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:12.030
True, madam, none at all:what call you this?

643
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.900
Away with them! let thembe clapp'd up close.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.070
And kept asunder. You,madam, shall with us.

We'll see your trinketshere all forthcoming.

647
00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.770
All, away!

648
00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:45.470
Lord Buckingham, methinks,you watch'd her well:

649
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:49.470
A pretty plot, well chosento build upon!

650
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:55.230
Now, pray, my lord, let'ssee the devil's writ.

651
00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:03.370
What have we here?

652
00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:07.370
'The duke yet lives, thatHenry shall depose;

653
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:15.370
But him outlive, anddie a violent death.'

654
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:26.030
'Tell me what fate awaitsthe Duke of Suffolk?

655
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:30.100
By water shall he die, andtake his end.

656
00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:36.370
What shall betide the Dukeof Somerset?

657
00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:39.800
Let him shun castles;

658
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:44.500
Safer shall he be upon thesandy plains

659
00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.900
Than where castles mountedstand.'

660
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.030
(Laughing) Come, come, my lords;

661
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.230
These oracles are hardlyattain'd,

662
00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:00.230
And hardly understood.

663
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.870
The king is now in progresstowards Saint Alban's,

664
00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.630
With him the husbandof this lovely lady:

665
00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:11.700
Thither go these news, as fastas horse can carry them:

666
00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:14.430
A sorry breakfast for mylord protector.

667
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:17.770
Your grace shall give meleave, my Lord of York,

668
00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:20.530
To be the post, in hope ofhis reward.

669
00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:24.330
At your pleasure, my good lord.

670
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:34.000
Within there, ho!

671
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.300
Invite my Lords ofSalisbury and Warwick

672
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.770
To sup with me to-morrownight. Away!

673
00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:52.870
