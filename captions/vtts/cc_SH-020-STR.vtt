00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:49.870


2
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.230
In Troy, there lies thescene. From isles of Greece

3
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.030
The princes orgulous,their high blood chafed,

4
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.700
Have to the port of Athenssent their ships,

5
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.700
Fraught with the ministersand instruments

6
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.900
Of cruel war: sixty andnine, that wore

7
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.230
Their crownets regal, fromthe Athenian bay

8
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.470
Put forth toward Phrygia;and their vow is made

9
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.130
To ransack Troy, withinwhose strong immures

10
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.370
The ravish'd Helen,Menelaus' queen,

11
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.000
With wanton Paris sleeps;and that's the quarrel.

12
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.870
To Tenedos they come;

13
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.030
And the deep-drawing barksdo there disgorge

14
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.400
Their warlike fraughtage:now on Dardan plains

15
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.630
The fresh and yetunbruised Greeks do pitch

16
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.500
Their brave pavilions:Priam's six-gated city,

17
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.100
Dardan, and Tymbria,Helias, Chetas, Troien,

18
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.730
And Antenorides, withmassy staples

19
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.230
And corresponsive andfulfilling bolts,

20
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.570
Sperr up the sons of Troy.

21
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.600
Now expectation, ticklingskittish spirits,

22
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.370
On one and other side,Trojan and Greek,

23
00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.430
Sets all on hazard: andhither am I come

24
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.300
A prologue arm'd, but notin confidence

25
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.370
Of author's pen or actor'svoice, but suited

26
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.670
In like conditions as ourargument,

27
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.830
To tell you, fairbeholders, that our play

28
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.330
Leaps o'er the vaunt andfirstlings of those broils,

29
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.830
Beginning in the middle,starting thence away

30
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.970
To what may be digested ina play.

31
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.970
Like or find fault; do asyour pleasures are:

32
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.230
Now good or bad, 'tis butthe chance of war.

33
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.830
Call here my varlet; I'llunarm again:

34
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.170
Why should I war withoutthe walls of Troy,

35
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.430
That find such cruelbattle here within?

36
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.400
Each Trojan that is masterof his heart,

37
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.130
Let him to field; Troilus,alas! hath none.

38
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.200
Will this gear ne'er bemended?

39
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.930
The Greeks are strong andskilful to their strength,

40
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.830
Fierce to their skill and totheir fierceness valiant;

41
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.800
But I am weaker than awoman's tear,

42
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.100
Tamer than sleep, fonderthan ignorance,

43
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.370
Less valiant than thevirgin in the night

44
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.300
And skilless asunpractised infancy.

45
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.530
Well, I have toldyou enough of this:

46
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.330
for my part, I'll not meddlenor make no further.

47
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.830
He that will have acake out of the wheat

48
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.470
must needs tarrythe grinding.

49
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.530
Have I not tarried?

50
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.000
Ay, the grinding; but youmust tarry the bolting.

51
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.130
Have I not tarried?

52
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.030
Ay, the bolting, but youmust tarry the leavening.

53
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.200
Still have I tarried.

54
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.470
Ay, to the leavening; buthere's yet in the word

55
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.470
'hereafter' the kneading,the making of the cake,

56
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.400
the heating of theoven and the baking;

57
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.800
nay, you must staythe cooling too,

58
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.400
or you may chanceto burn your lips.

59
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.800
Patience herself, whatgoddess e'er she be,

60
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.130
Doth lesser blench atsufferance than I do.

61
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.630
At Priam's royal table doI sit;

62
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.600
And when fair Cressidcomes into my thoughts,--

63
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.670
So, traitor! 'When shecomes!' When is she thence?

64
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.300
Well, she looked yesternightfairer than ever I saw

65
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.270
her look, or any womanelse.

66
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.700
I was about to tellthee:--when my heart,

67
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.370
As wedged with a sigh,would rive in twain,

68
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.870
Lest Hector or my fathershould perceive me,

69
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.930
I have, as when the sundoth light a storm,

70
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.630
Buried this sigh inwrinkle of a smile:

71
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.500
But sorrow, that is couch'din seeming gladness,

72
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.170
Is like that mirth fateturns to sudden sadness.

73
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.770
An her hair were not somewhatdarker than Helen's--

74
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.430
well, go to--there were no morecomparison between the women:

75
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.700
but, for my part, sheis my kinswoman;

76
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.600
I would not, as theyterm it, praise her:

77
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.830
but I would somebody had heardher talk yesterday, as I did.

78
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.230
I will not dispraise yoursister Cassandra's wit, but--

79
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.970
O Pandarus! I tell thee,Pandarus,--

80
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.530
When I do tell thee, theremy hopes lie drown'd,

81
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.170
Reply not in how manyfathoms deep

82
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.070
They lie indrench'd. Itell thee I am mad

83
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.870
In Cressid's love: thouanswer'st 'she is fair;'

84
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.270
Pour'st in the open ulcerof my heart

85
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.670
Her eyes, her hair, hercheek, her gait, her voice,

86
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.630
Handlest in thy discourse,O, that her hand,

87
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.430
In whose comparison allwhites are ink,

88
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.300
Writing their own reproach,to whose soft seizure

89
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.070
The cygnet's down is harshand spirit of sense

90
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.870
Hard as the palm of ploughman:this thou tell'st me,

91
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.230
As true thou tell'st me,when I say I love her;

92
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.000
But, saying thus, insteadof oil and balm,

93
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.870
Thou lay'st in every gashthat love hath given me

94
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.170
The knife that made it.

95
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.500
I speak no more thantruth.

96
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.530
Thou dost not speak somuch.

97
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.270
Faith, I'll not meddlein't. Let her be as she is:

98
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.900
if she be fair, 'tis the betterfor her; an she be not,

99
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.570
she has the mendsin her own hands.

100
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.370
Good Pandarus, how now,Pandarus!

101
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.300
I have had my labourfor my travail;

102
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.100
ill-thought on of her andill-thought on of you;

103
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:28.530
gone between and between, butsmall thanks for my labour.

104
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.500
What, art thou angry,Pandarus? what, with me?

105
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.330
Because she's kin to me,

106
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.470
therefore she's notso fair as Helen:

107
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.970
an she were not kin to me, shewould be as fair on Friday

108
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.630
as Helen is on Sunday.But what care I?

109
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.630
I care not an shewere a black-a-moor;

110
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.000
'tis all one to me.

111
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.300
Say I she is not fair?

112
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.400
I do not care whetheryou do or no.

113
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.570
She's a fool to stay behind herfather; let her to the Greeks;

114
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.130
and so I'll tell her the nexttime I see her: for my part,

115
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:22.970
I'll meddle nor make nomore i' the matter.

116
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:23.630
Pandarus,--

117
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.530
Not I.

118
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.800
Sweet Pandarus,--

119
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.630
Pray you, speak no more to me: Iwill leave all as I found it,

120
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.400
and there an end.

121
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.570
Peace, you ungraciousclamours! peace, rude sounds!

122
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:50.430
Fools on both sides! Helenmust needs be fair,

123
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.930
When with your blood youdaily paint her thus.

124
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.830
I cannot fight upon thisargument;

125
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:04.230
It is too starved asubject for my sword.

126
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:10.900
But Pandarus,--O gods, howdo you plague me!

127
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.900
I cannot come to Cressidbut by Pandar;

128
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.600
And he's as tetchy to bewoo'd to woo.

129
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.100
As she is stubborn-chasteagainst all suit.

130
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.270
Tell me, Apollo, for thyDaphne's love,

131
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:37.730
What Cressid is, whatPandar, and what we?

132
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:49.670
Her bed is India; thereshe lies, a pearl:

133
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.270
Between our Ilium andwhere she resides,

134
00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:00.430
Let it be call'd the wildand wandering flood,

135
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:07.470
Ourself the merchant, andthis sailing Pandar

136
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:15.470
Our doubtful hope, ourconvoy and our bark.

137
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:26.270
How now, Prince Troilus!wherefore not afield?

138
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:32.270
Because not there: thiswoman's answer sorts,

139
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.530
For womanish it is to befrom thence.

140
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.630
What news, AEneas, fromthe field to-day?

141
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.500
That Paris is returnedhome and hurt.

142
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.370
By whom, AEneas?

143
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.030
Troilus, by Menelaus.

144
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:55.500
Let Paris bleed; 'tis buta scar to scorn;

145
00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:03.030
Paris is gored withMenelaus' horn.

146
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.400
Hark, what good sport isout of town to-day!

147
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.000
Better at home, if 'wouldI might' were 'may.'

148
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.730
But to the sport abroad:are you bound thither?

149
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.470
In all swift haste.

150
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.370
Come, go we then together.

151
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:44.870
Who were those went by?

152
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.000
Queen Hecuba and Helen.

153
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.930
And whither go they?

154
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.600
Up to the eastern tower,

155
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.430
Whose height commands assubject all the vale,

156
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.730
To see the battle.

157
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.070
Hector, whose patienceIs, as a virtue, fix'd,

158
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.870
to-day was moved:

159
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.970
He chid Andromache andstruck his armourer,

160
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.800
And, like as there werehusbandry in war,

161
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.900
Before the sun rose he washarness'd light,

162
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.970
And to the field goes he;where every flower

163
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.070
Did, as a prophet, weep whatit foresaw In Hector's wrath.

164
00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.000
What was his cause ofanger?

165
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.400
The noise goes, this:there is among the Greeks

166
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.770
A lord of Trojan blood,nephew to Hector;

167
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.870
They call him Ajax.

168
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.130
Good; and what of him?

169
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.230
They say he is a very manper se,

170
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.530
And stands alone.

171
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:30.700
So do all men, unless they aredrunk, sick, or have no legs.

172
00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.800
This man, lady, hathrobbed many beasts

173
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.300
of their particular additions;he is as valiant as the lion,

174
00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.370
churlish as the bear,slow as the elephant:

175
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:43.700
a man into whom naturehath so crowded humours

176
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.370
that his valour iscrushed into folly,

177
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.900
his folly saucedwith discretion:

178
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.600
there is no man hath a virtuethat he hath not a glimpse of,

179
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.300
nor any man an attaint but hecarries some stain of it:

180
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.730
he is melancholy without cause,

181
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:00.630
and merry against the hair: hehath the joints of every thing,

182
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:05.130
but everything so out of jointthat he is a gouty Briareus,

183
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.330
many hands and no use,

184
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.570
or purblind Argus, alleyes and no sight.

185
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.100
But how should this man,that makes me smile,

186
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.000
make Hector angry?

187
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.170
They say he yesterday copedHector in the battle

188
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.900
and struck him down, thedisdain and shame whereof hath

189
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.570
ever since kept Hectorfasting and waking.

190
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:22.430
Who comes here?

191
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.230
Madam, your unclePandarus.

192
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.430
Hector's a gallant man.

193
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:27.930
As may be in the world,lady.

194
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.100
What's that? what's that?

195
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.300
Good morrow, unclePandarus.

196
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.900
Good morrow, cousin Cressid:what do you talk of?

197
00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.670
Good morrow, Alexander.How do you, cousin?

198
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.300
When were you at Ilium?

199
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.600
This morning, uncle.

200
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.600
What were you talkingof when I came?

201
00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.230
Was Hector armed and goneere ye came to Ilium?

202
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.400
Helen was not up, was she?

203
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.470
Hector was gone, but Helenwas not up.

204
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.330
Even so: Hector wasstirring early.

205
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.300
That were we talking of,and of his anger.

206
00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.630
Was he angry?

207
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.870
So he says here.

208
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.770
True, he was so: Iknow the cause too:

209
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.870
he'll lay about him to-day,I can tell them that:

210
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.330
and there's Troilus willnot come far behind him:

211
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.300
let them take heed of Troilus,I can tell them that too.

212
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.530
What, is he angry too?

213
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.670
Who, Troilus? Troilus isthe better man of the two.

214
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.700
O Jupiter! there's nocomparison.

215
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.830
What, not betweenTroilus and Hector?

216
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.170
Do you know a manif you see him?

217
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.870
Ay, if I ever saw himbefore and knew him.

218
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:32.100
Well, I say Troilus isTroilus.

219
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.870
Then you say as I say; for,I am sure, he is not Hector.

220
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.770
No, nor Hector is notTroilus in some degrees.

221
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:38.870
'Tis just to each of them;he is himself.

222
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.130
Himself! Alas, poorTroilus! I would he were.

223
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:44.370
So he is.

224
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.100
Condition, I had gonebarefoot to India.

225
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.300
He is not Hector.

226
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:55.830
Himself! no, he's not himself:would a' were himself!

227
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.230
Well, the gods are above;time must friend or end:

228
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:09.530
well, Troilus, well: I wouldmy heart were in her body.

229
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.000
No, Hector is not abetter man than Troilus.

230
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.800
Excuse me.

231
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.770
He is elder.

232
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.130
Pardon me, pardon me.

233
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.370
Th' other's not come to't; youshall tell me another tale,

234
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.000
when th' other's come to't.

235
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.470
Hector shall not havehis wit this year.

236
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.900
He shall not need it, ifhe have his own.

237
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.600
Nor his qualities.

238
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.430
No matter.

239
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:25.570
Nor his beauty.

240
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:26.830
'Twould not become him;his own's better.

241
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.670
You have no judgment, niece:

242
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.100
Helen herself sworeth' other day,

243
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.700
that fora brown favour

244
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.230
--for so 'tis, I must confess,--not brown neither,--

245
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.230
No, but brown.

246
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.500
'Faith, to say truth,brown and not brown.

247
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.730
To say the truth, true andnot true.

248
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:50.770
She praised his complexionabove Paris.

249
00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.130
Why, Paris hath colourenough.

250
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.370
So he has.

251
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.130
Then Troilus should have toomuch: if she praised him above,

252
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:57.700
his complexion ishigher than his;

253
00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:59.300
he having colour enough,and the other higher,

254
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.970
is too flaming a praisefor a good complexion.

255
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.200
I had as lief Helen'sgolden tongue

256
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.700
had commended Troilusfor a copper nose.

257
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.170
I swear to you. I think Helenloves him better than Paris.

258
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:14.630
Then she's a merry Greekindeed.

259
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.700
Nay, I am sure she does. Shecame to him th' other day

260
00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.300
and puts me her whitehand to his cloven chin--

261
00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.700
Juno have mercy! how cameit cloven?

262
00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.130
Why, you know 'tis dimpled:I think his smiling

263
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.730
becomes him better thanany man in all Phrygia.

264
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:33.300
O, he smiles valiantly.

265
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.170
Does he not?

266
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.470
O yes, an 'twere a cloudin autumn.

267
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.030
Why, go to, then:

268
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.030
I cannot choose but laugh, tothink how she tickled his chin:

269
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.170
she has a marvellouswhite hand,

270
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.200
I must needs confess,--

271
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.530
Without the rack.

272
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.030
And she takes upon her to spya white hair on his chin.

273
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.300
Alas, poor chin! many awart is richer.

274
00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.400
But there was such laughing!Queen Hecuba laughed

275
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.700
that her eyes ran o'er.

276
00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.970
With mill-stones.

277
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.530
And Cassandra laughed.

278
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.730
Did her eyes runo'er too?

279
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.400
And Hector laughed.

280
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.330
At what was all thislaughing?

281
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:21.130
Marry, at the white hair thatHelen spied on Troilus' chin.

282
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:23.370
An't had been a green hair,I should have laughed too.

283
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:28.000
They laughed not so much at thehair as at his pretty answer.

284
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.800
What was his answer?

285
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.570
Quoth she, 'Here's but two andfifty hairs on your chin,

286
00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:34.830
and one of them is white.

287
00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:36.270
This is her question.

288
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.830
'Two and fifty hairs'quoth he, 'and one white:

289
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:44.500
that white hair is my father,and all the rest are his sons.'

290
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:50.130
'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'whichof these hairs is Paris,

291
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:54.030
my husband? 'The forkedone,' quoth he,

292
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:58.400
'pluck't out, and give it him.'

293
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.700
But there was such laughing!

294
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.600
and Helen so blushed,an Paris so chafed,

295
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.070
and all the rest solaughed, that it passed.

296
00:17:05.070 --> 00:17:11.500
So let it now; for it hasbeen a great while going by.

297
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:18.830
Well, cousin. I told you athing yesterday; think on't.

298
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.370
So I do.

299
00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:24.800
I'll be sworn 'tistrue; he will weep you,

300
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.200
an 'twere a manborn in April.

301
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.070
And I'll spring up in his tears,an 'twere a nettle against May.

302
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:34.870
(♪A retreat sounded by horns)

303
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:37.400
Hark! they are comingfrom the field:

304
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:43.570
shall we stand up here, and seethem as they pass toward Ilium?

305
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:49.930
good niece, do, sweetniece Cressida.

306
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:55.300
At your pleasure.

307
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.230
Here, here, here'san excellent place;

308
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.470
here we may seemost bravely:

309
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:03.900
I'll tell you them all bytheir names as they pass by;

310
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.900
but mark Troilusabove the rest.

311
00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.930
Speak not so loud.

312
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.870
That's AEneas: is notthat a brave man?

313
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.530
he's one of the flowersof Troy, I can tell you:

314
00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.630
but mark Troilus;you shall see Troilus anon.

315
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.670
Who's that?

316
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:29.600
That's Antenor: he has ashrewd wit, I can tell you;

317
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:30.800
and he's a mangood enough,

318
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.100
he's one o' the soundestjudgments in Troy whosoever,

319
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.000
and a proper manof person.

320
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.570
When comes Troilus? I'llshow you Troilus anon:

321
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.770
if he see me, you shallsee him nod at me.

322
00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:44.500
Will he give you the nod?

323
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.370
You shall see.

324
00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.100
If he do, the rich shall havemore.

325
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.300
(♪trumpet sounds)

326
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:55.900
That's Hector, that, that, lookyou, that; there's a fellow!

327
00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.370
Go thy way, Hector! There'sa brave man, niece.

328
00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.170
O brave Hector!Look how he looks!

329
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:07.470
there's a countenance!is't not a brave man?

330
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.700
O, a brave man!

331
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.970
Is a' not? it does aman's heart good.

332
00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.230
Look you what hacksare on his helmet!

333
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:17.030
look you yonder, do yousee? look you there:

334
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.130

take't off who will, asthey say: there be hacks!

336
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.230
Be those with swords?

337
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.600
Swords! any thing, he caresnot; an the devil come to him,

338
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:37.170
it's all one: by God's lid,it does one's heart good.

339
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:41.430
Yonder comes Paris,yonder comes Paris.

340
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.470
Look ye yonder, niece; is'tnot a gallant man too,

341
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.800
is't not? Why, thisis brave now.

342
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:55.630
Who said he came hurt hometo-day? he's not hurt:

343
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.130
why, this will do Helen'sheart good now, ha!

344
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.900
Would I could see Troilus now!You shall see Troilus anon.

345
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.470
Who's that?

346
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.000
That's Helenus. I marvelwhere Troilus is.

347
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.230
That's Helenus. I think hewent not forth to-day.

348
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.330
That's Helenus. CanHelenus fight, uncle?

349
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:19.330
Helenus? no. Yes, he'llfight indifferent well.

350
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.230
I marvel where Troilus is.

351
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:27.830
Hark! do you not hear thepeople cry 'Troilus'?

352
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.430
Helenus is a priest.

353
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.330
What sneaking fellowcomes yonder?

354
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:40.970
Where? yonder? that'sDeiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!

355
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:45.870
there's a man, niece!Hem! Brave Troilus!

356
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.400
the prince of chivalry!

357
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.630
Peace, for shame, peace!

358
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.030
Mark him; note him.O brave Troilus!

359
00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.630
Look well upon him, niece: lookyou how his sword is bloodied,

360
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.930
and his helm more hacked thanHector's, and how he looks,

361
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.130
and how he goes! Oadmirable youth!

362
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.500
he ne'er sawthree and twenty.

363
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:08.670
Go thy way, Troilus,go thy way!

364
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.730
Had I a sister were a grace,or a daughter a goddess,

365
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:18.370
he should take his choice.O admirable man! Paris?

366
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:23.200
Paris is dirt to him; and, Iwarrant, Helen, to change,

367
00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.000
would give an eye to boot.

368
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.100
Here come more.

369
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.930
Asses, fools, dolts! chaffand bran, chaff and bran!

370
00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.830
porridge after meat!

371
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:37.600
I could live and die i'the eyes of Troilus.

372
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.430
Ne'er look, ne'er look:

373
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.100
the eagles are gone:

374
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:54.070
crows and daws,crows and daws!

375
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.630
I had rather be sucha man as Troilus

376
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:59.130
than Agamemnonand all Greece.

377
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:02.770
There is among theGreeks Achilles,

378
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.330
a better manthan Troilus.

379
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:11.800
Achilles! a drayman, aporter, a very camel.

380
00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.830
Well, well.

381
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.170
'Well, well!' why, haveyou any discretion?

382
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.500
have you any eyes? Doyou know what a man is?

383
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.600
Is not birth, beauty, goodshape, manhood, discourse,

384
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.230
learning, gentleness,virtue, youth, liberality,

385
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.870
and such like, the spiceand salt that season a man?

386
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:31.070
Ay, a minced man: and then to bebaked with no date in the pie,

387
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.130
for then the man's date's out.

388
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:38.300
You are such a woman! one knowsnot at what ward you lie.

389
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.970
Upon my back, to defendmy belly; upon my wit,

390
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.930
to defend my wiles;upon my secrecy,

391
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.770
to defend mine honesty; mymask, to defend my beauty;

392
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.600
and you, to defend all these:

393
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.730
and at all these wards Ilie, at a thousand watches.

394
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:55.930
Say one of your watches.

395
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:57.570
Nay, I'll watch you for that;

396
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.700
and that's one of thechiefest of them too:

397
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.670
if I cannot ward whatI would not have hit,

398
00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.830
I can watch you for tellinghow I took the blow;

399
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.030
unless it swell past hiding,and then it's past watching.

400
00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:13.270
(laughing)

401
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.770
You are such another!

402
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.800
Sir, my lord wouldinstantly speak with you.

403
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.700
Where?

404
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.270
At your own house; therehe unarms him.

405
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.670
Good boy, tell him I come.

406
00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.970
I doubt he be hurt. Fareye well, good niece.

407
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:24.800
Adieu, uncle.

408
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.970
I'll be with you, niece,by and by.

409
00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.000
To bring, uncle?

410
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.430
Ay, a token from Troilus.

411
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:33.600
By the same token, you area bawd.

412
00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:48.730
Words, vows, gifts, tears,and love's full sacrifice,

413
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.330
He offers in another'senterprise;

414
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.030
But more in Troilusthousand fold I see

415
00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.570
Than in the glass ofPandar's praise may be;

416
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:06.470
Yet hold I off. Women areangels, wooing:

417
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:12.570
Things won are done; joy'ssoul lies in the doing.

418
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.200
That she beloved knowsnought that knows not this:

419
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.300
Men prize the thingungain'd more than it is:

420
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.930
That she was never yetthat ever knew

421
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:26.270
Love got so sweet as whendesire did sue.

422
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.800
Therefore this maxim outof love I teach:

423
00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.070
Achievement is command;ungain'd, beseech:

424
00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:40.200
Then though my heart'scontent firm love doth bear,

425
00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:42.900
Nothing of that shall frommine eyes appear.

426
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:47.330
Princes,

427
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.570
What grief hath set thejaundice on your cheeks?

428
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.700
The ample proposition thathope makes

429
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.400
In all designs begun onearth below

430
00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.170
Fails in thepromised largeness:

431
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.500
cheques and disasters

432
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.970
Grow in the veins ofactions highest rear'd,

433
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.770
As knots, by the confluxof meeting sap,

434
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.630
Infect the sound pine anddivert his grain

435
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.100
Tortive and errant fromhis course of growth.

436
00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.030
Nor, princes, is it matternew to us

437
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:23.670
That we come short of oursuppose so far

438
00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:30.770
That after seven years'siege yet Troy walls stand;

439
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.170
Sith every action thathath gone before,

440
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.370
Whereof we have record,trial did draw

441
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.970
Bias and thwart, notanswering the aim,

442
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.800
And that unbodied figureof the thought

443
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:42.630
That gave't surmised shape.Why then, you princes,

444
00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.870
Do you with cheeks abash'dbehold our works,

445
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:48.700
And call them shames? whichare indeed nought else

446
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.700
But the protractive trialsof great Jove

447
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.400
To find persistiveconstancy in men:

448
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.100
The fineness of whichmetal is not found

449
00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.270
In fortune's love; forthen the bold and coward,

450
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:06.630
The wise and fool, theartist and unread,

451
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:11.230
The hard and soft, allaffined and kin:

452
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:15.230
But, in the wind andtempest of her frown,

453
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.070
Distinction, with a broadand powerful fan,

454
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.030
Puffing at all, winnowsthe light away;

455
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:25.170
And what hath mass ormatter, by itself

456
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.230
Lies rich in virtue andunmingled.

457
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.500
With due observance of thygodlike seat,

458
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.070
Great Agamemnon, Nestorshall apply

459
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.130
Thy latest words. In thereproof of chance

460
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:41.030
Lies the true proof ofmen: the sea being smooth,

461
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.570
How many shallow baubleboats dare sail

462
00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.730
Upon her patient breast,making their way

463
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.430
With those of nobler bulk!

464
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.200
But let the ruffian Boreasonce enrage

465
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.700
The gentle Thetis, andanon behold

466
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:56.700
The strong-ribb'd barkthrough liquid mountains cut,

467
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.330
Bounding between the twomoist elements,

468
00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.300
Like Perseus' horse:where's then the saucy boat

469
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.070
Whose weak untimber'dsides but even now

470
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:06.830
Co-rivall'd greatness?Either to harbour fled,

471
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:09.200
Or made a toast for Neptune.

472
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.030
Even so Doth valour's showand valour's worth divide

473
00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.230
In storms of fortune; forin her ray and brightness

474
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.130
The herd hath moreannoyance by the breeze

475
00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.500
Than by the tiger; butwhen the splitting wind

476
00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:23.300
Makes flexible the kneesof knotted oaks,

477
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.400
And flies fled under shade,why, then the thing of courage

478
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.000
As roused with rage withrage doth sympathize,

479
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.800
And with an accent tunedin selfsame key

480
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.430
Retorts to chidingfortune.

481
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.700
Agamemnon,

482
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.770
Thou great commander,nerve and bone of Greece,

483
00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:46.970
Heart of our numbers, souland only spirit.

484
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:48.670
In whom the tempers andthe minds of all

485
00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:54.100
Should be shut up, hearwhat Ulysses speaks.

486
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.270
Besides the applauseand approbation

487
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.330
To which, most mightyfor thy place and sway,

488
00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.130
And thou most reverend forthy stretch'd-out life

489
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.130
I give to both yourspeeches, which were such

490
00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.400
As Agamemnon and the handof Greece

491
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.330
Should hold up high inbrass, and such again

492
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.870
As venerable Nestor,hatch'd in silver,

493
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.430
Should with a bond of air,strong as the axle-tree

494
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.470
On which heaven rides,knit all the Greekish ears

495
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:25.470
To his experienced tongue,yet let it please both,

496
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:29.030
Thou great, and wise, tohear Ulysses speak.

497
00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.100
Speak, prince of Ithaca;and be't of less expect

498
00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.070
That matter needless, ofimportless burden,

499
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.130
Divide thy lips, than weare confident,

500
00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.600
When rank Thersites opeshis mastic jaws,

501
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.100
We shall hear music, witand oracle.

502
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:52.330
Troy, yet upon his basis,had been down,

503
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.500
And the great Hector'ssword had lack'd a master,

504
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.230
But for these instances.

505
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:02.570
The specialty of rule hathbeen neglected:

506
00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.700
And, look, how manyGrecian tents do stand

507
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.530
Hollow upon this plain, somany hollow factions.

508
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.870
When that the general isnot like the hive

509
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.170
To whom the foragers shallall repair,

510
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:21.070
What honey is expected?Degree being vizarded,

511
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.430
The unworthiest shows asfairly in the mask.

512
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.100
The heavens themselves, theplanets and this centre

513
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.900
Observe degree, priorityand shape,

514
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.570
Insisture, course,proportion, season, form,

515
00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.730
Office and custom, in allline of order;

516
00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.600
And therefore is theglorious planet Sol

517
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.530
In noble eminenceenthroned and sphered

518
00:29:40.530 --> 00:29:42.630
Amidst the other; whosemedicinable eye

519
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.030
Corrects the ill aspectsof planets evil,

520
00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.270
And posts, like thecommandment of a king,

521
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:50.730
Sans cheque to good andbad: but when the planets

522
00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:56.400
In evil mixture todisorder wander,

523
00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.230
What plagues and whatportents! what mutiny!

524
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.930
What raging of the sea!shaking of earth!

525
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.900
Commotion in the winds!frights, horrors, changes,

526
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:09.230
Divert and crack, rend andderacinate

527
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:11.300
The unity and married calmof states

528
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.300
Quite from their fixure!O, when degree is shaked,

529
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.670
Which is the ladder to allhigh designs,

530
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:23.900
Then enterprise is sick!How could communities,

531
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:27.430
Degrees in schools andbrotherhoods in cities,

532
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.900
Peaceful commerce fromdividable shores,

533
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.470
The primogenitive and dueof birth,

534
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.430
Prerogative of age,crowns, sceptres, laurels,

535
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.000
But by degree, stand inauthentic place?

536
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.030
Take but degree away,untune that string,

537
00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.770
And, hark, what discordfollows! each thing meets

538
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:50.070
In mere oppugnancy: thebounded waters

539
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:52.770
Should lift their bosomshigher than the shores

540
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.570
And make a sop of all thissolid globe:

541
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.330
Strength should be lord ofimbecility,

542
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.200
And the rude son shouldstrike his father dead:

543
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.430
Force should be right; orrather, right and wrong,

544
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:05.770
Between whose endless jarjustice resides,

545
00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.600
Should lose their names,and so should justice too.

546
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.070
Then every thing includesitself in power,

547
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.870
Power into will, will intoappetite;

548
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.430
And appetite, an universalwolf,

549
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.270
So doubly seconded withwill and power,

550
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.430
Must make perforce anuniversal prey,

551
00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.400
And last eat up himself.Great Agamemnon,

552
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.730
This chaos, when degree issuffocate,

553
00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:31.270
Follows the choking.

554
00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.670
And this neglection ofdegree it is

555
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.470
That by a pace goesbackward, with a purpose

556
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.570
It hath to climb. Thegeneral's disdain'd

557
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.800
By him one step below, heby the next,

558
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.170
That next by him beneath;so every step,

559
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.830
Exampled by the first pacethat is sick

560
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:49.270
Of his superior, grows toan envious fever

561
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.730
Of pale and bloodlessemulation:

562
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:57.430
And 'tis this fever thatkeeps Troy on foot,

563
00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:02.630
Not her own sinews. To enda tale of length,

564
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.400
Troy in our weakness stands,not in her strength.

565
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.570
Most wisely hath Ulysseshere discover'd

566
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:15.170
The fever whereof all ourpower is sick.

567
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.030
The nature of the sicknessfound, Ulysses,

568
00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:28.000
What is the remedy?

569
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.530
The great Achilles, whomopinion crowns

570
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.900
The sinew and the forehandof our host,

571
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.000
Having his ear full of hisairy fame,

572
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.630
Grows dainty of his worth,and in his tent

573
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.970
Lies mocking our designs:with him Patroclus

574
00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.570
Upon a lazy bed thelivelong day

575
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:50.930
Breaks scurril jests;

576
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.100
And with ridiculous andawkward action,

577
00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.900
Which, slanderer, heimitation calls,

578
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:04.030
He pageants us. Sometime,great Agamemnon,

579
00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:07.330
Thy topless deputation heputs on,

580
00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.630
And, like a strutting player,

581
00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:10.970
whose conceit Liesin his hamstring,

582
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.230
and doth think it rich

583
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:13.770
To hear the woodendialogue and sound

584
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.670
'Twixt his stretch'd footingand the scaffoldage,--

585
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:18.900
Such to-be-pitied ando'er-wrested seeming

586
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.430
He acts thy greatness in:and when he speaks,

587
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.330
'Tis like a chime a-mending;with terms unsquared,

588
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.130
Which, from the tongue ofroaring Typhon dropp'd

589
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.600
Would seem hyperboles. Atthis fusty stuff

590
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.600
The large Achilles, on hispress'd bed lolling,

591
00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.330
From his deep chest laughsout a loud applause;

592
00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:43.130
Cries 'Excellent! 'tisAgamemnon right.

593
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.370
Now play me Nestor; hem,and stroke thy beard,

594
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.700
As he being drest to someoration.'

595
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.070
That's done, as near asthe extremest ends

596
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.200
Of parallels, as like asVulcan and his wife:

597
00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.200
Yet god Achilles stillcries 'Excellent!

598
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.200
'Tis Nestor right. Nowplay him me, Patroclus,

599
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.570
Arming to answer in anight alarm.'

600
00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.400
And then, forsooth, thefaint defects of age

601
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.530
Must be the scene ofmirth; to cough and spit,

602
00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.930
And, with a palsy-fumblingon his gorget,

603
00:34:12.930 --> 00:34:17.200
Shake in and out therivet: and at this sport

604
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.530
Sir Valour dies; cries 'O,enough, Patroclus;

605
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.370
Or give me ribs of steel!I shall split all

606
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:27.530
In pleasure of my spleen.'And in this fashion,

607
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.600
All our abilities, gifts,natures, shapes,

608
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.370
Severals and generals ofgrace exact,

609
00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:35.400
Achievements, plots,orders, preventions,

610
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.370
Excitements to the field,or speech for truce,

611
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:40.730
Success or loss,what is or is not,

612
00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.670
serves As stuff for thesetwo to make paradoxes.

613
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.830
And in the imitation ofthese twain--

614
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.100
Who, as Ulysses says,opinion crowns

615
00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.070
With an imperialvoice--many are infect.

616
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:52.400
Ajax is grown self-will'd,and bears his head

617
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.230
In such a rein, in full asproud a place

618
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.870
As broad Achilles; keepshis tent like him;

619
00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:01.200
Makes factious feasts;rails on our state of war,

620
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.770
Bold as an oracle, andsets Thersites,

621
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:07.600
A slave whose gall coinsslanders like a mint,

622
00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.970
To match us in comparisonswith dirt,

623
00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:13.130
To weaken and discreditour exposure,

624
00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:15.200
How rank soever rounded inwith danger.

625
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.400
They tax our policy, andcall it cowardice,

626
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.530
Count wisdom as no memberof the war,

627
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.470
Forestall prescience, andesteem no act

628
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.670
But that of hand: thestill and mental parts,

629
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.430
That do contrive how manyhands shall strike,

630
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.500
When fitness calls themon, and know by measure

631
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.170
Of their observant toilthe enemies' weight,--

632
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.600
Why, this hath not afinger's dignity:

633
00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.930
They call this bed-work,mappery, closet-war;

634
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.000
So that the ram thatbatters down the wall,

635
00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.270
For the great swing andrudeness of his poise,

636
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:45.870
They place before his handthat made the engine,

637
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:48.000
Or those that with thefineness of their souls

638
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.370
By reason guide hisexecution.

639
00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.730
Let this be granted, andAchilles' horse

640
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.400
Makes many Thetis' sons.

641
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.300
(♪trumpet)

642
00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:02.000
What trumpet? look,Menelaus.

643
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.100
From Troy.

644
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:21.330
Is this great Agamemnon'stent, I pray you?

645
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.270
Even this.

646
00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:24.430
May one, that is a heraldand a prince,

647
00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:26.800
Do a fair message to hiskingly eye?

648
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.230
With surety stronger thanAchilles' arm

649
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.230
'Fore all the Greekishheads, which with one voice

650
00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:34.070
Call Agamemnon head andgeneral.

651
00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:37.530
Fair leave and large security.

652
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.370
How may A stranger tothose most imperial looks

653
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.470
Know them from eyes ofother mortals?

654
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.270
How!

655
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.270
Ay;

656
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.670
I ask, that I might wakenreverence,

657
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.900
And bid the cheek be readywith a blush

658
00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.700
Modest as morning when shecoldly eyes

659
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.370
The youthful Phoebus:

660
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.170
Which is that god inoffice, guiding men?

661
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:02.570
Which is the high andmighty Agamemnon?

662
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.730
This Trojan scorns us; orthe men of Troy

663
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.100
Are ceremonious courtiers.

664
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.730
Courtiers as free, asdebonair, unarm'd,

665
00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.470
As bending angels; that'stheir fame in peace:

666
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.330
But when they would seemsoldiers, they have galls,

667
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.130
Good arms, strongjoints, true swords;

668
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:20.600
and, great Jove's accord,

669
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.670
Nothing so full of heart.But peace, AEneas,

670
00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:28.000
Peace, Trojan; lay thyfinger on thy lips!

671
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.130
The worthiness of praisedistains his worth,

672
00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.730
If that the praised himselfbring the praise forth:

673
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.130
But what the repiningenemy commends,

674
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:40.600
That breath fame blows; thatpraise, sole pure, transcends.

675
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.270
Sir, you of Troy, call youyourself AEneas?

676
00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.430
Ay, Greek, that is myname.

677
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:48.330
What's your affair I prayyou?

678
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:51.100
Sir, pardon; 'tis forAgamemnon's ears.

679
00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.970
He hears naught privatelythat comes from Troy.

680
00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.100
Nor I from Troy come notto whisper him:

681
00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.530
I bring a trumpet to arousehis senses,

682
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:01.830
To set his sense on theattentive bent,

683
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.070
And then to speak.

684
00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.000
Speak frankly as the wind;

685
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.030
It is not Agamemnon'ssleeping hour:

686
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.000
That thou shalt know.Trojan, he is awake,

687
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.400
He tells thee so himself.

688
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.330
Trumpet, blow loud,

689
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:20.500
Send thy brass voice throughall these lazy tents;

690
00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.300
And every Greek of mettle,let him know,

691
00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.370
What Troy means fairlyshall be spoke aloud.

692
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:32.470
(♪trumpet sounds)

693
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.870
We have, great Agamemnon,here in Troy

694
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:54.370
A prince call'd Hector,--Priamis his father,--

695
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.430
Who in this dull andlong-continued truce

696
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:00.630
Is rusty grown: he bade metake a trumpet,

697
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:06.470
And to this purpose speak.Kings, princes, lords!

698
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:08.600
If there be one among thefair'st of Greece

699
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.700
That holds his honourhigher than his ease,

700
00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:15.100
That seeks his praise morethan he fears his peril,

701
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.330
That knows his valour, andknows not his fear,

702
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.230
That loves his mistressmore than in confession,

703
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.100
With truant vows to herown lips he loves,

704
00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.930
And dare avow her beautyand her worth

705
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:31.470
In other arms than hers,--tohim this challenge.

706
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.330
Hector, in view of Trojansand of Greeks,

707
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:37.600
Shall make it good, or dohis best to do it,

708
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.900
He hath a lady, wiser,fairer, truer,

709
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.900
Than ever Greek didcompass in his arms,

710
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.130
And will to-morrow withhis trumpet call

711
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.300
Midway between your tentsand walls of Troy,

712
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.630
To rouse a Grecian that istrue in love:

713
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:59.070
If any come, Hector shallhonour him;

714
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:04.370
If none, he'll say in Troywhen he retires,

715
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:08.430
The Grecian dames aresunburnt and not worth

716
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:13.630
The splinter of a lance.Even so much.

717
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.330
This shall be told ourlovers, Lord AEneas;

718
00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.830
If none of them have soulin such a kind,

719
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.530
We left them all at home:but we are soldiers;

720
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.070
And may that soldier amere recreant prove,

721
00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:27.330
That means not, hath not,or is not in love!

722
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.900
If then one is, or hath,or means to be,

723
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.470
That one meets Hector; ifnone else, I am he.

724
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.170
Tell him of Nestor, onethat was a man

725
00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:42.330
When Hector's grandsiresuck'd: he is old now;

726
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.100
But if there be not in ourGrecian host

727
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.270
One noble man that hathone spark of fire,

728
00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:50.530
To answer for his love,tell him from me

729
00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.600
I'll hide my silver beardin a gold beaver

730
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.970
And in my vantbrace putthis wither'd brawn,

731
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:57.700
And meeting him will tellhim that my lady

732
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.200
Was fairer than hisgrandam and as chaste

733
00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:05.100
As may be in the world:his youth in flood,

734
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:10.070
I'll prove this truth withmy three drops of blood.

735
00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:14.000
Now heavens forbid suchscarcity of youth!

736
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.870
Amen.

737
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:18.200
Fair Lord AEneas, let metouch your hand;

738
00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.670
To our pavilion shall Ilead you, sir.

739
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.430
Achilles shall have wordof this intent;

740
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:25.930
So shall each lord ofGreece, from tent to tent:

741
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.370
Yourself shall feast withus before you go

742
00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:33.170
And find the welcome of anoble foe.

743
00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:42.600
Nestor!

744
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.770
What says Ulysses?

745
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:49.530
I have a young conceptionin my brain;

746
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:52.430
Be you my time to bring itto some shape.

747
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:54.400
What is't?

748
00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.400
This 'tis:

749
00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:03.770
Blunt wedges rive hardknots: the seeded pride

750
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.170
That hath to this maturityblown up

751
00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:09.400
In rank Achilles must ornow be cropp'd,

752
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.400
Or, shedding, breed anursery of like evil,

753
00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.730
To overbulk us all.

754
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.130
Well, and how?

755
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:20.900
This challenge that thegallant Hector sends,

756
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.030
However it is spread ingeneral name,

757
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:28.070
Relates in purpose only toAchilles.

758
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.230
The purpose is perspicuouseven as substance,

759
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:34.070
Whose grossness littlecharacters sum up:

760
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.430
And, in the publication,make no strain,

761
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:39.130
But that Achilles, werehis brain as barren

762
00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.230
As banks of Libya,--though,Apollo knows, 'Tis dry enough,

763
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.930
--will, with greatspeed of judgment,

764
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.570
Ay, with celerity, findHector's purpose

765
00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:48.370
Pointing on him.

766
00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:50.570
And wake him to theanswer, think you?

767
00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.030
Yes, 'tis most meet: whommay you else oppose,

768
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.630
That can from Hector bringhis honour off,

769
00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.270
If not Achilles? Though'tbe a sportful combat,

770
00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:00.100
Yet in the trial muchopinion dwells;

771
00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:02.300
For here the Trojans tasteour dear'st repute

772
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.870
With their finest palate:and trust to me, Ulysses,

773
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:09.270
Our imputation shall beoddly poised

774
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.000
In this wild action; forthe success,

775
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.930
Although particular, shallgive a scantling

776
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.270
Of good or bad unto thegeneral;

777
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:18.100
And in such indexes,although small pricks

778
00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.530
To their subsequentvolumes, there is seen

779
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.230
The baby figure of thegiant mass

780
00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:27.500
Of things to come atlarge. It is supposed

781
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.670
He that meets Hectorissues from our choice

782
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:32.630
And choice, being mutualact of all our souls,

783
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.770
Makes merit her election,and doth boil,

784
00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:37.400
As 'twere from us all, aman distill'd

785
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.670
Out of our virtues; whomiscarrying,

786
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.630
What heart receives fromhence the conquering part,

787
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.470
To steel a strong opinionto themselves?

788
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.230
Which entertain'd, limbsare his instruments,

789
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:54.370
In no less working thanare swords and bows

790
00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:57.430
Directive by the limbs.

791
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.200
Give pardon to my speech:

792
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.170
Therefore 'tis meetAchilles meet not Hector.

793
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.500
Let us, like merchants,show our foulest wares,

794
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.000
And think, perchance,they'll sell; if not,

795
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.430
The lustre of the betteryet to show,

796
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:17.370
Shall show the better. Byshowing the worst first.

797
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:18.530
Do not consent

798
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.400
That ever Hector andAchilles meet;

799
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.830
For both our honour andour shame in this

800
00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:27.670
Are dogg'd with twostrange followers.

801
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:30.000
I see them not with my oldeyes: what are they?

802
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.570
What glory our Achillesshares from Hector,

803
00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.200
Were he not proud, we allshould share with him:

804
00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.370
But he already is tooinsolent;

805
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.470
And we were better parchin Afric sun

806
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:43.100
Than in the pride and saltscorn of his eyes,

807
00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.700
Should he 'scape Hectorfair:

808
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.530
No no, make a lottery;

809
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:51.470
And, by device, letblockish Ajax draw

810
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:53.630
The sort to fight withHector:

811
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.400
Give him allowance for thebetter man;

812
00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:58.000
For that will physic thegreat Myrmidon

813
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.670
Who broils in loudapplause, and make him fall

814
00:45:00.670 --> 00:45:04.300
His crest that prouderthan blue Iris bends.

815
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:08.130
If the dull brainless Ajaxcome safe off,

816
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.300
We'll dress him up invoices: if he fail,

817
00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.830
Yet go we under ouropinion still

818
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:18.100
That we have better men.But, hit or miss,

819
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.200
Our project's life thisshape of sense assumes:

820
00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.200
Ajax employ'd plucks downAchilles' plumes.

821
00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.930
Now Ulysses, I begin to relishthy advice;

822
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.630
And I will give a taste ofit forthwith To Agamemnon:

823
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.070
go we to him straight.

824
00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.130
Two curs shall tame eachother: pride alone

825
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:42.030
Must tarre the mastiffson, as 'twere their bone.

826
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:48.330
Agamemnon, how if he had boils?full, all over, generally?

827
00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.100
Thersites!

828
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.230
And those boils did run? say so:did not the general run then?

829
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:55.400
were not that a botchy core?

830
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.570
Dog!

831
00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.430
Then would come some matterfrom him; I see none now.

832
00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:01.300
Thou bitch-wolf's son,canst thou not hear?

833
00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.700
Feel, then.

834
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.200
The plague of Greece upon thee,thou mongrel beef-witted lord!

835
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.470
Speak then, thouvinewedst leaven, speak:

836
00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:09.830
I will beat theeinto handsomeness.

837
00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:12.430
I shall sooner rail theeinto wit and holiness:

838
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.170
but, I think, thy horsewill sooner con an oration

839
00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:17.000
than thou learn a prayer withoutbook. Thou canst strike,

840
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.300
canst thou? a red murraino' thy jade's tricks!

841
00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.930
Toadstool, learn me theproclamation.

842
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.770
Dost thou think I have nosense, thou strikest me thus?

843
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:29.170
The proclamation!

844
00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.370
Thou art proclaimed afool, I think.

845
00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:35.370
Do not, porpentine, donot: my fingers itch.

846
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.630
I would thou didst itchfrom head to foot

847
00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:38.970
and I had thescratching of thee;

848
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.730
I would make thee theloathsomest scab in Greece.

849
00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.370
I say, the proclamation!

850
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.170
Thou grumblest and railestevery hour on Achilles,

851
00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:47.430
and thou art as full of envyat his greatness as Cerberus

852
00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:48.900
is at Proserpine's beauty,

853
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.600
Mistress Thersites!

854
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:52.630
Thou shouldest strike him.

855
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:53.930
He would pun thee intoshivers with his fist,

856
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.000
as a sailor breaks a biscuit.

857
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.370
You whoreson cur!

858
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:59.370
Do, do.

859
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:00.830
Thou stool for a witch!

860
00:47:00.830 --> 00:47:02.630
Ay, do, do; thousodden-witted lord!

861
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:05.530
thou hast no more brain thanI have in mine elbows;

862
00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:07.270
thou art here butto thrash Trojans;

863
00:47:07.270 --> 00:47:09.100
and thou art bought and soldamong those of any wit,

864
00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:10.830
like a barbarian slave.

865
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.970
thou thing of no bowels, thou!

866
00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:14.700
You dog!

867
00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.300
You scurvy lord!

868
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.000
You cur!

869
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.230
Why, how now, Ajax!wherefore do you thus?

870
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:24.770
How now, Thersites!what's the matter, man?

871
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:26.730
You see him there, do you?

872
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:27.730
Ay; what's the matter?

873
00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:29.230
Nay, look upon him.

874
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:30.670
So I do: what's thematter?

875
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.030
Nay, but regard him well.

876
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.830
'Well!' why, I do so.

877
00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:35.500
But yet you looknot well upon him;

878
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.970
for whosoever you takehim to be, he is Ajax.

879
00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:39.170
I know that, fool.

880
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:40.970
Ay, but that fool knowsnot himself.

881
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.430
Therefore I beat thee.

882
00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:45.070
Lo, lo, lo, lo, whatmodicums of wit he utters!

883
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.870
his evasions haveears thus long.

884
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.100
I have bobbed his brain morethan he has beat my bones:

885
00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.130
This lord, Ajax, whowears his wit in his belly

886
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:54.170
and his guts in his head, I'lltell you what I say of him.

887
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.800
What?

888
00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800
I say, this Ajax--

889
00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.730
Nay, good Ajax.

890
00:47:56.730 --> 00:47:57.770
Has not so much wit--

891
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:59.000
Nay, I must hold you.

892
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.300
As will stop the eyeof Helen's needle,

893
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.130
for whom hecomes to fight.

894
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:04.170
Will thou set thy wit to afool's?

895
00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:06.170
No, I warrant you; for afools will shame it.

896
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:09.330
Good words, Thersites.

897
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.600
What's the quarrel?

898
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.400
I bade the vile owl go learn methe tenor of the proclamation,

899
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.070
and he rails upon me.

900
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.370
I serve thee not.

901
00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:18.570
Well, go to, go to.

902
00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:20.470
I serve here voluntarily.

903
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:21.930
Your last servicewas sufferance,

904
00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.330
'twas not voluntary: noman is beaten voluntary:

905
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:29.070
Ajax was here the voluntary,and you as under an impress.

906
00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.870
E'en so; a great deal of yourwit, too, lies in your sinews,

907
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:35.100
or else there be liars.Hector have a great catch,

908
00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.030
if he knock out eitherof your brains:

909
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:40.070
a' were as good crack afusty nut with no kernel.

910
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.600
What, with me too,Thersites?

911
00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.370
There's Ulysses and oldNestor, whose wit was mouldy

912
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:46.170
ere your grandsires hadnails on their toes,

913
00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.830
yoke you like draught-oxen andmake you plough up the wars.

914
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:50.330
What, what?

915
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:51.800
Yes, good sooth:

916
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:53.530
I shall cut out yourtongue.

917
00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:56.400
'Tis no matter! I shall speakas much as thou afterwards.

918
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.200
No more words, Thersites;peace!

919
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.870
I will hold my peace

920
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.570
when Achilles' brachbids me, shall I?

921
00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.670
There's for you, Patroclus.

922
00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:09.330
I will see you hanged,like clotpoles,

923
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.900
ere I come any moreto your tents:

924
00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.600
I will keep wherethere is wit stirring

925
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:18.170
and leave thefaction of fools.

926
00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:22.400
A good riddance.

927
00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:27.670
Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'dthrough all our host:

928
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.570
That Hector, by the fifthhour of the sun,

929
00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:32.870
Will with a trumpet callsome knight to arms

930
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:34.570
That hath a stomach;

931
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:35.800
and such a one thatdare Maintain

932
00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.230
--I know not what:'tis trash. Farewell.

933
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:39.430
Farewell. Who shall answerhim?

934
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:44.730
I know not: 'tis put tolottery; otherwise

935
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:46.130
He knew his man.

936
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:52.500
O, meaning you. I will golearn more of it.

937
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.200


938
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:23.030
After so many hours,lives, speeches spent,

939
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:28.030
Thus once again saysNestor from the Greeks:

940
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:31.700
'Deliver Helen, and alldamage else--

941
00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:36.100
As honour, loss of time,travail, expense,

942
00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:41.170
Wounds, friends, and whatelse dear that is consumed

943
00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:46.700
In hot digestion of thiscormorant war--

944
00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:57.930
Shall be struck off.'Hector, what say you to't?

945
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:04.300
Though no man lesser fearsthe Greeks than I

946
00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.630
As far as toucheth myparticular,

947
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:10.270
Yet, dread Priam,

948
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:13.470
There is no lady of moresofter bowels,

949
00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:17.130
More spongy to suck in thesense of fear,

950
00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.100
More ready to cry out 'Whoknows what follows?'

951
00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:26.000
Than Hector is: the woundof peace is surety,

952
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.700
Surety secure; but modestdoubt is call'd

953
00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:31.970
The beacon of the wise,the tent that searches

954
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:38.300
To the bottom of theworst. Let Helen go:

955
00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.930
Since the first sword wasdrawn about this question,

956
00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:43.930
Every tithe soul, 'mongstmany thousand dismes,

957
00:51:43.930 --> 00:51:46.530
Hath been as dear asHelen; I mean, of ours:

958
00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.270
If we have lost so manytenths of ours,

959
00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.130
To guard a thing not oursnor worth to us,

960
00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:53.630
Had it our name, the valueof one ten,

961
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:55.970
What merit's in thatreason which denies

962
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:57.300
The yielding of her up?

963
00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.630
Fie, fie, my brother!

964
00:51:58.630 --> 00:52:01.000
Weigh you the worth andhonour of a king

965
00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.330
So great as our dreadfather in a scale

966
00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:08.370
Of common ounces? will youwith counters sum

967
00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:10.830
The past proportion of hisinfinite?

968
00:52:10.830 --> 00:52:14.100
And buckle in a scale mostfathomless

969
00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:16.500
With spans and inches sodiminutive

970
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.830
As fears and reasons?

971
00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:25.530
If we talk of reason, Let'sshut our gates and sleep:

972
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:26.870
manhood and honour Shouldhave hare-hearts,

973
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:27.770
would they but fattheir thoughts

974
00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.000
With this cramm'dreason:

975
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.400
reason and respect Make liverspale and lustihood deject.

976
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:36.130
Brother, she is not worth whatshe doth cost The keeping.

977
00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:37.770
What is aught, but as 'tisvalued?

978
00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:41.000
But value dwells not inparticular will;

979
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.170
It holds his estimate anddignity

980
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.730
As well wherein 'tisprecious of itself

981
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:46.670
As in the prizer: 'tis madidolatry

982
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:49.170
To make the servicegreater than the god

983
00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:51.300
And the will dotes that isattributive

984
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:53.330
To what infectiouslyitself affects,

985
00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:57.900
Without some image of theaffected merit.

986
00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:11.400
I take to-day a wife, andmy election

987
00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.930
Is led on in the conductof my will;

988
00:53:13.930 --> 00:53:16.170
My will enkindled by mineeyes and ears,

989
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:19.800
Two traded pilots 'twixtthe dangerous shores

990
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:25.700
Of will and judgment: howmay I avoid,

991
00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:28.970
Although my will distastewhat it elected,

992
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:35.100
The wife I chose? therecan be no evasion

993
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:39.570
To blench from this and tostand firm by honour:

994
00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:41.600
We turn not back the silksupon the merchant,

995
00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:47.300
When we have soil'd them,nor the remainder viands

996
00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.830
We do not throw inunrespective sieve,

997
00:53:48.830 --> 00:53:55.470
Because we now are full.It was thought meet

998
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:58.870
Paris should do somevengeance on the Greeks:

999
00:53:58.870 --> 00:54:00.700
Your breath of fullconsent bellied his sails;

1000
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.870
The seas and winds, oldwranglers, took a truce

1001
00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:05.670
And did him service: hetouch'd the ports desired,

1002
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:08.500
And for an old aunt whomthe Greeks held captive,

1003
00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:14.030
He brought a Grecian queen,whose youth and freshness

1004
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:18.100
Wrinkles Apollo's, andmakes stale the morning.

1005
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:26.000
Why keep we her? theGrecians keep our aunt:

1006
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.700
Is she worth keeping? why,she is a pearl,

1007
00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:34.830
Whose price hath launch'dabove a thousand ships,

1008
00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:39.500
And turn'd crown'd kingsto merchants.

1009
00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.400
If you'll avouch 'twaswisdom Paris went--

1010
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:47.170
As you must needs, for youall cried 'Go, go,'--

1011
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:50.000
If you'll confess hebrought home worthy prize--

1012
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.230
As you must needs, for youall clapp'd your hands

1013
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:59.000
And cried 'Inestimable!'--whydo you now

1014
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:02.270
The issue of your properwisdoms rate,

1015
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.900
And do a deed that fortunenever did,

1016
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.470
Beggar the estimationwhich you prized

1017
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:14.000
Richer than sea and land?O, theft most base,

1018
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.130
That we have stol'n whatwe do fear to keep!

1019
00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.530
Cry, Trojans, cry!

1020
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:20.170
What noise? what shriek isthis?

1021
00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:22.400
Cry, Trojans!

1022
00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.670
Cry, Trojans, cry! lend meten thousand eyes,

1023
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:26.130
And I will fill them withprophetic tears.

1024
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.170
Peace, sister, Peace!!

1025
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:30.030
Virgins and boys, mid-ageand wrinkled eld,

1026
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:33.000
Soft infancy, that nothingcanst but cry,

1027
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.130
Add to my clamours! let uspay betimes

1028
00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:39.800
A moiety of that mass ofmoan to come.

1029
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.830
Cry, Trojans, cry! practiseyour eyes with tears!

1030
00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:47.230
Troy must not be, norgoodly Ilion stand;

1031
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.530
Our firebrand brother,Paris, burns us all.

1032
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:54.700
Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helenand a woe:

1033
00:55:54.700 --> 00:56:01.800
Cry, cry! Troy burns, orelse let Helen go.

1034
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.030
Now, youthful Troilus, donot these high strains

1035
00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:09.570
Of divination in oursister work

1036
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:12.470
Some touches of remorse?or is your blood

1037
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:14.430
So madly hot that nodiscourse of reason,

1038
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:17.630
Nor fear of bad success ina bad cause,

1039
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:19.330
Can qualify the same?

1040
00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:21.770
Why, brother Hector,

1041
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:24.800
We may not think thejustness of each act

1042
00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:30.300
Such and no other thanevent doth form it,

1043
00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.700
Nor once deject thecourage of our minds,

1044
00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:36.430
Because Cassandra's mad:her brain-sick raptures

1045
00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.130
Cannot distaste thegoodness of a quarrel

1046
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:40.870
Which hath our severalhonours all engaged

1047
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:44.370
To make it gracious. Formy private part,

1048
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:47.670
I am no more touch'd thanall Priam's sons:

1049
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.530
And Jove forbid thereshould be done amongst us

1050
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:51.530
Such things as mightoffend the weakest spleen

1051
00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:53.200
To fight for and maintain!

1052
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.430
Else might the worldconvince of levity

1053
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:58.330
As well my undertakings asyour counsels:

1054
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.670
But I attest the gods,your full consent

1055
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:04.200
Gave wings to mypropension and cut off

1056
00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:07.500
All fears attending on sodire a project.

1057
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:11.870
For what, alas, can thesemy single arms?

1058
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:14.400
What Propugnation is inone man's valour,

1059
00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.070
To stand the push andenmity of those

1060
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:24.530
This quarrel would excite?Yet, I protest,

1061
00:57:24.530 --> 00:57:28.370
Were I alone to pass thedifficulties

1062
00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:32.330
And had as ample power asI have will,

1063
00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:35.330
Paris should ne'er retractwhat he hath done,

1064
00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.700
Nor faint in the pursuit.

1065
00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.930
Paris, you speakLike one besotted

1066
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.530
on your sweet delights:

1067
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:47.770
You have the honey still,but these the gall;

1068
00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:51.200
So to be valiant is nopraise at all.

1069
00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.370
Sir, I propose not merelyto myself

1070
00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:58.470
The pleasures such abeauty brings with it;

1071
00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:00.970
But I would have the soilof her fair rape

1072
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:04.600
Wiped off, in honourablekeeping her.

1073
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.730
What treason were it tothe ransack'd queen,

1074
00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:08.370
Disgrace to your greatworths and shame to me,

1075
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:09.830
Now to deliver herpossession up

1076
00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:13.130
On terms of base compulsion!

1077
00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:15.370
Can it be That so degeneratea strain as this

1078
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:21.130
Should once set footing inyour generous bosoms?

1079
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.570
There's not the meanestspirit on our party

1080
00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:25.970
Without a heart to dare orsword to draw

1081
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:29.500
When Helen is defended,nor none so noble

1082
00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.600
Whose life were illbestow'd or death unfamed

1083
00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:36.400
Where Helen is thesubject; then, I say,

1084
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:41.730
Well may we fight for herwhom, we know well,

1085
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:47.470
The world's large spacescannot parallel.

1086
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:50.630
Paris and Troilus, youhave both said well,

1087
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:52.670
And on the cause andquestion now in hand

1088
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:54.830
Have glozed, but superficially:

1089
00:58:54.830 --> 00:58:56.900
not much Unlike young men,whom Aristotle thought

1090
00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:01.130
Unfit to hear moralphilosophy:

1091
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.170
The reasons you allege domore conduce

1092
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:05.430
To the hot passion ofdistemper'd blood

1093
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:06.770
Than to make up a freedetermination

1094
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:12.470
'Twixt right and wrong,for pleasure and revenge

1095
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:14.830
Have ears more deaf thanadders to the voice

1096
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:19.670
Of any true decision.Nature craves

1097
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:26.930
All dues be render'd totheir owners: now,

1098
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:28.170
What nearer debt in allhumanity

1099
00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:31.800
Than wife is to thehusband? If this law

1100
00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:35.370
Of nature be corruptedthrough affection,

1101
00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:37.200
And that great minds, ofpartial indulgence

1102
00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.200
To their benumbed wills,resist the same,

1103
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.470
There is a law in eachwell-order'd nation

1104
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:44.330
To curb those ragingappetites which are

1105
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:48.400
Most disobedient andrefractory.

1106
00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.430
If Helen then be wife toSparta's king,

1107
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:54.070
As it is known she is,these moral laws

1108
00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:56.130
Of nature and of nationsspeak aloud

1109
00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:58.430
To have her back return'd:thus to persist

1110
00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:00.170
In doing wrong extenuatesnot wrong,

1111
01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:03.130
But makes it much more heavy.

1112
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:11.730
Hector's opinion Isthis in way of truth;

1113
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:23.700
yet ne'ertheless, My spritelybrethren, I propend to you

1114
01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.970
In resolution to keepHelen still,

1115
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:30.370
For 'tis a cause that hathno mean dependance

1116
01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.670
Upon our joint and severaldignities.

1117
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:36.830
Why, there you touch'd thelife of our design:

1118
01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:39.770
Were it not glory that wemore affected

1119
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:42.270
Than the performance ofour heaving spleens,

1120
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:43.700
I would not wish a drop ofTrojan blood

1121
01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.400
Spent more in her defence.But, worthy Hector,

1122
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.100
She is a theme of honourand renown,

1123
01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.770
A spur to valiant andmagnanimous deeds,

1124
01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.800
Whose present courage maybeat down our foes,

1125
01:00:56.800 --> 01:01:00.530
And fame in time to comecanonize us;

1126
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:02.470
For, I presume, braveHector would not lose

1127
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:03.670
So rich advantage of apromised glory

1128
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:05.300
As smiles upon theforehead of this action

1129
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.800
For the wide world'srevenue.

1130
01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:08.700
I am yours,

1131
01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.130
You valiant offspring ofgreat Priamus.

1132
01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:16.470
I have a roistingchallenge sent amongst

1133
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:17.930
The dun and factiousnobles of the Greeks

1134
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:20.070
Will strike amazement totheir drowsy spirits:

1135
01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:23.170
I was advertised theirgreat general slept,

1136
01:01:23.170 --> 01:01:26.770
Whilst emulation in thearmy crept:

1137
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.530
This, I presume, will wakehim.

1138
01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:41.530
How now, Thersites! what lostin the labyrinth of thy fury!

1139
01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:44.770
Shall the elephantAjax carry it thus?

1140
01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:49.870
He beats me, and I rail athim: O, worthy satisfaction!

1141
01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.670
would it were otherwise;that I could beat him,

1142
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:56.830
whilst he railed at me.'Sfoot, I'll learn to conjure

1143
01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:59.570
and raise devils, butI'll see some issue

1144
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:04.970
of my spiteful execrations.Then there's Achilles,

1145
01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:08.300
a rare enginer! IfTroy be not taken

1146
01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:10.100
till these two undermine it,

1147
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.970
the walls will stand tillthey fall of themselves.

1148
01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:16.630
O thou great thunder-darterof Olympus,

1149
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:21.000
forget that thou art Jove, theking of gods and, Mercury,

1150
01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.970
lose all the serpentinecraft of thy caduceus,

1151
01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:26.670
if ye take not that little,little less than little wit

1152
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:27.900
from them that they have!

1153
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.700
which short-armedignorance itself

1154
01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:31.770
knows is so abundant scarce,

1155
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:35.130
it will not in circumventiondeliver a fly from a spider,

1156
01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.930
without drawingtheir massy irons

1157
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.670
and cutting the web.

1158
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.400
After this, the vengeanceon the whole camp!

1159
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.130
or rather, theneopolitan bone-ache!

1160
01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:46.770
for that, methinks, isthe curse dependent

1161
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.300
on those that warfor a placket.

1162
01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:54.200
I have said my prayersand devil Envy say Amen.

1163
01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.770
What ho! my Lord Achilles!

1164
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:59.700
Who's there? Thersites! GoodThersites, come in and rail.

1165
01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.370
If I could have remembereda gilt counterfeit,

1166
01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:04.600
thou wouldst not have slippedout of my contemplation:

1167
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.970
but it is no matter;thyself upon thyself!

1168
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:10.770
The common curse of mankind,folly and ignorance,

1169
01:03:10.770 --> 01:03:12.130
be thine in great revenue!

1170
01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:15.800
Let thy blood be thydirection till thy death!

1171
01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.770
Where's Achilles?

1172
01:03:16.770 --> 01:03:18.400
What, art thou devout?wast thou in prayer?

1173
01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.630
Ay: the heavens hear me!

1174
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:20.700
Amen.

1175
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.800
Who's there?

1176
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.170
Thersites, my lord.

1177
01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:29.430
Where, where? Art thou come?why, my cheese, my digestion,

1178
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:33.830
why hast thou not served thyselfin to my table so many meals?

1179
01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:35.770
Come, what's Agamemnon?

1180
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.970
Thy commander, Achilles.Then tell me, Patroclus,

1181
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:39.230
what's Achilles?

1182
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:41.030
Thy lord, Thersites: thentell me, I pray thee,

1183
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.470
what's Thersites?

1184
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.300
Thy knower, Patroclus:then tell me, Patroclus,

1185
01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.330
what art thou?

1186
01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:46.970
Thou mayst tell thatknowest.

1187
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:48.300
O, tell, tell.

1188
01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:51.330
I'll decline the whole question.Agamemnon commands Achilles;

1189
01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:54.270
Achilles is my lord; Iam Patroclus' knower,

1190
01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:55.470
and Patroclus is a fool.

1191
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.330
You rascal!

1192
01:03:56.330 --> 01:03:57.870
Peace, fool! I have notdone.

1193
01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:00.600
He is a privileged man.Proceed, Thersites.

1194
01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:02.600
Agamemnon is a fool;Achilles is a fool;

1195
01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:06.600
Thersites is a fool, and, asaforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.

1196
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.030
Derive this; come.

1197
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:09.830
Agamemnon is a fool tooffer to command Achilles;

1198
01:04:09.830 --> 01:04:11.930
Achilles is a fool to becommanded of Agamemnon;

1199
01:04:11.930 --> 01:04:14.500
Thersites is a fool toserve such a fool,

1200
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.900
and Patroclus isa fool positive.

1201
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.070
Why am I a fool?

1202
01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:22.700
Make that demand of the creater.It suffices me thou art.

1203
01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.530
Look you, who comes here?

1204
01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.830
Patroclus, I'll speak withnobody.

1205
01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:32.470
Come in with me,Thersites.

1206
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:36.000
Here is such patchery, suchjuggling and such knavery!

1207
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.900
all the argument is a whore anda cuckold;

1208
01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:41.300
a good quarrel to drawemulous factions

1209
01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.230
and bleed to death upon.

1210
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:47.770
Now, and war andlechery confound all!

1211
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.930
Where is Achilles?

1212
01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:56.500
Within his tent; but illdisposed, my lord.

1213
01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.370
Let it be known to himthat we are here.

1214
01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:01.470
He shent our messengers;and we lay by

1215
01:05:01.470 --> 01:05:03.870
Our appertainments,visiting of him:

1216
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:05.800
Let him be told so; lestperchance he think

1217
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:08.200
We dare not move thequestion of our place,

1218
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.570
Or know not what we are.

1219
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:13.270
I shall say so to him.

1220
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:16.570
We saw him at the openingof his tent:

1221
01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:17.670
He is not sick.

1222
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:23.530
Yes, lion-sick, sick ofproud heart: you may call it

1223
01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:25.630
melancholy, if you will favourthe man; but, by my head,

1224
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:31.370
'tis pride: but why, why?let him show us the cause.

1225
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:36.900
A word, my lord.

1226
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.430
What moves Ajax thus tobay at him?

1227
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:43.070
Achilles hath inveigledhis fool from him.

1228
01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:44.230
Who, Thersites?

1229
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.000
He.

1230
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.800
Then will Ajax lack matter,if he have lost his argument.

1231
01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:50.730
No, you see, heis his argument

1232
01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:54.300
that has hisargument, Achilles.

1233
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:57.600
All the better; theirfraction is more our wish

1234
01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.070
than their faction:

1235
01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:03.700
but it was a strong composurea fool could disunite.

1236
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:08.030
The amity that wisdom knitsnot, folly may easily untie.

1237
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:10.270
Here comes Patroclus.

1238
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.700
No Achilles with him.

1239
01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:14.730
The elephant hath joints,but none for courtesy:

1240
01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:19.600
his legs are legs fornecessity, not for flexure.

1241
01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.970
Achilles bids me say, heis much sorry,

1242
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:24.100
If any thing more thanyour sport and pleasure

1243
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.900
Did move your greatnessand this noble state

1244
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.100
To call upon him; he hopesit is no other

1245
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.070
But for your health andyour digestion sake,

1246
01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:34.270
And after-dinner's breath.

1247
01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:35.300
Hear you, Patroclus:

1248
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.400
We are too well acquaintedwith these answers:

1249
01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:41.130
But his evasion, wing'dthus swift with scorn,

1250
01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:44.200
Cannot outfly ourapprehensions.

1251
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.930
Much attribute he hath,and much the reason

1252
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:50.100
Why we ascribe it to him;yet all his virtues,

1253
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.970
Not virtuously on his ownpart beheld,

1254
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:56.470
Do in our eyes begin tolose their gloss,

1255
01:06:56.470 --> 01:07:01.100
Yea, like fair fruit in anunwholesome dish,

1256
01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:03.700
Are like to rot untasted.Go and tell him,

1257
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.230
We come to speak with him;and you shall not sin,

1258
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.430
If you do say we think himover-proud

1259
01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:12.030
And under-honest, inself-assumption greater

1260
01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:13.500
Than in the note of judgment;

1261
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.400
and worthier than himself

1262
01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:19.100
Here tend the savagestrangeness he puts on,

1263
01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.730
Disguise the holy strengthof their command,

1264
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:23.530
And underwrite in anobserving kind

1265
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.800
His humorous predominance;yea, watch

1266
01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.500
His pettish lunes,his ebbs, his flows,

1267
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.370
as if The passage and wholecarriage of this action

1268
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:33.930
Rode on his tide. Go tellhim this, and add,

1269
01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:36.200
That if he overhold hisprice so much,

1270
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.170
We'll none of him; but lethim, like an engine

1271
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:41.930
Not portable, lie underthis report:

1272
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:46.470
'Bring action hither, thiscannot go to war:

1273
01:07:46.470 --> 01:07:48.430
A stirring dwarf we doallowance give

1274
01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.870
Before a sleeping giant.'Tell him so.

1275
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:56.730
I shall; and bring hisanswer presently.

1276
01:07:57.630 --> 01:08:00.270
In second voice we'll notbe satisfied;

1277
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:06.830
We come to speak with him.Ulysses, enter you.

1278
01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.770
What is he more thananother?

1279
01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:14.670
No more than what hethinks he is.

1280
01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:15.870
Is he so much?

1281
01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:18.430
Do you not think he thinkshimself a better man than I am?

1282
01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:19.430
No question.

1283
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:21.370
Will you subscribe histhought, and say he is?

1284
01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:24.230
No, noble Ajax; you areas strong, as valiant,

1285
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:28.530
as wise, no less noble,much more gentle,

1286
01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:31.030
and altogether more tractable.

1287
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:35.530
Why should a man be proud?How doth pride grow?

1288
01:08:35.530 --> 01:08:38.530
I know not what pride is.

1289
01:08:38.530 --> 01:08:40.430
Your mind is the fairer, Ajax,

1290
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:42.400
and your virtues the clearer.

1291
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.870
He that is proudeats up himself:

1292
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:48.130
pride is his own glass, his owntrumpet, his own chronicle;

1293
01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:52.000
and whatever praisesitself but in the deed,

1294
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.030
devours the deed in the praise.

1295
01:08:54.030 --> 01:09:01.500
I do hate a proud man, as Ihate the engendering of toads.

1296
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:07.370
Yet he loves himself: is'tnot strange?

1297
01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:10.530
Achilles will not to thefield to-morrow.

1298
01:09:10.530 --> 01:09:11.470
What's his excuse?

1299
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:12.630
He doth rely on none,

1300
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:14.700
But carries on the streamof his dispose

1301
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:16.700
Without observance orrespect of any,

1302
01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.400
In will peculiar and inself-admission.

1303
01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.970
Why will he not upon ourfair request

1304
01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:24.970
Untent his person andshare the air with us?

1305
01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:27.030
Things small as nothing,for request's sake only,

1306
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:30.770
He makes important: possess'dhe is with greatness,

1307
01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:32.970
And speaks not to himselfbut with a pride

1308
01:09:32.970 --> 01:09:35.300
That quarrels atself-breath: imagined worth

1309
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.730
Holds in his blood suchswoln and hot discourse

1310
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:39.730
That 'twixt his mental andhis active parts

1311
01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:42.700
Kingdom'd Achilles incommotion rages

1312
01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.900
And batters down himself:what should I say?

1313
01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:48.030
He is so plaguy proud thatthe death-tokens of it

1314
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:50.230
Cry 'No recovery.'

1315
01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:55.370
Let Ajax go to him.

1316
01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:56.770
Dear lord, go you andgreet him in his tent:

1317
01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:59.300
'Tis said he holds you well,and will be led

1318
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:01.700
At your request a littlefrom himself.

1319
01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:06.500
O Agamemnon, let it not beso!

1320
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.930
We'll consecrate the stepsthat Ajax makes

1321
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:12.830
When they go from Achilles:shall the proud lord

1322
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:15.070
That bastes his arrogancewith his own seam

1323
01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:16.830
And never suffers matterof the world

1324
01:10:16.830 --> 01:10:19.370
Enter his thoughts, savesuch as do revolve

1325
01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:21.200
And ruminate himself,shall he be worshipp'd

1326
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.870
Of that we hold an idolmore than he?

1327
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.900
No, this thrice worthy andright valiant lord

1328
01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.870
Must not so stale hispalm, nobly acquired;

1329
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:32.770
Nor, by my will,assubjugate his merit,

1330
01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.770
As amply titled asAchilles is,

1331
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:36.670
By going to Achilles:

1332
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.200
That were to enlard hisfat already pride

1333
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.530
And add more coals toCancer when he burns

1334
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:46.300
With entertaining greatHyperion.

1335
01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.300
This lord go to him!Jupiter forbid,

1336
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.030
And say in thunder'Achilles go to him.'

1337
01:10:51.030 --> 01:10:53.530
O, this is well; herubs the vein of him.

1338
01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:55.630
And how his silencedrinks up this applause!

1339
01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.500
If I go to him,with my armed fist

1340
01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.400
I'll pash him o'erthe face.

1341
01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:01.100
O, no, you shall not go.

1342
01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.830
An a' be proud with me,I'll pheeze his pride:

1343
01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:04.600
Let me go to him.

1344
01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:06.830
Not for the worth thathangs upon our quarrel.

1345
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.630
A paltry, insolent fellow!

1346
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.830
How he describes himself!

1347
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:12.370
Can he not be sociable?

1348
01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:14.670
The raven chidesblackness.

1349
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.100
I'll let his humoursblood.

1350
01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.400
He will be the physicianthat should be the patient.

1351
01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.800
An all men were o' mymind,--

1352
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:21.130
Wit would be out offashion.

1353
01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:23.670
A' should not bear it so,a' should eat swords first:

1354
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:25.500
shall pride carry it?

1355
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.400
An 'twould, you'ld carryhalf.

1356
01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.330
A' would have ten shares.

1357
01:11:29.330 --> 01:11:32.400
I will knead him; I'llmake him supple.

1358
01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.470
He's not yet through warm:force him with praises:

1359
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.270
pour in, pour in; hisambition is dry.

1360
01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:40.570
My lord, you feed too muchon this dislike.

1361
01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:42.830
Our noble general, do notdo so.

1362
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:45.230
You must prepare to fightwithout Achilles.

1363
01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:48.100
Why, 'tis this naming ofhim does him harm.

1364
01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:51.570
Here is a lord--but 'tisbefore his face;

1365
01:11:51.570 --> 01:11:52.930
I will be silent.

1366
01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:54.070
Wherefore should you so?

1367
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:56.130
He is not emulous, asAchilles is.

1368
01:11:56.130 --> 01:11:58.830
Know the whole world, heis as valiant.

1369
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:01.070
A whoreson dog, that shallpelter thus with us!

1370
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:04.700
Would he were a Trojan!

1371
01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.870
What a vice were it inAjax now,--

1372
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:08.170
If he were proud,--

1373
01:12:08.170 --> 01:12:09.330
Or covetous of praise,--

1374
01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:11.100
Ay, or surly borne,--

1375
01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:13.330
Or strange, orself-affected!

1376
01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:17.270
Thank the heavens, lord,thou art of sweet composure;

1377
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:19.900
Praise him that got thee,she that gave thee suck:

1378
01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:23.500
Famed be thy tutor, andthy parts of nature

1379
01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.470
Thrice famed, beyond allerudition:

1380
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:29.230
But he that disciplinedthy arms to fight,

1381
01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:31.970
Let Mars divide eternityin twain,

1382
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:34.570
And give him half: and,for thy vigour,

1383
01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:37.000
Bull-bearing Milo hisaddition yield

1384
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.630
To sinewy Ajax. I will notpraise thy wisdom,

1385
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:45.730
Which, like a bourn, apale, a shore, confines

1386
01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:51.170

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:30.330
Yea, what he shall receiveof us in duty

1559
01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:33.730
Gives us more palm inbeauty than we have,

1560
01:21:33.730 --> 01:21:38.600
Yea, overshines ourself.

1561
01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:45.130
Sweet, above thought Ilove thee.

1562
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:02.600
Have you seen my cousin?

1563
01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:04.430
No, Pandarus: I stalkabout her door,

1564
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:06.600
Like a strange soul uponthe Stygian banks

1565
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.900
Staying for waftage. O, bethou my Charon,

1566
01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:11.100
And give me swifttransportance to those fields

1567
01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.570
Where I may wallow in thelily-beds

1568
01:22:12.570 --> 01:22:15.730
Proposed for the deserver!O gentle Pandarus,

1569
01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.700
From Cupid's shoulderpluck his painted wings

1570
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.800
And fly with me toCressid!

1571
01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.170
I'll bring her straight.

1572
01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.130
I am giddy; expectationwhirls me round.

1573
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:35.400
The imaginary relish is sosweet

1574
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:41.730
That it enchants my sense:what will it be,

1575
01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:43.970
When that the waterypalate tastes indeed

1576
01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:51.900
Love's thrice repurednectar? death, I fear me,

1577
01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:56.570
Swooning destruction, orsome joy too fine,

1578
01:22:56.570 --> 01:23:00.300
Too subtle-potent, tunedtoo sharp in sweetness,

1579
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:05.230
For the capacity of myruder powers:

1580
01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:08.630
I fear it much; and I dofear besides,

1581
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:12.230
That I shall losedistinction in my joys;

1582
01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:15.570
As doth a battle, whenthey charge on heaps

1583
01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:17.530
The enemy flying.

1584
01:23:17.530 --> 01:23:21.100
She's making her ready,she'll come straight:

1585
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:24.230
you must be witty now.She does so blush,

1586
01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:27.130
and fetches her wind so short,

1587
01:23:27.130 --> 01:23:30.570
as if she were frayed witha sprite: I'll fetch her.

1588
01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:34.070
It is the prettiest villain:

1589
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:37.530
she fetches her breath asshort as a new-ta'en sparrow.

1590
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:40.330
Even such a passion dothembrace my bosom:

1591
01:23:40.330 --> 01:23:42.600
My heart beats thickerthan a feverous pulse;

1592
01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:46.170
And all my powers do theirbestowing lose,

1593
01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:48.270
Like vassalage at unawaresencountering

1594
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:51.870
The eye of majesty.

1595
01:23:51.870 --> 01:24:01.470
Come, come, what need youblush? shame's a baby.

1596
01:24:01.700 --> 01:24:06.200
Here she is now: swear theoaths now to her that

1597
01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.370
you have sworn to me.What, are you gone again?

1598
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:13.430
you must be watched ere yoube made tame, must you?

1599
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:16.400
Come your ways, come yourways; an you draw backward,

1600
01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:23.500
we'll put you i' the fills.Why do you not speak to her?

1601
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:33.600
Come, draw this curtain, andlet's see your picture.

1602
01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:36.170
Alas the day, how loath youare to offend daylight!

1603
01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:39.200
an 'twere dark,you'ld close sooner.

1604
01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:45.570
So, so; rub on, andkiss the mistress.

1605
01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:00.230
How now! a kiss in fee-farm!build there, carpenter;

1606
01:25:00.230 --> 01:25:03.370
the air is sweet.

1607
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:06.530
Nay, you shall fight yourhearts out ere I part you.

1608
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:10.500
The falcon as the tercel, forall the ducks i' the river:

1609
01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.330
go to, go to.

1610
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:17.100
You have bereft meof all words, lady.

1611
01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:20.300
Words pay no debts,give her deeds:

1612
01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:22.030
but she'll bereave youo' the deeds too,

1613
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:29.130
if she call your activity inquestion. What, billing again?

1614
01:25:29.130 --> 01:25:34.400
Come in, come in: I'll goget a fire.

1615
01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.770
Will you walk in, my lord?

1616
01:25:37.770 --> 01:25:39.730
O Cressida, how often haveI wished me thus!

1617
01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:46.200
Wished, my lord! The godsgrant,--O my lord!

1618
01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:55.330
What should they grant? whatmakes this pretty abruption?

1619
01:25:55.330 --> 01:25:57.730
What too curious dregespies my sweet lady

1620
01:25:57.730 --> 01:25:59.770
in the fountain of our love?

1621
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:02.670
More dregs than water, ifmy fears have eyes.

1622
01:26:02.670 --> 01:26:06.730
Fears make devils of cherubims;they never see truly.

1623
01:26:06.730 --> 01:26:10.330
Blind fear, that seeingreason leads, finds safer

1624
01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:14.870
footing than blind reasonstumbling without fear:

1625
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:17.300
to fear the worst oftcures the worse.

1626
01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.530
O, let my ladyapprehend no fear:

1627
01:26:20.530 --> 01:26:24.300
in all Cupid's pageant thereis presented no monster.

1628
01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.300
Nor nothing monstrousneither?

1629
01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:31.130
Nothing, but our undertakings;when we vow to weep seas,

1630
01:26:31.130 --> 01:26:35.530
live in fire, eatrocks, tame tigers;

1631
01:26:35.530 --> 01:26:37.870
thinking it harder for ourmistress to devise imposition

1632
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:42.500
enough than for us to undergoany difficulty imposed.

1633
01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:46.570
This is the monstruosityin love, lady,

1634
01:26:46.570 --> 01:26:52.130
that the will is infiniteand the execution confined,

1635
01:26:52.130 --> 01:27:02.200
that the desire is boundlessand the act a slave to limit.

1636
01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.930
They say all lovers swear moreperformance than they are able

1637
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:09.670
and yet reserve an abilitythat they never perform,

1638
01:27:09.670 --> 01:27:12.730
vowing more than theperfection of ten

1639
01:27:12.730 --> 01:27:16.970
and discharging less thanthe tenth part of one.

1640
01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.400
They that have the voice oflions and the act of hares,

1641
01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.200
are they not monsters?

1642
01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:31.530
Are there such?such are not we:

1643
01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:36.100
praise us as we are tasted,allow us as we prove;

1644
01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:39.800
our head shall go baretill merit crown it:

1645
01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.100
no perfection in reversion shallhave a praise in present:

1646
01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:48.200
we will not name desertbefore his birth,

1647
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:53.070
and, being born, hisaddition shall be humble.

1648
01:27:53.070 --> 01:27:58.230
Few words to fair faith:

1649
01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:03.570
Troilus shall be such to Cressidas what envy can say worst

1650
01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:07.930
shall be a mock for histruth, and what truth can

1651
01:28:07.930 --> 01:28:13.670
speak truest not truerthan Troilus.

1652
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:17.700
Will you walk in, my lord?

1653
01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:20.600
What, blushing still? haveyou not done talking yet?

1654
01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.900
Well, uncle, what folly Icommit, I dedicate to you.

1655
01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:25.930
I thank you for that: ifmy lord get a boy of you,

1656
01:28:25.930 --> 01:28:29.930
you'll give him me.Be true to my lord:

1657
01:28:29.930 --> 01:28:32.700
if he flinch, chide me for it.

1658
01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.230
You know now your hostages;

1659
01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:36.900
your uncle's wordand my firm faith.

1660
01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:39.630
Nay, I'll give my word forher too: our kindred,

1661
01:28:39.630 --> 01:28:42.770
though they be longere they are wooed,

1662
01:28:42.770 --> 01:28:44.830
they are constant being won:they are burs, I can tell you;

1663
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:47.900
they'll stick where theyare thrown.

1664
01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:53.570
Boldness comes to me now,and brings me heart.

1665
01:28:55.970 --> 01:29:03.900
Prince Troilus, I haveloved you night and day

1666
01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.470
For many weary months.

1667
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:08.200
Why was my Cressid then sohard to win?

1668
01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.700
Hard to seem won: but Iwas won, my lord,

1669
01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:18.600
With the first glance thatever--pardon me--

1670
01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.470
If I confess much, youwill play the tyrant.

1671
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:21.700
No.

1672
01:29:21.700 --> 01:29:25.330
I love you now; but not,till now, so much

1673
01:29:25.330 --> 01:29:28.470
But I might master it: infaith, I lie;

1674
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:30.230
My thoughts were likeunbridled children, grown

1675
01:29:30.230 --> 01:29:35.070
Too headstrong for theirmother. See, we fools!

1676
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:37.370
Why have I blabb'd? whoshall be true to us,

1677
01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:40.500
When we are so unsecret toourselves?

1678
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.870
But, though I loved youwell, I woo'd you not;

1679
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:45.070
And yet, good faith, Iwish'd myself a man,

1680
01:29:45.070 --> 01:29:48.470
Or that we women had men'sprivilege Of speaking first.

1681
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:50.670
Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,

1682
01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:52.370
For in this rapture Ishall surely speak

1683
01:29:52.370 --> 01:30:00.130
The thing I shall repent.See, see, your silence,

1684
01:30:00.130 --> 01:30:02.770
Cunning in dumbness, frommy weakness draws

1685
01:30:02.770 --> 01:30:06.700
My very soul of counsel!stop my mouth.

1686
01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:12.530
And shall, albeit sweetmusic issues thence.

1687
01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:14.600
Pretty, i' faith.

1688
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:28.500
My lord, I do beseech you,pardon me;

1689
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:32.130
'Twas not my purpose, thusto beg a kiss:

1690
01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:36.570
I am ashamed. O heavens!what have I done?

1691
01:30:36.570 --> 01:30:37.700
For this time will I takemy leave, my lord.

1692
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.930
Your leave, sweet Cressid!

1693
01:30:38.930 --> 01:30:40.930
Leave! an you take leavetill to-morrow morning,--

1694
01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:42.530
Pray you, content you.

1695
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:46.000
What offends you, lady?

1696
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.500
Sir, mine own company.

1697
01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:51.200
You cannot shun Yourself.

1698
01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.430
Let me go and try:

1699
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:56.500
I have a kind of selfresides with you;

1700
01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:58.670
But an unkind self, thatitself will leave,

1701
01:30:58.670 --> 01:31:03.870
To be another's fool. Iwould be gone:

1702
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:06.830
Where is my wit? I knownot what I speak.

1703
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:10.730
Well know they what theyspeak that speak so wisely.

1704
01:31:10.730 --> 01:31:14.700
Perchance, my lord, I showmore craft than love;

1705
01:31:14.700 --> 01:31:16.600
And fell so roundly to alarge confession,

1706
01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:22.430
To angle for your thoughts:but you are wise,

1707
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:26.030
Or else you love not, forto be wise and love

1708
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:32.730
Exceeds man's might; thatdwells with gods above.

1709
01:31:32.730 --> 01:31:40.370
O that I thought it couldbe in a woman--

1710
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:45.400
As, if it can, I willpresume in you--

1711
01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:54.100
To feed for aye her rampand flames of love;

1712
01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:58.500
To keep her constancy inplight and youth,

1713
01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:00.230
Outliving beauty'soutward, with a mind

1714
01:32:00.230 --> 01:32:05.100
That doth renew swifterthan blood decays!

1715
01:32:05.100 --> 01:32:06.600
Or that persuasion couldbut thus convince me,

1716
01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.230
That my integrity andtruth to you

1717
01:32:08.230 --> 01:32:10.570
Might be affronted withthe match and weight

1718
01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:15.470
Of such a winnow'd purityin love;

1719
01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:20.630
How were I then uplifted!but, alas!

1720
01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:23.770
I am as true as truth'ssimplicity

1721
01:32:23.770 --> 01:32:28.400
And simpler than theinfancy of truth.

1722
01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.600
In that I'll war with you.

1723
01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:32.200
O virtuous fight,

1724
01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:37.370
When right with right warswho shall be most right!

1725
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.270
True swains in love shallin the world to come

1726
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:46.530
Approve their truths byTroilus: when their rhymes,

1727
01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:49.000
Full of protest, of oathand big compare,

1728
01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.970
Want similes, truth tiredwith iteration,

1729
01:32:52.970 --> 01:32:56.270
As true as steel, asplantage to the moon,

1730
01:32:56.270 --> 01:33:00.570
As sun to day, as turtleto her mate,

1731
01:33:00.570 --> 01:33:09.030
As iron to adamant, asearth to the centre,

1732
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:16.930
Yet, after all comparisonsof truth,

1733
01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:22.170
As truth's authenticauthor to be cited,

1734
01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:29.430
'As true as Troilus' shallcrown up the verse,

1735
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:32.300
And sanctify the numbers.

1736
01:33:32.300 --> 01:33:36.200
Prophet may you be!

1737
01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:42.130
If I be false, or swerve ahair from truth,

1738
01:33:42.130 --> 01:33:45.430
When time is old and hathforgot itself,

1739
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:48.430
When waterdrops have wornthe stones of Troy,

1740
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:52.200
And blind oblivionswallow'd cities up,

1741
01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:54.630
And mighty statescharacterless are grated

1742
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:58.670
To dusty nothing, yet letmemory,

1743
01:33:58.670 --> 01:34:02.370
From false to false, amongfalse maids in love,

1744
01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:06.900
Upbraid my falsehood! whenthey've said 'as false

1745
01:34:06.900 --> 01:34:13.070
As air, as water, wind, orsandy earth,

1746
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:16.770
As fox to lamb, as wolf toheifer's calf,

1747
01:34:16.770 --> 01:34:21.800
Pard to the hind, orstepdame to her son,'

1748
01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:28.600
'Yea,' let them say, to stickthe heart of falsehood,

1749
01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:31.400
'As false as Cressid.'

1750
01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:42.070
Go to, a bargain made: seal it,seal it; I'll be the witness.

1751
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:46.130
Here I hold your hand,here my cousin's.

1752
01:34:46.130 --> 01:34:48.900
If ever you provefalse one to another,

1753
01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:52.470
since I have taken such painsto bring you together,

1754
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:56.330
let all pitiful goers-betweenbe called to the world's end

1755
01:34:56.330 --> 01:35:00.070
after my name; callthem all Pandars;

1756
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:03.100
let all constantmen be Troiluses,

1757
01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:11.330
all false women Cressids, andall brokers-between Pandars!

1758
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:12.270
say, amen.

1759
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.800
Amen.

1760
01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:14.330
Amen.

1761
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:20.900
Amen. Whereupon I will showyou a chamber with a bed;

1762
01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:24.070
which bed, because itshall not speak of your

1763
01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:37.800
pretty encounters, pressit to death: away!

1764
01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.930
And Cupid grant alltongue-tied maidens here

1765
01:35:42.930 --> 01:35:52.730
Bed, chamber, Pandarto provide this gear!

1766
01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.900


1767
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:02.970
Now, princes, for theservice I have done,

1768
01:36:02.970 --> 01:36:05.900
The advantage of the timeprompts me aloud

1769
01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:09.670
To call for recompense.Appear it to your mind

1770
01:36:09.670 --> 01:36:12.270
That, through the sight Ibear in things to love,

1771
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:16.370
I have abandon'd Troy,left my possession,

1772
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:20.400
Incurr'd a traitor's name;exposed myself,

1773
01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.570
From certain and possess'dconveniences,

1774
01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:25.530
To doubtful fortunes;sequestering from me all

1775
01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:29.130
That time, acquaintance,custom and condition

1776
01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:32.570
Made tame and mostfamiliar to my nature,

1777
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:37.330
And here, to do youservice, am become

1778
01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:42.800
As new into the world,strange, unacquainted:

1779
01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.230
I do beseech you, as inway of taste,

1780
01:36:45.230 --> 01:36:48.430
To give me now a littlebenefit,

1781
01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:50.930
Out of those manyregister'd in promise,

1782
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:52.670
Which, you say, live tocome in my behalf.

1783
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:56.430
What wouldst thou of us,Trojan? make demand.

1784
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:10.130
You have a Trojanprisoner, call'd Antenor,

1785
01:37:10.130 --> 01:37:14.870
Yesterday took: Troy holdshim very dear.

1786
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:18.000
Oft have you--often haveyou thanks therefore--

1787
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:21.900
Desired my Cressid inright great exchange,

1788
01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:24.100
Whom Troy hath still denied:

1789
01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:27.670
but this Antenor, I know, issuch a wrest in their affairs

1790
01:37:27.670 --> 01:37:29.700
That their negotiationsall must slack,

1791
01:37:29.700 --> 01:37:32.000
Wanting his manage; andthey will almost

1792
01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.570
Give us a prince of blood,a son of Priam,

1793
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:40.470
In change of him: let himbe sent, great princes,

1794
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:46.070
And he shall buy mydaughter; and her presence

1795
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:49.900
Shall quite strike off allservice I have done,

1796
01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:52.800
In most accepted pain.

1797
01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.500
Let Diomedes bear him,

1798
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:58.200
And bring us Cressidhither: Calchas shall have

1799
01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.530
What he requests of us.Good Diomed,

1800
01:38:00.530 --> 01:38:03.430
Furnish you fairly forthis interchange:

1801
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:06.670
Withal bring word ifHector will to-morrow

1802
01:38:06.670 --> 01:38:09.970
Be answer'd in hischallenge: Ajax is ready.

1803
01:38:09.970 --> 01:38:12.000
This shall I undertake;and 'tis a burden

1804
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.670
Which I am proud to bear.

1805
01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:21.070
Achilles stands i' theentrance of his tent:

1806
01:38:21.070 --> 01:38:24.670
Please it our general topass strangely by him,

1807
01:38:24.670 --> 01:38:28.430
As if he were forgot; and,princes all,

1808
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:31.770
Lay negligent and looseregard upon him:

1809
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:33.900
I will come last. 'Tislike he'll question me

1810
01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:36.400
Why such unplausive eyesare bent on him:

1811
01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:40.100
If so, I have derisionmedicinable,

1812
01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:44.030
To use between yourstrangeness and his pride,

1813
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:47.400
Which his own will shallhave desire to drink:

1814
01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.370
It may be good: pride hathno other glass

1815
01:38:52.370 --> 01:38:55.700
To show itself but pride,for supple knees

1816
01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:59.800
Feed arrogance and are theproud man's fees.

1817
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:03.000
We'll execute yourpurpose, and put on

1818
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:06.530
A form of strangeness aswe pass along:

1819
01:39:06.530 --> 01:39:08.600
So do each lord, andeither greet him not,

1820
01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.870
Or else disdainfully,which shall shake him more

1821
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:18.870
Than if not look'd on. Iwill lead the way.

1822
01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:22.670
Supple knead.

1823
01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:35.870
What, comes the general tospeak with me?

1824
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:38.830
You know my mind, I'llfight no more 'gainst Troy.

1825
01:39:38.830 --> 01:39:41.670
What says Achilles? wouldhe aught with us?

1826
01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:43.930
Would you, my lord, aughtwith the general?

1827
01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:45.370
No.

1828
01:39:45.370 --> 01:39:46.370
Nothing, my lord.

1829
01:39:46.370 --> 01:39:49.900
The better.

1830
01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:51.270
Good day, good day.

1831
01:39:51.270 --> 01:39:52.700
How do you? how do you?

1832
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:54.930
What, does the cuckoldscorn me?

1833
01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:56.100
How now, Patroclus!

1834
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:56.670
Good morrow, Ajax.

1835
01:39:56.670 --> 01:39:57.670
Ha?

1836
01:39:57.670 --> 01:39:58.830
Good morrow.

1837
01:39:58.830 --> 01:40:01.870
Ay, and good next day too.

1838
01:40:01.870 --> 01:40:04.970
What mean these fellows?Know they not Achilles?

1839
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:07.670
They pass by strangely:they were used to bend

1840
01:40:07.670 --> 01:40:10.100
To send their smilesbefore them to Achilles;

1841
01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:11.870
To come as humbly as theyused to creep

1842
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:12.800
To holy altars.

1843
01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.400
What, am I poor of late?

1844
01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.970
'Tis certain, greatness, oncefall'n out with fortune,

1845
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:22.770
Must fall out with mentoo: what the declined is

1846
01:40:22.770 --> 01:40:24.230
He shall as soon read inthe eyes of others

1847
01:40:24.230 --> 01:40:29.830
As feel in his own fall;for men, like butterflies,

1848
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:33.630
Show not their mealy wingsbut to the summer,

1849
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:35.100
And not a man, for beingsimply man,

1850
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:38.000
Hath any honour, buthonour for those honours

1851
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.500
That are without him, asplace, riches, favour,

1852
01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:44.370
Prizes of accident as oftas merit:

1853
01:40:44.370 --> 01:40:47.030
Which when they fall, asbeing slippery standers,

1854
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:50.430
The love that lean'd onthem as slippery too,

1855
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:52.500
Do one pluck down anotherand together

1856
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:56.400
Die in the fall. But 'tisnot so with me:

1857
01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.330
Fortune and I are friends:I do enjoy

1858
01:40:59.330 --> 01:41:02.070
At ample point all that Idid possess,

1859
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:05.470
Save these men's looks;who do, methinks,

1860
01:41:05.470 --> 01:41:08.900
find out Something not worthin me such rich beholding

1861
01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:11.630
As they have often given.Here is Ulysses;

1862
01:41:11.630 --> 01:41:14.300
I'll interrupt hisreading.

1863
01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:15.730
How now Ulysses!

1864
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:17.730
Now, great Thetis' son!

1865
01:41:17.730 --> 01:41:19.530
What are you reading?

1866
01:41:19.530 --> 01:41:22.870
A strange fellow here

1867
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:25.630
Writes me: 'That man, howdearly ever parted,

1868
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:30.230
How much in having, orwithout or in,

1869
01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:34.270
Cannot make boast to havethat which he hath,

1870
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:38.670
Nor feels not what heowes, but by reflection;

1871
01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:41.870
As when his virtuesshining upon others

1872
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:44.430
Heat them and they retortthat heat again

1873
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:46.800
To the first giver.'

1874
01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:49.170
This is not strange,Ulysses.

1875
01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:51.430
The beauty that is bornehere in the face

1876
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:54.470
The bearer knows not, butcommends itself

1877
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:57.300
To others' eyes; nor doththe eye itself,

1878
01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:01.000
That most pure spirit ofsense, behold itself,

1879
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.130
Not going from itself; buteye to eye opposed

1880
01:42:05.130 --> 01:42:07.970
Salutes each other witheach other's form;

1881
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:10.430
For speculation turns notto itself,

1882
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:13.430
Till it hath travell'd andis mirror'd there

1883
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:17.930
Where it may see itself.This is not strange at all.

1884
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:19.400
I do not strain at theposition,--

1885
01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.200
It is familiar,--but atthe author's drift;

1886
01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:26.200
Who, in his circumstance,expressly proves

1887
01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.070
That no man is the lord ofany thing,

1888
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:31.400
Though in and of him therebe much consisting,

1889
01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.830
Till he communicate hisparts to others:

1890
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:40.230
Nor doth he of himselfknow them for aught

1891
01:42:40.230 --> 01:42:43.530
Till he behold them form'din the applause

1892
01:42:43.530 --> 01:42:46.100
Where they're extended;who, like an arch,

1893
01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:47.930
reverberates

1894
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:50.730
The voice again, or, likea gate of steel

1895
01:42:50.730 --> 01:42:54.000
Fronting the sun, receivesand renders back

1896
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.170
His figure and his heat. Iwas much wrapt in this;

1897
01:42:58.170 --> 01:43:01.230
And apprehended hereimmediately

1898
01:43:01.230 --> 01:43:03.770
The unknown Ajax.

1899
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:07.970
Heavens, what a man isthere! a very horse,

1900
01:43:07.970 --> 01:43:12.800
That has he knows not what.Nature, what things there are

1901
01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:15.730
Most abject in regard anddear in use!

1902
01:43:15.730 --> 01:43:17.700
What things again mostdear in the esteem

1903
01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:20.930
And poor in worth! Nowshall we see to-morrow--

1904
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:24.100
An act that very chancedoth throw upon him--

1905
01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:30.630
Ajax renown'd. O heavens,what some men do,

1906
01:43:30.630 --> 01:43:33.370
While some men leave todo!

1907
01:43:33.370 --> 01:43:36.200
How some men creep inskittish fortune's hall,

1908
01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:39.000
Whiles others play theidiots in her eyes!

1909
01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.870
How one man eats intoanother's pride,

1910
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:44.600
While pride is fasting inhis wantonness!

1911
01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:47.970
To see these Grecianlords!--why, even already

1912
01:43:47.970 --> 01:43:50.400
They clap the lubber Ajaxon the shoulder,

1913
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.700
As if his foot were onbrave Hector's breast

1914
01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:56.070
And great Troy shrieking.

1915
01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:57.630
I do believe it; for theypass'd by me

1916
01:43:57.630 --> 01:43:59.200
As misers do by beggars,neither gave to me

1917
01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:05.430
Good word nor look: what,are my deeds forgot?

1918
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:10.170
Time hath, my lord, awallet at his back,

1919
01:44:10.170 --> 01:44:14.630
Wherein he puts alms foroblivion,

1920
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:17.770
A great-sized monster ofingratitudes:

1921
01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:21.870
Those scraps are good deedspast; which are devour'd

1922
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:24.700
As fast as they are made,forgot as soon

1923
01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:27.900
As done: perseverance,dear my lord,

1924
01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:32.200
Keeps honour bright: tohave done is to hang

1925
01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.500
Quite out of fashion,like a rusty mail

1926
01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:38.870
In monumental mockery.Take the instant way;

1927
01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:41.170
For honour travels in astrait so narrow,

1928
01:44:41.170 --> 01:44:44.970
Where one but goes abreast:keep then the path;

1929
01:44:44.970 --> 01:44:47.630
For emulation hath athousand sons

1930
01:44:47.630 --> 01:44:50.200
That one by one pursue: ifyou give way,

1931
01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.330
Or hedge aside from thedirect forthright,

1932
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:56.300
Like to an enter'd tide,they all rush by

1933
01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:58.730
And leave you hindmost;

1934
01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:01.670
Or like a gallant horsefall'n in first rank,

1935
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:04.130
Lie there for pavement tothe abject rear,

1936
01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:08.930
O'er-run and trampled on:then what they do in present,

1937
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:12.870
Though less than yours inpast, must o'ertop yours;

1938
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:17.270
For time is like afashionable host

1939
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:22.030
That slightly shakes hisparting guest by the hand,

1940
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:24.970
And with his armsoutstretch'd, as he would fly,

1941
01:45:24.970 --> 01:45:29.300
Grasps in the comer:welcome ever smiles,

1942
01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:34.970
And farewell goes out sighing.O, let not virtue seek

1943
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:37.900
Remuneration for the thingit was;

1944
01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:40.430
For beauty, wit,

1945
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:44.030
High birth, vigour ofbone, desert in service,

1946
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:47.070
Love, friendship, charity,are subjects all

1947
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:48.930
To envious andcalumniating time.

1948
01:45:48.930 --> 01:45:53.200
One touch of nature makesthe whole world kin,

1949
01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.330
That all with one consentpraise new-born gawds,

1950
01:45:56.330 --> 01:45:58.530
Though they are made andmoulded of things past,

1951
01:45:58.530 --> 01:46:01.170
And give to dust that is alittle gilt

1952
01:46:01.170 --> 01:46:03.470
More laud than gilto'er-dusted.

1953
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:07.900
The present eye praisesthe present object.

1954
01:46:07.900 --> 01:46:10.900
Then marvel not, thougreat and complete man,

1955
01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:12.730
That all the Greeks beginto worship Ajax;

1956
01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:15.670
Since things in motionsooner catch the eye

1957
01:46:15.670 --> 01:46:20.630
Than what not stirs. Thecry went once on thee,

1958
01:46:20.630 --> 01:46:23.700
And still it might, andyet it may again,

1959
01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:27.170
If thou wouldst not entombthyself alive

1960
01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:30.900
And case thy reputation inthy tent;

1961
01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:33.330
Whose glorious deeds, butin these fields of late,

1962
01:46:33.330 --> 01:46:37.330
Made emulous missions'mongst the gods themselves

1963
01:46:37.330 --> 01:46:40.470
And drave great Mars tofaction.

1964
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:42.970
Of this my privacy

1965
01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:47.300
I have strong reasons.

1966
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.100
But 'gainst your privacy

1967
01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:53.570
The reasons are morepotent and heroical:

1968
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:57.570
'Tis known, Achilles, thatyou are in love

1969
01:46:57.570 --> 01:47:00.530
With one of Priam'sdaughters.

1970
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:01.570
Ha! known!

1971
01:47:01.570 --> 01:47:03.230
Is that a wonder?

1972
01:47:03.230 --> 01:47:04.270
The providence that's in awatchful state

1973
01:47:04.270 --> 01:47:06.270
Knows almost every grainof Plutus' gold,

1974
01:47:06.270 --> 01:47:08.930
Finds bottom in theuncomprehensive deeps,

1975
01:47:08.930 --> 01:47:11.530
Keeps place with thoughtand almost, like the gods,

1976
01:47:11.530 --> 01:47:15.500
Does thoughts unveil intheir dumb cradles.

1977
01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:19.070
There is a mystery--in thesoul of state

1978
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:21.200
with whom relation-- Durst nevermeddle;

1979
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.730
Which hath an operationmore divine

1980
01:47:23.730 --> 01:47:26.500
Than breath or pen cangive expressure to:

1981
01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.930
All the commerce that youhave had with Troy

1982
01:47:28.930 --> 01:47:32.830
As perfectly is ours asyours, my lord;

1983
01:47:32.830 --> 01:47:34.630
And better would it fitAchilles much

1984
01:47:34.630 --> 01:47:40.100
To throw down Hector thanPolyxena:

1985
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:42.600
But it must grieve youngPyrrhus now at home,

1986
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:46.570
When fame shall in ourislands sound her trump,

1987
01:47:46.570 --> 01:47:49.130
And all the Greekish girlsshall tripping sing,

1988
01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:51.830
'Great Hector's sister didAchilles win,

1989
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:55.970
But our great Ajax bravelybeat down him.'

1990
01:47:57.170 --> 01:48:03.670
Farewell, my lord: I asyour lover speak;

1991
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:09.900
The fool slides o'er theice that you should break.

1992
01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:14.070
To this effect, Achilles,have I moved you:

1993
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:16.200
A woman impudent andmannish grown

1994
01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.400
Is not more loathed thanan effeminate man

1995
01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:21.930
In time of action. I standcondemn'd for this;

1996
01:48:21.930 --> 01:48:23.700
They think my littlestomach to the war

1997
01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:26.630
And your great love to merestrains you thus:

1998
01:48:26.630 --> 01:48:30.000
Sweet, rouse yourself; andthe weak wanton Cupid

1999
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.970
Shall from your neckunloose his amorous fold,

2000
01:48:32.970 --> 01:48:34.700
And, like a dew-drop fromthe lion's mane,

2001
01:48:34.700 --> 01:48:37.030
Be shook to air.

2002
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:39.670
Shall Ajax fight withHector?

2003
01:48:39.670 --> 01:48:44.000
Ay, and perhaps receivemuch honour by him.

2004
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.900
I see my reputation is atstake

2005
01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:47.970
My fame is shrewdly gored.

2006
01:48:47.970 --> 01:48:49.670
O, then, beware;

2007
01:48:49.670 --> 01:48:52.630
Those wounds heal ill thatmen do give themselves:

2008
01:48:52.630 --> 01:48:54.300
Omission to do what isnecessary

2009
01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:57.000
Seals a commission to ablank of danger;

2010
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.270
And danger, like an ague,subtly taints

2011
01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:05.370
Even then when we sit idlyin the sun.

2012
01:49:05.370 --> 01:49:09.630
Go call Thersites hither,sweet Patroclus:

2013
01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:13.330
I'll send the fool to Ajaxand desire him

2014
01:49:13.330 --> 01:49:17.200
To invite the Trojan lordsafter the combat

2015
01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.530
To see us here unarm'd: Ihave a woman's longing,

2016
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:24.300
An appetite that I am sickwithal,

2017
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:28.500
To see great Hector in hisweeds of peace,

2018
01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:31.530
To talk with him and tobehold his visage,

2019
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:35.400
Even to my full of view.

2020
01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.600
A labour saved!

2021
01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:38.700
A wonder!

2022
01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:39.830
What?

2023
01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:41.700
Ajax goes up and down thefield, asking for himself.

2024
01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:42.670
How so?

2025
01:49:42.670 --> 01:49:44.070
He must fight singlyto-morrow with Hector,

2026
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:46.830
and is so prophetically proudof an heroical cudgelling

2027
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:48.730
that he raves insaying nothing.

2028
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:50.100
Stalks up anddown like a peacock,

2029
01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:51.900
--a stride and a stand:

2030
01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:54.530
The man's undone forever; forif Hector break not his neck

2031
01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:57.800
i' the combat, he'll break't himself in vain-glory.

2032
01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:59.630
He knows not me: Isaid 'Good morrow,

2033
01:49:59.630 --> 01:50:02.700
Ajax;' and he replies'Thanks, Agamemnon.'

2034
01:50:02.700 --> 01:50:05.600
What think you of this man thattakes me for the general?

2035
01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.800
He's grown a very land-fish,language-less, a monster.

2036
01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:11.600
Thou must be my ambassadorto him, Thersites.

2037
01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.730
Who, I? why, he'llanswer nobody;

2038
01:50:13.730 --> 01:50:16.930
he professes not answering:speaking is for beggars;

2039
01:50:16.930 --> 01:50:20.970
he wears his tongue in's arms.I will put on his presence:

2040
01:50:20.970 --> 01:50:23.130
let Patroclus makedemands to me,

2041
01:50:23.130 --> 01:50:26.830
you shall see thepageant of Ajax.

2042
01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:28.000
To him, Patroclus;

2043
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.130
tell him I humbly desirethe valiant Ajax

2044
01:50:30.130 --> 01:50:32.100
to invite the mostvalorous Hector

2045
01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.700
to come unarmedto my tent,

2046
01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:37.070
and to procure safe-conduct forhis person of the magnanimous

2047
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:39.170
and most illustrioussix-or-seven-times-honoure d

2048
01:50:39.170 --> 01:50:42.670
captain-general of theGrecian army, Agamemnon,

2049
01:50:42.670 --> 01:50:43.830
et cetera. Do this.

2050
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:45.430
Jove bless great Ajax!

2051
01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:46.930
Hum!

2052
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:49.530
I come from the worthyAchilles,--

2053
01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:50.770
Ha!

2054
01:50:50.770 --> 01:50:53.430
Who most humbly desires you toinvite Hector to his tent,--

2055
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:54.400
Hum!

2056
01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.970
And to procure safe-conductfrom Agamemnon.

2057
01:50:56.970 --> 01:50:59.130
Agamemnon!

2058
01:50:59.130 --> 01:51:00.300
Ay, my lord.

2059
01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:01.130
Ha!

2060
01:51:01.130 --> 01:51:02.700
What say you to't?

2061
01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.230
God b' wi' you, with allmy heart.

2062
01:51:05.230 --> 01:51:06.730
Your answer, sir.

2063
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:11.030
If to-morrow be a fairday, by eleven o'clock

2064
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:14.830
it will go one way or other:howsoever, he shall pay for me

2065
01:51:14.830 --> 01:51:16.330
ere he has me.

2066
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:17.230
Your answer, sir.

2067
01:51:17.230 --> 01:51:19.230
Fare you well, with all myheart.

2068
01:51:19.230 --> 01:51:21.430
Why, but he is not in thistune, is he?

2069
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:23.770
No, but he's out o' tunethus. What music will be in

2070
01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:25.830
him when Hector hasknocked out his brains,

2071
01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:27.130
I know not;

2072
01:51:27.130 --> 01:51:29.330
Come, thou must deliver aletter to him straight.

2073
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:32.230
Let me carry another to hishorse; for that's the more

2074
01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:34.770
capable creature.

2075
01:51:34.770 --> 01:51:38.430
My mind is troubled, likea fountain stirr'd;

2076
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:40.500
And I myself see not thebottom of it.

2077
01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:46.930
Would the fountain of yourmind were clear again,

2078
01:51:46.930 --> 01:51:50.530
that I might water an assat it! I had rather be a

2079
01:51:50.530 --> 01:51:56.530
tick in a sheep than sucha valiant ignorance.

2080
01:52:05.230 --> 01:52:07.070
See, ho! who is thatthere?

2081
01:52:07.070 --> 01:52:08.630
It is the Lord AEneas.

2082
01:52:08.630 --> 01:52:12.230
Is the prince there inperson?

2083
01:52:12.230 --> 01:52:16.770
Had I so good occasion tolie long

2084
01:52:16.770 --> 01:52:19.930
As you, prince Paris, nothingbut heavenly business

2085
01:52:19.930 --> 01:52:22.500
Should rob my bed-mate ofmy company.

2086
01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:27.930
That's my mind too. Goodmorrow, Lord AEneas.

2087
01:52:27.930 --> 01:52:31.000
A valiant Greek,AEneas,--take his hand,--

2088
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.170
Witness the process ofyour speech, wherein

2089
01:52:33.170 --> 01:52:35.830
You told how Diomed, awhole week by days,

2090
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:39.270
Did haunt you in thefield.

2091
01:52:39.270 --> 01:52:41.230
Health to you, valiantsir,

2092
01:52:41.230 --> 01:52:44.170
During all question of thegentle truce;

2093
01:52:44.170 --> 01:52:46.670
But when I meet you arm'd,as black defiance

2094
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:49.300
As heart can think orcourage execute.

2095
01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:52.070
The one and other Diomedembraces.

2096
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:55.470
Our bloods are now in calm;and, so long, health!

2097
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:57.530
But when contention andoccasion meet,

2098
01:52:57.530 --> 01:52:58.900
By Jove, I'll play thehunter for thy life

2099
01:52:58.900 --> 01:53:03.500
With all my force, pursuitand policy.

2100
01:53:03.500 --> 01:53:05.200
And thou shalt hunt alion, that will fly

2101
01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:10.400
With his face backward. Inhumane gentleness,

2102
01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:14.630
Welcome to Troy! now, byAnchises' life,

2103
01:53:14.630 --> 01:53:17.800
Welcome, indeed! By Venus'hand I swear,

2104
01:53:17.800 --> 01:53:20.130
No man alive can love insuch a sort

2105
01:53:20.130 --> 01:53:23.000
The thing he means to killmore excellently.

2106
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.070
We sympathize: Jove, letAEneas live,

2107
01:53:26.070 --> 01:53:28.600
If to my sword his fate benot the glory,

2108
01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:31.700
A thousand completecourses of the sun!

2109
01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:34.700
But, in mine emuloushonour, let him die,

2110
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:39.530
With every joint a wound,and that to-morrow!

2111
01:53:40.570 --> 01:53:41.830
We know each other well.

2112
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:45.430
We do; and long to knoweach other worse.

2113
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:47.530
This is the most despitefulgentle greeting,

2114
01:53:47.530 --> 01:53:52.170
The noblest hateful love,that e'er I heard of.

2115
01:53:52.170 --> 01:53:54.700
What business, lord, soearly?

2116
01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:57.830
I was sent for to theking; but why, I know not.

2117
01:53:57.830 --> 01:54:00.230
His purpose meets you:'twas to bring this Greek

2118
01:54:00.230 --> 01:54:01.930
To Calchas' house, andthere to render him,

2119
01:54:01.930 --> 01:54:04.770
For the enfreed Antenor,the fair Cressid:

2120
01:54:04.770 --> 01:54:10.100
Let's have your company,or, if you please,

2121
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:12.900
Haste there before us: Iconstantly believe--

2122
01:54:12.900 --> 01:54:14.530
Or rather, call my thoughta certain knowledge--

2123
01:54:14.530 --> 01:54:16.470
My brother Troilus lodgesthere to-night:

2124
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:18.370
Rouse him and give himnote of our approach.

2125
01:54:18.370 --> 01:54:21.070
With the whole qualitywherefore: I fear

2126
01:54:21.070 --> 01:54:22.170
We shall be muchunwelcome.

2127
01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:24.500
That I assure you:

2128
01:54:24.500 --> 01:54:26.630
Troilus had rather Troywere borne to Greece

2129
01:54:26.630 --> 01:54:29.170
Than Cressid borne fromTroy.

2130
01:54:29.170 --> 01:54:30.570
There is no help;

2131
01:54:30.570 --> 01:54:31.870
The bitter disposition ofthe time

2132
01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:36.130
Will have it so. On, lord;we'll follow you.

2133
01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:45.770
Good morrow, friend.

2134
01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:52.600
And tell me, noble Diomed,faith, tell me true,

2135
01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.630
Even in the soul of soundgood-fellowship,

2136
01:54:56.630 --> 01:54:59.970
Who, in your thoughts,merits fair Helen best,

2137
01:54:59.970 --> 01:55:02.100
Myself or Menelaus?

2138
01:55:02.100 --> 01:55:03.830
Both alike:

2139
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:05.570
He merits well to haveher, that doth seek her,

2140
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:07.970
Not making any scruple ofher soilure,

2141
01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:11.170
With such a hell of painand world of charge,

2142
01:55:11.170 --> 01:55:12.670
And you as well to keepher, that defend her,

2143
01:55:12.670 --> 01:55:15.770
Not palating the taste ofher dishonour,

2144
01:55:15.770 --> 01:55:19.430
With such a costly loss ofwealth and friends:

2145
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:21.970
He, like a puling cuckold,would drink up

2146
01:55:21.970 --> 01:55:26.130
The lees and dregs of aflat tamed piece;

2147
01:55:26.130 --> 01:55:28.270
You, like a lecher, out ofwhorish loins

2148
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:31.730
Are pleased to breed outyour inheritors:

2149
01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:36.270
Both merits poised, eachweighs nor less nor more;

2150
01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:40.200
But he as he, the heavierfor a whore.

2151
01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:43.570
You are too bitter to yourcountrywoman.

2152
01:55:43.570 --> 01:55:47.570
She's bitter to hercountry: hear me, Paris:

2153
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:48.900
For every false drop inher bawdy veins

2154
01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:51.530
A Grecian's life hathsunk; for every scruple

2155
01:55:51.530 --> 01:55:53.200
Of her contaminatedcarrion weight,

2156
01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.000
A Trojan hath been slain:since she could speak,

2157
01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.570
She hath not given so manygood words breath

2158
01:55:57.570 --> 01:56:02.070
As for her Greeks andTrojans suffer'd death.

2159
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:05.030
Fair Diomed, you do aschapmen do,

2160
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:08.000
Dispraise the thing thatyou desire to buy:

2161
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.430
But we in silence holdthis virtue well,

2162
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:14.170
We'll but commend what weintend to sell.

2163
01:56:15.630 --> 01:56:19.070
Here lies our way.

2164
01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:46.170
Dear, trouble not yourself:the morn is cold.

2165
01:56:46.170 --> 01:56:49.570
Then, sweet my lord, I'llcall mine uncle down;

2166
01:56:49.570 --> 01:56:50.630
He shall unbolt the gates.

2167
01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:51.900
Trouble him not;

2168
01:56:51.900 --> 01:56:56.770
To bed, to bed: sleep killthose pretty eyes,

2169
01:56:56.770 --> 01:56:58.400
And give as softattachment to thy senses

2170
01:56:58.400 --> 01:57:01.630
As infants' empty of allthought!

2171
01:57:01.630 --> 01:57:03.670
Good morrow, then.

2172
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.170
I prithee now, to bed.

2173
01:57:11.830 --> 01:57:13.270
Are you a-weary of me?

2174
01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:18.570
O Cressida! but that thebusy day,

2175
01:57:18.570 --> 01:57:21.670
Waked by the lark, hathroused the ribald crows,

2176
01:57:21.670 --> 01:57:24.400
And dreaming night willhide our joys no longer,

2177
01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:26.230
I would not from thee.

2178
01:57:26.230 --> 01:57:28.030
Night hath been too brief.

2179
01:57:28.030 --> 01:57:31.630
Beshrew the witch! withvenomous wights she stays

2180
01:57:31.630 --> 01:57:35.000
As tediously as hell, butflies the grasps of love

2181
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000
With wings moremomentary-swift than thought.

2182
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:41.170
You will catch cold, andcurse me.

2183
01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:43.530
Prithee, tarry:

2184
01:57:43.530 --> 01:57:46.500
You men will never tarry.

2185
01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:50.470
O foolish Cressid! I mighthave still held off,

2186
01:57:50.470 --> 01:57:54.770
And then you would havetarried. Hark!

2187
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:56.400
there's one up.

2188
01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:58.670
What, 's all the doorsopen here?

2189
01:57:58.670 --> 01:58:00.100
It is your uncle.

2190
01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:02.100
A pestilence on him! nowwill he be mocking:

2191
01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:03.570
I shall have such a life!

2192
01:58:03.570 --> 01:58:13.170
How now, how now!how go maidenheads?

2193
01:58:13.170 --> 01:58:17.400
Here, you maid! where'smy cousin Cressid?

2194
01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:20.570
Go hang yourself, younaughty mocking uncle!

2195
01:58:20.570 --> 01:58:22.630
You bring me to do, andthen you flout me too.

2196
01:58:22.630 --> 01:58:25.300
To do what? to do what?let her say

2197
01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:27.800
what: what have I broughtyou to do?

2198
01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.900
Come, come, beshrew yourheart! you'll ne'er be good,

2199
01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:31.600
Nor suffer others.

2200
01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.570
Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch!ah, poor capocchia!

2201
01:58:34.570 --> 01:58:37.900
hast not slept to-night?would he not, a naughty man,

2202
01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:41.230
let it sleep? abugbear take him!

2203
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:43.330
Did not I tell you? Would hewere knock'd i' the head!

2204
01:58:43.330 --> 01:58:44.970
(Knocking)

2205
01:58:44.970 --> 01:58:56.670
Hark. Who's that at door? gooduncle, go and see.

2206
01:58:56.670 --> 01:59:00.770
My lord, come you againinto my chamber:

2207
01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:03.970
You smile and mock me, asif I meant naughtily.

2208
01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:05.030
Ha, ha!

2209
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:07.300
Come, you are deceived, Ithink of no such thing.

2210
01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:09.000
(Knocking within)

2211
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.830
How earnestly they knock!Pray you, come in:

2212
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:15.000
I would not for half Troyhave you seen here.

2213
01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:18.400
My LordAEneas! By my troth,

2214
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:21.830
I knew you not: what newswith you so early?

2215
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:23.900
Is not Prince Troilushere?

2216
01:59:23.900 --> 01:59:27.100
Here! what should he dohere?

2217
01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:29.570
Come, he is here, my lord;do not deny him:

2218
01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:31.300
It doth import him much tospeak with me.

2219
01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:34.000
Is he here, say you?'tis more than I know,

2220
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:37.070
I'll be sworn: for my ownpart, I came in late.

2221
01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:39.100
What should he do here?

2222
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:41.330
Who!--nay, then: come,come, you'll do him wrong

2223
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:43.670
ere you're ware: you'llbe so true to him,

2224
01:59:43.670 --> 01:59:47.370
to be false to him: donot you know of him,

2225
01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:49.800
but yet go fetchhim hither; go.

2226
01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:52.700
How now! what's thematter?

2227
01:59:56.900 --> 01:59:59.570
My lord, I scarce haveleisure to salute you,

2228
01:59:59.570 --> 02:00:02.170
My matter is so rash:there is at hand

2229
02:00:02.170 --> 02:00:04.030
Paris your brother, andDeiphobus,

2230
02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:06.330
The Grecian Diomed, andour Antenor

2231
02:00:06.330 --> 02:00:10.000
Deliver'd to us; and forhim forthwith,

2232
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.770
Ere the first sacrifice,within this hour,

2233
02:00:11.770 --> 02:00:14.330
We must give up toDiomedes' hand

2234
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:16.900
The Lady Cressida.

2235
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:20.500
Is it so concluded?

2236
02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:22.700
By Priam and the generalstate of Troy:

2237
02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:26.400
They are at hand and readyto effect it.

2238
02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:39.700
How my achievements mockme!

2239
02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:43.530
I will go meet them: and,my Lord AEneas,

2240
02:00:43.530 --> 02:00:45.430
We met by chance; you didnot find me here.

2241
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:48.470
Good, good, my lord; thesecrets of nature

2242
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:50.670
Have not more gift intaciturnity.

2243
02:00:50.670 --> 02:00:56.600
Is't possible? nosooner got but lost?

2244
02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:01.770
The devil take Antenor! theyoung prince will go mad:

2245
02:01:01.770 --> 02:01:04.900
a plague upon Antenor! I wouldthey had broke 's neck!

2246
02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:07.630
How now! what's thematter? who was here?

2247
02:01:07.630 --> 02:01:08.770
Ah, ah!

2248
02:01:08.770 --> 02:01:12.670
Why sigh you so profoundly?where's my lord? gone!

2249
02:01:12.670 --> 02:01:14.400
Tell me, sweet uncle,what's the matter?

2250
02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:17.230
Would I were as deep underthe earth as I am above!

2251
02:01:17.230 --> 02:01:18.770
O the gods! what's thematter?

2252
02:01:18.770 --> 02:01:22.530
Prithee, get thee in: wouldthou hadst ne'er been born!

2253
02:01:22.530 --> 02:01:24.330
I knew thou wouldstbe his death.

2254
02:01:24.330 --> 02:01:27.730
O, poor gentleman! Aplague upon Antenor!

2255
02:01:27.730 --> 02:01:29.870
Good uncle, I beseech you,

2256
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:31.570
what's the matter?

2257
02:01:31.570 --> 02:01:33.470
Thou must be gone, wench,thou must be gone;

2258
02:01:33.470 --> 02:01:37.830
thou art changed for Antenor:thou must to thy father,

2259
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:40.570
and be gone from Troilus:'twill be his death;

2260
02:01:40.570 --> 02:01:43.530
'twill be his bane; hecannot bear it.

2261
02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:48.770
O you immortal gods! Iwill not go.

2262
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:50.170
Thou must.

2263
02:01:50.170 --> 02:01:55.300
I will not, uncle: I haveforgot my father;

2264
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:59.100
I know no touch ofconsanguinity;

2265
02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:04.500
No kin no love, no blood,no soul so near me

2266
02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:10.670
As the sweet Troilus. Oyou gods divine!

2267
02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:13.200
Make Cressid's name thevery crown of falsehood,

2268
02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:18.630
If ever she leave Troilus!Time, force, and death,

2269
02:02:18.630 --> 02:02:22.030
Do to this body whatextremes you can;

2270
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:24.500
But the strong base andbuilding of my love

2271
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:27.230
Is as the very centre ofthe earth,

2272
02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:29.930
Drawing all things to it.

2273
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:39.500
(Cressida starts crying)

2274
02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:41.670
I'll go in and weep,--

2275
02:02:41.670 --> 02:02:45.630
Do, do.

2276
02:02:50.370 --> 02:02:58.600
Tear my bright hair andscratch my praised cheeks,

2277
02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:05.870
Crack my clear voice withsobs and break my heart

2278
02:03:05.870 --> 02:03:17.000
With sounding Troilus. Iwill not go from Troy.

2279
02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:18.900
Be moderate, be moderate.

2280
02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:22.930
Why tell you me ofmoderation?

2281
02:03:22.930 --> 02:03:28.300
The grief is fine, full,perfect, that I taste,

2282
02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:30.800
And violenteth in a senseas strong

2283
02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:37.300
As that which causeth it:how can I moderate it?

2284
02:03:37.300 --> 02:03:41.700
If I could temporize withmy affection,

2285
02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:43.670
Or brew it to a weak andcolder palate,

2286
02:03:43.670 --> 02:03:47.630
The like allayment could Igive my grief.

2287
02:03:47.630 --> 02:03:53.730
My love admits noqualifying dross;

2288
02:03:53.730 --> 02:03:59.130
No more my grief, in sucha precious loss.

2289
02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:06.170
Here, here, here he comes.

2290
02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:10.500
Ah, sweet ducks!

2291
02:04:10.500 --> 02:04:15.300
O Troilus! Troilus!

2292
02:04:15.630 --> 02:04:19.230
What a pair of spectaclesis here!

2293
02:04:19.230 --> 02:04:24.170
Let me embrace too.How now, lambs?

2294
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:43.300
Cressid, I love thee in sostrain'd a purity,

2295
02:04:43.300 --> 02:04:49.930
Cressid, I love thee in sostrain'd a purity,

2296
02:04:49.930 --> 02:04:52.930
That the bless'd gods, asangry with my fancy,

2297
02:04:52.930 --> 02:04:56.170
More bright in zeal thanthe devotion which

2298
02:04:56.170 --> 02:05:04.130
Cold lips blow to theirdeities, take thee from me.

2299
02:05:10.700 --> 02:05:13.770
Have the gods envy?

2300
02:05:13.770 --> 02:05:20.530
Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis tooplain a case.

2301
02:05:20.530 --> 02:05:23.730
And is it true that I mustgo from Troy?

2302
02:05:23.730 --> 02:05:26.130
A hateful truth.

2303
02:05:26.130 --> 02:05:29.130
What, and from Troilustoo?

2304
02:05:29.130 --> 02:05:33.930
From Troy and Troilus.

2305
02:05:33.930 --> 02:05:36.530
Is it possible?

2306
02:05:36.530 --> 02:05:42.430
And suddenly; where injuryof chance

2307
02:05:42.430 --> 02:05:48.770
Puts back leave-taking,justles roughly by

2308
02:05:48.770 --> 02:05:55.270
All time of pause, rudelybeguiles our lips

2309
02:05:55.270 --> 02:06:00.300
Of all rejoindure,forcibly prevents

2310
02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:05.530
Our lock'd embrasures,strangles our dear vows

2311
02:06:05.530 --> 02:06:11.930
Even in the birth of ourown labouring breath:

2312
02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:19.500
We two, that with so manythousand sighs

2313
02:06:19.500 --> 02:06:22.130
Did buy each other, mustpoorly sell ourselves

2314
02:06:22.130 --> 02:06:31.470
With the rude brevity anddischarge of one.

2315
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:38.470
Injurious time now with arobber's haste

2316
02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:44.570
Crams his rich thieveryup, he knows not how:

2317
02:06:44.870 --> 02:06:49.670
As many farewells as bestars in heaven,

2318
02:06:49.670 --> 02:06:56.470
With distinct breath andconsign'd kisses to them,

2319
02:06:56.470 --> 02:07:00.530
He fumbles up into a loseadieu,

2320
02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:06.000
And scants us with asingle famish'd kiss,

2321
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:12.570
Distasted with the salt ofbroken tears.

2322
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:16.370
[Within] My lord, is thelady ready?

2323
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:20.600
Hark! you are call'd: somesay the Genius so

2324
02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:24.230
Cries 'come' to him thatinstantly must die.

2325
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:29.830
Bid them have patience;she shall come anon.

2326
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:35.000
Where are my tears?rain, to lay this wind,

2327
02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.030
or my heart will beblown up by the root.

2328
02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:52.230
I must then to theGrecians?

2329
02:07:52.230 --> 02:07:55.570
No remedy.

2330
02:07:55.570 --> 02:07:59.700
A woful Cressid 'mongstthe merry Greeks!

2331
02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:04.700
When shall we see again?

2332
02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:09.100
Hear me, my love: be thoutrue and I will see thee--

2333
02:08:09.100 --> 02:08:13.270
I true! how now! whatwicked deem is this?

2334
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:15.400
Nay, we must useexpostulation kindly,

2335
02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:17.270
For it is parting from us:

2336
02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:19.770
I speak not 'be thoutrue,' as fearing thee,

2337
02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:20.970
For I will throw my gloveto Death himself,

2338
02:08:20.970 --> 02:08:22.630
That there's no maculationin thy heart:

2339
02:08:22.630 --> 02:08:24.600
But 'be thou true,' say I,to fashion in

2340
02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:27.270
My sequent protestation;be thou true,

2341
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:29.930
And I will see thee.

2342
02:08:29.930 --> 02:08:33.070
O, you shall be exposed,my lord, to dangers

2343
02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:36.570
As infinite as imminent!but I'll be true.

2344
02:08:36.570 --> 02:08:44.730
And I'll grow friend withdanger. Wear this sleeve.

2345
02:08:45.070 --> 02:08:52.400
And you this glove. Whenshall I see you?

2346
02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:54.130
I will corrupt the Greciansentinels,

2347
02:08:54.130 --> 02:08:57.200
To give thee nightlyvisitation.

2348
02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:00.200
But yet be true.

2349
02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:02.100
O heavens! 'be true'again!

2350
02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:03.900
Hear while I speak it,love:

2351
02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:08.530
The Grecian youths arefull of quality;

2352
02:09:08.530 --> 02:09:11.870
They're loving, well composedwith gifts of nature,

2353
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:16.230
Flowing and swelling o'erwith arts and exercise:

2354
02:09:16.230 --> 02:09:18.270
How novelty may move, andparts with person,

2355
02:09:18.270 --> 02:09:19.770
Alas, a kind of godlyjealousy--

2356
02:09:19.770 --> 02:09:21.470
Which, I beseech you, calla virtuous sin--

2357
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:23.200
Makes me afeard.

2358
02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:26.730
O heavens! you love menot.

2359
02:09:26.730 --> 02:09:28.500
Die I a villain, then!

2360
02:09:28.500 --> 02:09:30.330
In this I do not call yourfaith in question

2361
02:09:30.330 --> 02:09:34.370
So mainly as my merit: Icannot sing,

2362
02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:40.900
Nor heel the high lavolt,nor sweeten talk,

2363
02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:42.800
Nor play at subtle games;fair virtues all,

2364
02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:45.570
To which the Grecians aremost prompt and pregnant:

2365
02:09:45.570 --> 02:09:47.600
But I can tell that ineach grace of these

2366
02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.830
There lurks a still anddumb-discoursive devil

2367
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:54.670
That tempts most cunningly:but be not tempted.

2368
02:09:54.670 --> 02:09:56.670
Do you think I will?

2369
02:09:56.670 --> 02:09:59.100
No.

2370
02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:05.170
But something may be donethat we will not:

2371
02:10:05.170 --> 02:10:09.200
And sometimes we aredevils to ourselves,

2372
02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:11.000
When we will tempt thefrailty of our powers,

2373
02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.730
Presuming on theirchangeful potency.

2374
02:10:13.730 --> 02:10:16.000
Nay, good my lord,--

2375
02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.830
Come, kiss; and let uspart.

2376
02:10:19.800 --> 02:10:20.770
(from outside) Brother Troilus!

2377
02:10:20.770 --> 02:10:22.070
Good brother, come youhither;

2378
02:10:22.070 --> 02:10:27.770
And bring AEneas and theGrecian with you.

2379
02:10:30.730 --> 02:10:34.670
My lord, will you be true?

2380
02:10:34.670 --> 02:10:42.430
Who, I? alas, it is myvice, my fault:

2381
02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:45.270
Whiles others fish withcraft for great opinion,

2382
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:49.600
I with great truth catchmere simplicity;

2383
02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.630
Whilst some with cunninggild their copper crowns,

2384
02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:58.300
With truth and plainness Ido wear mine bare.

2385
02:10:58.300 --> 02:11:02.300
Fear not my truth: themoral of my wit

2386
02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:10.770
Is 'plain and true;' there'sall the reach of it.

2387
02:11:43.770 --> 02:11:48.670
Welcome, Sir Diomed! hereis the lady

2388
02:11:48.670 --> 02:11:52.630
Which for Antenor wedeliver you:

2389
02:11:52.630 --> 02:11:54.530
At the port, lord, I'llgive her to thy hand,

2390
02:11:54.530 --> 02:11:58.370
And by the way possessthee what she is.

2391
02:11:58.370 --> 02:12:03.000
Entreat her fair; and, bymy soul, fair Greek,

2392
02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:06.400
If e'er thou stand atmercy of my sword,

2393
02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:08.100
Name Cressida and thy lifeshall be as safe

2394
02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:12.870
As Priam is in Ilion.

2395
02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.270
Fair Lady Cressid,

2396
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:19.970
So please you, save thethanks this prince expects:

2397
02:12:19.970 --> 02:12:23.470
The lustre in your eye,heaven in your cheek,

2398
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:26.870
Pleads your fair usage;and to Diomed

2399
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:31.230
You shall be mistress, andcommand him wholly.

2400
02:12:31.230 --> 02:12:33.470
Grecian, thou dost not useme courteously,

2401
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:34.770
To shame the zeal of mypetition to thee

2402
02:12:34.770 --> 02:12:40.700
In praising her: I tellthee, lord of Greece,

2403
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:43.300
She is as far high-soaringo'er thy praises

2404
02:12:43.300 --> 02:12:46.900
As thou unworthy to becall'd her servant.

2405
02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:51.830
I charge thee use herwell, even for my charge;

2406
02:12:51.830 --> 02:12:53.670
For, by the dreadfulPluto, if thou dost not,

2407
02:12:53.670 --> 02:12:56.470
Though the great bulkAchilles be thy guard,

2408
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:58.000
I'll cut thy throat.

2409
02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.100
O, be not moved, PrinceTroilus:

2410
02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:01.900
Let me be privileged by myplace and message,

2411
02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:04.800
To be a speaker free; whenI am hence

2412
02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:08.170
I'll answer to my lust:and know you, lord,

2413
02:13:08.170 --> 02:13:11.430
I'll nothing do on charge:to her own worth

2414
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:16.030
She shall be prized; butthat you say 'be't so,'

2415
02:13:16.030 --> 02:13:19.570
I'll speak it in my spiritand honour, 'no.'

2416
02:13:19.570 --> 02:13:22.470
Come, to the port. I'lltell thee, Diomed,

2417
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:28.130
This brave shall oft makethee to hide thy head.

2418
02:13:28.130 --> 02:13:33.830
Lady, give me your hand,and, as we walk,

2419
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:37.400
To our own selves bend weour needful talk.

2420
02:13:38.230 --> 02:13:43.000
(Cressida stops crying)

2421
02:13:48.770 --> 02:13:54.700
(♪trumpet plays)

2422
02:13:54.700 --> 02:13:59.400
Hark! Hector's trumpet.

2423
02:14:03.130 --> 02:14:06.800
How have we spent thismorning!

2424
02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:10.000
The prince must think metardy and remiss,

2425
02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.430
That sore to ride beforehim to the field.

2426
02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:17.430
'Tis Troilus' fault: come,come, to field with him.

2427
02:14:17.430 --> 02:14:19.430
Yea, with a bridegroom'sfresh alacrity,

2428
02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:23.400
Let us address to tend onHector's heels:

2429
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:26.070
The glory of our Troy doththis day lie

2430
02:14:26.070 --> 02:14:31.170
On his fair worth andsingle chivalry.

2431
02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.470
(screams)

2432
02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:42.200
Here art thou inappointment fresh and fair,

2433
02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:45.000
Anticipating time withstarting courage.

2434
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.170
Give with thy trumpet aloud note to Troy,

2435
02:14:47.170 --> 02:14:50.370
Thou dreadful Ajax; thatthe appalled air

2436
02:14:50.370 --> 02:14:52.630
May pierce the head of thegreat combatant

2437
02:14:52.630 --> 02:14:54.970
And hale him hither.

2438
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:58.200
Thou, trumpet, there's mypurse.

2439
02:14:58.200 --> 02:15:02.400
Now crack thy lungs, andsplit thy brazen pipe:

2440
02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.170
Blow, villain, till thysphered bias cheek

2441
02:15:04.170 --> 02:15:07.500
Outswell the colic ofpuff'd Aquilon:

2442
02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:12.830
Come, stretch thy chest andlet thy eyes spout blood;

2443
02:15:12.830 --> 02:15:15.330
Thou blow'st for Hector.

2444
02:15:16.630 --> 02:15:23.730
(♪Trumpet sounds)

2445
02:15:29.070 --> 02:15:30.700
No trumpet answers.

2446
02:15:30.700 --> 02:15:33.230
'Tis but early days.

2447
02:15:33.230 --> 02:15:37.830
Is not yond Diomed, withCalchas' daughter?

2448
02:15:37.830 --> 02:15:39.630
'Tis he, I ken the mannerof his gait;

2449
02:15:39.630 --> 02:15:42.170
He rises on the toe: thatspirit of his

2450
02:15:42.170 --> 02:15:45.700
In aspiration lifts himfrom the earth.

2451
02:15:57.100 --> 02:15:59.770
Is this the Lady Cressid?

2452
02:15:59.770 --> 02:16:01.300
Even she.

2453
02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:04.230
Most dearly welcome to theGreeks, sweet lady.

2454
02:16:05.370 --> 02:16:07.870
Our general doth saluteyou with a kiss.

2455
02:16:07.870 --> 02:16:09.470
Yet is the kindness butparticular;

2456
02:16:09.470 --> 02:16:11.330
'Twere better she werekiss'd in general.

2457
02:16:11.330 --> 02:16:15.700
And very courtly counsel:I'll begin.

2458
02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:17.370
So much for Nestor.

2459
02:16:17.370 --> 02:16:21.430
I'll take what winter fromyour lips, fair lady:

2460
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:23.900
Achilles bids you welcome.

2461
02:16:23.900 --> 02:16:26.030
I had good argument forkissing once.

2462
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:28.200
But that's no argument forkissing now;

2463
02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:29.770
For this popp'd Paris inhis hardiment,

2464
02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:32.630
And parted thus you andyour argument.

2465
02:16:32.630 --> 02:16:35.670
O deadly gall, and themeof all our scorns!

2466
02:16:35.670 --> 02:16:38.570
For which we lose ourheads to gild his horns.

2467
02:16:38.570 --> 02:16:41.970
The first was Menelaus'kiss; this, mine:

2468
02:16:41.970 --> 02:16:44.030
Patroclus kisses you.

2469
02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:45.400
O, this is trim!

2470
02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.870
Paris and I kiss evermorefor him.

2471
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:50.700
I'll have my kiss, sir.Lady, by your leave.

2472
02:16:50.700 --> 02:16:53.130
In kissing, do you renderor receive?

2473
02:16:53.130 --> 02:16:54.600
Both take and give.

2474
02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:55.870
I'll make my match tolive,

2475
02:16:55.870 --> 02:16:58.170
The kiss you take isbetter than you give;

2476
02:16:58.170 --> 02:17:00.400
Therefore no kiss.

2477
02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:02.630
I'll give you boot, I'llgive you three for one.

2478
02:17:02.630 --> 02:17:05.800
You're an odd man; giveeven or give none.

2479
02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:07.800
An odd man, lady! everyman is odd.

2480
02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.870
No, Paris is not; for youknow 'tis true,

2481
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:13.200
That you are odd, and heis even with you.

2482
02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:14.370
You fillip me o' the head.

2483
02:17:14.370 --> 02:17:16.500
No, I'll be sworn.

2484
02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:18.670
It were no match, yournail against his horn.

2485
02:17:18.670 --> 02:17:21.070
May I, sweet lady, beg akiss of you?

2486
02:17:21.070 --> 02:17:21.700
You may.

2487
02:17:21.700 --> 02:17:22.700
I do desire it.

2488
02:17:22.700 --> 02:17:25.130
Why, beg, then.

2489
02:17:25.130 --> 02:17:28.230
Why then for Venus' sake,give me a kiss,

2490
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:30.300
When Helen is a maidagain, and his.

2491
02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:32.900
I am your debtor, claim itwhen 'tis due.

2492
02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:36.770
Never's my day, and then akiss of you.

2493
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:39.370
Lady, a word: I'll bringyou to your father.

2494
02:17:39.370 --> 02:17:42.630
A woman of quick sense.

2495
02:17:42.630 --> 02:17:44.230
Fie, fie upon her!

2496
02:17:44.230 --> 02:17:46.530
There's language in hereye, her cheek, her lip, her eye

2497
02:17:46.530 --> 02:17:49.830
Nay, her foot speaks;her wanton spirits look out

2498
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:51.870
At every joint and motiveof her body.

2499
02:17:51.870 --> 02:17:55.000
O, these encounterers, soglib of tongue,

2500
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.900
That give accostingwelcome ere it comes,

2501
02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:59.870
And wide unclasp thetables of their thoughts

2502
02:17:59.870 --> 02:18:02.270
To every ticklish reader!set them down

2503
02:18:02.270 --> 02:18:04.500
For sluttish spoils ofopportunity

2504
02:18:04.500 --> 02:18:07.030
And daughters of the game.

2505
02:18:07.030 --> 02:18:09.170
(♪ Trojans' trumpet sounds)

2506
02:18:09.170 --> 02:18:11.630
Yonder comes the troop.

2507
02:18:12.730 --> 02:18:17.370
Hail, all you state ofGreece! what shall be done

2508
02:18:17.370 --> 02:18:19.900
To him that victorycommands? or do you purpose

2509
02:18:19.900 --> 02:18:22.270
A victor shall be known?will you the knights

2510
02:18:22.270 --> 02:18:24.330
Shall to the edge of allextremity

2511
02:18:24.330 --> 02:18:26.270
Pursue each other, orshall be divided

2512
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:29.200
By any voice or order ofthe field?

2513
02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.070
Hector bade ask.

2514
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:31.330
Which way would Hectorhave it?

2515
02:18:31.330 --> 02:18:33.970
He cares not; he'll obeyconditions.

2516
02:18:33.970 --> 02:18:36.930
'Tis done like Hector; butsecurely done,

2517
02:18:36.930 --> 02:18:40.530
A little proudly, andgreat deal misprizing

2518
02:18:40.530 --> 02:18:42.570
The knight opposed.

2519
02:18:42.570 --> 02:18:43.530
If not Achilles, sir,

2520
02:18:43.530 --> 02:18:44.570
What is your name?

2521
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:47.430
If not Achilles, nothing.

2522
02:18:47.430 --> 02:18:52.470
Therefore Achilles: but,whate'er, know this:

2523
02:18:52.470 --> 02:18:54.700
In the extremity of greatand little,

2524
02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:57.900
Valour and pride excelthemselves in Hector;

2525
02:18:57.900 --> 02:19:00.370
The one almost as infiniteas all,

2526
02:19:00.370 --> 02:19:04.800
The other blank asnothing. Weigh him well,

2527
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:09.030
And that which looks likepride is courtesy.

2528
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:14.530
This Ajax is half made ofHector's blood:

2529
02:19:14.530 --> 02:19:17.430
In love whereof, halfHector stays at home;

2530
02:19:17.430 --> 02:19:20.700
Half heart, half hand,half Hector comes to seek

2531
02:19:20.700 --> 02:19:24.600
This blended knight, halfTrojan and half Greek.

2532
02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:27.530
A maiden battle, then? O,I perceive you.

2533
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:29.900
Here is Sir Diomed. Go,gentle knight,

2534
02:19:29.900 --> 02:19:32.270
Stand by our Ajax: as youand Lord AEneas

2535
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:33.800
Consent upon the order oftheir fight,

2536
02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:36.370
So be it; either to theuttermost,

2537
02:19:36.370 --> 02:19:39.630
Or else a breath: thecombatants being kin

2538
02:19:39.630 --> 02:19:42.500
Half stints their strifebefore their strokes begin.

2539
02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:44.330
They are opposed already.

2540
02:19:44.330 --> 02:19:47.070
What Trojan is that samethat looks so heavy?

2541
02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:49.670
The youngest son ofPriam, a true knight,

2542
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:50.670
they call him Troilus.

2543
02:19:50.670 --> 02:19:54.300
Not yet mature, yetmatchless, firm of word,

2544
02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:56.700
Speaking in deeds anddeedless in his tongue;

2545
02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:59.770
Not soon provoked nor beingprovoked soon calm'd:

2546
02:19:59.770 --> 02:20:02.570
His heart and hand bothopen and both free;

2547
02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:06.200
For what he has he gives,what thinks he shows;

2548
02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:09.000
Yet gives he not tilljudgment guide his bounty,

2549
02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:11.570
Manly as Hector, but moredangerous;

2550
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:14.100
For Hector in his blaze ofwrath subscribes

2551
02:20:14.100 --> 02:20:16.470
To tender objects, but hein heat of action

2552
02:20:16.470 --> 02:20:18.500
Is more vindicative thanjealous love:

2553
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:20.630
They call him Troilus, andon him erect

2554
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:22.700
A second hope, as fairlybuilt as Hector.

2555
02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:25.170
Thus says AEneas; one thatknows the youth

2556
02:20:25.170 --> 02:20:26.670
Even to his inches, andwith private soul

2557
02:20:26.670 --> 02:20:27.670
They are in action.

2558
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:29.930
Did in great Ilion thustranslate him to me.

2559
02:20:29.930 --> 02:20:31.930
They are in action.

2560
02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:48.030
You must no more.

2561
02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:49.470
Princes, enough, so pleaseyou.

2562
02:20:49.470 --> 02:20:50.530
I am not warm yet; let usfight again.

2563
02:20:50.530 --> 02:20:52.130
As Hector pleases.

2564
02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:53.630
Why, then will I no more:

2565
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:56.970
Thou art, great lord, myfather's sister's son,

2566
02:20:56.970 --> 02:20:59.770
A cousin-german to greatPriam's seed;

2567
02:20:59.770 --> 02:21:01.100
The obligation of ourblood forbids

2568
02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:03.430
A gory emulation 'twixt ustwain:

2569
02:21:03.430 --> 02:21:05.600
Were thy commixtion Greekand Trojan so

2570
02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:07.700
That thou couldst say'This hand is Grecian all,

2571
02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:09.300
And this is Trojan; thesinews of this leg

2572
02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:11.600
All Greek, and this allTroy; my mother's blood

2573
02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:13.370
Runs on the dexter cheek,and this sinister

2574
02:21:13.370 --> 02:21:16.330
Bounds in my father's;' byJove multipotent,

2575
02:21:16.330 --> 02:21:18.100
Thou shouldst not bearfrom me a Greekish member

2576
02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:19.430
Wherein my sword had notimpressure made

2577
02:21:19.430 --> 02:21:23.630
Of our rank feud: but thejust gods gainsay

2578
02:21:23.630 --> 02:21:25.900
That any drop thouborrow'dst from thy mother,

2579
02:21:25.900 --> 02:21:29.330
My sacred aunt, should bymy mortal sword

2580
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:33.330
Be drain'd! Let me embracethee, Ajax:

2581
02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:37.700
By him that thunders, thouhast lusty arms;

2582
02:21:37.700 --> 02:21:41.170
Hector would have themfall upon him thus:

2583
02:21:41.170 --> 02:21:45.600
Cousin, all honour tothee!

2584
02:21:46.970 --> 02:21:49.000
I thank thee, Hector

2585
02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.030
Thou art too gentle andtoo free a man:

2586
02:21:52.330 --> 02:21:55.870
I came to kill thee,cousin, and bear hence

2587
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:57.730
A great addition earned inthy death.

2588
02:21:57.730 --> 02:21:59.300
Not Neoptolemus somirable,

2589
02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:01.400
On whose bright crest Famewith her loud'st Oyes

2590
02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:04.230
Cries 'This is he,' couldpromise to himself

2591
02:22:04.230 --> 02:22:06.930
A thought of added honourtorn from Hector.

2592
02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.530
There is expectance herefrom both the sides,

2593
02:22:11.530 --> 02:22:12.670
What further you will do.

2594
02:22:12.670 --> 02:22:13.600
We'll answer it;

2595
02:22:13.600 --> 02:22:17.530
The issue is embracement:Ajax, farewell.

2596
02:22:17.530 --> 02:22:19.370
If I might in entreatiesfind success--

2597
02:22:19.370 --> 02:22:21.670
As seld I have thechance--I would desire

2598
02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:25.200
My famous cousin to ourGrecian tents.

2599
02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:28.130
'Tis Agamemnon's wish, andgreat Achilles

2600
02:22:28.130 --> 02:22:31.200
Doth long to see unarm'dthe valiant Hector.

2601
02:22:31.430 --> 02:22:33.730
AEneas, call my brotherTroilus to me,

2602
02:22:33.730 --> 02:22:35.270
And signify this lovinginterview

2603
02:22:35.270 --> 02:22:36.800
To the expecters of ourTrojan part;

2604
02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:40.130
Desire them home. Give methy hand, my cousin;

2605
02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:45.570
I will go eat with theeand see your knights.

2606
02:22:46.270 --> 02:22:48.130
Great Agamemnon comes tomeet us here.

2607
02:22:48.130 --> 02:22:50.970
The worthiest of them tellme name by name;

2608
02:22:50.970 --> 02:22:53.130
But for Achilles, mine ownsearching eyes

2609
02:22:53.130 --> 02:22:56.370
Shall find him by hislarge and portly size.

2610
02:22:56.370 --> 02:22:58.930
Worthy of arms! as welcomeas to one

2611
02:22:58.930 --> 02:23:00.730
That would be rid of suchan enemy;

2612
02:23:00.730 --> 02:23:03.430
But that's no welcome:understand more clear,

2613
02:23:03.430 --> 02:23:05.730
What's past and what's tocome is strew'd with husks

2614
02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:07.970
And formless ruin ofoblivion;

2615
02:23:07.970 --> 02:23:10.730
But in this extant moment,faith and troth,

2616
02:23:10.730 --> 02:23:13.530
Strain'd purely from allhollow bias-drawing,

2617
02:23:13.530 --> 02:23:16.730
Bids thee, with mostdivine integrity,

2618
02:23:16.730 --> 02:23:20.100
From heart of very heart,great Hector, welcome.

2619
02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:22.270
I thank thee, mostimperious Agamemnon.

2620
02:23:22.270 --> 02:23:26.370
My well-famed lord ofTroy, no less to you.

2621
02:23:26.370 --> 02:23:27.870
Let me confirm my princelybrother's greeting:

2622
02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:31.670
You brace of warlikebrothers, welcome hither.

2623
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:32.470
Who must we answer?

2624
02:23:32.470 --> 02:23:34.000
The noble Menelaus.

2625
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.330
O, you, my lord? by Marshis gauntlet, thanks!

2626
02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:40.330
Mock not, that I affectthe untraded oath;

2627
02:23:40.330 --> 02:23:45.170
Your quondam wife swearsstill by Venus' glove:

2628
02:23:45.170 --> 02:23:47.870
She's well, but bade menot commend her to you.

2629
02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:51.000
Name her not now, sir;she's a deadly theme.

2630
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.870
O, pardon; I offend.

2631
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:55.700
I have, thou gallantTrojan, seen thee oft

2632
02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:57.700
Labouring for destiny makecruel way

2633
02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:00.370
Through ranks of Greekishyouth, and I have seen thee,

2634
02:24:00.370 --> 02:24:03.230
As hot as Perseus, spurthy Phrygian steed,

2635
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:05.830
Despising many forfeitsand subduements,

2636
02:24:05.830 --> 02:24:08.030
When thou hast hung thyadvanced sword i' the air,

2637
02:24:08.030 --> 02:24:09.870
Not letting it decline onthe declined,

2638
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:13.230
That I have said to somemy standers by

2639
02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:15.600
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder,dealing life!'

2640
02:24:15.600 --> 02:24:18.700
And I have seen thee pauseand take thy breath,

2641
02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:20.130
When that a ring of Greekshave hemm'd thee in,

2642
02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:24.130
Like an Olympian wrestling:this have I seen;

2643
02:24:24.130 --> 02:24:26.430
But this thy countenance,still lock'd in steel,

2644
02:24:26.430 --> 02:24:33.430
I never saw till now. Iknew thy grandsire,

2645
02:24:33.430 --> 02:24:36.170
And once fought with him:he was a soldier good;

2646
02:24:36.170 --> 02:24:38.430
But, by great Mars, thecaptain of us all,

2647
02:24:38.430 --> 02:24:43.100
Never saw like thee. Letan old man embrace thee;

2648
02:24:43.100 --> 02:24:48.370
And, worthy warrior,welcome to our tents.

2649
02:24:48.370 --> 02:24:51.630
'Tis the old Nestor.

2650
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:53.930
Let me embrace thee, goodold chronicle,

2651
02:24:53.930 --> 02:24:56.930
That hast so long walk'dhand in hand with time:

2652
02:24:56.930 --> 02:24:59.930
Most reverend Nestor, I amglad to clasp thee.

2653
02:24:59.930 --> 02:25:02.900
I would my arms couldmatch thee in contention,

2654
02:25:02.900 --> 02:25:05.900
As they contend with theein courtesy.

2655
02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:06.170
I would they could.

2656
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:07.330
Ha!

2657
02:25:07.330 --> 02:25:08.370
By this white beard, I'ldfight with thee to-morrow.

2658
02:25:08.370 --> 02:25:11.200
Well, welcome, welcome! Ihave seen the time.

2659
02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:15.400
I wonder now how yondercity stands

2660
02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:18.200
When we have here her baseand pillar by us.

2661
02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:20.200
I know your favour, LordUlysses, well.

2662
02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:21.600
Ah, sir, there's many aGreek and Trojan dead,

2663
02:25:21.600 --> 02:25:23.230
Since first I saw yourselfand Diomed

2664
02:25:23.230 --> 02:25:25.970
In Ilion, on your Greekishembassy.

2665
02:25:25.970 --> 02:25:27.930
Sir, I foretold you thenwhat would ensue:

2666
02:25:27.930 --> 02:25:30.430
My prophecy is but halfhis journey yet;

2667
02:25:30.430 --> 02:25:33.270
For yonder walls, thatpertly front your town,

2668
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:36.600
Yond towers, whose wantontops do buss the clouds,

2669
02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:39.430
Must kiss their own feet.

2670
02:25:39.430 --> 02:25:41.930
I must not believe you:

2671
02:25:41.930 --> 02:25:44.070
There they stand yet, andmodestly I think,

2672
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:47.000
The fall of every Phrygianstone will cost

2673
02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.130
A drop of Grecian blood:the end crowns all,

2674
02:25:52.130 --> 02:25:54.000
And that oldcommon arbitrator,

2675
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.730
Time, Will one day end it.

2676
02:25:56.730 --> 02:25:57.730
So to him we leave it.

2677
02:25:57.730 --> 02:26:00.370
Most gentle and mostvaliant Hector, welcome:

2678
02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:01.970
After the general, Ibeseech you next

2679
02:26:01.970 --> 02:26:06.130
To feast with me and seeme at my tent.

2680
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:14.800
I shall forestall thee,Lord Ulysses, thou!

2681
02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.030
Now, Hector, I have fedmine eyes on thee;

2682
02:26:19.030 --> 02:26:23.200
I have with exact viewperused thee, Hector,

2683
02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:25.930
And quoted joint by joint.

2684
02:26:25.930 --> 02:26:27.070
Is this Achilles?

2685
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:28.670
I am Achilles.

2686
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:31.730
Stand fair, I pray thee:let me look on thee.

2687
02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:34.800
Behold thy fill.

2688
02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:36.270
Nay, I have done already.

2689
02:26:36.270 --> 02:26:39.000
Thou art too brief: I willthe second time,

2690
02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:43.000
As I would buy thee, viewthee limb by limb.

2691
02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:46.830
O, like a book of sportthou'lt read me o'er;

2692
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:51.770
But there's more in methan thou understand'st.

2693
02:26:52.030 --> 02:26:54.700
Why dost thou so oppressme with thine eye?

2694
02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:56.670
Tell me, you heavens, inwhich part of his body

2695
02:26:56.670 --> 02:27:00.070
Shall I destroy him? whetherthere, or there, or there?

2696
02:27:00.070 --> 02:27:02.730
That I may give the localwound a name

2697
02:27:02.730 --> 02:27:05.030
And make distinct the verybreach whereout

2698
02:27:05.030 --> 02:27:08.900
Hector's great spiritflew: answer me, heavens!

2699
02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:11.070
It would discredit theblest gods, proud man,

2700
02:27:11.070 --> 02:27:17.300
To answer such a question:stand again:

2701
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:19.730
Think'st thou to catch mylife so pleasantly

2702
02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:21.770
As to prenominate in niceconjecture

2703
02:27:21.770 --> 02:27:23.200
Where thou wilt hit medead?

2704
02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:25.000
I tell thee, yea.

2705
02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.370
Wert thou an oracle totell me so,

2706
02:27:26.370 --> 02:27:32.170
I'd not believe thee.Henceforth guard thee well;

2707
02:27:32.170 --> 02:27:35.000
For I'll not kill theethere, nor there, nor there;

2708
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:36.470
But, by the forge thatstithied Mars his helm,

2709
02:27:36.470 --> 02:27:41.530
I'll kill thee everywhere, yea, o'er and o'er.

2710
02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:46.730
You wisest Grecians,pardon me this brag;

2711
02:27:46.730 --> 02:27:50.300
His insolence draws follyfrom my lips;

2712
02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:52.500
But I'll endeavour deedsto match these words,

2713
02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:54.030
Or may I never--

2714
02:27:54.030 --> 02:27:58.530
Do not chafe thee, cousin:

2715
02:27:58.530 --> 02:28:00.570
And you, Achilles, letthese threats alone,

2716
02:28:00.570 --> 02:28:02.700
Till accident or purposebring you to't:

2717
02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:05.470
You may have every dayenough of Hector

2718
02:28:05.470 --> 02:28:09.030
If you have stomach; thegeneral state, I fear,

2719
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:12.900
Can scarce entreat you tobe odd with him.

2720
02:28:13.230 --> 02:28:16.430
I pray you, let us see youin the field:

2721
02:28:16.430 --> 02:28:18.730
We have had pelting wars,since you refused

2722
02:28:18.730 --> 02:28:21.630
The Grecians' cause.

2723
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:25.230
Dost thou entreat me,Hector?

2724
02:28:25.230 --> 02:28:28.770
To-morrow do I meet thee,fell as death;

2725
02:28:28.770 --> 02:28:30.530
To-night all friends.

2726
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:33.070
Thy hand upon that match.

2727
02:28:33.070 --> 02:28:36.370
First, all you peers ofGreece, go to my tent;

2728
02:28:36.370 --> 02:28:38.570
There in the full convivewe: afterwards,

2729
02:28:38.570 --> 02:28:42.270
As Hector's leisure andyour bounties shall

2730
02:28:42.270 --> 02:28:47.000
Concur together, severallyentreat him.

2731
02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.370
Beat loud the tabourines,let the trumpets blow,

2732
02:28:50.370 --> 02:28:53.400
That this great soldiermay his welcome know.

2733
02:29:07.900 --> 02:29:11.570
My Lord Ulysses, tell me,I beseech you,

2734
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:14.130
In what place of the fielddoth Calchas keep?

2735
02:29:14.130 --> 02:29:17.030
At Menelaus' tent, mostprincely Troilus:

2736
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:19.830
There Diomed doth feastwith him to-night;

2737
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:21.930
Who neither looks upon theheaven nor earth,

2738
02:29:21.930 --> 02:29:24.270
But gives all gaze andbent of amorous view

2739
02:29:24.270 --> 02:29:27.200
On the fair Cressid.

2740
02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:30.330
Shall sweet lord, be boundto you so much,

2741
02:29:30.330 --> 02:29:31.870
After we part fromAgamemnon's tent,

2742
02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:32.870
To bring me thither?

2743
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:34.130
You shall command me, sir.

2744
02:29:34.130 --> 02:29:37.470
As gentle tell me,of what honour was

2745
02:29:37.470 --> 02:29:41.400
This Cressida in Troy?Had she no lover there

2746
02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:44.970
That wails her absence?

2747
02:29:44.970 --> 02:29:49.670
O, sir, to such asboasting show their scars

2748
02:29:49.670 --> 02:29:54.400
A mock is due. Will youwalk on, my lord?

2749
02:29:54.730 --> 02:29:58.900
She was beloved, sheloved; she is, and doth:

2750
02:29:58.900 --> 02:30:04.130
But still sweet love isfood for fortune's tooth.

2751
02:30:05.170 --> 02:30:13.900


2752
02:30:16.470 --> 02:30:19.570
I'll heat his blood withGreekish wine to-night,

2753
02:30:19.570 --> 02:30:22.800
Which with my scimitarI'll cool to-morrow.

2754
02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:25.030
Patroclus, let us feasthim to the height.

2755
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:26.630
Here comes Thersites.

2756
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:28.970
How now, thou core ofenvy!

2757
02:30:28.970 --> 02:30:31.800
Thou crusty batch ofnature, what's the news?

2758
02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:34.000
Why, thou picture ofwhat thou seemest,

2759
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.070
and idol of idiot worshippers,here's a letter for thee.

2760
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:38.330
From whence, fragment?

2761
02:30:38.330 --> 02:30:41.970
Why, thou full dish offool, from Troy.

2762
02:30:41.970 --> 02:30:43.670
Well said, adversity!

2763
02:30:43.670 --> 02:30:48.500
Prithee, be silent, boy; Iprofit not by thy talk:

2764
02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:51.730
thou art thought to beAchilles' male varlet.

2765
02:30:51.730 --> 02:30:54.900
Male varlet, you rogue!what's that?

2766
02:30:54.900 --> 02:30:58.600
Why, his masculine whore.Now, the rotten diseases

2767
02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:02.530
of the south, the guts-griping,ruptures, catarrhs,

2768
02:31:02.530 --> 02:31:05.800
loads o' gravel i' the back,cold palsies, raw eyes,

2769
02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:11.130
dirt-rotten livers,wheezing lungs, sciaticas,

2770
02:31:11.130 --> 02:31:12.830
incurable bone-ache,

2771
02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:15.970
take and take again suchpreposterous discoveries!

2772
02:31:15.970 --> 02:31:17.400
Why thou damnablebox of envy, thou,

2773
02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:19.130
what meanest thouto curse thus?

2774
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:20.470
Do I curse thee?

2775
02:31:20.470 --> 02:31:22.100
Why no, you ruinous butt,you whoreson

2776
02:31:22.100 --> 02:31:23.900
indistinguishable cur, no.

2777
02:31:23.900 --> 02:31:26.370
No! why art thou thenexasperate, thou idle

2778
02:31:26.370 --> 02:31:30.670
immaterial skein of sleave-silk,

2779
02:31:30.670 --> 02:31:33.800
thou tassel of a prodigal'spurse, thou?

2780
02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:37.870
Ah, how the poorworld is pestered

2781
02:31:37.870 --> 02:31:44.300
with such waterflies,diminutives of nature!

2782
02:31:44.300 --> 02:31:44.670
Out, gall!

2783
02:31:44.670 --> 02:31:45.530
Finch-egg!

2784
02:31:45.530 --> 02:31:48.130
My sweet Patroclus, I amthwarted quite

2785
02:31:48.130 --> 02:31:51.500
From my great purpose into-morrow's battle.

2786
02:31:51.500 --> 02:31:53.670
Here is a letter fromQueen Hecuba,

2787
02:31:53.670 --> 02:31:56.470
A token from her daughter,my fair love,

2788
02:31:56.470 --> 02:31:58.970
Both taxing me and gagingme to keep

2789
02:31:58.970 --> 02:32:03.370
An oath that I have sworn.I will not break it:

2790
02:32:03.370 --> 02:32:06.100
Fall Greeks; fail fame;honour or go or stay;

2791
02:32:06.100 --> 02:32:11.430
My major vow lies here,this I'll obey.

2792
02:32:11.430 --> 02:32:14.000
Come, come, Thersites,help to trim my tent:

2793
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.730
This night in banquetingmust all be spent.

2794
02:32:16.730 --> 02:32:18.730
Away, Patroclus!

2795
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:22.330
With too much bloodand too little brain,

2796
02:32:22.330 --> 02:32:26.230
these two may run mad; but,if with too much brain

2797
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:29.930
and too little blood they do,I'll be a curer of madmen.

2798
02:32:29.930 --> 02:32:32.170
Here's Agamemnon,

2799
02:32:32.170 --> 02:32:35.430
an honest fellow enough andone that loves quails;

2800
02:32:35.430 --> 02:32:39.770
but he has not so muchbrain as earwax:

2801
02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:40.670
O, his brother, thebull,--the primitive statue,

2802
02:32:40.670 --> 02:32:43.500
and oblique memorialof cuckolds;

2803
02:32:43.500 --> 02:32:45.730
To be a dog, a mule, a cat, afitchew, a toad, a lizard,

2804
02:32:45.730 --> 02:32:47.230
an owl, or aherring without a roe,

2805
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:50.730
I would not care;but to be Menelaus,

2806
02:32:50.730 --> 02:32:53.830
I would conspireagainst destiny.

2807
02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:57.070
Hey-day! spiritsand fires!

2808
02:33:00.730 --> 02:33:02.570
Oh yes. Oh yes.

2809
02:33:02.570 --> 02:33:05.030
We go wrong, we go wrong.

2810
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.900
No, yonder 'tis;

2811
02:33:05.900 --> 02:33:07.100
There, where we see thelights.

2812
02:33:07.100 --> 02:33:07.800
I trouble you.

2813
02:33:07.800 --> 02:33:09.370
No, not a whit.

2814
02:33:09.370 --> 02:33:10.900
Here comes himself toguide you.

2815
02:33:10.900 --> 02:33:12.530
Welcome, brave Hector;welcome, princes all.

2816
02:33:12.530 --> 02:33:17.930
So now, fair prince ofTroy, I bid good night.

2817
02:33:17.930 --> 02:33:20.300
Ajax commands the guard totend on you.

2818
02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:21.970
Thanks and good night tothe Greeks' general.

2819
02:33:21.970 --> 02:33:24.400
Good night, my lord.

2820
02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:26.100
Good night, sweet lordMenelaus.

2821
02:33:26.100 --> 02:33:28.070
Good night and welcome,both at once,

2822
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:29.670
to those That go or tarry.

2823
02:33:29.670 --> 02:33:32.570
Old Nestor tarries; andyou too, Diomed,

2824
02:33:32.570 --> 02:33:34.300
Keep Hector company anhour or two.

2825
02:33:34.300 --> 02:33:36.170
I cannot, lord; I haveimportant business,

2826
02:33:36.170 --> 02:33:40.970
The tide whereof is now.Good night, great Hector.

2827
02:33:40.970 --> 02:33:42.030
Give me your hand.

2828
02:33:42.030 --> 02:33:43.100
Sir. Goodnight.

2829
02:33:43.100 --> 02:33:45.430
Come. Into my tent.

2830
02:33:45.430 --> 02:33:47.530
Follow his torch; hegoes to Calchas' tent:

2831
02:33:47.530 --> 02:33:48.430
I'll keep you company.

2832
02:33:48.430 --> 02:33:51.700
Sweet sir, you honour me.

2833
02:33:51.700 --> 02:33:56.030
That same Diomed's afalse-hearted rogue,

2834
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:57.800
a most unjust knave;

2835
02:33:57.800 --> 02:33:59.730
I will no more trusthim when he leers

2836
02:33:59.730 --> 02:34:02.870
than I will a serpentwhen he hisses:

2837
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:05.830
they say he keeps a Trojandrab,

2838
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:09.270
and uses the traitorCalchas' tent:

2839
02:34:09.270 --> 02:34:16.830
I'll after. Nothing but lechery!all incontinent varlets!

2840
02:34:32.030 --> 02:34:34.170
What, are you up here, ho?speak.

2841
02:34:34.170 --> 02:34:35.400
Who calls?

2842
02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:38.630
Diomed. Where'syour daughter?

2843
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:41.200
She comes to you.

2844
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:54.100
How now, my charge!

Now, my sweet guardian!Hark, a word with you.

2846

Yea, so familiar!

2847
02:35:01.330 --> 02:35:04.600
She will sing any man atfirst sight.

2848
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:06.870
Will you remember?

2849
02:35:06.870 --> 02:35:09.570
Remember! yes.

2850
02:35:09.570 --> 02:35:11.370
Nay, but do, then;

2851
02:35:11.370 --> 02:35:14.230
And let your mind becoupled with your words.

2852
02:35:14.230 --> 02:35:15.600
What should she remember?

2853
02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:17.170
List.

2854
02:35:17.170 --> 02:35:22.100
Sweet honey Greek, temptme no more to folly.

2855
02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:24.300
Roguery!

2856
02:35:24.300 --> 02:35:25.230
Nay, then,--

2857
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:26.230
I'll tell you what,--

2858
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:28.770
Foh, foh! come, tell apin: you are forsworn.

2859
02:35:28.770 --> 02:35:34.170
In faith, I cannot: whatwould you have me do?

2860
02:35:34.170 --> 02:35:38.270
A juggling trick,--to besecretly open.

2861
02:35:38.270 --> 02:35:41.970
What did you swear youwould bestow on me?

2862
02:35:41.970 --> 02:35:44.230
I prithee, do not hold meto mine oath;

2863
02:35:44.230 --> 02:35:49.070
Bid me do any thing butthat, sweet Greek.

2864
02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:52.530
Good night.

2865
02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:55.400
Diomed,--

2866
02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:57.970
No, no, good night: I'llbe your fool no more.

2867
02:35:57.970 --> 02:36:00.600
Thy better must.

2868
02:36:00.600 --> 02:36:02.200
Hark, one word in yourear.

2869
02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:04.470
O plague and madness!

2870
02:36:04.470 --> 02:36:07.000
You are moved, prince; letus depart, I pray you,

2871
02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.530
Lest your displeasureshould enlarge itself

2872
02:36:08.530 --> 02:36:10.730
To wrathful terms: thisplace is dangerous;

2873
02:36:10.730 --> 02:36:11.430
I beseech you, go.

2874
02:36:11.430 --> 02:36:12.600
Behold, I pray you!

2875
02:36:12.600 --> 02:36:14.530
Nay, good my lord, go off:

You flow to greatdistraction; come, my lord.

2877
02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:17.330
I pray thee, stay.

2878
02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:19.700
You have not patience;come.

2879
02:36:19.700 --> 02:36:21.100
I pray you, stay; by helland all hell's torments

2880
02:36:21.100 --> 02:36:22.730
I will not speak a word!

2881
02:36:22.730 --> 02:36:24.000
And so, good night.

2882
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.100
Nay, but you part inanger.

2883
02:36:26.100 --> 02:36:27.500
Doth that grieve thee?

2884
02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:28.730
O wither'd truth!

2885
02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:29.430
Why, how now, Trojan!

2886
02:36:29.430 --> 02:36:31.430
By Jove, I willbe patient.

2887
02:36:31.430 --> 02:36:33.800
Guardian!--why, Greek!

2888
02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:36.300
Foh, foh! adieu; youpalter.

2889
02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:41.770
In faith, I do not: comehither once again.

2890
02:36:55.170 --> 02:36:57.470
She strokes his cheek!

2891
02:36:57.470 --> 02:36:59.700
Come, come.

2892
02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:01.700
Nay, stay; by Jove, I willnot speak a word:

2893
02:37:01.700 --> 02:37:03.130
There is between my willand all offences

2894
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:06.630
A guard of patience: staya little while.

2895
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:12.200
How the devil Luxury, with hisfat rump and potato-finger,

2896
02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:17.170
tickles these together!Fry, lechery, fry!

2897
02:37:17.670 --> 02:37:20.870
But will you, then?

2898
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:24.900
In faith, I will, la;never trust me else.

2899
02:37:24.900 --> 02:37:32.530
Give me some token for thesurety of it.

2900
02:37:33.900 --> 02:37:38.630
I'll fetch you one.

2901
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:40.370
You have sworn patience.

2902
02:37:40.370 --> 02:37:42.100
Fear me not, sweet lord;

2903
02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:44.330
I will not be myself, norhave cognition

2904
02:37:44.330 --> 02:37:46.500
Of what I feel: I am allpatience.

2905
02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:50.770
Here, Diomed, keep thissleeve.

2906
02:37:50.770 --> 02:37:52.830
O beauty! where is thyfaith?

2907
02:37:52.830 --> 02:37:53.700
My lord,--

2908
02:37:53.700 --> 02:37:56.100
I will be patient;outwardly I will.

2909
02:37:56.100 --> 02:38:00.430
You look upon that sleeve;behold it well.

2910
02:38:00.430 --> 02:38:06.530
He loved me--O falsewench!--Give't me again.

2911
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:09.000
Whose was't?

2912
02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:12.530
It is no matter, now Ihave't again.

2913
02:38:12.530 --> 02:38:15.530
I will not meet with youto-morrow night:

2914
02:38:15.530 --> 02:38:18.570
I prithee, Diomed, visitme no more.

2915
02:38:18.570 --> 02:38:25.170
Now she sharpens: wellsaid, whetstone!

2916
02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:25.970
I shall have it.

2917
02:38:25.970 --> 02:38:26.800
What, this?

2918
02:38:26.800 --> 02:38:29.330
Ay, that.

2919
02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:37.570
O, all you gods! O pretty,pretty pledge!

2920
02:38:38.730 --> 02:38:40.870
Thy master now liesthinking in his bed

2921
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:47.630
Of thee and me, and sighs,and takes my glove,

2922
02:38:47.630 --> 02:38:51.030
And gives memorial daintykisses to it,

2923
02:38:51.030 --> 02:38:53.630
As I kiss thee. Nay, donot snatch it from me;

2924
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:55.570
He that takes that dothtake my heart withal.

2925
02:38:55.570 --> 02:38:58.330
I had your heart before,this follows it.

2926
02:38:58.330 --> 02:39:01.500
I did swear patience.

2927
02:39:01.500 --> 02:39:04.830
You shall not have it,Diomed; faith, you shall not;

2928
02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:06.030
I'll give you somethingelse.

2929
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:07.170
I will have this: whosewas it?

2930
02:39:07.170 --> 02:39:08.000
It is no matter.

2931
02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.470
Come, tell me whose itwas.

2932
02:39:09.470 --> 02:39:11.270
'Twas one's that loved mebetter than you will.

2933
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:12.800
But, now you have it,take it.

2934
02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:13.700
Whose was it?

2935
02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:14.970
By all Diana'swaiting-women yond,

2936
02:39:14.970 --> 02:39:17.770
And by herself, I will nottell you whose.

2937
02:39:17.770 --> 02:39:21.000
To-morrow will I wear iton my helm,

2938
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:24.300
And grieve his spirit thatdares not challenge it.

2939
02:39:24.300 --> 02:39:25.970
Wert thou the devil, andworest it on thy horn,

2940
02:39:25.970 --> 02:39:29.530
It should be challenged.

2941
02:39:29.930 --> 02:39:43.130
Well, well, 'tis done, 'tispast: and yet it is not;

2942
02:39:44.830 --> 02:39:47.270
I will not keep my word.

2943
02:39:47.270 --> 02:39:49.500
Why, then, farewell;

2944
02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:51.100
Thou never shalt mockDiomed again.

2945
02:39:51.100 --> 02:39:54.330
You shall not go: onecannot speak a word,

2946
02:39:54.330 --> 02:39:56.570
But it straight startsyou.

2947
02:39:57.070 --> 02:40:04.370
I do not like thisfooling.

2948
02:40:04.370 --> 02:40:10.500
What, shall I come? thehour?

2949
02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:22.530
Ay, come:--O Jove!--docome:--I shall be plagued.

2950
02:40:22.530 --> 02:40:27.070
Farewell till then.

2951
02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:35.170
Good night: I prithee,come.

2952
02:40:58.630 --> 02:41:03.070
But with my heart theother eye doth see.

2953
02:41:03.070 --> 02:41:10.570
Ah, poor our sex! thisfault in us I find,

2954
02:41:10.570 --> 02:41:14.170
The error of our eyedirects our mind:

2955
02:41:14.170 --> 02:41:18.400
What error leads must err;

2956
02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:29.270
O, then conclude Minds sway'dby eyes are full of turpitude.

2957
02:42:08.170 --> 02:42:11.500
All's done, my lord.

2958
02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:14.200
It is.

2959
02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:20.430
Why stay we, then?

2960
02:42:20.430 --> 02:42:26.230
To make a recordation tomy soul

2961
02:42:26.230 --> 02:42:35.330
Of every syllable thathere was spoke.

2962
02:42:35.330 --> 02:42:39.670
But if I tell how thesetwo did co-act,

2963
02:42:39.670 --> 02:42:47.630
Shall I not lie inpublishing a truth?

2964
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:49.570
Sith yet there is acredence in my heart,

2965
02:42:49.570 --> 02:42:51.700
An esperance soobstinately strong,

2966
02:42:51.700 --> 02:42:57.800
That doth invert theattest of eyes and ears,

2967
02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:00.370
As if those organs haddeceptious functions,

2968
02:43:00.370 --> 02:43:05.000
Created only tocalumniate.

2969
02:43:06.970 --> 02:43:09.700
Was Cressid here?

2970
02:43:09.700 --> 02:43:12.800
I cannot conjure, Trojan.

2971
02:43:13.430 --> 02:43:15.370
She was not, sure.

2972
02:43:15.370 --> 02:43:16.330
Most sure she was.

2973
02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:18.330
Why, my negation hath notaste of madness.

2974
02:43:18.330 --> 02:43:20.800
Nor mine, my lord: Cressidwas here but now.

2975
02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:28.270
Let it not be believed forwomanhood!

2976
02:43:28.270 --> 02:43:35.500
Think, we had mothers; donot give advantage

2977
02:43:35.500 --> 02:43:38.270
To stubborn critics, apt,without a theme,

2978
02:43:38.270 --> 02:43:39.770
For depravation, to squarethe general sex

2979
02:43:39.770 --> 02:43:46.070
By Cressid's rule: ratherthink this not Cressid.

2980
02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:52.570
What hath she done, prince,that can soil our mothers?

2981
02:43:52.570 --> 02:44:00.570
Nothing at all, unlessthat this were she.

2982
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:13.570
This she? no, this isDiomed's Cressida:

2983
02:44:13.570 --> 02:44:20.330
If beauty have a soul,this is not she;

2984
02:44:20.330 --> 02:44:23.370
If souls guide vows, ifvows be sanctimonies,

2985
02:44:23.370 --> 02:44:25.530
If sanctimony be the gods'delight,

2986
02:44:25.530 --> 02:44:28.730
If there be rule in unityitself,

2987
02:44:28.730 --> 02:44:39.470
This is not she. O madnessof discourse,

2988
02:44:39.470 --> 02:44:46.130
That cause sets up withand against itself!

2989
02:44:46.130 --> 02:44:50.930
Bi-fold authority! wherereason can revolt

2990
02:44:50.930 --> 02:44:54.600
Without perdition, andloss assume all reason

2991
02:44:54.600 --> 02:45:02.230
Without revolt: this is,and is not, Cressid.

2992
02:45:02.230 --> 02:45:04.030
Within my soul there dothconduce a fight

2993
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:08.370
Of this strange naturethat a thing inseparate

2994
02:45:08.370 --> 02:45:12.270
Divides more wider thanthe sky and earth,

2995
02:45:12.270 --> 02:45:15.200
And yet the spaciousbreadth of this division

2996
02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:18.300
Admits no orifex for apoint as subtle

2997
02:45:18.300 --> 02:45:23.670
As Ariachne's broken woofto enter.

2998
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:27.500
Instance, O instance!strong as Pluto's gates;

2999
02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:32.030
Cressid is mine, tied withthe bonds of heaven:

3000
02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:37.370
Instance, O instance!strong as heaven itself;

3001
02:45:37.370 --> 02:45:40.030
The bonds of heaven areslipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;

3002
02:45:40.030 --> 02:45:42.230
And with another knot,five-finger-tied,

3003
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:44.300
The fractions of herfaith, orts of her love,

3004
02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:47.970
The fragments, scraps, thebits and greasy relics

3005
02:45:47.970 --> 02:45:51.030
Of her o'er-eaten faith,are bound to Diomed.

3006
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:52.300
May worthy Troilus be halfattach'd

3007
02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:53.830
With that which here hispassion doth express?

3008
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:55.370
Ay, Greek; and that shallbe divulged well

3009
02:45:55.370 --> 02:45:57.330
In characters as red asMars his heart

3010
02:45:57.330 --> 02:46:00.430
Inflamed with Venus: neverdid young man fancy

3011
02:46:00.430 --> 02:46:04.100
With so eternal and sofix'd a soul.

3012
02:46:04.770 --> 02:46:09.100
Hark, Greek: as much as Ido Cressid love,

3013
02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:13.170
So much by weight hate Iher Diomed:

3014
02:46:13.170 --> 02:46:17.430
That sleeve is mine thathe'll bear on his helm;

3015
02:46:17.430 --> 02:46:19.130
Were it a casque composedby Vulcan's skill,

3016
02:46:19.130 --> 02:46:21.770
My sword should bite it:not the dreadful spout

3017
02:46:21.770 --> 02:46:23.500
Which shipmen do thehurricano call,

3018
02:46:23.500 --> 02:46:25.630
Constringed in mass by thealmighty sun,

3019
02:46:25.630 --> 02:46:27.270
Shall dizzy with moreclamour Neptune's ear

3020
02:46:27.270 --> 02:46:29.570
In his descent than shallmy prompted sword

3021
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:31.630
Falling on Diomed.

3022
02:46:31.630 --> 02:46:38.070
O Cressid! O false Cressid!false, false, false!

3023
02:46:38.070 --> 02:46:40.870
Let all untruths stand bythy stained name,

3024
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:42.930
And they'll seem glorious.

3025
02:46:42.930 --> 02:46:44.000
O, contain yourself

3026
02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.030
Your passion draws earshither.

3027
02:46:46.030 --> 02:46:49.600
I have been seeking youthis hour, my lord:

3028
02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:53.530
Hector, by this, is arminghim in Troy;

3029
02:46:53.530 --> 02:47:00.230
Ajax, your guard, stays toconduct you home.

3030
02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:14.900
Have with you, prince. Mycourteous lord, adieu.

3031
02:47:18.130 --> 02:47:26.200
Farewell, revolted fair!and, Diomed,

3032
02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:33.930
Stand fast, and wear acastle on thy head!

3033
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:36.900
I'll bring you to thegates.

3034
02:47:36.900 --> 02:47:40.070
Accept distracted thanks.

3035
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:56.070
When was my lord so muchungently temper'd,

3036
02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:59.500
To stop his ears againstadmonishment?

3037
02:47:59.500 --> 02:48:03.700
Unarm, unarm, and do notfight to-day.

3038
02:48:03.700 --> 02:48:07.800
You train me to offendyou; get you in:

3039
02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:10.630
By all the everlastinggods, I'll go!

3040
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:12.970
My dreams will, sure,prove ominous to the day.

3041
02:48:12.970 --> 02:48:14.930
No more, I say.

3042
02:48:14.930 --> 02:48:16.430
Where is my brotherHector?

3043
02:48:16.430 --> 02:48:19.900
Here, sister; arm'd, andbloody in intent.

3044
02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:21.970
Consort with me in loudand dear petition,

3045
02:48:21.970 --> 02:48:25.370
Pursue we him on knees;for I have dream'd

3046
02:48:25.370 --> 02:48:27.300
Of bloody turbulence, andthis whole night

3047
02:48:27.300 --> 02:48:30.100
Hath nothing been but shapesand forms of slaughter.

3048
02:48:30.100 --> 02:48:31.270
O, 'tis true.

3049
02:48:31.270 --> 02:48:32.600
Ho! bid my trumpet sound!

3050
02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:34.170
No notes of sally, for theheavens, sweet brother.

3051
02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:36.400
Be gone, I say: the godshave heard me swear.

3052
02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:38.500
The gods are deaf to hotand peevish vows:

3053
02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.400
They are pollutedofferings, more abhorr'd

3054
02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:43.370
Than spotted livers in thesacrifice.

3055
02:48:43.370 --> 02:48:46.730
O, be persuaded! do notcount it holy

3056
02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:50.700
To hurt by being just: itis as lawful,

3057
02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:53.870
For we would give much, touse violent thefts,

3058
02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:56.830
And rob in the behalf ofcharity.

3059
02:48:56.830 --> 02:48:58.530
It is the purpose thatmakes strong the vow;

3060
02:48:58.530 --> 02:49:01.030
But vows to every purposemust not hold:

3061
02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:02.200
Unarm, sweet Hector.

3062
02:49:02.200 --> 02:49:04.330
Hold you still, I say;

3063
02:49:04.330 --> 02:49:07.430
Mine honour keeps theweather of my fate:

3064
02:49:07.430 --> 02:49:10.370
Life every man holds dear;but the dear man

3065
02:49:10.370 --> 02:49:14.900
Holds honour far moreprecious-dear than life.

3066
02:49:14.900 --> 02:49:17.470
How now, young man! mean'stthou to fight to-day?

3067
02:49:17.470 --> 02:49:19.500
Cassandra, call my fatherto persuade.

3068
02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:21.900
No, faith, young Troilus;doff thy harness, youth;

3069
02:49:21.900 --> 02:49:23.530
I am to-day i' the vein ofchivalry:

3070
02:49:23.530 --> 02:49:25.670
Let grow thy sinews tilltheir knots be strong,

3071
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:28.370
And tempt not yet thebrushes of the war.

3072
02:49:28.370 --> 02:49:30.030
Unarm thee, go, and doubtthou not, brave boy,

3073
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:32.470
I'll stand to-day for theeand me and Troy.

3074
02:49:32.470 --> 02:49:36.230
Brother, you have a viceof mercy in you,

3075
02:49:36.230 --> 02:49:38.570
Which better fits a lionthan a man.

3076
02:49:38.570 --> 02:49:40.600
What vice is that, goodTroilus? chide me for it.

3077
02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:42.370
When many times thecaptive Grecian falls,

3078
02:49:42.370 --> 02:49:44.370
Even in the fan and windof your fair sword,

3079
02:49:44.370 --> 02:49:45.870
You bid them rise, andlive.

3080
02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:47.000
O,'tis fair play.

3081
02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:48.430
Fool's play, by heaven,Hector.

3082
02:49:48.430 --> 02:49:49.430
How now! how now!

3083
02:49:49.430 --> 02:49:51.070
For the love of all thegods,

3084
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:55.070
Let's leave the hermitpity with our mothers,

3085
02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:57.870
And when we have ourarmours buckled on,

3086
02:49:57.870 --> 02:50:02.870
The venom'd vengeance rideupon our swords,

3087
02:50:02.870 --> 02:50:08.170
Spur them to ruthful work,rein them from ruth.

3088
02:50:08.170 --> 02:50:09.070
Fie, savage, fie!

3089
02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:11.400
Hector, then 'tis wars.

3090
02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:13.670
Troilus, I would not haveyou fight to-day.

3091
02:50:13.670 --> 02:50:16.070
Who should withhold me?

3092
02:50:16.070 --> 02:50:19.630
Not fate, obedience, northe hand of Mars

3093
02:50:19.630 --> 02:50:23.330
Beckoning with fierytruncheon my retire;

3094
02:50:23.330 --> 02:50:24.800
Not Priamus and Hecuba onknees,

3095
02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:27.470
Their eyes o'ergalled withrecourse of tears;

3096
02:50:27.470 --> 02:50:29.630
Not you, my brother, withyour true sword drawn,

3097
02:50:29.630 --> 02:50:33.070
Opposed to hinder me,should stop my way,

3098
02:50:33.070 --> 02:50:35.330
But by my ruin.

3099
02:50:37.170 --> 02:50:40.100
Lay hold upon him, Priam,hold him fast:

3100
02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:43.570
He is thy crutch; now ifthou lose thy stay,

3101
02:50:43.570 --> 02:50:46.270
Thou on him leaning, andall Troy on thee,

3102
02:50:46.270 --> 02:50:47.870
Fall all together.

3103
02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:55.400
Come, Hector, come, goback:

3104
02:50:55.400 --> 02:50:59.400
Thy wife hath dream'd; thymother hath had visions;

3105
02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:01.930
Cassandra doth foresee;and I myself

3106
02:51:01.930 --> 02:51:04.200
Am like a prophet suddenlyenrapt

3107
02:51:04.200 --> 02:51:07.430
To tell thee that this dayis ominous:

3108
02:51:07.430 --> 02:51:09.030
Therefore, come back.

3109
02:51:09.030 --> 02:51:10.870
AEneas is a-field;

3110
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:12.230
And I do stand engaged tomany Greeks,

3111
02:51:12.230 --> 02:51:13.730
Even in the faith ofvalour, to appear

3112
02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:15.130
This morning to them.

3113
02:51:15.130 --> 02:51:17.400
Ay, but thou shalt not go.

3114
02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:19.900
I must not break my faith.

3115
02:51:19.900 --> 02:51:21.570
You know me dutiful;therefore, dear sir,

3116
02:51:21.570 --> 02:51:24.100
Let me not shame respect;but give me leave

3117
02:51:24.100 --> 02:51:26.770
To take that course byyour consent and voice,

3118
02:51:26.770 --> 02:51:30.270
Which you do here forbidme, royal Priam.

3119
02:51:30.270 --> 02:51:31.970
O Priam, yield not to him!

3120
02:51:31.970 --> 02:51:33.130
Do not, dear father.

3121
02:51:33.130 --> 02:51:34.670
Andromache, I am offendedwith you:

3122
02:51:34.670 --> 02:51:35.630
Upon the love you bear me,get you in.

3123
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:38.300
This foolish, dreaming,superstitious girl

3124
02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:40.370
Makes all these bodements.

3125
02:51:40.370 --> 02:51:42.600
O, farewell, dear Hector!

3126
02:51:42.600 --> 02:51:47.170
Look, how thou diest! look,how thy eye turns pale!

3127
02:51:47.170 --> 02:51:51.170
Look, how thy wounds dobleed at many vents!

3128
02:51:51.170 --> 02:51:56.630
Hark, how Troy roars! howHecuba cries out!

3129
02:51:56.630 --> 02:52:00.800
How poor Andromacheshrills her dolours forth!

3130
02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:04.630
Behold, distraction,frenzy and amazement,

3131
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:07.370
Like witless antics, oneanother meet,

3132
02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:13.430
And all cry, Hector!Hector's dead! O Hector!

3133
02:52:13.430 --> 02:52:15.330
Away! away!

3134
02:52:15.330 --> 02:52:22.200
Farewell: yet, soft!Hector! take my leave:

3135
02:52:22.200 --> 02:52:27.500
Thou dost thyself and allour Troy deceive.

3136
02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:33.630
You are amazed, my liege,at her exclaim:

3137
02:52:33.630 --> 02:52:37.870
Go in and cheer the town:we'll forth and fight,

3138
02:52:37.870 --> 02:52:43.370
Do deeds worth praise andtell you them at night.

3139
02:52:43.370 --> 02:52:48.830
Farewell: the gods withsafety stand about thee!

3140
02:52:48.830 --> 02:52:54.670
(♪horns sound)

3141
02:52:54.670 --> 02:52:57.900
They are at it, hark!Proud Diomed, believe,

3142
02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:00.470
I come to lose my arm, orwin my sleeve.

3143
02:53:00.470 --> 02:53:02.930
Do you hear, my lord? doyou hear?

3144
02:53:02.930 --> 02:53:05.430
What now?

3145
02:53:05.430 --> 02:53:08.030
Here's a letter come fromyond poor girl.

3146
02:53:08.030 --> 02:53:13.170
Let me read.

3147
02:53:13.170 --> 02:53:14.700
A whoreson tisick,

3148
02:53:14.700 --> 02:53:17.430
a whoreson rascallytisick so troubles me,

3149
02:53:17.430 --> 02:53:21.070
and the foolishfortune of this girl;

3150
02:53:21.070 --> 02:53:22.270
and what one thing,what another,

3151
02:53:22.270 --> 02:53:25.030
that I shall leave youone o' these days:

3152
02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:27.400
and I have a rheumin mine eyes too,

3153
02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:30.100
and such an achein my bones that,

3154
02:53:30.100 --> 02:53:34.370
unless a man were cursed, Icannot tell what to think on't.

3155
02:53:34.370 --> 02:53:36.630
What says she there?

3156
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:43.770
Words, words, mere words,no matter from the heart:

3157
02:53:43.770 --> 02:53:48.070
The effect doth operateanother way.

3158
02:53:48.070 --> 02:53:53.270
Go, wind, to wind, thereturn and change together.

3159
02:53:53.270 --> 02:53:56.930
My love with words anderrors still she feeds;

3160
02:53:56.930 --> 02:54:00.130
But edifies another withher deeds.

3161
02:54:23.300 --> 02:54:28.230
Now they are clapper-clawingone another;

3162
02:54:28.230 --> 02:54:31.130
That dissembling abominablevarlets Diomed,

3163
02:54:31.130 --> 02:54:33.930
has got that same scurvy doting

3164
02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:36.830
foolish young knave's sleeveof Troy there in his helm:

3165
02:54:36.830 --> 02:54:39.330
I would fain see them meet;

3166
02:54:39.330 --> 02:54:41.470
that that sameyoung Trojan ass,

3167
02:54:41.470 --> 02:54:42.730
that loves the whore there,

3168
02:54:42.730 --> 02:54:44.930
might send that Greekishwhore-masterly villain,

3169
02:54:44.930 --> 02:54:48.300
with the sleeve, back to thedissembling luxurious drab,

3170
02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:50.600
of a sleeveless errand.

3171
02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:52.670
O' the t'other side,

3172
02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:55.900
the policy of thosecrafty swearing rascals,

3173
02:54:55.900 --> 02:54:57.900
that stale oldmouse-eaten dry cheese,

3174
02:54:57.900 --> 02:55:00.870
Nestor, and that samedog-fox, Ulysses,

3175
02:55:00.870 --> 02:55:03.270
is not proved worthya blackberry:

3176
02:55:03.270 --> 02:55:06.000
they set me up, in policy,that mongrel cur, Ajax,

3177
02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:09.100
against that dog of asbad a kind, Achilles:

3178
02:55:09.100 --> 02:55:12.470
and now is the cur Ajax prouderthan the cur Achilles,

3179
02:55:12.470 --> 02:55:14.570
and will not arm to-day;

3180
02:55:14.570 --> 02:55:18.970
whereupon the Grecians beginto proclaim barbarism,

3181
02:55:18.970 --> 02:55:22.500
and policy grows intoan ill opinion.

3182
02:55:22.500 --> 02:55:27.830
Soft! here comes sleeve,and t'other.

3183
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:29.170
Fly not; for shouldst thoutake the river Styx,

3184
02:55:29.170 --> 02:55:30.630
I would swim after.

3185
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:33.000
Thou dost miscall retire:

3186
02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:34.070
I do not fly, butadvantageous care

3187
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:36.370
Withdrew me from the oddsof multitude:

3188
02:55:36.370 --> 02:55:37.600
Have at thee!

3189
02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:42.900
Hold thy whore, Grecian!--nowfor thy whore, Trojan!

3190
02:55:42.900 --> 02:55:45.030
What art thou, Greek? artthou for Hector's match?

3191
02:55:45.030 --> 02:55:47.430
Art thou of blood andhonour?

3192
02:55:47.430 --> 02:55:50.430
No, no, I am a rascal; ascurvy railing knave:

3193
02:55:50.430 --> 02:55:53.230
a very filthy rogue.

3194
02:55:53.230 --> 02:55:56.400
I do believe thee: live.

3195
02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:00.570
God-a-mercy, that thouwilt believe me;

3196
02:56:00.570 --> 02:56:04.070
but a plague break thyneck for frightening me!

3197
02:56:04.970 --> 02:56:07.530
What's become of thewenching rogues?

3198
02:56:07.530 --> 02:56:10.830
I think they haveswallowed one another:

3199
02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:13.800
I'll seek them.

3200
02:56:16.030 --> 02:56:23.170
Renew, renew! The fiercePolydamas

3201
02:56:23.170 --> 02:56:25.700
Hath beat down Menon:bastard Margarelon

3202
02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:28.070
Hath Doreus prisoner,

3203
02:56:28.070 --> 02:56:30.270
And stands colossus-wise,waving his beam,

3204
02:56:30.270 --> 02:56:32.670
Upon the pashed corses ofthe kings

3205
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:37.570
Epistrophus and Cedius:Polyxenes is slain,

3206
02:56:37.570 --> 02:56:40.630
Amphimachus and Thoasdeadly hurt,

3207
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:44.600
Patroclus ta'en or slain,and Palamedes

3208
02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:47.100
Sore hurt and bruised: thedreadful Sagittary

3209
02:56:47.100 --> 02:56:48.930
Appals our numbers: hastewe, Diomed,

3210
02:56:48.930 --> 02:56:51.900
To reinforcement, or weperish all.

3211
02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:54.100
Go, bear Patroclus' bodyto Achilles;

3212
02:56:54.100 --> 02:56:57.430
And bid the snail-pacedAjax arm for shame.

3213
02:56:57.430 --> 02:56:59.800
There is a thousandHectors in the field:

3214
02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:01.830
Now here he fights onGalathe his horse,

3215
02:57:01.830 --> 02:57:04.870
And there lacks work; anonhe's there afoot,

3216
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:07.100
And there they fly or die,like scaled sculls

3217
02:57:07.100 --> 02:57:11.170
Before the belching whale;then is he yonder,

3218
02:57:11.170 --> 02:57:13.330
And there the strawyGreeks, ripe for his edge,

3219
02:57:13.330 --> 02:57:16.870
Fall down before him, likethe mower's swath:

3220
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:19.930
Here, there, and everywhere, he leaves and takes,

3221
02:57:19.930 --> 02:57:22.930
Dexterity so obeyingappetite

3222
02:57:22.930 --> 02:57:25.500
That what he will he does,and does so much

3223
02:57:25.500 --> 02:57:28.230
That proof is call'dimpossibility.

3224
02:57:28.230 --> 02:57:29.630
O, courage, courage,princes! great Achilles

3225
02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:32.070
Is arming, weeping,cursing, vowing vengeance:

3226
02:57:32.070 --> 02:57:34.530
Patroclus' wounds haveroused his drowsy blood,

3227
02:57:34.530 --> 02:57:36.570
Together with his mangledMyrmidons,

3228
02:57:36.570 --> 02:57:39.600
That noseless, handless, hack'dand chipp'd, come to him,

3229
02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:42.000
Crying on Hector. Ajaxhath lost a friend

3230
02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:43.770
And foams at mouth, and heis arm'd and at it,

3231
02:57:43.770 --> 02:57:45.830
Roaring for Troilus, whohath done to-day

3232
02:57:45.830 --> 02:57:48.070
Mad and fantasticexecution,

3233
02:57:48.070 --> 02:57:49.530
Engaging and redeeming ofhimself

3234
02:57:49.530 --> 02:57:52.270
With such a careless forceand forceless care

3235
02:57:52.270 --> 02:57:54.700
As if that luck, in veryspite of cunning,

3236
02:57:54.700 --> 02:57:57.430
Bade him win all.

3237
02:57:57.430 --> 02:58:00.330
Troilus, thou cowardTroilus, show thy head!

3238
02:58:00.330 --> 02:58:02.830
Troilus, I say! where'sTroilus?

3239
02:58:02.830 --> 02:58:04.600
What wouldst thou?

3240
02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:05.830
I would correct him.

3241
02:58:05.830 --> 02:58:08.370
Were I the general, thoushouldst have my office

3242
02:58:08.370 --> 02:58:12.070
Ere that correction. Troilus,I say!

3243
02:58:12.070 --> 02:58:16.200
O traitor Diomed! turn thyfalse face, thou traitor,

3244
02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:17.600
Ha, art thou there?

3245
02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:21.870
I'll fight with him alone:stand, Diomed.

3246
02:58:21.870 --> 02:58:23.830
He is my prize; I will notlook upon.

3247
02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:28.170
Come, both you coggingGreeks; have at you both!

3248
02:58:31.870 --> 02:58:37.300
Yea, Troilus? O, wellfought, my youngest brother!

3249
02:58:46.500 --> 02:58:53.030
Stand, stand, thou Greek;thou art a goodly mark:

3250
02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:57.600
No? wilt thou not? I likethy armour well;

3251
02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:00.870
I'll frush it and unlockthe rivets all,

3252
02:59:00.870 --> 02:59:03.070
But I'll be master of it:

3253
02:59:03.700 --> 02:59:06.600
Come here about me, you myMyrmidons;

3254
02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:11.600
Mark what I say. Attend mewhere I wheel:

3255
02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:15.300
Strike not a stroke, butkeep yourselves in breath:

3256
02:59:15.300 --> 02:59:18.070
And when I have the bloodyHector found,

3257
02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:22.230
Empale him with yourweapons round about;

3258
02:59:22.230 --> 02:59:25.830
In fellest manner executeyour aims.

3259
02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:30.530
Follow me, sirs, and myproceedings eye:

3260
02:59:30.530 --> 02:59:34.400
It is decreed Hector thegreat must die.

3261
02:59:45.630 --> 02:59:48.270
The cuckold and thecuckold-maker are at it.

3262
02:59:49.600 --> 02:59:52.600
Now, bull! now, dog!'Loo, Paris, 'loo!

3263
02:59:52.600 --> 02:59:53.900
'loo, Paris, 'loo!

3264
02:59:53.900 --> 02:59:57.470
The bull has the game:ware horns, ho!

3265
02:59:58.070 --> 03:00:00.800
Turn, slave, and fight.

3266
03:00:00.800 --> 03:00:02.100
What art thou?

3267
03:00:02.100 --> 03:00:04.700
A bastard son of Priam's.

3268
03:00:04.700 --> 03:00:08.630
I am a bastard too; I lovebastards: I am a bastard begot,

3269
03:00:08.630 --> 03:00:10.330
bastard instructed,bastard in mind,

3270
03:00:10.330 --> 03:00:13.870
bastard in valour, inevery thing illegitimate.

3271
03:00:13.870 --> 03:00:14.800
One bear will not bite another,

3272
03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:17.270
and wherefore shouldone bastard?

3273
03:00:17.270 --> 03:00:18.200
Take heed,

3274
03:00:18.200 --> 03:00:19.200
if the son of a whorefight for a whore,

3275
03:00:19.200 --> 03:00:22.630
he tempts judgment:farewell, bastard.

3276
03:00:22.630 --> 03:00:25.570
The devil take thee,coward!

3277
03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:41.130
Most putrefied core, sofair without,

3278
03:00:41.800 --> 03:00:45.100
Thy goodly armour thushath cost thy life.

3279
03:00:50.170 --> 03:00:54.870
Now is my day's work done;I'll take good breath:

3280
03:00:57.570 --> 03:01:06.530
Rest, sword; thou hast thyfill of blood and death.

3281
03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:20.000
Look, Hector, how the sunbegins to set;

3282
03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:23.030
How ugly night comesbreathing at his heels:

3283
03:01:23.030 --> 03:01:25.600
Even with the vail anddarking of the sun,

3284
03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:33.570
To close the day up,Hector's life is done.

3285
03:01:38.070 --> 03:01:45.000
I am unarm'd; forego thisvantage, Greek.

3286
03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.430
Strike, fellows, strike;this is the man I seek.

3287
03:02:08.730 --> 03:02:13.700
So, Ilion, fall thou next!now, Troy, sink down!

3288
03:02:15.070 --> 03:02:21.930
Here lies thy heart, thysinews, and thy bone.

3289
03:02:22.700 --> 03:02:25.270
On, Myrmidons, and cry youall amain,

3290
03:02:25.270 --> 03:02:28.970
'Achilles hath the mightyHector slain.'

3291
03:02:28.970 --> 03:02:30.830
(A retreat sounded)

3292
03:02:30.830 --> 03:02:36.470
Hark! a retire upon ourGrecian part.

3293
03:02:37.300 --> 03:02:40.400
The dragon wing of nighto'erspreads the earth,

3294
03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:44.970
And, stickler-like, thearmies separates.

3295
03:02:44.970 --> 03:02:48.270
My half-supp'd sword, thatfrankly would have fed,

3296
03:02:48.270 --> 03:02:52.370
Pleased with this daintybait, thus goes to bed.

3297
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:57.500
Come, tie his body to myhorse's tail;

3298
03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:02.530
Along the field I will theTrojan trail.

3299
03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:10.130
Stand, ho! yet are wemasters of the field:

3300
03:03:10.130 --> 03:03:14.170
Never go home; here starvewe out the night.

3301
03:03:14.170 --> 03:03:15.930
Hector is slain.

3302
03:03:15.930 --> 03:03:18.200
Hector! the gods forbid!

3303
03:03:18.200 --> 03:03:20.530
He's dead; and at themurderer's horse's tail,

3304
03:03:20.530 --> 03:03:23.500
In beastly sort, dragg'dthrough the shameful field.

3305
03:03:23.500 --> 03:03:28.200
Frown on, you heavens,effect your rage with speed!

3306
03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:33.470
Sit, gods, upon yourthrones, and smile at Troy!

3307
03:03:33.470 --> 03:03:38.470
I say, at once let yourbrief plagues be mercy,

3308
03:03:38.470 --> 03:03:40.930
And linger not our suredestructions on!

3309
03:03:40.930 --> 03:03:43.200
My lord, you do discomfortall the host!

3310
03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:45.230
You understand me not thattell me so:

3311
03:03:45.230 --> 03:03:47.130
I do not speak of flight,of fear, of death,

3312
03:03:47.130 --> 03:03:49.000
But dare all imminencethat gods and men

3313
03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:52.570
Address their dangers in.Hector is gone:

3314
03:03:52.570 --> 03:03:54.930
Who shall tell Priam so,or Hecuba?

3315
03:03:54.930 --> 03:03:56.500
Let him that will ascreech-owl aye be call'd,

3316
03:03:56.500 --> 03:03:59.970
Go in to Troy, and saythere, Hector's dead:

3317
03:03:59.970 --> 03:04:03.100
There is a word will Priamturn to stone;

3318
03:04:03.100 --> 03:04:05.970
Make wells and Niobes ofthe maids and wives,

3319
03:04:05.970 --> 03:04:08.370
Cold statues of the youth,and, in a word,

3320
03:04:08.370 --> 03:04:12.870
Scare Troy out of itself.But, march away:

3321
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:16.700
Hector is dead; there isno more to say.

3322
03:04:18.270 --> 03:04:28.430
Stay yet. You vileabominable tents,

3323
03:04:29.300 --> 03:04:34.830
Thus proudly pight uponour Phrygian plains,

3324
03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:37.800
Let Titan rise as early ashe dare,

3325
03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:43.800
I'll through and through you!and, thou great-sized coward,

3326
03:04:43.800 --> 03:04:46.630
No space of earth shallsunder our two hates:

3327
03:04:46.630 --> 03:04:49.830
I'll haunt thee like awicked conscience still,

3328
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:54.900
That mouldeth goblins swiftas frenzy's thoughts.

3329
03:04:55.130 --> 03:05:00.070
Strike a free march toTroy! with comfort go:

3330
03:05:00.370 --> 03:05:03.400
Hope of revenge shall hideour inward woe.

3331
03:05:03.400 --> 03:05:05.700
But hear you, hear you!

3332
03:05:05.700 --> 03:05:09.030
Hence, broker-lackey!ignomy and shame

3333
03:05:09.030 --> 03:05:12.370
Pursue thy life, and liveaye with thy name!

3334
03:05:16.670 --> 03:05:21.930
A goodly medicine for myaching bones! O world!

3335
03:05:21.930 --> 03:05:28.170
world! world! thus is thepoor agent despised!

3336
03:05:28.170 --> 03:05:31.170
O traitors and bawds, howearnestly are you set

3337
03:05:31.170 --> 03:05:35.730
a-work, and how ill requited!

3338
03:05:36.130 --> 03:05:41.170
why should ourendeavour be so loved

3339
03:05:41.170 --> 03:05:47.800
and the performance soloathed? what instance for it?

3340
03:05:47.800 --> 03:05:53.170
what verse forit? Let me see:

3341
03:05:53.600 --> 03:06:02.770
Full merrily thehumble-bee doth sing,

3342
03:06:02.770 --> 03:06:10.800
Till he hath lost hishoney and his sting;

3343
03:06:10.800 --> 03:06:19.070
And being once subdued inarmed tail,

3344
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:27.670
Sweet honey and sweetnotes together fail.

3345
03:06:31.500 --> 03:06:41.530
Good traders in the flesh, setthis in your painted cloths.

3346
03:06:41.530 --> 03:06:51.600
As many as be here ofpander's hall,

3347
03:06:52.230 --> 03:06:56.800
Your eyes, half out, weepout at Pandar's fall;

3348
03:07:00.800 --> 03:07:05.170
Or if you cannot weep, yetgive some groans,

3349
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:11.900
Though not for me, yet foryour aching bones.

3350
03:07:15.230 --> 03:07:20.200
Brethren and sisters ofthe hold-door trade,

3351
03:07:20.200 --> 03:07:25.830
Some two months hence mywill shall here be made:

3352
03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:33.300
Till then I'll sweat andseek about for eases,

3353
03:07:33.300 --> 03:07:41.830
And at that time bequeatheyou my diseases.

3354
03:09:58.930 --> 03:10:01.930
