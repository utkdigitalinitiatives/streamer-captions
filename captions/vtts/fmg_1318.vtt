00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.570
with all solemnity,
I curse him,

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.670
whether he acted alone
or with others,

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:26.970
to bear the mark of this crime
for the rest of his life,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.030
without friends, homeless,
and in misery.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.170
I'll go further.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.730
I don't even exclude myself.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.530
If knowingly,
I should shelter this criminal

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.400
in any house or hearth
or any place of mine,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.300
that the curse I have uttered
fall on me too

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.500
as fiercely as on anyone.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.600
That is my sentence.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.830
And it's up to you
to see it fully carried out

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.230
for the gods' sake,
for my sake,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.430
and the sake of our
plague-ridden,

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.600
god-deserted city.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.830
To be honest with you,

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.030
I'm surprised that no
purification ceremonies

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.630
or investigations
were undertaken

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:07.470
when so excellent
a king as Laius

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:09.570
was inexplicably murdered.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.170
Even without the gods' command,

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.670
that should have been looked
into, I should have thought.

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.800
Now, however, I am king.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.270
I enjoy Laius' title, his bed,
and his wife.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.130
She is a kind of common ground
between us,

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.830
and his children, indeed,
if he had had any,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:31.300
would be another bond,
sharing a mother with mine.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.530
And he was the sad victim
of this tragedy.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.270
These links between us
and my feeling for the man

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.830
make me determined
to fight for him now

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.870
as if he were my own father.

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:44.400
Nothing will be too much trouble
to ferret him out,

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.700
this destroyer of Laius,
the heir to Labdacus,

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.770
and all the ancient
kings of Thebes

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.330
back to Cadmus himself
and Agenor, his father.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.400
And if any man dares
to disobey these orders,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.870
let the gods' curses
fall on him too--

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:01.500
barren earth, barren cattle,
a barren wife,

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.770
and all the horrors this
suffering city daily endures--

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:11.030
without mercy
till the end of his life.

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.230
For the honest people of Thebes

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.770
who follow me
in intention and action,

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:18.730
justice be ours

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:22.070
and the gods' help today
and every day.

any man, great king of Thebes,

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:28.870

Let me say that at once.

or tell you his name.

persuades a god to speak

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.530

I shall thank you for it.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.200
You made me say it
against my will.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.300
>> Say it again,

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.630
so there will be no doubt.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.900
>> Didn't you hear,

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.530
or do you want me to elaborate?

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.600
>> I heard,
but I didn't believe my ears.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.770
Say it again,
aloud, to everybody.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:49.100
>> You are the murderer
of the murdered king!

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.430
>> Twice to my face!

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.200
You will regret this, old man!

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.830
>> Hold your anger
if it pleases you.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:59.430
I could say more to make you
angrier still.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:00.500
>> Why not?

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.570
More and more lunacy.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:02.700
Let's have it all.

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.670
>> I know, but you do not,

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:10.600
that the woman you love
is not the woman you love,

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.600
that the relationship
is disgusting, taboo,

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.930
and, in your ignorance,
will destroy you.

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.470
>> Do you expect to say such
things and not be punished?

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.700
>> The truth protects me
if I tell it honestly.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.570
>> The truth.
What's the truth to you?

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.230
You're blind all over--
ears, mind, as well as eyes.

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:31.770
>> I pity you.

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:34.870
People will scream the same
insults at you before long.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:36.700
Everyone will despise you.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.300
>> You live in darkness
permanently.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.870
You see nothing
of the real world.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.070
My eyes are open.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:43.400
You can't hurt me.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.500
>> How could I, an old man?

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.800
It's not my business.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.330
Apollo will do it.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.170
It's in his hands.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:54.200
>> Creon, of course.
He went to the oracle.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.100
This plot is his doing,
not yours!

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.700
>> Creon isn't your enemy.
You are.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.670
>> Political rank,
wealth and power

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:05.970
and men's ambitions
clawing at each other

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.300
till life becomes a battleground
and envy everyone's motive.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:12.430
Creon is and has been
my friend.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.700
I've trusted him completely.

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.130
This crown was given to me
freely by the people.

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:20.670
I didn't ask for it,
and this man, my friend,

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.170
is secretly plotting
to overthrow me

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.570
with a spiritual quack,
a charlatan,

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:28.630
a paranormal stunt man

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.700
whose eyes are stone-blind
when it comes to prophecy

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.270
but where money's concerned,
very sharp then, wide-open then.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.900
Astrology, fortune-telling,
forecasting the future,

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.670
where was all that
when we needed it?

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:41.700
There was a monster here--

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:43.330
Do you remember?
I'm sure you do.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:45.600
With the face of a woman
and the body of a dog

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.400
who terrorized our city.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.870
Where were you then?

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:50.630
What was your advice
to save this country?

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:53.670
She said a riddle which
no ordinary man could solve.

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.300
Someone special was required.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.470
What else are prophets for?

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.370
But you!
You hadn't a clue, had you?

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.430
Not a word,
not the slightest suggestion.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:06.330
And then I came along,
a young man, quite ignorant,

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.600
knowing nothing, with only
the wit my mother gave me.

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.630
But I stopped her mouth.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:12.130
I did it, Oedipus.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.830
I guessed her riddle without
any gobbledygook about birds,

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:18.300
and I, Oedipus, I am the man
you hope to depose,

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.070
you and Creon, so that he will
be king and you his guru.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.630
Well, you will regret it.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:24.970
You will both regret
this attempt

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:26.430
to turn me into a scapegoat.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.400
If you weren't an old man,

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.100
punishment would teach you
the difference

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.330
between prophecy and sedition.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.930
>> Great king, to speak in anger
as both of you have done

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.000
helps none of us
as far as I can judge

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.530
when our city is dying.

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:41.330
>> We must consider the god's
command and how to obey it.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.430
>> You may be king,

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:48.230
but I am a free man,
and I have the right to answer.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:54.670
I serve Apollo the god,
not you nor Creon.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:57.970
You sneer at my blindness.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:03.670
You have eyes but cannot see
your own corruption,

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:07.270
nor who she is
you love the most,

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.430
not even whose son you are.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:13.370
In your ignorance, you have
committed terrible crimes

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.800
against those closest to you,
the living and the dead.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.130
A double curse,
like a two-edged sword,

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.400
father and mother will drive you
from this city

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:25.500
into exile forever.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:29.300
And what a cripple
you'll be then.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:35.230
Those bright eyes, that perfect
vision you are so proud of,

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:38.500
will become dark like mine.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.900
There will be no place on Earth

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.430
that has not heard
the sound of your pain.

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:47.130
The wildest heathland
of Cithaeron,

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:52.270
even its cliffs and ravines
will echo to your bellowing

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:56.730
when you understand how those
melodious marriage songs

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.930
deceived you when they led you
to that safe harbor

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.070
you imagined here.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:09.230
And unaccountable miseries,
sufferings you cannot guess at

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:13.570
will become familiar both to you
and to your children

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.700
as you pile your agonies
upon their heads.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.430
Accuse Creon of every crime.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.770
Slander him.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.930
Despise what I say.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.600
Every man in the world
will despise you,

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:31.270

where he came from.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.600

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.030

Remember that.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.670

I'm famous for it.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.930

a quiet life
within the ruling family

It has never crossed my mind.

I have no ambition to be king

I live like a king,
sometimes I hope I act like one,

than I get now from royal rank
without royal obligations.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.070
I'm not so drunk
with the prospect of power

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:19.930

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.270
Anyone who seeks to get

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:28.700
first tries for mine

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.400
because my influence
guarantees success.

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.800
Why should I change
such a favorable situation?

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.370
Is it likely
I'd be such a fool

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.130
as to break with you
in such conditions

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.130
as far as to commit treason?

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:45.600
As a political policy,
it has nothing to recommend it.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.400
It's not mine nor the policy
of any of my friends,

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.330
not if I know them.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.970
If you want proof,

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.830
send to the priestess
at the oracle.

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:58.430
Check the message I brought,
if it was true.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.730
Produce some evidence
of conspiracy

00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:02.030
between the blind man
and me.

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.800
Prove that and condemn me
to death out of hand.

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.100
My verdict in those conditions
will be as merciless

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.330
as any man's.

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:15.000
But to condemn me like this
without any evidence,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.900
I cannot endure that.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.630
If mere supposition,

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.200
is all your evidence,
you can call bad men honest

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.570
and decent citizens
crooks and villains,

00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:28.330
and justice will be done
to none of them.

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:32.130
A reliable friend
is a precious possession

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.630
worth a man's life.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:35.900
Throw friendship away,

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:41.830
you destroy something living
and irreplaceable.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.830
The truth of this
will emerge in time.

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:49.800
Time is the one
incorruptible judge.

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:54.430
One minute is long enough
to accuse a man.

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.770
To prove his innocence
takes longer.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:58.770
>> If you weigh his words,
they make good sense,

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.700
well worth
a prudent man's consideration.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.100
>> Quick judgments
are not always the wisest.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.930
>> Conspiracies
don't take their time.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:06.230
They keep on the move,

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:08.530
and counterintelligence
must move fast too

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:09.800
or be caught napping.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.800
Shall I sit and do nothing
while he takes power

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.170
and my own sluggishness
destroys me?

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.930
>> What do you want, then,
to have me banished?

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.400
>> Banished?
Oh, no.

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.630
I want you dead.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:22.400
>> What have I done
to provoke such jealousy?

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.300
>> Are you still so obstinate?
Still pretending?

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.330
>> Yes, I am, because
you're not thinking straight.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:27.800
>> I know where
my best interests lie.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.500
>> And what about mine?
>> You are a traitor!

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.800
>> And you are mistaken!

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.270
>> Kings must take decisions!
>> Not wrong decisions!

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:35.130
>> Oh, Thebes, my city!

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.230
>> Thebes is my city
as well as yours!

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:38.870
>> Princes, stop this brawling.

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:39.970
>> The queen.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.630
>> Jocasta
is coming from the palace.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:46.400
>> She will help us
to put an end to this quarrel.

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.670
>> What is all this shouting?

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.930
From inside the palace,

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.530
I heard angry voices
like a quarrel.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.130
Aren't you ashamed?

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:57.430
Indulging yourself in private
arguments, squabbling like boys

00:47:57.430 --> 00:48:00.300
while the city dies
all around you.

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:09.000
Go inside, my husband.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.030
And you too.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.670
Creon, go back
to your own house

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.330
before you turn a private row
into a public spectacle.

00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:16.400
>> Sister,
we are blood relations,

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.730
but your husband
has condemned me unheard

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.970
to the choice of death or exile.

00:48:20.970 --> 00:48:22.630
>> Certainly, I have,
and that, dear wife,

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:23.670
is the least I can do.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.430
>> May all the gods
curse me forever

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.800
if I was even remotely guilty.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.630
>> Oedipus,
you must believe him.

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.830
An oath like that
can't be taken lightly.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.230
Believe him, for my sake,

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:39.200
and for the sake
of these reliable councilors.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.830
They heard it all.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.400
[together] Great king,
be prepared to change your mind.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.100
>> Are you asking me
to break my word?

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.200
[together] No man ever
questioned his integrity.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.700
He confirms it by oath.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.300
Show some leniency.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.900
>> Do you know
what you're asking?

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.030
[together]
Certainly, we do.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.630
>> Say it openly, then.
Let everyone know.

00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:56.530
[together]
He's your long-trusted friend,

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:58.000
above suspicion.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.830
Don't condemn him
by hearsay

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:01.500
and in spite of his oath.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.400
>> Don't you understand
your own implications?

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.670
Spare him, and you demand
my banishment or death.

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:06.800
>> By the life-giving sun,

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.170
that necessary power
by whose warmth we live,

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:11.200
such a terrible thought
never crossed my mind.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.800
>> I had far rather be
an outcast--

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.100
godless, friendless, despised,
and distraught--

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.630
than embrace such a destiny.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:19.000
>> Our city's in anguish.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.270
What greater blow
could fall on us in our misery

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:23.570
than anger and hatred
between you two?

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:26.130
>> Then let him go,

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.200
even if my death, exile,
or disgrace

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:29.970
is the price of his mercy.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.630
Your voice buys his pardon,
not his.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:33.200
Wherever he hides his face,

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.630
then my backbreaking hatred
be his burden.

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:39.800
>> Your apology's as graceless
as your anger's insane.

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.870
An unforgiving nature breeds
misery in its own heart,

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:43.100
not that of its enemy.

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.900
>> Leave me alone!
I want you gone!

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.470
>> Yes, I'll go.

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.600
They respect my integrity.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.400
I am misjudged by you alone.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.500
[together]
Take the king inside, madam.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.030
Speak to him in private.

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.730
>> What caused this quarrel?
Who began it?

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:04.170
[together]
Rumors were mentioned,

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:05.430
unfounded suspicions,

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.730
then the anger that follows
unjust accusations.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.130
>> Both men were at fault, then?

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:10.630
[together]
Yes, madam, they were.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.970
>> Tell me all the details.
You can speak without fear.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:14.500
[together]
We have troubles enough.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.970
Best to keep silent
in all our interests.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.170
Let sleeping dogs lie.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:20.570
>> Your intentions
are honorable,

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:22.330
but your advice
is pregnant with disaster.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:24.230
All the guilt falls on me.

00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:25.830
>> Great king, believe me
when I say again

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:27.100
what I have said before.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:30.170
We would be stark mad to council
an action so insane

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.030
as to cast you out
without proof.

00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:33.470
>> We need your help
and guidance.

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.870
>> We all remember how,

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:37.330
like a pilot
in that desperate storm,

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.500
half-wrecked,
you navigated us to harbor.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.130
[together] You are our captain
in rough weather or calm.

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:46.800
>> Please tell me,
what harm can Creon have done

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.870
to provoke such fury
so suddenly?

00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:50.330
I am worthy your trust.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:54.070
>> These old men mean well,
but you matter to me far more.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:55.530
It's Creon.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:58.130
I'm sickened with disgust
at the scope of his conspiracy.

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.170
>> What conspiracy?

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:00.870
And why do you accuse
my brother?

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:06.630
>> He says I'm responsible
for Laius' murder.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:09.370
>> Has he any evidence,
or is it hearsay?

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:10.570
>> He says nothing himself.

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:12.370
That corrupt fortune-teller
speaks for him

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:14.800
with his bird talk
and prophecy.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.830
>> And is that all?

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:18.630
Set your mind at rest.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.800
No one can forecast the future.

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:25.900
I know what I'm talking about
from personal experience.

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.970
I have proof.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:31.270
When Laius was alive,
an oracle told him--

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:33.970
not the god himself
but through his mouthpiece--

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.230
that he would be killed
by his own son,

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:41.030
our own child,
and it didn't happen.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:43.730
Laius was killed
by persons unknown,

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:45.870
foreign robbers,
according to the story,

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.870
at the place
where three roads meet.

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:51.830
As for the child, it was
abandoned on a deserted mountain

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.470
before it was three days old
by a servant.

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:56.800
Kings never commit such acts
themselves.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.270
To make doubly sure,
its ankles were pierced

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:01.770
and strapped together
with leather thongs,

00:52:01.770 --> 00:52:03.970
so that prediction
didn't come true.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:05.900
In spite of Apollo,

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.700
the prophecy of parricide
wasn't fulfilled.

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.630
Laius was murdered but not,
as he feared, by his own son.

00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:18.470
The oracle had been unambiguous,
its meaning quite plain.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:22.630
So why take notice of these
fortune-tellers and astrologers?

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:26.830
The gods always get their
own way without anyone's help

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:28.200
when they're ready.

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.100
>> Something you said...

00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:36.800
Jocasta, I remember...

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.470
My brains are turmoil.

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:42.400
Feelings, memories.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.800
>> Why do you look at me
so strangely?

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.470
What's the matter?

00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:50.030
>> You said, didn't you,
that Laius was butchered

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:53.730
at a place
where three roads meet?

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.600
>> Yes, that was said
at the time.

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.470
It's still the common story.

00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.800
>> Where?
What country?

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.770
>> A place in Phocis
near the junction

00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:05.800
where the road to Thebes
forks to Daulia and Delphi.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.330
>> And how long ago
did all this happen?

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:08.470
>> You hadn't arrived.

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:09.500
The news became public

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.970
a short while
before you became king.

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.800
>> Oh, Zeus.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.270
What will you do to me?

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:21.500
>> Oedipus, you look terrified.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.830
What have I said?

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:24.070
>> Not yet.

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.400
Don't ask me yet.

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.570
How old was Laius?

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.470
What kind of man was he?

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:34.330
>> Big man, hair graying,
about your build.

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:37.600
>> Dear god, without knowing it,

00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.270
I may have damned myself
just a moment ago.

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.030
>> Don't look at me like that.
What do you mean?

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:46.430
>> Maybe Tiresias
could see after all.

00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:49.730
Terrifying but possible.

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:50.900
Tell me one more thing.

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.070
>> Why are you frightening me?

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:53.070
I'll tell you everything.

00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:54.670
>> Who was with the king?

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:56.070
A few attendants?

00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:00.170
Or was he traveling in state
with servants and armed men?

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:02.100
>> Five men all told,
one of them a herald.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.570
Laius himself
rode in a carriage.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:05.900
>> [gasps]

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:09.270
Nothing could be
clearer than that.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:12.270
Every detail.

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.400
Where did you get
this information?

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:15.700
>> There was one survivor.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.100
Eventually,
he got back to Thebes.

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.800
>> And is he still here now?

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.800
>> No, he isn't.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.830
By the time he got back,

00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:23.270
everything had changed
in the city.

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:25.030
You were king in Laius' place.

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:27.300
When he saw how things were,
he came to me

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.370
and begged me
on his knees

00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:29.830
to let him go back
to the country

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:31.130
to be a shepherd.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:32.900
He said he wanted to be
done with Thebes--

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.900
out of sight,
out of mind.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:35.930
So I let him go.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:37.130
He was a good servant.

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:38.830
He deserved better than that.

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:41.230
>> I want him here at once,
today.

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:42.230
Can we find him?

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:43.600
>> Of course, we can.

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.030
But why are you
so anxious?

00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:46.930
>> Oh, my dear wife.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.570
I'm frightened of what
I've done, what I'm doing.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:51.770
I've already said far too much.

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.030
I must see the shepherd,
ask him some questions.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.170
>> You will see him.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.400
We'll send for him,

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.100
but why are you so worried?

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.170
You must tell me.

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:01.700
I do have a right to know.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.870
>> Oh, yes, yes.

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:06.870
You have a right to know.

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:09.670
If the truth of this
is what I think it is,

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:12.870
no one has
a better right to know than you.

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:20.400
I'll tell you the whole story.

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.930
My father, Polybus,
was Corinth-born,

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:28.200
and Merope, my mother,
came from Daulis.

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.500
I was an up-and-coming fellow,
very much the man to watch,

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.630
until one day,
an odd thing happened,

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:37.570
an astonishing thing
which caused more trouble

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:41.470
perhaps than it merited
but which I took seriously.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:44.370
At a banquet one day,
a man who had drunk too much

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:48.130
jeered at me and said
I was not my father's son.

00:55:48.130 --> 00:55:51.470
I was very hurt, angry,
and insulted,

00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:53.270
but I kept it to myself
for the rest of that day.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:55.630
The next morning,
I went to my parents,

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:57.000
both father and mother together,

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.600
and asked them question
after question,

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.430
almost compelling them
to tell me the truth.

00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:02.730
They were very angry that anyone
should dare say such a thing

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.670
and put my mind at rest
as best they could,

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:07.270
but a thing like that
gets under your skin.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:08.870
I couldn't forget it,

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:11.170
and the story got around
a good deal, as these things do,

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:13.330
so without telling my parents,

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:16.730
I went to the oracle at Delphi.

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:20.130
I got no answer
to the question I asked,

00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:23.930
a catalog of horrors
and miseries instead:

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:27.430
that I would marry
my own mother

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:31.230
and father children on her,
conceived incestuously,

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:33.600
and become
a public outcast for it,

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.170
notorious throughout the world.

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:39.270
As if this weren't enough,
I would kill my own father.

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:40.700
What could I do?

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:44.130
I ran as fast and as far
from Corinth as any man could,

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.270
always checking my distance
from that forbidden city

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:47.500
by the position of the stars

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.070
so that
those dreadful prophecies

00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:50.530
could not possibly come true.

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:53.170
The route I took brought me
into that part of the country

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:56.630
where, according to you,
Laius was murdered.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:57.830
Now, listen, Jocasta.

00:56:57.830 --> 00:57:02.030
This is the truth
in every detail.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:10.030
I reached a place
where three roads meet.

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.000
I was confronted by a herald

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.470
ahead of a carriage
drawn by horses

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.000
and carrying a passenger
just as you described:

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.900
gray-haired, my build.

00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:23.030
The man in front shouted at me
to clear the road,

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:24.600
and the old man, too,
rudely ordered me

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.930
to get out of his way.

00:57:25.930 --> 00:57:28.000
The driver barged into me,
so I hit him, hard!

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.070
I was furious by now,
uncontrollable,

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:32.470
but the old man in the carriage
was watching for his chance.

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:34.400
He waited till I passed him,
and then he struck me

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.270
full on the head
with his two-pronged stick,

00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:38.770
the kind you use for goading
the horses to make them gallop.

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.700
I paid him back with interest
and double-quick.

00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.470
I whacked him savagely
with my staff

00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:44.230
and knocked him
out of the carriage.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:45.230
He fell flat in the road.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:46.630
The others attacked me,
of course,

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:49.200
and I killed them, every one.

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:56.430
Now, if that old man was
remotely connected with Laius,

00:57:56.430 --> 00:58:00.930
if the king's blood
ran in his veins,

00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:06.070
is there any man on Earth
more miserable than I am?

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.370
Every god will hate me,
and all men.

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:12.370
No one will speak to me,
friend nor stranger.

00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:14.470
No one will take me
into his house.

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:16.000
I cursed the murderer,

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.100
and the weight of that curse
now falls on me.

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:22.300
These same hands that murdered
him have fondled his wife.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.530
Was I cursed
from the beginning, then?

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:28.400
A filthy, corrupted thing,
infecting the city,

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:31.000
deserving exile
if anyone deserves it.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.600
Now I am cast out from Thebes,

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.300
denied the sight of my wife
and children,

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.970
forbidden never to return
to my home in Corinth.

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:38.630
No, never again
can I go back there

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:40.830
for fear that the oracle's
prophecies might be fulfilled

00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:44.170
and that I should somehow marry
my mother and kill my father,

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.400
Polybus, who nurtured me
and gave me life.

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:50.430
The immortals, I suppose, have
devised this inhuman scenario

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:53.170
to amuse themselves,
but listen, gods,

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:55.870
as you revel in the purity of
your power over human affairs,

00:58:55.870 --> 00:58:58.530
I shall do my best to deprive
you of that pleasure.

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:01.930
Never, never will that day come
if I can prevent it.

>> Even when he gets here,
what possible help can he be?

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:27.570
>> One detail,
and it's crucial.

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.370
If his story corroborates yours,
I am proved innocent.

00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:31.400
>> What detail?

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.100
Does it matter?
What did I say?

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.930
>> In your version
of the shepherd's evidence,

00:59:34.930 --> 00:59:36.130
the king was killed by robbers.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:37.470
Robbers, plural.

00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:39.630
Now, if he says the same,
still calls them robbers,

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:40.630
I'm in the clear.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:42.370
One man is not a group of men.

00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:44.930
Plural is plural,
not singular.

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:49.830
But if he describes
a single traveler walking alone,

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:51.800
then quite obviously,

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:54.170
all the evidence
will point to me.

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.630
>> Oh, but he did say that.

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:58.700
I'm certain.

00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:00.570
He can't change his story now.

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:01.630
He spoke in public.

01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:03.100
The whole city heard him.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:06.570
And even if his evidence
varies in detail,

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.170
by no possible stretch
of the imagination

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:12.000
can he pretend
that Laius died as predicted.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.300
A son of mine would kill him,
the oracle said,

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:16.130
and it didn't happen.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:18.500
My poor little boy
killed no one.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.070
He was the one who died,

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:22.300
years before
any of this happened.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.430
That's how much
oracles are worth.

In future, whatever they say,
one way or the other,

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.130

01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:22.530
as the gods decreed it from
the ancient summit of Olympus,

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:26.170
the sacred mountain.

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:28.930
>> No man made those precepts.

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.670
>> They never sleep nor decay
with age as men decay.

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:35.130
>> They run their courses
from immortal sources.

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:38.200
>> Like a pure and eternal
fountain.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.630
[together] Arrogant self-love
breeds absolute rule,

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:46.330
the tyrant who eats up money
and men.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:51.170
He seeks absolute power
and, in one foolish hour,

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:55.100
overreaches himself
and ends in the gutter.

01:01:56.470 --> 01:02:00.270
>> An ambitious man
most honors the gods.

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:02.800
>> When his demon drives him
to serve the state...

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.730
>> He sets his store
by the moral law.

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:09.370
>> The gods love him,
and his people prosper.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.830
[together] But what if a man
should laugh at justice,

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.100
grab what he wants,

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:15.570
and disregard by his words
and actions

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:19.470
honesty and truth
and plunder holy shrines?

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:23.430
Can he hope to escape
the consequences of his rape?

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.330
When the criminal makes off
with his loot

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.300
and the murderer becomes king,

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.270
why should I still cling
to the old wisdom and morality

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:36.330
or honor in song
the sacred harmony?

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:38.530
And why should I make
pilgrimages

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:42.370
to Delphi or Olympia
or any holy place

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:47.070
if these manifest truths are not
made absolute for every man,

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:49.670
and the gods' warnings
provoke laughter

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:52.300
with no thought
of what comes after?

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:58.100
Oh, Zeus, universal,
if you hear our song,

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.500
show us again
your immortal power

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.270
in this darkest hour

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:07.630
when Laius' fate
and Apollo's word

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:10.300
are both forgotten

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.570
and your warnings unheard.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.100
>> I have decided,
senators of Thebes,

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.830
to visit the holiest temples
of the city

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:40.570
to make sacrifices there
with incense and flowers

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:44.800
to the all-powerful gods.

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:53.570
The king is confused
at the moment

01:03:53.570 --> 01:03:56.270
by his own nightmares
and fantasies.

01:03:56.270 --> 01:03:58.370
He can't make balanced
judgments

01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:02.300
or estimate from past experience
what is likely to happen.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.770
Each new, sensational revelation
he takes as truth

01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:08.170
and is terrified the more.

01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:10.430
I've tried to comfort him,

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.430
but I've failed.

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:16.700
So it seems sensible
to offer prayers,

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.130
and first to Apollo,
whose altar stands nearest.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:38.770
Brilliant god of sunlight
and healing,

01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:41.970
we stand in the shadow
of a curse.

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:44.930
Shine on our darkest corners.

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:46.930
Where there is sickness
and dirt,

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:50.100
make us whole and clean.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.970
Like desperate sailors,
we lose our last hope

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:56.300
when we see our captain
in despair.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.330
>> Gentlemen.

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.230
Can anyone show me the way
to the palace of King Oedipus?

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.670
Or better still,
to the man himself,

01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:37.170
if you know where he is.

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:39.230
>> This is the palace,
and the king is inside it.

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.930
>> This lady is his wife
and mother of his children.

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:44.270
>> God bless her, then,
and all her family,

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:46.570
bearing children
to such a great man.

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:48.130
>> God bless you too, sir,

01:05:48.130 --> 01:05:49.900
and thank you
for such a courteous greeting.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.130
Have you traveled here
for your own purpose

01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:53.200
or to bring us news?

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.000
>> News, dear lady,
good news too,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.730
for your husband
and for his whole family.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.270
>> What news is it?
Who sent you?

01:05:59.270 --> 01:06:01.230
>> I come from Corinth,

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.430
and my message
is bound to please you,

01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:06.070
though it's painful too

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:08.170
and will make you sad
to begin with.

01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:10.530
>> One message causing
two such opposite reactions.

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:11.670
Tell me.

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:13.630
>> The Corinthians
will make Oedipus king

01:06:13.630 --> 01:06:15.270
of the whole isthmus.

01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:16.670
Everybody says so.

01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:19.570
>> But Polybus rules in Corinth
and has done for years.

01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:21.030
Isn't he still king?

01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:25.600
>> Polybus is dead, my lady,
and buried.

01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:31.170
>> Polybus is dead.

01:06:31.170 --> 01:06:36.030
The father of Oedipus, dead.

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:37.630
>> Unless I'm a liar.

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:39.700
In which case,
strike me dead on the spot.

01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:45.170
>> You, girl, quickly,
run to the king.

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.530
Tell him the news.

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:50.970
Ooh, oracles, dreamers
of dreams, fortune-tellers,

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:53.200
where are your predictions now?

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.870
The one man Oedipus has kept
clear of all these years

01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:59.730
for fear he should murder him,

01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:03.170
and that man is dead
at long last.

01:07:03.170 --> 01:07:06.570
Dead, and Oedipus had nothing
to do with it.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:07.700
>> Jocasta, my dearest,

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:09.270
you called me out
from the palace again.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:10.300
What's going on?

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.730
>> This man has news for you;
listen,

01:07:11.730 --> 01:07:13.330
and then tell me what you think
of oracles

01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:15.030
with their mystification
and mumbo jumbo.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.470
>> Who is he?
What does he have to say?

01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:17.870
>> He comes from Corinth.

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:20.330
Your father, he's dead.

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:24.730
Polybus--do you understand me--
is dead.

01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:27.900
>> What?

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.870
Tell me yourself.

01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:31.400
Get it quite clear.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.000
>> I can't put it any plainer;
he's dead, all right.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.200
He is gone the way we all go.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.870
>> How did he die?

01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:39.830
Was it murder or sickness?

01:07:39.830 --> 01:07:42.330
>> Sleep comes easily
to an old man's eyes.

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:44.770
>> He was ill, then,
and gradually declined.

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:45.770
Poor old man.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.070
>> He was old and tired.

01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:49.030
He'd lived long enough.

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.170
>> Well, then.

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:55.000
Ha!
What now, Jocasta!

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.930
That priestess at Delphi
with her oracle.

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:02.630
A whole sky full of screaming
birds prophesying ruin.

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:04.900
I was the man who would kill
my father,

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:06.970
and my sword has never left
its scabbard.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:08.470
Perhaps he died
of a broken heart

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:09.930
because I was in exile.

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:12.930
Perhaps I killed him that way,
but I don't think so.

01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:14.670
Polybus is dead,

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:17.470
and so is the oracle
and all its prophecies,

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:18.930
dead and rotten.

01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:20.430
>> And that was my prophecy.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.400
Didn't I say so
right from the beginning?

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:25.630
>> You said it, but I was
confused and frightened.

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:27.400
>> Forget it now.
It's over.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:31.600
>> My mother, while she's alive,
I can't be safe.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.830
There's still that to fear.

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:35.400
>> Fear, why fear?

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.570
We live our lives
at the mercy of chance,

01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.630
the purest coincidence.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.200
No one can predict the future,

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.130
so what's the point
of fearing it?

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:45.200
Live. Enjoy life.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.630
Take each day as it comes.

01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.000
As for marrying your mother,

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.830
you're not the first man
to have dreamed that dream.

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:56.100
Every man is his mother's lover
in imagination or in daydreams.

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.230
It's commonplace.

01:08:58.230 --> 01:09:01.230
If a man dwells
on his most private fantasies,

01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:02.930
his life won't be worth living;
believe me.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.400
>> Yeah, that's all very well,

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.770
your celebrations of the woman
who brought me into the world

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:07.900
happened to be dead too,

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:09.030
but she isn't, not yet.

01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:10.370
She's alive,
and while she lives,

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.670
somewhere inside me,
I'm still afraid.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:15.170
>> But much less afraid;
your father's dead.

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.700
>> Less afraid,
maybe still afraid of her.

01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.200
>> Don't mind me asking, sir,

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:21.830
who is this lady
who scares you so much?

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:24.370
>> The queen, Merope,
the dead king's wife.

01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:26.130
>> What's she done?

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:28.970
There's nothing to scare you
about her, surely.

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:33.130
>> My friend, there was
an oracle once from Delphi,

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:34.500
dreadful prophecy.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.900
>> Too dreadful
to tell a stranger,

01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:37.930
or can anyone hear it?

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:39.800
>> No, it's no secret.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.530
Apollo's mouthpiece,
the Pythia herself,

01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:45.770
told me I was doomed
to marry my own mother

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:48.400
and kill my father bloodily
with my own hands.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.370
It's for this reason
that I left Corinth

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:51.700
and have stayed away
so long.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:54.070
I've prospered, as you see,
abroad,

01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:55.200
but nothing can compensate

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.570
for the loss
of my parents' love,

01:09:57.570 --> 01:10:00.700
the pleasure denied me
of seeing them face-to-face.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.200
>> And this is the fear
that's kept you in exile?

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.200
No other reason?

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.330
>> Well, it was enough.

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:07.030
I was determined
not to kill my father.

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:09.630
>> Well, I came to do you
one good turn,

01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:11.500
and now I can do you another.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.770
>> What other?

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:16.200
If you know more,
you'll earn my gratitude.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:18.730

Because I saved your life;
no question about that.

There was another shepherd.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.700
He gave you to me and asked me
to look after you.

Could you identify him?

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:03.330

Did you work
for old King Laius?

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:10.300
I was born and bred
in his service,

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.600

How were you employed?

I've been a shepherd, sir.

In what part of the country
did you usually work?

Cithaeron mostly,

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:30.000
all around there.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.170

have you ever seen him before?

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.530

with him ever that you remember?

01:19:45.530 --> 01:19:47.530

but I'll soon remind him.

The days when us two were
neighbors up there on Cithaeron,

01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:57.300
he won't forget that,
will you?

01:19:57.300 --> 01:20:00.370
He had two flocks,
and I had one.

01:20:00.370 --> 01:20:03.500
Three seasons altogether
we were up there, the two of us.

And then from spring
right through to the autumn,

then I drove my lot
down to Corinth,

01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:11.370
and he took his lot
down to Thebes to Laius' place.

01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:14.230
Now, is that true,
or isn't it?

forgotten that boy,

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.270
You told me to look after it
and bring it up as my own.

01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:27.230

asking about that?

01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:28.330

more than he does.

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:43.870

What have I done wrong?

01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:46.030

to a straight question.

01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:47.600
He was asking you

you'll be forced to speak.

01:29:21.130 --> 01:29:25.000
You haven't seen it,
and count yourselves lucky.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.130
I shall never
be able to forget it.

01:29:28.130 --> 01:29:33.130
That image
will always be with me now.

01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:36.430
I was there,

01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:42.100
and I'll tell you what happened
as accurately as I can.

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:45.100
When she rushed into the palace
in anguish,

01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.770
she went straight
into the bedroom,

01:29:46.770 --> 01:29:51.800
tearing her hair out in handfuls
and muttering like a madwoman.

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.230
She slammed the doors
and locked herself in,

01:29:54.230 --> 01:29:56.100
and we heard her shouting,

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.070
something about Laius,
her first husband,

01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:59.530
who's been dead for years,

01:29:59.530 --> 01:30:02.200
and the night they conceived
the son who was to kill him

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:06.700
and breed misbegotten children
on his own mother.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.430
Then it became confused.

01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:12.370
She screamed
and beat upon the bed

01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:15.230
where she had conceived
a husband by a husband

01:30:15.230 --> 01:30:16.800
and children by a child.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:20.130
I heard all that.

01:30:20.130 --> 01:30:23.700
Her actual death
was behind the locked doors,

01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:25.370
and Oedipus broke in
at that point,

01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:28.570
raving up and down the hall
and shouting for a sword

01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:30.800
so that all our eyes
were fixed on him,

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.930
and we all forgot
what she was doing.

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:37.700
"That wife of mine,
that wife and mother,"

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.270
he shouted.

01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:42.330
"Her fertile belly,
twice it's been harvested,

01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:44.730
me and my children."

01:30:44.730 --> 01:30:46.200
Then he suddenly
made for the door.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.300
None of us told him,

01:30:47.300 --> 01:30:48.670
as though some premonition

01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:50.500
suddenly told him
she was there.

01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:53.470
He bellowed and shouted
and shoulder-charged the doors

01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:56.300
and kicked them till the bolts
and hinges shattered,

01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.500
and he stumbled in.

01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:05.800
We saw her slowly turning
in the air,

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:09.500
swinging slightly
like a pendulum,

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:14.030
strung up by the neck.

01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:18.400
She'd hanged herself.

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.430
The king ran to her,
loosed the ropes,

01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:23.370
and lifted her down,

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:29.630
all the while groaning
heartbreakingly like an animal.

01:31:29.630 --> 01:31:33.670
He laid her gently on the floor,
and then...

01:31:35.930 --> 01:31:39.300
This was unbearable,

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.730
the worst of all.

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:47.170
There were two golden brooches
pinned on her dress.

01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:50.330
He opened them up,
lifted them high in the air

01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:52.630
at arm's length,

01:31:52.630 --> 01:31:56.170
and plunged them down
into his eyeballs,

01:31:56.170 --> 01:31:59.170
screaming and groaning
that his own guilt and suffering

01:31:59.170 --> 01:32:02.170
were too great for his eyes
ever to see it,

01:32:02.170 --> 01:32:05.170
that now, they would both be
in darkness forever,

01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:08.830
that he would never see again
those he should never have seen,

01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:12.000
nor ever love those
he should never have loved.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.500
That's the way he went on,

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:19.100
cursing himself and stabbing
his eyelids again and again

01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:23.330
till his face was a mass
of blood and tears;

01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:24.900
not drops of blood

So they embraced in the crime

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:42.770

in the punishment too,

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:46.200
Or my children, whom I love,

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:49.500
what pleasure for me
to see their faces again,

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.370
conceived
as they were conceived?

01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:54.870
My eyes are a father's eyes.

01:41:54.870 --> 01:41:57.930
What would they see?

01:41:57.930 --> 01:42:01.570
And this marvelous city
in which I was born,

01:42:01.570 --> 01:42:03.730
the greatest among men.

01:42:03.730 --> 01:42:10.230
If I had eyes, I could still see
its palaces and temples,

01:42:10.230 --> 01:42:13.970
which by my own edict,
my own folly,

01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:16.130
my own insane determination

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:18.200
are forbidden
the murderer of Laius,

01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:22.270
the unclean thing that all men
turn away from

01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:23.500
and the gods hate.

01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:27.430
I mean myself.

01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:29.270
With eyes in my head,

01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:32.200
how could I look anyone
in the face,

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:35.570
even the Theban people
in the streets?

01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:40.430
My hearing--
oh, these ears.

01:42:40.430 --> 01:42:44.030
If I'd known a way
to block up these receivers

01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:47.170
or cut them off from
every sound the world makes,

01:42:47.170 --> 01:42:50.100
I'd have done that too
without regrets

01:42:50.100 --> 01:42:53.800
to make a prison cell
of my own mind,

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:57.000
in solitary confinement
from the world.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.700
No sight or sound
of all of these horrors

01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.870
could touch me there.

01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:04.500
That would be peace.

01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:11.100
The wastelands of Cithaeron,
like a nurse, cradled me,

01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:13.930
kept me alive
for this.

01:43:13.930 --> 01:43:20.100
Trees, gullies, naked rocks,
you should have let me die.

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:22.630
You preserved me to parade
before the world

01:43:22.630 --> 01:43:25.970
the well-kept secret
of who my father was

01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:27.570
and who my mother.

01:43:27.570 --> 01:43:30.500
And Corinth, my childhood home,

01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:32.370
and Polybus and Merope,

01:43:32.370 --> 01:43:36.130
whom I loved
and thought my parents,

01:43:36.130 --> 01:43:38.800
how could you imagine
what a corrupt man

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:42.430
your open-faced boy would become
in his age?

01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:46.130
If ever a rosebud was soggy
and rotten within,

01:43:46.130 --> 01:43:49.230
if ever an apple
was filthy with maggots,

01:43:49.230 --> 01:43:52.730
let these images describe me
in my youth.

01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:56.600
Born damned
among the damned.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.900
And that triple junction
under the trees,

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:03.400
that overgrown place
where three roads meet,

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:07.100
do the trees still remember
and the shaded pathways

01:44:07.100 --> 01:44:10.130
what happened there,
whose blood was spilt?

01:44:10.130 --> 01:44:12.130
My father's,
my own.

01:44:12.130 --> 01:44:14.700
On the way to Thebes
I was that day,

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:18.370
and what acts I did when I got
there on the dead man's wife,

01:44:18.370 --> 01:44:21.070
entering so joyfully
the same passage

01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:23.300
that gave me exit
into the world,

01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:28.270
sowing my seed in the warm earth
where I was germinated.

01:44:28.270 --> 01:44:30.770
A marriage for a monster.

01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:32.800
Father!

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:33.830
Brother!

01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:35.130
Son!
Bride!

01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:36.500
Wife!
Mother!

01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.900
Children, sisters,
all confused!

01:44:38.900 --> 01:44:42.800
Horribly mingled in a liaison
too filthy to give a name to,

01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.170
too corrupt to be remembered
with anything but loathing.

01:44:46.170 --> 01:44:49.430
No more, then.

01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:51.570
Nothing.

01:44:51.570 --> 01:44:57.370
What should never have been done
should never be spoken of.

01:44:57.370 --> 01:45:01.700
Take me away,
quickly, for god's sake.

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:06.000
Hide me as far from the city
as a man can go.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:07.500
Drown me.

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:11.030
Bury my body under the floor
of the ocean.

01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:20.870
Where are you?

01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:23.770
Is anyone there?

01:45:23.770 --> 01:45:27.330
Or have you all gone?

01:45:27.330 --> 01:45:32.930
For pity's sake,
someone help me.

01:45:34.730 --> 01:45:37.270
Don't leave me alone.

01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:39.270
Take me.

01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:41.800
You need not draw back.

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:44.970
It's not infectious,
this crime of mine.

01:45:44.970 --> 01:45:49.670
I am the one who must bear
the guilt and the punishment

01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:52.770
and the shame,

01:45:52.770 --> 01:45:56.070
and I must bear it alone.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:25.270
>> Creon is coming.

01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:28.270
>> It's up to him now
to deal with you.

01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:30.270
>> He will advise us.

01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:31.970
>> And take action
as provisional governor

01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:32.970
in your place.

01:46:32.970 --> 01:46:34.670
>> Creon.

01:46:34.670 --> 01:46:36.970
Of course.

01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:38.930
There's nothing
I can say to him,

01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:44.170
and why should he listen
to anything I say?

01:46:44.170 --> 01:46:47.670
I treated him unjustly.

01:46:47.670 --> 01:46:52.830
>> I haven't come to crow,
Oedipus, now you are down,

01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:55.470
nor to accuse you of crimes
or misjudgments

01:46:55.470 --> 01:46:58.230
committed in the past.

01:46:58.230 --> 01:47:02.770
But you, people,

01:47:02.770 --> 01:47:04.730
if you have no respect
for the common decencies,

01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:08.170
the sympathy due
to any man's suffering,

01:47:08.170 --> 01:47:09.800
revere the sun at least,

01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:13.100
whose warmth and brightness
sustains us.

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.700
The open street
at the end of the day

01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.930
is no place
for a thing unclean, cursed,

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:20.970
and sentenced to be cast out.

01:47:20.970 --> 01:47:22.830
Not even in the open air,
on the common earth,

01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:28.800
or under the rain from heaven
will he find welcome or shelter.

01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:30.770
Take him in.

01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:32.700
His sufferings are no business
of the public.

01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.430
It's private,

01:47:34.430 --> 01:47:38.200
a question of family grief
and prayer,

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.870
a matter for his relations,
not the whole city.

01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:43.600
>> This is a kindness, Creon,

01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.230
more than I expected
in my degradation.

01:47:48.230 --> 01:47:52.330
For your sake,
not mine,

01:47:52.330 --> 01:47:54.030
let me ask one favor.

01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:55.170
>> What favor?

01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:57.200
You need not go on your knees.

01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:00.030
>> Get rid of me quickly.

01:48:00.030 --> 01:48:02.730
Deport me
to some empty wasteland

01:48:02.730 --> 01:48:05.430
where the human voice
is never heard.

01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:08.070
>> I could have done that
already, of course,

01:48:08.070 --> 01:48:10.270
but it seemed safer,
as a matter of priority,

01:48:10.270 --> 01:48:11.630
to consult the oracle.

01:48:11.630 --> 01:48:15.270
>> But the oracle has spoken
unambiguously.

01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:17.170
Kill the father-killer.

01:48:17.170 --> 01:48:19.300
Drive out the unclean thing.

01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:20.570
I am the man.

01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:21.570
>> That's true.

01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:23.530
That's what was said.

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:26.530
But in circumstances
as extraordinary as these,

01:48:26.530 --> 01:48:28.570
it seemed safer
to consult the god again.

01:48:28.570 --> 01:48:30.430
>> For what?

01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:33.830
I am the cause of all this pain,
and the punishment is known.

01:48:33.830 --> 01:48:35.270
What is there to ask?

01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:37.630
>> Haven't you, of all men,
learned to trust the gods?

01:48:37.630 --> 01:48:42.430
>> Yes, I've learned that.

01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:46.530
One favor more
I must ask or beg.

01:48:46.530 --> 01:48:51.430
The woman who lies dead
in the palace,

01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:54.470
let her be buried decently

01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:57.100
with whatever formalities
you think appropriate.

01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:58.270
She's your sister,

01:48:58.270 --> 01:48:59.670
your flesh and blood,

01:48:59.670 --> 01:49:01.970
and you owe her that.

01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:07.230
In my case,
Thebes is my country,

01:49:07.230 --> 01:49:09.800
my homeland, though I never
knew it until today,

01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:12.870
and my presence
alive within her walls

01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:14.400
would be a curse on her.

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:15.870
Let me leave

01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:20.170
and go up into my own mountains
of Cithaeron.

01:49:20.170 --> 01:49:24.200
My mother and father left me
there to die in the wilderness,

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.470
and I shall die now
in accordance with their wishes

01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:29.200
who wished me dead.

01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:33.730
My death, I know,
will be mysterious.

01:49:33.730 --> 01:49:35.970
My life was saved miraculously

01:49:35.970 --> 01:49:39.330
and not for the common death
of old age or sickness

01:49:39.330 --> 01:49:41.700
but for some other ending,

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:45.770
awe-inspiring and perhaps evil.

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.930
Let it come as it will.

01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:54.370
And now, my children,

01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:58.100
the boys, Creon,
Polynices and Eteocles,

01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:00.830
they're almost men
and can look after themselves

01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:01.930
wherever they go,

01:50:01.930 --> 01:50:05.230
but the girls,
they're so small,

01:50:05.230 --> 01:50:07.330
such babies yet.

01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:09.030
They have shared
everything with me,

01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:11.600
food and drink and company.

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.170
I doubt if they've ever so much
as eaten a meal

01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:15.400
away from their father.

01:50:15.400 --> 01:50:16.970
Look after them, Creon,

01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:19.600
for my sake.

01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.030
And if I could,
just once more,

01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:27.830
touch them and share my tears
with theirs.

01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:29.970
Just once more.

01:50:29.970 --> 01:50:33.500
Kindness and generosity
could do no more.

01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:37.770
Grasping their hands
and remembering,

01:50:37.770 --> 01:50:42.270
I could imagine I had eyes
to see them once more

01:50:42.270 --> 01:50:44.870
before I go.

01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:50.000
Shh!

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.070
I heard something.

01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:57.100
Are they here already?

01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:59.430
Are they crying?

01:50:59.430 --> 01:51:03.330
You have taken pity, Creon,
and brought them to me unasked,

01:51:03.330 --> 01:51:05.630
the dearest of my children.

01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:06.830
Am I right?

01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:09.030
>> I know how much
you love them

01:51:09.030 --> 01:51:10.830
and love them still
in spite of everything.

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:12.830
>> God bless you, Creon.

01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:15.800
May you have better luck
both as a king and as a man

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:19.000
than I've had.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.100
Children,
where are you?

01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:26.600
Come here to me.

01:51:31.730 --> 01:51:35.230
Embrace me.

01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:39.430
Antigone, Ismene.

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:44.270
These hands
are your brother's hands

01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:46.170
and your father's,

01:51:46.170 --> 01:51:48.700
the hands that blinded me.

01:51:48.700 --> 01:51:51.130
I was blind already,
if the truth be known.

01:51:51.130 --> 01:51:55.300
I saw nothing as I fathered you
on my own mother--

01:51:55.300 --> 01:51:56.730
only a wife.

01:51:56.730 --> 01:52:00.870
Was ever a man more blind?

01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:05.870
My eyes can't see you now,
but they can cry still.

01:52:05.870 --> 01:52:10.300
And they do to think what hard
lives you will lead in the world

01:52:10.300 --> 01:52:11.830
when you're grown up,

01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:14.730

people will say.

01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:17.130

01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:21.070
no fun for you they'll be,
staying at home in tears

01:52:21.070 --> 01:52:22.700
while the others
enjoy themselves.

01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:26.400
And then later, when you're old
enough to be married,

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:30.300
where is the man who will be
brave or foolhardy enough

01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:31.470
to take you on

01:52:31.470 --> 01:52:33.970
and that scandalous reputation
that shall stick

01:52:33.970 --> 01:52:37.130
to all my children
and my children's children?

01:52:37.130 --> 01:52:39.470
"Their father killed his father,

01:52:39.470 --> 01:52:42.370

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.430
Those girls, yes,
they're his sisters."

01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:49.900
That's the sort of thing
people will say.

01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:52.670
And who will marry you
in those circumstances?

01:52:52.670 --> 01:52:54.600
Nobody will.

01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:56.300
My poor girls.

and don't condemn them to share
the punishment that falls on me.

01:53:25.870 --> 01:53:28.370
They're very young,

01:53:28.370 --> 01:53:31.930
very poor now
and, if you don't help them,

01:53:31.930 --> 01:53:34.670
quite without hope.

01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:39.100
Promise me and take my hand
upon the promise.

01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:51.130
Good brother.

01:53:51.130 --> 01:53:52.330
Good.

my girls,

01:53:57.870 --> 01:54:00.970

such things,
