WEBVTT

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.470
SUMMER DAYS ALONG
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN...

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.370
THIS IS THE OUTER COAST OF
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS...

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:42.770
FROM A PORTRAIT
MADE IN 1981.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.370
HIGH, WIDE BEACHES...

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.930
TOWERING CLIFFS...

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.900
GRASSY DUNES...

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.030
A COAST FOREVER THE SAME,
AND YET UNDERGOING A SLOW,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:09.830
RELENTLESS TRANSFORMATION
SPANNING THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:17.530
A COAST BEING SUBMERGED
BY A RISING SEA.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.670
TODAY, IN THE EARLY PART OF THE
21ST CENTURY, THIS COAST IS

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.400
STILL RETREATING AN AVERAGE
OF TWO TO THREE FEET A YEAR.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.930
BUT ONE THING IS DIFFERENT:
MOST SCIENTISTS NOW BELIEVE

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.670
THAT SEA LEVEL RISE IS IN PART
A RESULT OF MAN'S OWN DOING.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.700
THAT THE RELEASE OF
HEAT-TRAPPING GREENHOUSE GASES

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.330
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE IS A MAJOR
CAUSE FOR THE RISE IN

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.500
TEMPERATURES AROUND THE GLOBE,
AND THUS THE RISE IN SEA LEVEL.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.130
THE OUTER COAST OF THE
CAPE LOOKS MUCH AS IT DID

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.430
IN THE SUMMER
OF 1978,

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.730
BUT IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
IT'S BEEN LEFT ALONE

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.470
- CAPE CODDERS
REALIZING LONG AGO

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.230
THAT TO TRY TO STOP THE SEA
ALONG THIS BEACH WAS UNWISE.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:10.400
THESE CLIFFS PROBABLY LOOKED
THE SAME 500 YEARS AGO,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.700
BUT STOOD A QUARTER
OF A MILE OUT TO SEA.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.030
THIS BARRIER BEACH HAS LOOKED
THE SAME FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.830
BUT IT'S BEEN RETREATING,
MAINTAINING ITS GENERAL FORM

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.130
BUT MIGRATING
LANDWARD.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.370
THIS SALT MARSH APPEARS
THE SAME AS IN YEARS PAST

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.730
BUT ITS BORDERS HAVE
BEEN CREEPING INLAND.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.300
THIS COAST IS BEING
SUBMERGED BY A COMBINATION

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.770
OF THE SINKING OF THE
LAND AND A RISING SEA.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.300
SOME COASTS OF THE WORLD
ARE NOT BEING SUBMERGED -

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.000
PLACES WHERE THE LAND
IS RISING AT THE SAME RATE

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.800
OR EVEN FASTER
THAN SEA LEVEL.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.600
BUT ALONG THIS COAST, ALONG THE
EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.470
THE LAND IS BEING SUBMERGED
AT A RATE OF ABOUT

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.170
A VERTICAL FOOT
EVERY HUNDRED YEARS.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.970
AND IN LOW-LYING AREAS A
ONE-FOOT RISE IN SEA LEVEL

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.330
COULD SEND WATER LANDWARD
BY HUNDREDS OF FEET.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.170
FORMED BY VAST ICE SHEETS TOWARD
THE END OF THE LAST ICE AGE,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.800
CAPE COD CONSISTS ALMOST
ENTIRELY OF SAND, GRAVEL, SILT,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.970
CLAY AND BOULDERS LEFT BY THE
GLACIERS AFTER THEIR RETREAT

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.200
SOME 15,000 YEARS AGO.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.370
THE OUTLINE OF THIS
COAST LOOKED LIKE THIS.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.670
AS GLACIERS MELTED AND SEA
LEVEL INCREASED, WIND, WAVES,

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.700
AND TIDES BEGAN TO SHAPE IT
AND ITS PROFILE EVOLVED.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.870
THE OUTER ARM OF THE
CAPE STARTED TO TAKE

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.230
ITS PRESENT SHAPE
AROUND 6,000 YEARS AGO...

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.500
5,000...

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.100
3,700...

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.370
2,000...

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.070
AND TODAY.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.400
EVIDENCE OF SEA LEVEL RISE
CAN BE SEEN IN THESE PHOTOS.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.400
IN EACH, THE YELLOW LINE SHOWS
THE UPPER LIMIT OF THE BLACK

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.070
ZONE OF A PARTICULAR ALGAE WHICH
GROWS ONLY NEAR SEA LEVEL.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.130
THE DIFFERENCE IS SOME 13 TO 14
INCHES HIGHER IN THE YEAR 2000

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.000
THAN IN 1900.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.670
AND EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 19TH

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.230
CENTURY, ROUGHLY THE START
OF THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.900
THE RATE OF SEA LEVEL RISE HAS
DOUBLED AND THAT GLOBAL WARMING

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.570
IS RESPONSIBLE AS THE WORLD'S
GLACIERS MELT MORE RAPIDLY

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.030
AND THE WARMER SEAS
EXPAND IN VOLUME.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.130


00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.700
IN SUMMER, THE COAST
MAY SEEM ETERNAL...

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.270
BUT IT'S JUST
AN ILLUSION.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.500
FOR SOON SUMMER WILL END
AND THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.470
LAND AND SEA
WILL BEGIN AGAIN.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:31.170


00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.230
WITH THE CHANGING OF THE
SEASONS COMES A NEW INTERPLAY

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.670
OF NATURE'S ELEMENTS.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.430
AS THE NORTHERN
HEMISPHERE COOLS,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.630
GLOBAL WEATHER
PATTERNS CHANGE.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.600
THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMES
RESTLESS AND THE WIND SHIFTS

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.570
FROM QUARTER
TO QUARTER.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.170
WAVES FROM OFFSHORE
STORMS RAGE IN.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:08.870


00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.130
WHILE RISING SEA LEVEL IS
SUBMERGING THIS COAST QUIETLY

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.800
OVER TIME, THE EFFECTS OF
WIND AND WAVES ARE IMMEDIATE.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:26.770


00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.030
THE HIGH, WIDE SUMMER BEACHES
ARE CUT BY STORM WAVES

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:39.400
REACHING FAR UP
ONTO THE BACK SHORE.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.400
AS WAVES HIT AT AN ANGLE TO THE
BEACH, SAND IS LIFTED INTO

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.170
SUSPENSION AND MOVED DOWN SHORE
ALONG THE BEACH IN A LITERAL

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:54.570
CURRENT DETERMINED BY THE ENERGY
AND DIRECTION OF THE WAVES...

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:01.000
WHILE SOME SAND IS CARRIED
OFFSHORE FORMING BARS.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.700
IN JUST A FEW HOURS A HIGH BERM
IS REDUCED TO A LOW, FLAT PLAIN.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.300
THE EFFECT OF THESE
NEW COASTAL FORMS IS TO

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.230
SPREAD OUT THE TURBULENT
ENERGY OF THE WAVES.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.900
LARGER STORM WAVES BREAK
FIRST ON THE OFFSHORE BARS

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.030
AND THEN DISPERSE OVER
THE LOW, FLAT BEACH.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:28.270
THESE CONDITIONS TEND TO PROTECT
THE LAND FROM FURTHER EROSION.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.170
BUT WINTER STORMS,
"NOR'EASTERS",

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.670
ARE MUCH
MORE SEVERE.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:41.530
WATER LEVELS ARE HEIGHTENED
BY GALES, BY HIGHER TIDES,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.570
AND BY STORM SURGES - A
RESULT OF HIGH WINDS AND LOW

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:51.730
ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE, ALLOWING
THE WATER TO BULGE UPWARD.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.670
WITHOUT THE PROTECTION
OF THE HIGH SUMMER BEACH,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.130
WAVES ARE DRIVEN TO THE
FOOT OF THE DUNES AND CLIFFS.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:26.570


00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.970
SEVERE EROSION FROM WINTER
STORMS TENDS TO BE LOCAL,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.270
WITH WAVE ATTACK
MOST SEVERE

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.070
WHERE OFFSHORE
BARS HAVE NOT FORMED.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:41.870
OFFSHORE BARS MAY
PROTECT AN AREA FOR YEARS

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:47.530
BUT THE DEGREE OF PROTECTION
VARIES AS BARS CHANGE.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:57.830


00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.100
IN AREAS WHERE
BARRIER DUNES ARE LOW,

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.500
STORM WAVES MAY
OVERWASH THEM,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.830
CARRYING SAND FROM THE
BEACH TO THE BACK SIDE.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:35.130


00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.470
IT ORIGINATES
WITH THE SUN.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.470
THE SUN WARMS THE AIR
AND SETS IT IN MOTION.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:46.600
THE WIND BLOWS ACROSS
THE SURFACE OF THE WATER

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.670
AND GENERATES WAVES.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:58.200
THE WAVES BREAK ON THE
SHORE AND MODEL THE LAND.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.530
ALTHOUGH STORMS BRING
EXTRAORDINARY CONDITIONS

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.070
OF HIGH SEAS, THEY ARE IN A
SENSE PREPARING THE LAND

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.470
FOR THE ORDINARY
CONDITIONS

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.170
THAT RISING SEA LEVEL
WILL ULTIMATELY BRING.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:19.400


00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:24.200
THIS COAST IS ERODING.
IT IS RETREATING.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:32.400


00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.270
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SEDIMENT
ERODED BY WINTER STORMS?

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:40.130
IN FACT, EROSION OF THE
SHORELINE AND THE LONGSHORE

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.000
MOVEMENT OF SAND PROVIDES
A SOURCE OF SEDIMENT

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.370
FOR ALL COASTAL FORMS,
OFTEN MANY MILES AWAY.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.530
ON THE CAPE, WHERE NO
SAND IS SUPPLIED BY RIVERS,

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:56.000
EROSION OF THE COAST IS
THE ONLY SOURCE OF SAND.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.170
MATERIAL SCOURED OUT OF THE
CLIFFS IS CARRIED ALONG THE

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:05.430
SHORE BY THE LITERAL CURRENTS,
THEN DEPOSITED AS BEACHES.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:13.130
FROM THE BEACHES, SAND
DUNES ARE FORMED BY WIND.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.800
DUNES PROTECT THE LAND
BEHIND THEM FROM FLOODING

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.270
WHILE PROVIDING A STORE
OF SEDIMENT TO BE USED

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.170
IN THE GIVE AND TAKE
OF COASTAL SYSTEMS.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:29.570
AND IT IS EROSION THAT PROVIDES
MATERIAL FOR THE BARRIER BEACHES

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:35.600
THAT LINE THE COAST, PROTECTING
SALT MARSHES, ESTUARIES,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.000
HARBORS AND TOWNS
LYING SAFELY BEHIND THEM.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:49.000


00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.170
BARRIER BEACHES ARE BOTH
TRANSIENT AND STABLE,

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.330
MOVING WITH THE WIND AND WAVES,
MAINTAINING THEIR EXISTENCE,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.700
EVEN KEEPING PACE WITH RISING
SEA LEVEL BY BUILDING UP

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.500
AROUND THE VEGETATION
THAT GROWS ON THEM.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.330
FREE MOVEMENT OF SEDIMENT IS
ESSENTIAL TO BARRIER BEACHES.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.930
AT TIMES THEY MAY
HOLD BACK STORM WAVES,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.970
AT OTHER TIMES BE BROKEN
THROUGH OR OVERWASHED.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.030
BUT WITH THE FREE MOVEMENT
OF SAND THEY TEND TO SURVIVE

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.130
AND REPAIR THEMSELVES
AS THEIR PROFILE EVOLVES.

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:24.400
AND PROTECTED FROM THE
OPEN WATER BY BARRIER BEACHES,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.130
SALT MARSHES THRIVE -
A HABITAT ESSENTIAL TO

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:33.370
MARINE LIFE AND ONE OF
THE RICHEST ON EARTH.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.470
THIS COAST IS AN ENVIRONMENT
HELD TOGETHER BY THE

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:41.230
MOVEMENT OF SAND AND
THE FREEDOM TO EVOLVE.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.730
TO TRY TO STABILIZE IT, TO
FIX IT IN PLACE, IS TO DISRUPT

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.170
ITS EQUILIBRIUM, THROW IT
OUT OF BALANCE, AND SET OFF

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:53.270
A BATTLE WITH NATURE THAT WILL
BE COSTLY AND NEVER ENDING.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:13:06.200


00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.170
ALONG THE COAST, HUMAN
EXISTENCE IN PAST GENERATIONS

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.700
WAS TUNED TO THE
RHYTHMS OF NATURE.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.330
LIVES WERE LIVED AND LOST
WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:21.000
OF NATURAL CIRCUMSTANCE.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
COMMUNITIES GREW BY
HARBORS AND ESTUARIES,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.200
SAFELY AWAY FROM
THE HIGH ENERGY COAST.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.470
THEY WERE BUILT AROUND
NATURE'S PROVIDENCE

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.700
AND WITHIN HER LIMITS...

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.570
LIMITS DETERMINED
BY TIME, OBSERVATION,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:40.370
AND THE MISTAKES
OF THE PAST.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:47.670


00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:50.400
PEOPLE WHO EARN THEIR
LIVING FROM THE SEA

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.670
KNOW ITS
ANNUAL CYCLES.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:14:03.570
FOR SOME, ITS
ANCESTRAL HERITAGE...

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.830
THE SOLITUDE, BEAUTY, AND
BITTERNESS OF THE WINTER COAST

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.330
ARE PART OF DAILY LIFE.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:25.000


00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.200
BUT WITH THE GROWTH OF
COASTAL CITIES AND TOWNS,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.400
THE DEVELOPMENT OF AMERICA'S
SHORELINE HAS LED TO UNPLANNED,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.830
UNCONTROLLED BUILDING TOO
CLOSE TO THE WATER'S EDGE.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.030
HOMES, BUSINESSES,
ENTIRE COMMUNITIES

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:46.400
GRADUALLY REPLACING
THE GRASSY DUNES.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.970
BUT WITHOUT DUNES THERE IS
NO PROTECTION FROM FLOODING

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.730
AND NO SEDIMENT
SUPPLY FOR THE BEACHES.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:59.600
AND WITHOUT BEACHES THERE IS
LITTLE PROTECTION FROM WAVES.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.430
AS THE SHORELINE RETREATED AND
THE BUILDINGS WERE THREATENED,

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.130
ENGINEERING MEASURES WERE
UNDERTAKEN TO STOP THE SEA'S

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:10.700
ENCROACHMENT, TO SAVE THE HOUSES
AND BUILDINGS FROM WASHING AWAY:

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:14.230
JETTIES AND GROINS TO TRAP THE
LONGSHORE MOVEMENT OF SAND,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.030
WOODEN BULKHEADS,
STONE REVETMENTS.

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:22.230
AND ULTIMATELY
CONCRETE SEA WALLS.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.500
BUT THESE STRUCTURES FURTHER
INTERRUPT THE FLOW OF SAND,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.470
OFTEN STARVING THE
BEACHES DOWNSTREAM.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.830
SO MORE STRUCTURES ARE
NEEDED, MORE WALLS, BUT WAVES

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:40.930
REFLECTING OFF THE WALLS CAUSE
EVEN GREATER TURBULENCE

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:45.000
AND THE BEACH IS SCOURED AWAY
EVEN FASTER, UNTIL FINALLY

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.900
THE WALLS ARE UNDERMINED
AND CLAWED AWAY AT THE SIDES.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.270
STRUCTURES BUILT TO STABILIZE
THE SHORE HAVE SEVERELY

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.530
DISRUPTED THE FLOW OF SAND,
WASTED BEACHES AND DUNES,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.200
AND THREATEN THE
COAST'S DESTRUCTION.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:20.500


00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.730
A FEW MILES AWAY ACROSS CAPE
COD BAY, IN TOWNS ALL ALONG THE

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:33.430
MAINLAND COAST, THE BLIZZARD OF
'78 LEFT A TRAIL OF DISASTER.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.430
IN THIS ONE TOWN ALONE,
HUNDREDS OF HOMES

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:42.570
WERE DESTROYED OR
SEVERELY DAMAGED...

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:47.500
STREETS UNDER FOUR
FEET OF WATER...

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.770
PROPERTY BURIED
BENEATH ROCKS AND DEBRIS...

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:56.130
IN A 15-FOOT
TIDAL SURGE.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.930
AND IN ALL THE STATE'S
COASTAL COMMUNITIES

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:05.600
ESTIMATED DAMAGE
OF $300 MILLION.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.900
AFTER YEARS OF BUILDING AND
REBUILDING AND AN ONGOING

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.970
STRUGGLE TO DEFEND
THE SHORE FROM EROSION,

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:18.470
A SHORELINE WITH NO
SAND LEFT, NO BEACH.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:26.600
ONLY ROCK, STEEL,
AND CONCRETE.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:33.200


00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.300
THIRTY YEARS LATER, A PERIOD
OF MANY SIGNIFICANT STORMS,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:41.700
THESE SAME HOUSES CONTINUE
TO BE DESTROYED THEN REBUILT.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:47.530
MANY BIGGER AND
GRANDER THAN EVER.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:54.670
AND THE ARMOR - ROCK AND
CONCRETE SEA WALLS - REPAIRED.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.130
THE IDEA OF GIVING UP A VIEW
OF THE WATER UNTHINKABLE

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:05.000
DESPITE THE COST: THE
RUIN OF THE COAST ITSELF

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.770
AND THE CERTAINTY IT
WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:23.330


00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.070
ON THE CAPE, WINTER GIVES
WAY TO A NEW SEASON.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.400


00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:37.000
LONGER, LOWER, MORE ORDERLY
WAVES RETURN THE SAND

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.070
FROM OFFSHORE AND
REPLENISH THE BEACHES.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.030
WHILE THE TURBULENT, HIGH ENERGY
WAVES OF WINTER KEPT SEDIMENT

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.000
IN SUSPENSION LONGER AND
CARRIED IT AWAY FROM THE BEACH,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.830
THESE GENTLE SPRING
WAVES SOAK INTO THE BEACH

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:57.030
AND DROP OFF SEDIMENT
AS THEY ROLL BACK.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:09.700


00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.630
IN A MATTER OF WEEKS THE
HIGH, WIDE SUMMER BEACHES

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:18.500
ARE RESTORED.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.300
THE CLIFFS HAVE
RETREATED...

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.970
THE WINTER SCARP IS COVERED
AND THE CLIFF FACE SMOOTHED

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:27.400
BY SAND AND GRAVEL
SLIDING FROM ABOVE.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.400


00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.870
AND THE BARRIER
BEACHES HAVE HELD.

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.770
EVEN WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN
WASHED OVER BY WINTER STORMS,

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.630
NEAR VEGETATION BEGINS TO
TAKE HOLD IN THE FANS OF SAND

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.300
CARRIED LANDWARD
BY THE WINTER WAVES.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.300
AND AS THE SAND BUILDS UP,
CAUGHT BY CLUMPS OF THE

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.600
FAST-GROWING BEACH GRASS,
NEW DUNES BEGIN TO FORM.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:00.970
WITH THE NEW SEASON
THE COAST IS REJUVENATED,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:06.300
ONLY NOW IT'S A FRACTION
LANDWARD FROM A YEAR AGO.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.930


00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.500
THE EFFECT OF THE
SUBMERGENCE OF THIS COAST

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.930
IS TO PUT HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF HOMES

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.670
WITHIN 500 FEET OF THE
UNITED STATES COASTLINE

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.630
IN PERIL, AND THE
LOW-LYING AREAS,

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:32.030
THOSE CLOSE TO SEA LEVEL,
WILL BE HIT FIRST AND HARDEST.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.830
IN UNDEVELOPED AREAS
THE CHOICE IS SIMPLE:

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.530
BUILD WELL BACK
FROM THE WATER,

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:39.730
UNDERSTANDING HOW
THE COAST IS EVOLVING

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.730
AND RESPECTING
ITS WAYS.

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:49.970
ON DEVELOPED COASTS THE CHOICES
ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT:

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:56.570
ARTIFICIALLY REPLENISH THE
BEACHES, SUPPLY MILLIONS OF

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.470
CUBIC YARDS OF SAND FROM
OFFSHORE PUMPING STATIONS

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:07.670
OR HAULED IN BY TRUCK,
UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.770
IT'S OFTEN ONLY FOR
THE BENEFIT OF A FEW

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:18.500
AND THAT THE NEW BEACH
WILL ONLY BE TEMPORARY.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.100
ELEVATE THE STRUCTURES,
PUT THEM ON PILINGS

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.300
HIGH ABOVE STORM TIDE
LEVEL - 20 FEET OR MORE.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:35.100
ARMOR THE COAST - WALL IT OFF
AT PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EXPENSE,

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.530
LEAVING IT SURROUNDED BY WATER,
SACRIFICING THE BEACH AND MUCH

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.930
OF THE ORIGINAL ENVIRONMENT
FOR A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:50.470
IT CAN WITHSTAND
WHATEVER NATURE BRINGS.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.570
OR BEGIN A RETREAT...
MOVE THE BUILDINGS BACK,

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:59.400
PUT A LIMIT ON REBUILDING
AFTER A STORM,

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.100
AND BUY THE LAND THROUGH
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MEANS.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.270
HELP PEOPLE TO MOVE AS AN
ALTERNATIVE TO FLOOD INSURANCE,

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:16.700
DISASTER RELIEF, AND THE
ENTICEMENT TO BUILD BACK.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.170
THEY'RE COMPLEX AND PAINFUL
CHOICES, BUT THEY WILL

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:28.830
HAVE TO BE MADE AS SURELY
AS SEA LEVEL IS RISING.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.170
ALTHOUGH THE SHORELINE OF
THE SUMMER LOOKS THE SAME,

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.970
COUNTLESS TONS OF
EARTH HAVE BEEN MOVED.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.300
THE COAST HAS
BEEN RESHAPED.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.930
IT'S DIFFERENT THIS
YEAR FROM LAST,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.300
BUT IN ESSENCE
IS STILL THE SAME.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:49.400
EROSION OF THE COAST
IS NOT A PROBLEM WHERE

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.400
NATURE IS GIVEN THE
FREEDOM TO DO WHAT IT WILL.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.800
ONLY WHERE MAN
HAS MANAGED BADLY.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.000
IT WON'T BE EASY TO
CORRECT THE MISTAKES.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.570
A HUNDRED YEAR STORM WHERE
THE INCREASED RATE OF SEA LEVEL

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.900
RISE DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING
INVOLVE A TIMEFRAME

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.970
THAT IS BEYOND OUR EVERYDAY
FRAME OF REFERENCE.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.270
AND MAN'S OWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR
GLOBAL WARMING HAS IMPLICATIONS

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:23.230
FAR BEYOND THE
PROBLEMS OF THE COAST.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.930
AT STAKE IS THE FUTURE
OF AMERICA'S COASTS.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.830
THE BEAUTY AND BENEFIT OF
ITS EVER-EVOLVING FORMS,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.400
THE WELL-BEING OF ITS RESIDENTS
ULTIMATELY DEPENDENT ON THE

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.770
HEALTH OF ITS SHORELINE, AND
THE GUARANTEE OUR COASTS

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.570
WILL REMAIN THE SAME IN
ALL THEIR NATURAL WONDER

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:48.800
FOR MANY
GENERATIONS TO COME.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.800
}
