JOHN

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.900
STOSSEL IS GOING

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.500
TO TACKLE SOME QUESTIONS THAT

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.400
HAVE HAD PARENTS REELING ALL

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.160
OVER THE COUNTRY.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.300
WE'RE BRINGING UP QUESTIONS

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.600
THAT SEEM TO EASY

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.930
TO ANSWER ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE'S

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.630
CHILD AND SO DIFFICULT WHEN IT

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.260
COMES TO YOUR OWN.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.000
HOW MUCH CONTROL DO WE PARENTS

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.700
REALLY HAVE OVER WHAT

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.860
OUR KIDS DO?

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.830
IT IS OUR DUTY TO FEED THEM,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.800
CLOTHE THEM, TEACH THEM RIGHT

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.000
FROM WRONG.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.330
AND MANY OF US BLAME OURSELVES

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.260
WHEN OUR KIDS DO WRONG.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.330
BUT NOW, OTHER PEOPLE ARE

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330
BLAMING US, TOO.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.430
AND SOME DEMAND RETRIBUTION.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.000
IF A CHILD HAS POSSESSION

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.860
OF A HANDGUN, THEN I THINK THAT

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.560
PARENTS SHOULD BE SUBJECT

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560
TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.900
THAT'S THE WAY TO SEND MESSAGES.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.600
THE PARENTS NEED TO BE HELD

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.000
RESPONSIBLE.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.660
THEY CAN'T JUST TURN

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.400
THE OTHER WAY OR BURY THEIR HEAD

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.900
IN THE SAND.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.630
THERE IS A GATHERING MOVEMENT

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.160
TO HOLD PARENTS MORE

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.630
RESPONSIBLE.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.160
SHOULDN'T THE PARENTS HAVE

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.800
KNOWN SOMETHING WAS GOING ON?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.300
Reporter: AFTER THE HORROR

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.160
OF THOSE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, LOTS

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.760
OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA SAID,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.930
"WHERE WERE THE PARENTS?

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.930
HOW COULD THEY HAVE MISSED

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.230
THE WARNING SIGNS?

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.260
HOW COULD THEY NOT HAVE KNOWN

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.560
WHAT WAS GOING ON?"

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.400
MANY OF US SAID, "MY KIDS

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.330
COULDN'T DO THAT, COULD THEY?"

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.360
AND AFTER THE KILLINGS,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.200
THE PARENTS OF SOME

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.500

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.660
THE CAMERAS HEARTBROKEN

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.500
AND APOLOGETIC.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.330
THERE JUST IS NOT NO WORDS

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.660
FROM ANY OF US OR ANYTHING

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.830
ANYONE CAN DO THAT WILL EVER

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.630
MAKE THAT RIGHT AGAIN.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.130
Reporter: BUT APOLOGIES

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.160
AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH, SAY

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.000
THE FAMILIES OF MANY

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.200
OF THE VICTIMS.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.730
WE NEED TO START MAKING SOME

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.760
PARENTS PAY SOME PRICES

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.860
FOR THE ACTIONS OF THEIR CHILD.

WHERE WERE THE PARENTS?

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.430
YOU GET A CHILD THAT -- THAT'S

MR. KLEBOLD TOLD THE JUDGE

CURIOUS AT TIMES, DYLAN KLEBOLD

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.200

DIVORCED AND HIS FATHER LIVED

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.400

ANDREW GOLDEN'S FAMILY SAID

HE WAS "AN IDEAL KID" WHO "NEVER

WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

THE SAME ANSWERS THEY WOULD --

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.100
WHY IT HAPPENED, WHY SOMETHING

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.960
LIKE THIS CAN GO ON UNTIL KIDS

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.630

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.730
THERE WERE WARNING SIGNS.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.130
WHEN ANDREW WAS IN FIRST

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.960

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.800

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.000
HE FILLED IT FULL OF SAND.

HE WENT UP TO A LITTLE GIRL,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.100
AND HE SHOT HER IN THE FACE.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.830
ONE LITTLE GIRL TOLD ME THAT

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.660

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.060
THEY ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT KILLING

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.160

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.330
APPLIES TO.

THEIR CHILDREN TO PLAY

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.830
WITH YOUR CHILD BECAUSE

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.860
YOUR CHILD IS GOING AROUND

HE DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.300
OF GIRLS BREAKING UP WITH HIM

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.060
SO HE'D JUST KILL 'EM ONE DAY.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.060
HE CAME UP TO US AND SAID,

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.230

ANDREW GOLDEN'S PARENTS PAID

THEIR LAWSUIT.

NOW, IN ALL THESE CASES,

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.400
THE LAWSUITS ARE ABOUT MONEY.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.500
NO ONE HAS OFFICIALLY CALLED

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.330

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560
PARENTS ARE BEING PUT IN JAIL --

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.730
NOT JUST SUED.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:24.530
IT'S ALL PART OF A NATIONWIDE

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.660
MOVEMENT TO GET TOUGH

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.000

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.830
TO HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.000
CRIMINALLY, FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.500
DELINQUENT ACTS.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.160
NOW, FOR DECADES THERE HAVE BEEN

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.700
LAWS ON THE BOOKS ABOUT ACTIVELY

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.760

DRUGS OR ALCOHOL.

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.830
BUT NEW PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.100
LAWS GO FURTHER, HOLDING PARENTS

ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW WELL

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.730
WE SUPERVISE OUR KIDS.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.530
IN OTHER CASES, ALREADY EXISTING

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.900
LAWS ARE BEING INTERPRETED MORE

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.830
BROADLY TO SINGLE OUT

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.730
THE PARENTS.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.930
FOR EXAMPLE, IN CALIFORNIA

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.400
IN 1996, AN 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.960
USED HER MOTHER'S LOADED SHOTGUN

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.760
TO SHOOT AT TWO BOYS WHO WERE

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.030
MAKING FUN OF HER OUTSIDE

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:04.130
HER HOUSE.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.730
SHE KILLED THIS BOY.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.960
THE LOCAL PROSECUTOR APPLIED

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.600
A NEW NEGLIGENT GUN STORAGE LAW

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.930
TO PUT THE GIRL'S MOTHER IN JAIL

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.230
FOR A YEAR.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.960
UNDER JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA'S,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.130
NEW PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY LAW,

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.460
THESE PARENTS WERE ARRESTED

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.700
BECAUSE THEIR KIDS REPEATEDLY

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.330
SKIPPED SCHOOL.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.300
IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THIS GIRL,

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.230
WHO'D ROBBED AN ELDERLY WOMAN,

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.060
WAS ORDERED TETHERED TO ONE

WITH A PARENT IN SCHOOL

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.630
WITH HER, SHE STARTED GETTING

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.300
STRAIGHT "A"s.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.130
AND IN MICHIGAN, A PROSECUTOR

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.000
USED A NEW PARENTAL

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.560
THEIR SON, ALEX, WHO'D BEEN

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:42.660
CAUGHT ROBBING HOUSES

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:44.730
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.730
I'D NEVER HAD A DOUBT THAT

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:47.030
I WAS A GOOD PARENT.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.930
Reporter: NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.100
SAID THE LOCAL CITY ATTORNEY.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.300
WHY COULD THE POLICE FIND

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.800
IN THIS YOUNG MAN'S ROOM,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.830
OPENLY, DRUGS, EMPTY ALCOHOL

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.700
BOTTLES, A PISTOL, WHEN

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.100
THE PARENTS COULDN'T?

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.230
Reporter: THE PROVENZINOS

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.260
CLAIMED THEY NEVER SAW ANYTHING

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.660
SUSPICIOUS.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.000
AND THAT WHEN ALEX WAS OUT

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.060
ROBBING HOUSES, THEY THOUGHT

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.030
HE WAS IN HIS ROOM, ASLEEP.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.100
WE FOUND OUT LATER THAT

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.130
HE WOULD SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.400
OR SNEAK OUT OF THE WINDOW.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.600
Reporter: IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.800
THEY COULD HAVE CONTROLLED ALEX.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.060
IN COURT IT WAS REVEALED THAT

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.630
THEY WERE INTIMIDATED

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.660
BY THEIR MUCH LARGER SON.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:22.100
ONE OF ALEX'S FRIENDS SAID ALEX

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.100
WOULD YELL AT HIS PARENTS.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.100
HE'D THEM THEM, "GET OUT,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.960
YOU STUPID DWARF."

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.760
AND WHAT WOULD HIS FATHER DO

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.530
IN RESPONSE TO THOSE WORDS?

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:33.430
HE WOULD GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.330
AND WHAT IS THE VERDICT

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.230
REGARDING ANTHONY PROVENZINO?

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.230
GUILTY.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.700
THE PROVENZINOS WERE ORDERED

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.800
TO PAY A FINE, COURT COSTS

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.260
AND THE COST OF ALEX'S

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.860
DETENTION, $155 A DAY.

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:46.500
WE DON'T EARN THAT KIND

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.900

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.100
WE CAN'T PAY $155 PER DAY.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.300

ON A TECHNICALITY.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:56.760
I THINK IT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.900
TO MAKE PARENTS CRIMINALLY

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.930

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.160
PARENTS SHOULD BE ABLE

IDEALLY.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.330
BUT LET'S GET REAL.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.560
THERE ARE KIDS THAT NO PARENT

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.730
HAS BEEN ABLE TO CONSTRAIN,

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:19.630

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.500

TO US, BUT IN COURT,

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.830
BILLY HENKEL TESTIFIED IT WAS

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.400
HIS 18-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER'S

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.900
PARTY, AND IF HE'D STOPPED

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.760
THE UNDERAGE DRINKING, IT WOULD

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.130
HAVE EMBARRASSED HER.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.330
BUT KIDS WHO WERE THERE SAY

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.660
THE HENKELS DIDN'T

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.660
JUST ALLOW THE PARTY.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.060
THEY WERE JOINING

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:56.960
IN ON THE PARTY.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.360

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.060
SEEMED LIKE A REGULAR OLD NIGHT

00:11:59.060 --> 00:11:59.860
TO THEM, YOU KNOW.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.100
Reporter: AT THE PARTY,

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:02.500
MRS. HENKEL WAS IN THE KITCHEN,

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.060
PASSING OUT SHOTS OF TEQUILA.

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.830
SHE WAS JUST EGGING EVERYBODY

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:06.630
ON.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.330
SHE WAS LIKE, "COME ON,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.100
YOU CAN DO IT."

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.930
YOU KNOW?

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.800
"DON'T BE A WIMP ABOUT IT."

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.430
YOU KNOW, "BE A MAN," YOU KNOW?

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.460
Reporter: AROUND 1:00 THAT

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.660
MORNING, 16-YEAR-OLD JOE DELAO

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.700
AND FOUR OF HIS FRIENDS LEFT

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.760
THE PARTY.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.360
I DIDN'T FEEL DRUNK.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.500
I FELT PRETTY GOOD.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.030
Reporter: AND SO THEY PILED

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.100
INTO JOE'S PICKUP TRUCK

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.500
AND HEADED DOWN COUNTY

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.130
ROAD 1150.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:29.830
NOBODY REALLY NOTICED

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.400
ANYTHING WAS WRONG UNTIL WE HAD

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.760
COME UP ON THE STOP SIGN.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.330
Reporter: BY THE TIME JOE HIT

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.760
THE BRAKE, IT WAS TOO LATE.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.660
EVERYBODY JUST STARTED

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.030
SCREAMING.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.900
WE JUST, LIKE, SLID.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.230
WE JUST SLID.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.200
AND THAT'S ALL I REMEMBER.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.330
I FOUND ONE YOUNG MAN LAYING

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.400
OUT THROUGH WHERE THE WINDSHIELD

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.800
HAD BEEN.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.760
THERE WAS ONE OTHER PERSON

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.960
I COULD SEE INSIDE THE PICKUP.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.830
AND THEN I HAD ONE YOUNG MAN

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:52.700
LYING ON THE GROUND

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:53.460
UNDER THE PICKUP.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.630
HE WAS SAYING, "HELP ME."

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:55.500
HE KNEW HE WAS IN A LOT

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.130
OF TROUBLE.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:58.600
I THINK HE KNEW HE WAS DYING.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.460
Reporter: TWO OF THE BOYS DID

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.560
DIE.

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.460
NOW, WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THESE

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.300
DEATHS?

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.600
THE HENKELS SAY THE ACCIDENT IS

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.530
SOLELY JOE'S FAULT --

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.660
HE DROVE THE CAR.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.160
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME, DO

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.400
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.260
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE KIDS

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.030
THAT DIED --

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:14.530

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.330

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.860
NO.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.300
Reporter: WHY IS THAT?

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.260
NAH, BECAUSE I DIDN'T --

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:22.930
I DIDN'T INVITE ANYBODY OUT

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.930
THERE.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.700
I DIDN'T FURNISH THE LIQUOR

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.860
FOR THEM, AND I CAN'T BE HELD

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:30.800

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.400
PEOPLE.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.200
I THINK THEY WERE

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.960
OUTRAGEOUSLY IRRESPONSIBLE WITH

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.930

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.960

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.760
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.700
EXPANDING THE REACH

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:46.760
OF AN EXISTING LAW, SHE ACCUSED

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.960
THE HENKELS OF BEING JUST

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.800
AS GUILTY AS THE DRIVER

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.000

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.700
SHE CHARGED THEM WITH

INTOXICATION MANSLAUGHTER.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.130
A JURY VOTED TO CONVICT.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.100
THE HENKELS WERE ORDERED LOCKED

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.160

"HOST LIABILITY" LAWS IS

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.660
A GROWING PHENOMENON.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.760
IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, THIS MOTHER

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.430
WAS CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.560

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.000
AT HER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

PARTY, AND ONE BOY DIED

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:17.230

CAR CRASH.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.560
SO CLEARLY, HOSTING A PARTY

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.360
WHERE UNDERAGE KIDS DRINK CAN

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.930
HAVE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES --

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.400
NOT JUST FOR THE KIDS,

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.260
BUT FOR THE PARENTS, TOO.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.560
YET, THE REALITY IS THAT MOST

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.100
HIGH SCHOOL KIDS DO DRINK.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.460
A THIRD OF THEM SAY THEY DRINK

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.060
HEAVILY.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.130
SO WHAT SHOULD A PARENT DO?

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.900
AND WHAT WOULD BE

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.900
THE RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO IF,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:46.960
SAY, YOU WERE FACED

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.000
WITH THE SITUATION THAT

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.360
CONFRONTED A PARENT HERE

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.930
IN YARMOUTH, MAINE?

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.700
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE HIGH SCHOOL

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.500
PROM, THE DAUGHTERS OF YARMOUTH

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.960
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER EDGAR BEEM

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.300
TOLD HIM THERE WOULD BE

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.530
A POST-PROM PARTY.

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.100
THEY SAID, "EVERYONE'S

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.500
PLANNING TO CAMP OUT IN THIS

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.060
FIELD ACROSS FROM THE DUMP."

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.100
AND I SAID, "DO THE OWNERS KNOW?

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.900
ARE THEY GOING TO BE THERE?

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.200
DO THEY APPROVE?"

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:07.960
AND THEY SAID OF COURSE

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.400
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.960
SO I CALLED THE OWNERS, AND NO,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.860
THEY WERE GOING TO BE OUT

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.760
OF TOWN ALL WEEKEND.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.560

THERE'D BE ALCOHOL AT THIS

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.460
PARTY, AND WORRIED NOT JUST

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.760

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.760
BUT ABOUT ALL THE KIDS, BEEM DID

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.330
WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.230
THE RESPONSIBLE THING.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.260
I THOUGHT, "THE ONLY WAY THAT

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.400
I CAN ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN IS

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.330
IF I'M THERE TO TRY TO KEEP THEM

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:28.400
SAFE."

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.360
Reporter: BEEM CALLED

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.330
A FRIEND, ATTORNEY

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.830
NEIL SHANKMAN, TO HELP OUT.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:32.700
I SAID, "I'M WITH YOU, LET'S

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.700
DO IT."

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.330
Reporter: TOGETHER

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:38.030
THEY DECIDED TO ACT

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.700
AS CHAPERONES --

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.730
REALLY MORE LIKE GATEKEEPERS.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:43.430
THEY STAYED UP ALL NIGHT,

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:44.160
GUARDING THE DRIVEWAY.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.030
THEY WERE LAYING OUT RULES,

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.760
SO THAT WE WOULD KNOW WHAT

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.460
THEY EXPECTED OF US.

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.360
Reporter: THESE TEENS WERE

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.260
AT THE PARTY.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.400
WHAT WERE THE RULES?

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.400
NO DRINKING, NO SMOKING,

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.100
NO DRUGS.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.500
Reporter: BUT THAT'S SILLY,

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.930
'CAUSE THERE WAS DRINKING,

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:55.930
AND THAT'S WHY THEY WERE THERE.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:56.800
THEY KNEW THERE WAS GONNA BE

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.130
DRINKING.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.230
OBVIOUSLY, NOT EVERYBODY

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.100
FOLLOWED THOSE RULES TO A "T,"

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.800

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.630

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.530
AT THE PARTY?

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.760
I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.560
RELEVANT TO WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.460

Reporter: BEEM AND SHANKMAN

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.800
ASSUMED SOME KIDS WOULD DRINK

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.700
TOO MUCH, SO THEY POLICED

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:14.260
THE DRIVING.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.530
AND EACH CAR, AS THEY WOULD

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.560
COME OUT, WE WOULD STOP, STICK

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.300
OUR HEAD IN AND SAY, "HI, HOW'S

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.130
IT GOING?"

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:20.130
Reporter: SO YOU WERE, WHAT,

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.200
SMELLING THE AIR?

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.360
WELL, BASICALLY.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.530
Reporter: IN MANY CASES,

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:24.500
THEY GOT ANOTHER TEEN TO BE

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.000
A DESIGNATED DRIVER,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.630
OR THEY PERSUADED THE KIDS

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.460
TO STAY THERE AND SLEEP IT OFF.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.700
NO ONE WAS HURT, AND THERE WERE

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.360
NO DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENTS.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.360
BUT SINCE BEEM'S A MEMBER

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.530
OF THE SCHOOL BOARD,

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:36.960

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.760
COMMITTEE -- BOTH OF WHICH HAVE

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.460
A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY TOWARD

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.930
UNDERAGE DRINKING -- SOME

IN TOWN FELT WHAT THE ADULTS DID

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.200
WAS ABSOLUTELY WRONG.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.660
THE ONLY HONORABLE THING

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.600
FOR BOTH MEN TO DO WOULD BE

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.360
TO APOLOGIZE TO THE TOWN

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.660
AND RESIGN THEIR POSITIONS.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.060
BEEM AND SHANKMAN DID.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.160
WHAT THEY REALLY DID WAS

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.630
ALLOW CHILDREN TO BREAK THE LAW.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.360
DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM,

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.360
SIMPLY ENCOURAGES IT.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:07.430
Reporter: THEY SAY BEEM

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.200

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200

DRINKING.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.060
WE DIDN'T CONDONE ANYTHING.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:14.330
I THINK FROM THE BEGINNING

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.730
WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE WERE

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:16.730
NOT THERE TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT'S

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.760
RIGHT OR WRONG.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.860
WE WEREN'T THERE TO --

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.760
Reporter: THAT CONDONES IT.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.960
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.230
IT RECOGNIZES REALITY.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.860
Reporter: AND THE REALITY IS,

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.630
KIDS DRINK, WHETHER WE LIKE IT

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.130
OR NOT.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.030
WHAT IF THEY'D BROKEN UP

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:31.530
THE PARTY?

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.760
I MEAN, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN --

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.500
I MEAN, CARS, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.660
CHAOS.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.560
I MEAN, CARS WOULD BE PULLING

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.360
OUT LEFT AND RIGHT, PEOPLE ARE

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.230
TRYING TO GO PLACES.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.060
INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE LARGE

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:39.800
PARTY, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN TONS

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.660
OF PARTIES, WITH KIDS DRIVING

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.360
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.160
TO ANOTHER.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.960
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.960
I WAS A POLICEMAN BACK IN LOS

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.800
ANGELES, AND WHEN WE BROKE UP

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.700
A PARTY, WE CONFISCATED ALL

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.460
THE ALCOHOL AND WE CALLED

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.660
PARENTS.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.200
Reporter: SOME PARENTS SAY

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.360
YOU SHOULD'VE CALLED THE COPS,

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.100
OR YOU SHOULD'VE STOPPED

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.560
THE KIDS.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.330
YOU KNOW, ANYTIME ANYTHING

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.230
GOES WRONG IN THIS COUNTRY THAT

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.500
INVOLVES YOUNG PEOPLE, SOMEBODY

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.830
SAYS, "WHERE WERE THE PARENTS?"

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.730
WELL, I KNOW WHERE I WAS.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:04.860
I WAS OUT THERE TAKING CARE

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:05.760
OF MY KIDS AND TAKING CARE

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.160
OF THEIR KIDS.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.400
YOU KNOW, WHERE WERE THEY?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.000
I THINK WHAT MY FATHER

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.960
AND EDGAR DID WAS MUCH MORE

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.860
RESPONSIBLE THAN SAYING, "WELL,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:14.600
THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN, BUT I WANT

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.830
NOTHING TO DO WITH IT."

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.600
Reporter: AND SOME PEOPLE

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.030
SAID THAT?

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.760
SOME PEOPLE ARE STILL SAYING

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.660
THAT.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.930
SOME PEOPLE STILL DON'T KNOW

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:21.760
THEIR KIDS WERE THERE.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.830
Reporter: AT THE SCHOOL

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.600
BOARD, A FEW PEOPLE DID ASK BEEM

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.660
TO RESIGN.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.660
BUT MOSTLY, THE MEN WERE GREETED

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.260
WITH PRAISE.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.100
MR. BEEM IS EXACTLY THE KIND

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:32.230
OF BOARD MEMBER I WANT.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.860
Reporter: BOTH GOT LETTERS

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.030
FROM TEENS AND THEIR PARENTS,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.360
THANKING THEM FOR WHAT THEY DID.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.430
STILL, AFTER THE CRITICISM,

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.830
WOULD THEY DO IT AGAIN?

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.260
YES.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.000
Reporter: BEEM IS LESS

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.330
CERTAIN.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:45.460
IT WAS NOT FUN.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.900
I DIDN'T ENJOY A MINUTE OF IT.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.800
I'M TOO OLD TO STAY UP ALL NIGHT

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.630
LONG.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.460
Reporter: AND HE SAYS

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.560
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE THOUGHT

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.530
OF AS A SPOKESMAN FOR UNDERAGE

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.660
DRINKING.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:54.930
WHAT ABOUT PROTECTING THE KIDS?

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.300
KIDS MIGHT DRIVE DRUNK.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.860
ABSOLUTELY.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:58.600
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.260
IS.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.060
I MEAN, I'M ALREADY THINKING

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.030
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, "WHAT DO I DO

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.130
NEXT YEAR?"

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:03.760
YOU KNOW?

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.360
GIVE ME SOME IDEAS.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.260
I DON'T KNOW.

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:09.960
IT'S A PUZZLE.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.230
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE THERE AT ALL,

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.100
YOU DO SEEM TO BE GIVING CONSENT

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:14.930
TO WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.530
AND I THINK IN THE END, I'D BE

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.730
THERE AND TRY TO PROTECT LIVES

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.200
AND TRY 0 TALK THEM OUT OF THE

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.900
DRINKING IF YOU COULD.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.160
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO PROTECT THE

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.260
LIVES FIRST, DON'T YOU?

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.760
MAYBE.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.730
BUT THAT SENDS THE MESSAGE THAT

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.860
IT'S OKAY WHICH MAY ENDANGER

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:28.500
LIVES LATER.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.160
I DON'T KNOW.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.100
AFTER RESEARCHING THESE STORIES,

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.760
I USUALLY HAVE A CLEAR OPINION

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.730
ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT TO DO.

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.100
IN THIS CASE, I HAVE NO CLUE.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.130
AND THIS CASE IS UNUSUAL IN THAT

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.730
THE KIDS TOLD THEIR PARENTS WHAT

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.000
THEY WERE UP TO.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.400
BUT HOW COMMON IS THAT?

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.900
HOW MUCH IS GOING ON THAT WE

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.400
DON'T HAVE A CLUE ABOUT?

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.530
WELL, WE WONDERED SO MUCH

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.000
ABOUT IT, THAT WHEN WE COME BACK

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.800
OUR CAMERAS ARE GOING TO SHOW

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:57.330
YOU WHAT YOUR CHILDREN AREN'T

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:57.900
ALL RIGHT.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.430
SO DO YOU KNOW -- DO YOU REALLY

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:00.630
KNOW WHAT YOUR KIDS DO WHEN

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:01.500
YOU'RE NOT AROUND?

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.330
DID YOU EVER WISH YOU WERE

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.100
INVISIBLE TO YOU WOULD WATCH AND

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.130
FIND OUT?

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:07.930
WELL, WE FOUND SOME TEENAGERS

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:08.730
WHO LET US IN ON THEIR SECRETS

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:09.730
AND OTHERS WHO RECORDED

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:11.630
THEIR OWN MISDEEDS.

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.360
AND FINALLY, WE SPIED ON SOME

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.100
OF THEM.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.730
AND AS JOHN REPORTS, WHAT WE SAW

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:19.730
WAS NOT ALWAYS A PRETTY PICTURE.

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.660
PARENTS OF THESE KIDS WERE SUED

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.900
TO COVER THE DAMAGES.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.300
BUT SHOULD THEY BE SUED

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.300
OVER SOMETHING THEY WEREN'T EVEN

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.900
THERE TO STOP?

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.430
WHEN KIDS ARE THIS AGE, HOW MUCH

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:13.600
DO PARENTS REALLY KNOW

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.060
ABOUT WHAT THEIR KIDS ARE DOING?

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.500
WE HEARD THAT IN THIS

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.500
CONNECTICUT TOWN, TEENS HANG OUT

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.230
AT THIS GAS STATION.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.830
IT'S HARD TO SAY WHY HERE,

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.930
BUT THIS IS WHERE THEY HANG OUT.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.260
SO WE SET UP A HIDDEN CAMERA

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.100
TO SEE HOW THEY BEHAVE WHEN

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.230
THEY THINK THERE'S NO ADULT

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.300
PRESENT.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.460
AND THIS IS SOME OF WHAT

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.430
THEY DO --

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.060
DANCE ON CARS.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.630
GET IN AND OUT OF CARS TO DO --

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.760
WELL, WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.060
INGEST SOMETHING FROM THE TRUNK

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.500
OF THIS CAR AND THEN SPIT IT

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.200
OUT.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.330
THEY MAKE OUT, GET ROWDY,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.560
AND SOME OF THEM DRINK.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.300
WE CAN HAVE THE ENTIRE SCHOOL

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.400
HERE, BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.760
TO HAVE PEOPLE OVER

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.400
TO THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE --

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.000
IT'S SO TRUE.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.260
BECAUSE THE HOUSE GETS

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:56.960
TRASHED, AND THEN YOU'VE GOT

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.600
TO DEAL WITH THE PARENTS.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.300
Reporter: AND SO THEY COME

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:58.930
HERE TO TALK AND SMOKE AND --

00:21:58.930 --> 00:21:59.630
WHAT ELSE?

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.400
NOTHING THAT I CAN TALK

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.800

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.500
Reporter: MOST KIDS TOLD US

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.260
THEIR PARENTS KNEW WHERE

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:05.060
THEY WERE, IF NOT EXACTLY WHAT

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.500
THEY WERE DOING.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.830
I THINK THEY'D BE HORRIFIED.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:13.060
I DON'T THINK THEY REALIZE HOW

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.830
MUCH -- HOW MANY TIMES I'VE GOT

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.600
DRUNK AND THROWN UP AND ALL THAT

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:16.900

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.030
HAVE BEEN DRINKING BEHIND

THEIR PARENTS' BACKS FOREVER.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.160
WHAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY IS THAT

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.600
IF ONE OF THESE TEENS DRIVES OFF

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.430
DRUNK AND GETS INTO AN ACCIDENT,

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.200
THEIR PARENTS COULD FACE A LEGAL

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.500
NIGHTMARE.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.800
LATER THAT NIGHT,

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.200
IN NEW YORK CITY, THESE TEENS

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.360
ARE DRINKING TO GET THEMSELVES

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.230
IN THE MOOD TO GO DANCING.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:35.430

SO WHEN WILL SHE GO HOME?

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.760
I HAVE NO IDEA.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.360

THIS AGE, IT'S HARDER

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.960
FOR PARENTS TO MAKE THEM DO

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.260
THINGS.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.030
AND TODAY, THE THINGS MANY

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.860
OF THEM DO ARE MORE DANGEROUS

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.100
AND HOW OLD ARE YOU? AGE THAN

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.130
15.

THE NATION'S CAPITAL WERE

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:09.330
SHOCKED WHEN THEY PICKED UP

THAT SUBURBAN MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.460
WERE HAVING ORAL SEX.

THE PARENTS KNOW WHAT'S GOING

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.230
ON.

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:21.430
THEY DON'T ASK.

THEY DON'T ASK ANYTHING.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:23.200
DON'T ASK.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.200
I DIDN'T KNOW TO ASK.

Reporter: WHEN WE BROUGHT

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.830
THE PARENTS IN, THEY WERE

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.700
SURPRISED TO HEAR WHAT WAS

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:28.430
COMMON KNOWLEDGE TO

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.430

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.430
RIGHT NOW, I'M KIND

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.830

WALKING AROUND WITH BLINDERS ON.

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.230
I TOLD ONE OF MY GIRLFRIENDS,

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:36.030
"I'M GOING TO SHOCK MY DAUGHTER

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.400
BY SHOWING HER THE ARTICLE."

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.130

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.830
EVERY DAY."

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:42.630

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:43.900

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.530

AS LONG AS WE TAPED THEM

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.760

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.830
ABOUT PARTIES?

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:42.260
ARE ADULTS ALWAYS POLICING THEM?

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:43.500
FRESHMAN PARTIES, CHAPERONES

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.300
THERE?

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.460
I WOULD HAVE SAID ALL

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.630
THE TIME.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:49.300
ALL THE TIME, ABSOLUTELY.

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:50.030
Reporter: SHE SAYS SOMETIMES.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:50.530
SOMETIMES?

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.260
Reporter: YOUR PARENTS THINK

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.030
IT'S ALL THE TIME.

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:52.830
IT WASN'T JUST DANA WHO WAS

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:54.630
FOOLING HER PARENTS.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.630
I MEAN, I TELL THEM THE GIST

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:57.700
OF WHAT WE'RE DOING, BUT I WON'T

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.300
GET DETAILED.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:05.030
SOMETIMES OUR ONLY WAY TO GET

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:06.600
OUTSIDE IS IF YOU LIE

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:07.300
TO YOUR PARENTS.

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.900
PEOPLE LAUGH ABOUT IT.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.200
THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.860
STUPID FOR FALLING FOR THESE

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.430
LITTLE THINGS THAT

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.000
THEY TELL 'EM.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:16.730
Reporter: SO YOU LIE.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:17.600
I MEAN, WHO DOESN'T?

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.460
WE'RE 14, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.300
Reporter: SURVEYS OF TEENS

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.160
SHOW MORE THAN 70% LIE

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.000
TO THEIR PARENTS.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.500
PROFESSOR STEINBERG SAYS

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.730
A LITTLE LYING ABOUT MINOR

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.260
THINGS IS NORMAL.

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.260
BUT TOO MANY OF US PARENTS ALLOW

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.000
OURSELVES TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.430
ABOUT TOO MUCH, LIKE DRINKING.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.500
YOU MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS, WHAT

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.060
PERCENTAGE DRINK?

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.760
I SAY, LIKE 65%.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:36.430
Reporter: DO THE PARENTS

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.100
KNOW?

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:37.800
NO.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.530
Reporter: ABOUT HALF

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.060
THE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.330
IN OUR QUESTIONNAIRE GROUP SAID

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.000
THERE WAS DRINKING AT PARTIES.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.630
AND MOST 12th GRADERS SAID

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.360
ALCOHOL WAS AVAILABLE ALMOST ALL

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.760
THE TIME.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:48.200
MOST OF THE PARENTS THOUGHT IT

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.900
WAS NEVER THERE.

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.400
YOUR PARENTS SAID NEVER.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.700
I MAY LEAD THEM TO THINK

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.100
THAT, BUT --

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.600
Reporter: MOST 12th GRADERS

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:58.300
ALSO SAID THERE WAS MARIJUANA

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.700
AT PARTIES.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.560
YOUR PARENTS KNOW?

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.000
NO.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.430
IT'S EASIER NOT TO TELL THEM.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:05.930
Reporter: THE 9th GRADERS

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.060
SAID ABOUT HALF THEIR GRADE

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:08.200
SMOKES POT.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.260
YOUR PARENTS DON'T KNOW

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.600
ABOUT THIS?

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.060
FAR AS I KNOW.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.130
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.860
Reporter: WHY DON'T YOU TELL

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.900
THEM?

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.230
WELL, THEY NEVER ASK.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.160
IF THEY ASKED, I GUESS

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.760
I WOULD TELL THEM.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.430
Reporter: "PARENTS DON'T

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:22.360
ASK."

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.060
WE HEARD THAT ALL OVER.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.800
STEINBERG SAYS SOMETIMES THEY'RE

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:26.530
JUST AFRAID TO ASK, OR DON'T

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.100
KNOW WHAT TO ASK.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.400
AND IN SOME CASES, THE PARENTS

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.830
HAVE JUST "CHECKED OUT."

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.400
I MEAN, SOME OF THEM ARE

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.960
CHECKED OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.030
WORKING SO MUCH THEY DON'T MAKE

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.100
TIME TO BE CHECKED IN.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.860
AND SOME OF THEM ARE DISENGAGED

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.660
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE KIND

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:40.760
OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR KIDS

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.230
THAT PROMPTS THEIR KIDS TO TALK

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.230
TO THEM.

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.200
AS A PARENT, IT'S

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.900
MY RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK UP

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:46.660
ON MY DAUGHTER.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.730
SHE IS 14 YEARS OLD.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.030
I HAVE BEEN 14.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.500
WE KNOW WHAT 14 IS ABOUT.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.830
Reporter: RHONDA DOES WHAT

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.200
STEINBERG SAYS PARENTS SHOULD

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.760
DO, EVEN THOUGH HER DAUGHTER,

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.130
ONICA, COMPLAINS HER MOTHER'S

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.030
QUESTIONS MAKE HER FEEL LIKE

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:57.700
A DORK.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.100
THAT'S OKAY.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.900
IF YOU ARE GOING TO A PARTY,

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.400
I NEED TO HAVE A NAME,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.630
AN ADDRESS, A TELEPHONE NUMBER.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:06.630
I'M GOING TO SPEAK

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:07.460
WITH THE PARENTS.

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:08.460
I'M GOINGS TO SPEAK WITH THE

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.830
CHAPERONES.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.700
I'M GOING TO DROP YOU OFF

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.430
AND SPEAK TO THEM FACE TO FACE.

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:12.260
Reporter: BUT EVEN THAT'S

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.030
NO GUARANTEE, 'CAUSE WHILE

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.000
THE KIDS PARTY --

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.730
MOST PARENTS ARE USUALLY

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.730
UPSTAIRS, AND DON'T WANNA COME

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:18.600
OUT, PRETTY MUCH, 'CAUSE

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.360
THEY DON'T WANNA SEE WHAT

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.700
THE KIDS ARE DOING.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.430
Reporter: AND WHAT MIGHT THAT

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:22.200
BE?

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.760
FREAK DANCING.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.460
FREAK.

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:25.260
LIKE LAP DANCING.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:25.960
IT'S LIKE DIRTY DANCING,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.200
SORT OF.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.560
IN A VERY, VERY DIRTY WAY.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.860
Reporter: THE NORTH ROCKLAND

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.000
KIDS SAY THERE'S LAP DANCING

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.260
AT THEIR PARTIES, TOO.

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:38.930
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW?

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:39.630
DO MY PARENTS KNOW?

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:40.300
NO, PROBABLY NOT.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.500
Reporter: WOULD YOU EVER

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.760
THINK OF TELLING THEM ABOUT IT?

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.700
IT'S NOT THE TOPIC

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.460
OF OUR CONVERSATION.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.130
Reporter: WELL, THEY ASK

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.700
YOU QUESTIONS.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.360
COLLEEN, WHAT GOES

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.500
ON AT THE PARTY?

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.200
AND I TELL THEM THAT WE HAD

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.560
FUND AND --

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.600
AND THAT WE WERE TALKING

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.030
AND DANCING.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:58.160
BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY SAY

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.560
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.760
Reporter: NOW, COLLEEN SAYS

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.160
SHE DOESN'T LAP DANCE.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.830
BUT WHAT THE KIDS ARE SAYING

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.200
IS --

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.300
IT'S LIKE THIS IS OUR ERA

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:07.960
AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.630
WITH IT.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.700
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, WELL,

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.460
THERE'S NOT A LOT WE CAN DO

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:11.460
ABOUT IT.

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.430
'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO BE

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.200
SOCIAL OUTCASTS.

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.430
Reporter: WE PARENTS MAY NOT

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.360
LIKE IT, BUT THE TEEN YEARS ARE

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.330
A TIME WHEN KIDS ARE SUPPOSED

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.300
TO BREAK AWAY, EXPERIMENT

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.200
WITH INDEPENDENCE.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.130
WHICH BRINGS US BACK

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.860
TO OUR CENTRAL QUESTION.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.630
LET'S SAY YOU SHOOT SOMEBODY --

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.660
SHOULD YOUR PARENTS BE HELD

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.560
RESPONSIBLE.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.130
NO.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:33.800
NO.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.460
Reporter: ALMOST ALL KIDS

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.900
WE TALKED TO FELT THEY ALONE

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.100
SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.700
THE CHILD KNOWS RIGHT

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:40.430
FROM WRONG.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.130
SO IF YOU KNOW IT'S WRONG

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:43.730
TO STEAL, AND YOU DO IT ANYWAY,

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:44.430
THEN YOU SHOULD BE PUNISHED

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.130
FOR THAT.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:46.160
NOT THE PARENT.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.360
BECAUSE THE PARENT CAN'T WATCH

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.560
THE CHILD 24-7.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.860
SO HOW CAN YOU FIND OUT WHAT

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.600
YOUR KIDS ARE DOING?

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.230
THE MORE YOU PRY, THE LESS

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:56.260
THEY TELL.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.960
HOW DO YOU WALK THE TIGHTROPE

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.230
BETWEEN DISCIPLINING THEM

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:01.100
AND PUSHING THEM AWAY?

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:11.930
WHEN WE COME BACK --

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.860
THESE DAYS, WHEN KIDS

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.160
MISBEHAVE, MORE AND MORE PARENTS

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.460
END UP IN COURT.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.400
IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, 25 STATES

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.200
PASSED NEW LAWS TO HOLD

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.000
PARENTS ACCOUNTABLE

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.400
FOR THEIR KIDS' CRIMES.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.460
BUT WILL PUNISHING PARENTS

REALLY HELP?

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.460
WHAT PARENT IS GOING TO KNOW

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.160
EVERYTHING THEIR KIDS DO?

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.030
IF OUR PARENTS KNEW

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.860
EVERYTHING THAT WE DID

00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.930
AND EVERYTHING ABOUT US, THEN

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.230
THEY WOULD BE US, KIND OF.

THEY DISOBEY AND LIE TO US.

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.730
SO WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF THESE

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.430
NEW PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.230
THAT HOLD US PARENTS LEGALLY

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.030
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THEY DO?

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:45.830
THEY'RE BOUND TO RESULT

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:46.860

STANTON SAMENOW SAYS THE LAWS

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.660
ARE UNFAIR.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.900
IN NEARLY EVERY CASE WHERE

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.730
I HAVE INTERVIEWED A JUVENILE

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.960
OFFENDER, THAT OFFENDER HAS

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.730
A BROTHER OR A SISTER, USUALLY

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.730

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.700
FROM THOSE VERY SAME PARENTS,

THE VERY SAME HOME, AND THEY'RE

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.830
LAW-ABIDING AND RESPONSIBLE.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:09.230
WHEN YOU DROPPED OUT

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:10.000
IN THE 10th GRADE, WHAT DID

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:10.930
YOU THINK YOU WERE GOING TO DO

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.030
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

FLIP BURGERS OR WORK SANITATION

ALL YOUR LIFE?

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.230
YEAH, I HAD --

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.000
I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:16.700

GET INTO TROUBLE, IT'S

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.000
YOUR LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.200

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.060
ON TRACK.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:31.400
IT'S TOO BAD WE HAVE TO PUT

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.030
IT IN LAW.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.930

DO MORE.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.600
NOW PARENTS ARE REQUIRED

TO APPEAR AT JUVENILE COURT

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:42.730

THIS TIME HE'S VANDALIZED A CAR.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.830
HIS PARENTS HADN'T EVEN HEARD

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.830

00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:09.700
WELL, I'VE MADE PIPE BOMBS

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.500
IN THE GARAGE BEFORE

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.360
AND MY PARENTS DON'T KNOW

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.760
ABOUT IT.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.500
I MEAN, I DON'T TAKE 'EM

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:25.730
DAVID SAID, "OKAY, I'M OUTTA

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:27.430
HERE."

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.600

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.130
I WOULD LIKE FOR DAVID TO BE

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:33.930

THAT DAVID WILL LEAVE.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:43.400

NUMBERS OF ALL THEIR KIDS'

PLEDGE PROMISING THEY WON'T

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:13.400
PERMIT KIDS TO DRINK

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.130
AT THEIR HOMES OR HAVE

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:16.200
UNCHAPERONED PARTIES.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:16.930
SOME PARENTS BELIEVE YOU SHOULD

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.000
GO FURTHER --

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.860
YOU SHOULD SPY ON YOUR KIDS.

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.530
I TOLD MY SON MICHAEL, "I

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.300
LOVE YOU.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.100

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.600

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.430
WELL, YOU MIGHT FIND OUT MORE

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.930
THINGS, BUT YOU PROBABLY WON'T

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.200
FIND OUT MORE ULTIMATELY.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.060
I THINK THE WAY TO FIND OUT

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.230
THE MOST ABOUT YOUR KID IS

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:43.430
TO HAVE AN HONEST AND OPEN

00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:44.160

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.300
WHERE YOUR CHILD DOESN'T FEEL

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.400
COMPELLED TO HIDE THINGS

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:49.300
FROM YOU.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.030
SAY I WAS GOING TO GO OUT

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:50.800

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.530
TO DRINK THAT NIGHT.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.330
MAYBE I COULD TELL THEM,

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.130
AND THEN THEY WOULD BE LIKE,

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:53.860
"ALL RIGHT," INSTEAD OF YELLING

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.530
AT ME.

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.330
WELL, WHEN I FIND OUT

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:56.260

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.230
PUNISHED IN SOME WAY OR ANOTHER.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.960
BUT THEN HE'LL JUST LIE MORE.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.960
AND IF HE'S CAUGHT, HE GETS

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.200
GROUNDED AND HE'S PUNISHED MORE.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:01.300
Reporter: THAT'S NOT THE WAY

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.000
TO GO, SAYS STEINBERG.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.700
BUT IF YOU DON'T GROUND HIM,

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.060
HE GETS AWAY WITH IT.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.760
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.560
WITH IT.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.600
HE'S DOING SOMETHING THAT,

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.400
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.760
FROM STUDIES OF TEENAGERS, THAT

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.560
90% OF ALL TEENAGERS IN THIS

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:18.000
COUNTRY DO.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.160
I MEAN, 90% OF THEM EXPERIMENT

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:20.860
WITH ALCOHOL AT SOME POINT

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.500
IN TIME BEFORE GRADUATING

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:27.830
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:28.900
Reporter: SO OU'RE SAYING

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.860
IT'S OKAY TO DRINK?

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.530
YOU BECOME LENIENT?

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.130
NO, YOU DON'T BECOME

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.700
LENIENT --

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.430
Reporter: STEINBERG SAYS,

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.100
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WHAT

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.900
MOTIVATES MOST TEENS IS HAVING

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.600
THEIR PARENTS APPROVE OF THEM.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:38.230
SOMETIMES SAYING

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.000
TO YOUR CHILD, "YOU KNOW, I'M

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.930
NOT GOING TO PUNISH YOU FOR WHAT

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:40.700
YOU DID, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.100
YOU REALLY LET ME DOWN.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.330
YOU REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME."

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.600
-- THAT THAT CAN BE MUCH MORE

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:45.530
EFFECTIVE THAN GROUNDING, THAN

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.100
TAKING AWAY THE CHILD'S

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.960
TELEPHONE PRIVILEGES.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.260
'CAUSE THEY WANT

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:50.900
YOUR APPROVAL.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.130
YES.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.860
THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:53.800
THEY WANT YOUR APPROVAL,

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.060
BUT THEY WANT YOUR APPROVAL.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.400
Reporter: AND EVEN

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.330
IF THEY DON'T SHOW IT, THEY WANT

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.160
US AROUND.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:35:59.900
AS WE TALKED TO KIDS AROUND

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.600
THE COUNTRY, WE KEPT HEARING

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.500
WHAT SOUNDS LIKE A LONGING

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.500
FOR PARENTS TO GET MORE

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.000
INVOLVED.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.830
THIS CALIFORNIA TEEN ACTED TOUGH

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.300
ON THE SURFACE.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.630
YOU KNOW, I DRINK WHENEVER

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.360
I WANT TO BECAUSE, LIKE, WHAT DO

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.230
THEY KNOW?

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.230
THEY DON'T CHECK UP ON ME.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:13.200
Reporter: BUT HE SAYS HE'D

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.800
LOVE TO HAVE MORE HONEST

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.330
COMMUNICATION WITH HIS PARENTS.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:17.400
IT MIGHT JUST HELP THE FAMILY

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.860
IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.700
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THIS IS ONE

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.060
WAY THEY CAN HEAR ABOUT IT.

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:21.760
I CAN'T TALK TO 'EM.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.000
MAYBE THE TV CAN.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.030
'CAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT I'VE BEEN

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.460
PARENTED BY.

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:29.960
SO THERE IT IS, JOHN.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.160
APPARENTLY, TEENAGERS SAYING

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.030
THEY WANT MORE ATTENTION FROM

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:33.730
THEIR PARENTS.

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.760
WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.160
BECAUSE ALL WE HEAR IS ABOUT

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:38.000
KIDS SAYING, I WANT FREEDOM FROM

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.730
MY PARENTS.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.660
BUT WE HEARD THAT OFTEN.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.730
IT SURPRISED US, TOO.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.030
AND THERE WAS ALSO A SURVEY THAT

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:45.530
ASKED KIDS TO DESIGN A PUBLIC

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.530
SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:47.730
AND THE MOST POPULAR

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.200
ANNOUNCEMENT WAS, REMIND PARENTS

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:51.230
TO TAKE TIME TO TALK TO THEIR

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.660
TEENS.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.530
EVEN THOUGH WHEN YOU QUESTION

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.230
THEM, THE MORE THEY -- I

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.900
QUESTIONS FEEL COMPELLED TO --

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.000
EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY LIE OR

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.530
LECTURE, THEY WANT YOU TO SHOW

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.360
THAT YOU LOVE THEM BY PAYING

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:05.730
ATTENTION.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:07.560
AND THE BEST ADVICE I EVER HEARD

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.100
WAS THE EXPERT WHO SAID, CATCH

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.730
YOUR KID DOING SOMETHING RIGHT

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.230
INSTEAD OF COMPLAINING ALL THE

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.860
TIME THAT LETS YOU FIND NICE

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.860
THINGS TO TALK ABOUT.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.000
MAINLY, WEE IN THERE

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.530
APPARENTLY.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:19.400
SO WE'RE GONNA THROW IT RIGHT

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:20.930
BACK TO YOU.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:22.330
SHOULD PARENTS BE PUNISHED FOR

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.860
WHAT THEIR KIDS DO?

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.600
