WEBVTT

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
IF I CAN'T PASS ANYTHING?
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Announcer: WE ALL WANT
 OUR CHILDREN TO DO WELL.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY
 JUST CAN'T SEEM TO LEARN?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Man: IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
 FOR YOU TO WATCH YOUR CHILD

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
NOT WANT TO DO SOMETHING

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
THAT YOU HAVE TO
MAKE THEM DO EVERY DAY.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
AND THAT'S WHAT SCHOOL
WAS BECOMING, IT WAS A BATTLE.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Announcer: TODAY,
 A LAST-CHANCE SCHOOL

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
FOR KIDS WITH
 LEARNING PROBLEMS.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
IS THIS PROPER?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
AND NEW FINDINGS ABOUT HOW
 YOU CAN HELP YOUR OWN CHILD.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
LAST YEAR'S TEACHER
WAS TO GET ON HER BACK,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
THIS YEAR'S TEACHER
SAID "LEAVE HER ALONE."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
OBVIOUSLY YOU ARE
UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Announcer:
 BRAZELTON ON PARENTING.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
THERE'S NOTHING THAT
SO CONCERNS PARENTS

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
AS MUCH AS HOW THEIR CHILD'S
BRAIN IS DEVELOPING.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
WE ALL WANT OUR KIDS
TO BE SMART,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
AND TO DO WELL IN SCHOOL.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
AND WE ALL WANT
TO BE THERE FOR THEM

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
IF WE FIND OUT
THEY NEED HELP.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Brazelton: HELP IS WHAT
 THIS STORY IS ALL ABOUT.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
HELP, AND HOPE.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
IT'S ABOUT A GROUP OF KIDS

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
WHO'VE COME HERE FROM SCHOOLS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
KIDS FROM SUBURBS,
 AND THE INNER CITY,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
ALL DIFFERENT, BUT WITH
 THE SAME UNHAPPY TALE.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Boy: IN MY SCHOOL,
 IF I FINISH MY HOMEWORK

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO SPELL--

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
SPELL SOMETHING,
THEY WILL YELL AT ME.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
- Brazelton: REALLY?
- YEAH, BIG TIME.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Brazelton:
 THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF
 HEARTACHE IN THEIR YOUNG LIVES.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Boy:
 I JUST THOUGHT
 I WAS A DUMB KID

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
KNEW HOW READ, WRITE,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
AND I WASN'T IN THEIR GRADE
SO I THOUGHT I'D NEVER PASS.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
WHO REMEMBERS WHAT
PARAPHRASING IS?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Brazelton: BUT THESE KIDS
 AREN'T DUMB,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
NOT AT ALL.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
...THE QUESTION,
AND YOU MAKE IT...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Veronica Kenney:
 KIDS COME TO LANDMARK

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
BECAUSE THEY HAVE LANGUAGE-BASED
LEARNING DISABILITIES.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE
DIFFICULTY WITH READING,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
WITH EXPRESSING THEMSELVES
ORALLY AND IN WRITING.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
ALL ASPECTS OF THE LANGUAGE AREA
ARE COMPROMISED.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
HOWEVER, THEY ARE BRIGHT.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Brazelton:
 LEARNING DISABILITIES
 AREN'T JUST THE CHILD'S ISSUE.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Lori Pugsley:
 WE KNEW IN FIRST GRADE
 REBECCA WAS DYSLEXIC.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
THE DYSLEXIA DOESN'T END
WHEN SCHOOL ENDS,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
IT DOESN'T END
AT THREE O'CLOCK,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
IT DOESN'T END
DURING THE SUMMER.
IT'S EVERY DAY,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
AROUND THE CLOCK THAT THEY
LIVE AND BREATHE IT.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
AND THEREFORE THE FAMILY
 LIVES AND BREATHES IT.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Brazelton:
 THE CONSTANT STRESS
 CAN CHANGE A CHILD.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Lori:
 WHAT WE SAW WITH REBECCA
 WAS THAT, UM...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
SHE STOPPED TAKING RISKS,
SHE STOPPED BEING OUTSPOKEN,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
SHE KIND OF
BECAME MORE QUIET.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
SO, UH, REBECCA, WHAT DID YOU
COME UP WITH FIRST?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Lori: WE COULD SEE THIS
 DOWNWARD SPIRAL HAPPENING,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
AND IF WE DIDN'T STOP
 THIS DOWNWARD MOTION,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
WE WOULD NEVER
GET HER TO THE POINT

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
WHERE SHE COULD BE
FUNCTIONING AND INDEPENDENT

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
AND YOU KNOW,
SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
( chattering )

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Bob Broudo:
 TYPICALLY, THE FAMILIES

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
WHO ARE BRINGING
 THEIR CHILDREN TO LANDMARK,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
ARE FAMILIES WHO COLLECTIVELY
HAVE EXPERIENCED FAILURE.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
THEY'VE SEEN THEIR CHILDREN
BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN SCHOOL,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING FRIENDS
SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THAT,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
AND THEY'VE SEEN THE WONDERFUL
SPIRIT IN THEIR CHILD

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
BEGIN TO FADE AWAY

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
AS THEY LOSE CONFIDENCE
IN THEMSELVES TO LEARN.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Brazelton:
 IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
HOW HOPELESS
 THESE KIDS HAVE FELT.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
JUST LISTEN.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I WAS ALWAYS FRUSTRATED
AND I ALWAYS BEHIND,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
AND I WAS ALWAYS LIKE
CATCHING UP,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
AND WHEN IT WAS TIME
TO TAKE TESTS,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I WAS ALWAYS A WRECK AND I
COULDN'T GET UP  THE GRADES

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
THAT MY CLASSMATES WERE UP TO,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
AND THAT MADE ME
 FEEL, LIKE, TERRIBLE.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Chris:
 I DIDN'T HAVE A GREAT
 EXPERIENCE IN MY OLD SCHOOL.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
IT MADE ME FEEL BAD
 THAT ALL THE OTHER KIDS

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
WEREN'T HAVING AS MUCH TROUBLE
WITH THIS AS I WAS,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
AND I THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WITH ME.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Tom:
 I WENT TO A SCHOOL
 WHERE IT WAS LIKE REALLY TOUGH.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I STARTED OFF BEHIND
 AND I ENDED UP BEHIND.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
EVERY YEAR I THOUGHT
 I WAS GETTING A LITTLE BIT

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
BETTER AND BETTER BUT I WAS
 ACTUALLY GETTING WORSE.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I THOUGHT I WAS STUPID AND...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL
CONFIDENT WITH MYSELF.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Brazelton:
 ALTHOUGH MANY KIDS

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
HAVE THESE KINDS
 OF LEARNING PROBLEMS,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
FEW SCHOOL SYSTEMS
 ARE REALLY ABLE TO HELP.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Broudo:
 BECAUSE THE STUDENTS
 WHO COME TO US ARE WOUNDED

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE
 IN THE LEARNING PROCESS,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
ONE OF OUR MAJOR TASKS
 IS TO BUILD SUCCESS.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
WE DON'T CARE
WHERE SUCCESS BEGINS,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
SO WE INVOLVE THE STUDENTS
IN A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
ACADEMICS, SOCIAL,
 EXTRA-CURRICULAR, ATHLETIC,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE
 TEACHING EVERYTHING
 ARE THE TEACHERS.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
THEY GET TO KNOW
 THE STUDENTS WELL.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
AND THEY FIND OUT
 WHAT MOTIVATES THE KIDS,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
AND THEN THEY DEAL
 WITH SUCCESS.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
THE FIRST SUCCESS
 MAY NOT BE IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
IT COULD BE BECAUSE THEY
 JOINED ONE OF THE ACTIVITIES,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
AND THEY FEEL GOOD
 FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
IN SOME OF THE SCHOOLS
YOU CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
BECAUSE YOUR GRADES ARE SO LOW

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
YOU CAN'T PARTICIPATE
IN EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
SO THEY COME HERE AND WE FIND
 SOME WAY TO BUILD THEM UP.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
THIS STRATEGY WORKS.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
AS SOON AS THEY BEGIN
 TO TRUST AN ADULT

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
WHO IS COACHING OR IS WORKING
 WITH THEM IN ANY OTHER WAY,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
THEY ALSO RELAX A LITTLE BIT
 MORE IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
CAN YOU FIND "SHUTS"?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Brazelton:
 THAT'S WHEN THE REAL
 LEARNING CAN BEGIN.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
THOUGH CONFIDENT
 IN OTHER AREAS,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
MOST KIDS WITH THESE DEFICITS
 CAN'T BREAK DOWN WORDS

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
INTO THEIR SOUNDS
 OR PHONEMES.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
ALL RIGHT.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
IT'S THE WAY
 THEIR BRAINS ARE WIRED.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
THIS MAKES LEARNING
 TO READ AND WRITE

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
"INBAUTIOUS,"
"INCAUTIOUS."

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
THE TEACHERS AT LANDMARK

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
DON'T LOCK THEMSELVES
 INTO ONE APPROACH.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
EVEN KIDS
 WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
RESPOND TO
 DIFFERENT STRATEGIES.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
...AND CHANGE IT
TO A TONGUE SCRAPER.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
YES.  WHICH TONGUE SCRAPER
DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
BEFORE,
I COULDN'T READ AT ALL.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
WITH MY TUTORIAL TEACHER,
MISS HERBERT,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
SHE KNOWS ALL THE RIGHT STEPS

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
TO MAKE SOMEBODY
 A BETTER READER.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
OHH, "SHUTS."

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Brazelton:
 THE RESULTS CAN BE
 NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
ALL RIGHT, JOHN,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
YOU WANNA READ
 THE REST OF THE TOP PART?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
- Brazelton:
  JOHN IS AN EXAMPLE.
- "A THESIS STATEMENT..."

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Woman:
 THEY ASKED ME, "WHY DO
 YOU WANT JOHN TO COME HERE?"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I TOLD THEM, "I WANT JOHN
TO HAVE THE LOOK IN HIS EYE

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
THAT THESE CHILDREN HAVE."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Gene Hilliard:
 IT WAS ABOUT 17 MONTHS AGO

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
WE CAME TO
 A MUTUAL AGREEMENT

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
WITH THE SPECIAL ED
TEACHER THERE

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
THAT REALLY,
IT WAS HOPELESS.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
THE THESIS STATEMENT WOULD BE
"APPLES COME IN MANY VARIETIES."

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Pat Hilliard: I SAID,
 "JOHN, IT'S OVER, HONEY.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
IT'S OVER.  WE'RE GONNA
 FIND YOU A PLACE."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
HE SAID, "HELP ME."
SO HE DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
AND WE WENT ON A SEARCH.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
AND NOW HERE WE ARE,
15, 16 MONTHS LATER.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
HE'S HAD FABULOUS
ACADEMIC SUCCESS,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
AND HE'S PRESIDENT
OF THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
John: I GOT THE ATTENTION
 I NEEDED, THE AMOUNT
 OF HELP I NEEDED.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I HAND THE STUFF IN
 AND FEEL SUCCESS,
 FEELING GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
"HIGH SCHOOL IS A VERY FUN TIME
 IN A PERSON'S LIFE."

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
NOW I'M HAVING A BLAST
EVERY DAY.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Brazelton: THERE ARE
 SO MANY STORIES LIKE JOHN'S.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Ian:
 THINGS WEREN'T WORKING
 OUT, SO I CAME OUT HERE.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000
GOT INVOLVED WITH SPORTS,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
LACROSSE.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
AND EVERYTHING SEEMS
TO BE GOING GREAT.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
THE TEACHERS HERE ARE AMAZING,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
THEY TRY THEIR HARDEST
 TO HELP US.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
THEY'LL HELP US DURING
 THEIR BREAKS, THEIR LUNCHES,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
AFTER SCHOOL.
 THEY COULD BE GOING HOME,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
INSTEAD THEY STAY HERE
 AND HELP US,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
AND THAT'S JUST AMAZING.
 I LOVE IT.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
IT'S A VERY MOTIVATING
POPULATION TO WORK WITH,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO BRIGHT.
ONCE THEY BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
HOW TO CRACK
 THE CODE OF LANGUAGE,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
THEY GET EXCITED AND THE
 TEACHERS GET EXCITED WITH THEM.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
THEY KNOW THEY'RE CHANGING
 THE LIVES OF THESE KIDS.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
( kids singing )

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Noelle:
 I'VE ALWAYS SANG
 SINCE I WAS YOUNGER.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I'VE LOVED IT.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
AS MUCH AS I TRIED,
 AS HARD AS I COULD,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I COULD NOT LEARN
 TO READ MUSIC.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
THEN WHEN I CAME HERE,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I WAS SORT OF PUSHED GOING,
"COME ON, JUST DO IT."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
THEN WHEN I STARTED
TRYING OUT FOR STUFF

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I WAS SURPRISED
WHEN I GOT IT.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
AND SO I'M MORE INVOLVED
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I KNOW I'M SMART NOW BECAUSE

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I CAN READ, WRITE AND DO MATH.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
IT FEELS MUCH BETTER NOW
BECAUSE LAST TIME

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO DO TIMES...

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
...PLUS ALGEBRA A LITTLE.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Laura:
 SINCE I'VE COME HERE

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I HAVE LIKE-- I'LL DO SOMETHING
BUT I'LL SUCCEED IN IT.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
THEN I WANT TO DO A LITTLE
BIT MORE AND SUCCEED MORE.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
COLLEGE, THAT'S WHERE
I'M GOING. NEXT STEP.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I'M MORE WILLING
TO TRY THINGS NOW.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
AND I'M NOT REALLY AFRAID
TO DO ANYTHING.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
( kids shouting )

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Ann Paton:
 IT'S JUST AMAZING TO SEE

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
THIS PERSON THAT
WE CARE ABOUT SO MUCH

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
HAVING... CHANGED THIS WAY.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
UH...

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
UM...

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I REALLY HAVE THE FEELING

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
THAT HER FUTURE
WILL BE BRIGHT

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
BECAUSE OF BEING HERE.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
( kids harmonizing )

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Brazelton:
 VISIT US ON-LINE AT...

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
ON PARENTING

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
PRESENTED BY
 THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
WITH ME IS DR. ROBERT BROOKS,
CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
ON THE FACULTY OF THE
 HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I KNOW YOUR WONDERFUL WORK ON
ADHD AND LEARNING DISABILITIES

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
AND I WONDER IF
YOU COULD TELL ME

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
WHAT'S THE LATEST
THINKING ABOUT THIS?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
WELL, ONE OF THE
THINGS WE KNOW, BERRY,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
IS THAT IT'S CERTAINLY
A NEURO-BIOLOGICAL DISORDER

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS IT'S
NOT CAUSED BY BAD PARENTING

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
BUT IT'S REALLY
SOMETHING IN THE BRAIN.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I GOT VERY INTERESTED
IN WHAT HAPPENS

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
TO THE SELF-ESTEEM OF CHILDREN
WITH LEARNING PROBLEMS.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
A SENSE
 OF HOPELESSNESS ARISES.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
 MY MAIN INTEREST HAS BEEN

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD
 WITH LEARNING
 AND ATTENTIONAL PROBLEMS

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
WHAT CAN YOU DO TO KEEP
THEIR SELF-ESTEEM UP,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
WHAT CAN YOU DO
SO THAT THEY HAVE

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
A SENSE OF HOPE
IN THE FUTURE.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
SO I USE A METAPHOR
 IN ALL OF MY TALKS,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
EVERY CHILD HAS
ISLANDS OF COMPETENCE
OR AREAS OF STRENGTH.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
YOU KNOW, I THINK PARENTS

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
WHO MIGHT BE
TRYING TO DO THIS,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
TO TRY TO TURN IT
AROUND INTO SOMETHING,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE
NEURO-BIOLOGICAL SIDE OF IT.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
CAN YOU LAY THAT OUT FOR ME?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
WELL, WE KNOW THAT WE ALL
HAVE DIFFERENT BRAINS,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
WE ALL LEARN DIFFERENTLY

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE
LEARNING MORE AND MORE ABOUT

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
IS HOW THESE DIFFERENCES
IN THE BRAIN

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
IMPACT ON A CHILD'S BEHAVIOR.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
SO WE KNOW THAT
CHILDREN WITH ADHD

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
SAY IN TERMS
OF THEIR IMPULSIVITY.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
THEY ACT
BEFORE THEY THINK,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
THEY'RE OFTEN
VERY HYPERACTIVE,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
THEY ARE VERY IMPULSIVE.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
THIS IS NOT, AS WE USED
TO THINK, BAD PARENTING,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
BUT IT HAS TO DO WITH
CHANGES IN THE BRAIN.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
THE SAME WITH
LEARNING DISABILITIES.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
WE PROCESS
INFORMATION DIFFERENTLY

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
BECAUSE OF HOW
THE BRAIN WORKS.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
WE KNOW THAT THERE'S
RESEARCH WHEN CHILDREN,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
GOOD READERS AND POOR READERS,
 ARE GIVEN MRI'S,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
AND ASKED TO READ,
 YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
BLOOD FLOWING TO
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BRAIN.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
WHAT ELSE GOES WITH ADHD?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
PROBABLY THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THAT RESEARCH
IS SHOWING WITH ADHD

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
IS THE IMPULSIVITY.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
WHAT IT IS, IS THAT
THEY ARE SO IMPULSIVE

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
THAT THEY JUST ACT,
THEY DON'T STOP

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT
THEY'VE LEARNED.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
THESE ARE THE CHILDREN
WHO CAN DRIVE PARENTS CRAZY

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
AND TEACHERS CRAZY.
THE TEACHER WILL SAY

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
TO THE CHILD,
I JUST SAID

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
"DON'T BLURT OUT AN ANSWER"
AND THEY BLURT OUT AN ANSWER.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I THINK THERE ARE WAYS
OF STARTING TO HELP
THESE CHILDREN.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
- GREAT.
- WHAT I LIKE TO DO

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
IS ACTUALLY SIT DOWN
WITH THE CHILD,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
AND IT'S SOMETHING
YOU SAID BEFORE, I LIKE TO

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
IN ONE SENSE, DEMYSTIFY.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
SAY, "YOU HAVE MANY STRENGTHS,
OR STRONG POINTS.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL ARTIST,
YOU DO THIS VERY NICELY,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF
THE PROBLEMS YOU HAVE?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
SOMETIMES YOU'LL
BLURT OUT AN ANSWER,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
SO TOGETHER WE HAVE TO
 FIGURE OUT WHAT MAY HELP."

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
THERE WAS A BOY I WORKED WITH
WHO WAS SIX YEARS OLD WITH ADHD.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
HE WAS HITTING OTHER KIDS.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
HE SAID TO ME,
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT,
A SIX YEAR OLD,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
"DOCTOR BROOKS,
 I NEED REMINDERS."

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
SO WE SAT DOWN, WE THEN
SAT DOWN WITH THE TEACHER,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
AND THE TEACHER
WAS WONDERFUL, SHE SAID,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
"HOW OFTEN DO YOU
 NEED REMINDERS?"

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
HE SAYS,
"LIKE TWICE AN HOUR."

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
SHOWS YOU THE MIND OF A CHILD.
AFTER THE FIRST DAY

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
HE CAME HOME,
HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I THINK I NEED REMINDERS
EVERY TEN MINUTES RIGHT NOW.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
SEE, HE KNEW HE COULD NOT
REMEMBER NOT TO HIT.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
YOU'RE JUST DRAWING
THESE KIDS BACK

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
INTO A SENSE OF
"I'M PART OF HUMANITY"

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
FROM WAY OUT THERE WHERE
WE PUT THEM WITH THESE LABELS.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
PUT UNDERSTANDING
UNDERNEATH IT,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
AND THEN SOME IDEAS
THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US TODAY

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
WOULD MAKE IT
SO MUCH EASIER TO DO THAT.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
THANK YOU.
ALWAYS WONDERFUL.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
THE PLEASURE'S MINE.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
JOINING ME TODAY
IS CRYSTAL HOLMES,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM IBM.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
CRYSTAL, HOW CAN
PARENTS LEARN

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO
TO FOSTER THEIR CHILD'S

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
BOTH EMOTIONAL
AND COGNITIVE LEARNING?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
THERE ARE GOOD SITES
ON THE INTERNET TO HELP PARENTS

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR
CHILDREN ARE GOING THROUGH

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
FROM VERY EARLY STAGES
OF THEIR LIFE.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
WE'RE GOING TO GO
TO THE SITE SPONSORED BY

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR
 INFANTS, TODDLERS AND FAMILIES.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
IT'S CALLED "ZERO TO THREE,"
 AND HERE THEY HAVE INFORMATION

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
FOR BOTH PARENTS
 AND PROFESSIONALS.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
IF WE CLICK ON
 THE INFORMATION FOR PARENTS,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
IT REALLY TALKS ABOUT HOW
 PARENTS ARE THE REAL EXPERTS

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
BUT THEY ALSO
 PROVIDE INFORMATION

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
WHERE YOU CAN DO A SEARCH
 TO GET INFORMATION

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
ON ANY TOPIC
 YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN
 FIND OUT ABOUT LEARNING.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
AS A RESULT
 OF OUR SEARCH,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
WE FIND THAT THERE
 ARE SEVERAL ARTICLES

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
ON THE COGNITIVE
 AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
OF CHILDREN, VERY EARLY ON.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER WEBSITE
 PARENTS CAN GO TO

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
SPONSORED BY
THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
FOR THE EDUCATION
OF YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
AND HERE PARENTS FIND
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES
 OF THEIR CHILD.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
YOU KNOW, I LOVE YOUR MENTIONING
THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
BECAUSE THEY TALK ABOUT
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
A CHILD WHO FEELS
GOOD ABOUT HIMSELF

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
CAN LEARN ANYTHING
YOU WANT HIM TO LEARN
BY THE TIME HE'S THREE,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
AND WE'VE TESTED THIS
WITH "REACH OUT AND READ,"

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
WHICH MEANS YOU START
READING TO A BABY

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
RIGHT FROM THE FIRST.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
AND OF COURSE, WHEN A PARENT
 OF A BABY READS TO THEM

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
THEY LOOK IN THEIR FACE
AND THEY TRY TO ELICIT A SMILE.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
WHEN THE BABY SMILES,
THEY SMILE BACK.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
SO THEY ARE REALLY
DOING MORE THAN READING.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
THEY'RE LOVING AND
READING AT THE SAME TIME.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO
 PARENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE...

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR, WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY
 IS SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Emcee:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
HI.  UM, MY SON
IS EIGHT YEARS OLD.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
HE HAS THIS BIG DISLIKE
OF DOING HOMEWORK.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
AND I'M TRYING TO
MOTIVATE HIM TO DO HOMEWORK.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
( Brazelton laughs )

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Woman: I DON'T WANT TO
BRIBE HIM BUT, UM...

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
I NEED TO GET HIM TO
 WANT TO DO HIS HOMEWORK.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
TO BE ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT SCHOOL WORK.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
TO WANT TO DO GOOD AND
WANT TO BE A GOOD STUDENT.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
UH-HUH.  HAVE YOU
EVER SEEN AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
WHO DID HOMEWORK BECAUSE
EVERYBODY WANTS HIM TO?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I DON'T KNOW.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
THIS IS THE FIRST
EIGHT YEAR OLD
I'VE EVER HAD, SO...

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
 ABOUT EIGHT YEAR OLDS.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT INNER
MOTIVATION, AREN'T YOU?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I THINK THAT'S GOT
TO COME FROM HIM.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
AND I DOUBT THAT IT'S
GOING TO COME FROM YOU.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
I THINK THE MORE PRESSURE
YOU PUT ON HIM,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
PROBABLY THE LESS INNER
MOTIVATION HE'S GOING TO HAVE.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
SO, I WOULD LOOK
 FOR OTHER WAYS.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
DOES HE HAVE A PARTICULAR
INTEREST OF ANY KIND

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
THAT YOU COULD FOSTER AND...

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
GIVE HIM, YOU KNOW, A FEELING
OF WOW, THIS IS EXCITING?

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
- HE LIKES TO DRAW.
- YEAH, GREAT.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
AND PAINT, CRAFTY THINGS.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M AFTER?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
TRYING TO BUILD HIM UP
AS, YOU KNOW,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
- FEELING GOOD ABOUT HIMSELF.
- MM-HMM.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
MAYBE HAVE SOME STRUCTURE
THAT HE CAN FALL BACK ON

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
THAT YOU CAN WATCH T.V.
ONE HOUR ONLY,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
AND THE REST OF THE TIME
YOU SAVE FOR HOMEWORK.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I TRY TO SET UP TIME
FOR HIM TO DO IT.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
AND I TRY TO SET UP A LITTLE
PLACE FOR HIM TO DO IT.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
RIGHT.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
AND HE'S FIDDLING
WITH HIS PENCIL

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
AND DOING ANYTHING
BUT DOING HIS HOMEWORK.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
HAVE YOU EVER WRITTEN
OR DONE ANY CRAFTY WORK?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
- HAVE YOU?
- OH, YEAH.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO
 BEFORE YOU CAN SIT DOWN
 AND GET IT DONE?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
UH...

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I HAVE TO GO
WATER THE PLANTS,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
I HAVE TO
FEED THE FISH,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
I HAVE TO
CHANGE PENCILS,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I HAVE TO DO ABOUT
TEN DIFFERENT THINGS

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
TO GET MOTIVATED TO DO IT.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
OKAY.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
AND MAYBE THIS IS
WHAT HE'S GOT TO DO

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
- FIND HIS OWN PATTERN.
- OKAY.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
GOOD.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
( applause )

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
HI.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
HI, MY NAME'S SANDY.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
I HAVE A
FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
AND SHE JUST
STARTED KINDERGARTEN,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
AND WE'RE QUESTIONING
POSSIBLE A.D.D.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
SHE HAS DIFFICULTY
GETTING WORK DONE AT SCHOOL,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
SHE'S VERY DISTRACTIBLE.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
DOES SHE GO FROM
ONE THING TO ANOTHER?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000
- Sandy: YEAH.
- IS SHE VERY HYPER-SENSITIVE?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
- A LITTLE BIT, I WOULD SAY.
- LET ME SUGGEST SOMETHING.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
( clapping )

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I DON'T SEE ANY OF YOU
STILL BLINKING,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT A.D.D.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
IF YOU DID YOU'D
 STILL BE BLINKING,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
AND YOU CAN OFTEN
TELL A CHILD

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
THAT'S VERY SENSITIVE--
SHE'LL KEEP ON BLINKING

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
AND SHE CAN'T STOP HERSELF

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
AND THESE KIDS HAVE A VERY
SENSITIVE NERVOUS SYSTEM

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
THAT REALLY DOESN'T HABITUATE

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
TO UNNECESSARY NOISE
OR WHATEVER.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
AND SO THEY ARE
SORT OF AT THE MERCY

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
OF EVERYTHING THAT
GOES ON AROUND THEM.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
AND OFTEN VISUALLY AND
AUDITORILY AND TACTILELY.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
AND ONE THING I'VE TRIED
 AND YOU MIGHT TRY THIS,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
IS I GET MOTHERS
TO DRAW ME A CURVE

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OF WHAT THEY'RE LIKE WHEN
THEY'RE PAYING ATTENTION,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
JUST BEFORE THEY CRASH,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
THEN WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
AS THEY CRASH,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
AND THEN WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
AND WHAT YOU MAY FIND
 IS THAT AFTER SHE CRASHES

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
SHE'S GREAT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
AND THEN SHE HAS TO
BUILD UP AGAIN.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
AND THEN IF YOU
 CAN SEE THAT,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
MAYBE ON THAT SLOPE UP
YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
THAT YOU CAN FIRST
HELP HER BREAK.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
AND SAY TO HER, "YOU KNOW WHEN
YOU BEGIN TO GET LIKE THAT,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
SUCK YOUR THUMB
OR TWIRL YOUR HAIR,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
OR GET SOMETHING
AND HANG ON TO IT,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
AND LET'S
CUT OFF THE PEAK.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
AND THEN IF SHE CAN LEARN
 TO CUT OFF THE PEAK HERSELF,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
SHE CAN DO THIS IN SCHOOL,
RATHER THAN THIS.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
AND IF THAT HELPS,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
IT MAY REALLY GIVE HER BACK
HER SELF-ESTEEM,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
HER FEELING THAT SHE KNOWS
WHAT TO DO FOR HERSELF,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
AND IT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS
GIFT IF YOU COULD DO THAT.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
THANK YOU.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
OKAY.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Brazelton: FOR TAPES
 AND TRANSCRIPTS, CALL...

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
OR LOG ON AT...

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
,
 PRESENTED BY

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
THE PARENTING INSTITUTE
 AT pampers.com.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
I HOPE YOU'VE
LEARNED A BIT MORE

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
ABOUT HOW YOUR CHILD LEARNS.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
SELF-ESTEEM COMES FIRST.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I CAN TELL IF A CHILD
IS GOING TO SUCCEED

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
BY AS EARLY AS
EIGHT MONTHS OR SO.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
A SUCCESSFUL BABY WILL
DO A TASK YOU GIVE HIM

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
LIKE BANGING
TWO BLOCKS TOGETHER.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
LOOK UP AT YOU AND SAY
"AREN'T I GREAT?"

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
THAT CHILD EXPECTS TO SUCCEED.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
WE WANT TO SEE THAT LOOK

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
IN THE FACE OF ALL
OF OUR CHILDREN.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
AS PARENTS,
WE CAN HELP THEM.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Brazelton: JUST ASK
 THE KIDS AT LANDMARK.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
( choir singing )

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Broudo: EACH YEAR
 WE GRADUATE BETWEEN

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
60 AND 75 STUDENTS
 AND THERE ARE ALWAYS

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000
OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE THERE.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
EVERYBODY'S
 SCREAMING AND YELLING

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
AND IT'S ALL THE AUNTS
AND UNCLES AND COUSINS

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
AND GRANDPARENTS, BECAUSE
THEY WERE PART OF THE PROCESS.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
THE PARENTS HAVE BEEN
ADVOCATES FOR THESE STUDENTS

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
AND EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY
 KNOWS THE STORY

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
AND THERE THEY ARE,
 BOUNCING ACROSS THAT STAGE

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
AND EVERYBODY IS JUST
 FILLED WITH LIFE

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
AND THEY CAN ALL SEE
 A DIFFERENT FUTURE
 FOR THIS YOUNG PERSON

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
THAN THEY COULD SEE
 A FEW YEARS PRIOR TO THAT.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
( audience cheering )

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
( theme music playing )
