''SECRETS OF THE DEAD,''

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.730
CAPTURED SLAVES MUTINY AND RISK
THEIR LIVES FOR FREEDOM...

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.900
Man: THE SLAVES PLANNED
FOR A LONG TIME TO BECOME
MASTERS OF THE SHIP.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.400
OUR AIM WAS TO GO BACK
TO OUR OWN COUNTRY.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.260
Announcer: BUT THE SLAVE
TRADERS ARE DETERMINED
TO SAVE THEIR SHIP.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.600
Man: HE IS TRYING TO OUTWIT
THE SLAVES AT THEIR OWN GAME.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.630
IF YOU WROTE THIS UP IN A
NOVEL, NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE IT.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.400
Announcer: THE STORY OF
AFRICA'S FIRST FREEDOM FIGHTER.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.800
FOR ME, HE'S AMONGST THE
HEROES OF ALL HEROES.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:47.100
''SLAVE SHIP MUTINY'' ON
''SECRETS OF THE DEAD.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.600
Announcer: ''SECRETS OF THE
DEAD'' WAS MADE POSSIBLE

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.500
BY CONTRIBUTIONS TO YOUR PBS
STATION FROM VIEWERS LIKE YOU.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:02.960
THANK YOU.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960
Narrator: HIDDEN IN
THESE TATTERED BOOKS

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.560
IS A STORY ABOUT ONE
MAN'S FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.430
HIS BATTLE TOOK PLACE
NEARLY 250 YEARS AGO

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.260
ON A SLAVE SHIP BOUND FOR
CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.900
A FREE MAN NAMED MASSAVANNA,
ENSLAVED THROUGH DECEPTION

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.430
AND DETERMINED TO RETURN
TO HIS HOME ANY WAY HE CAN,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.260
SEIZES A NOTORIOUS
DUTCH SLAVE SHIP.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:31.030
ON-BOARD, A LIFE-AND-DEATH
STRUGGLE BETWEEN SLAVES AND
SAILORS TAKES PLACE.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.700
THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE VICTOR.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.300
TODAY, THE SHIP
LIES BURIED UNDER THESE
WAVES AT CAPE AGULHAS,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.960
THE SOUTHERNMOST TIP OF AFRICA.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.160
THIS SLAVE SHIP MUTINY HAS
BEEN LARGELY FORGOTTEN.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.000
BUT NOW, 3 PEOPLE
ARE UNCOVERING THESE
REMARKABLE EVENTS

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.200
AND LEARNING THE
STORY OF MASSAVANNA,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.560
THE MAN NOW BEING HAILED
AS ONE OF SOUTH AFRICA'S
FIRST FREEDOM FIGHTERS.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.830
PROFESSOR NIGEL WORDEN
STUDIES THE HISTORY OF
CAPE TOWN UNDER DUTCH RULE

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.760
AND IS RESEARCHING HOW AND
WHY THE REBELLION HAPPENED;

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.330
SLAVE DESCENDANT LUCY CAMPBELL
WANTS TO KNOW WHO CAPE TOWN
SLAVE ANCESTORS WERE

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.860
AND HOW THEY STRUGGLED
FOR THEIR FREEDOM;

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.230
AND MARINE ARCHAEOLOGIST
JACO BOSHOFF

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.100
IS HUNTING FOR THE
REMAINS OF THE SLAVE SHIP

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.860
AT THE HEART OF THIS STORY.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.030
IT WAS CALLED THE MEERMIN.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.060
IT SAILED FROM MADAGASCAR
IN JANUARY 1 766

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.800
WITH MORE THAN 1 40
ENSLAVED PEOPLE ABOARD.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.430
THIS WOULD BE ITS FINAL VO YAGE.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.000
TODAY, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH
AFRICA, IS A THRIVING CITY

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.430
WHOSE RESIDENTS CAN
TRACE THEIR ANCESTRY BACK

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.000
TO FAR-FLUNG COUNTRIES ALL
AROUND THE INDIAN OCEAN.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.430
HOWEVER, MOST RESIDENTS HAVE
ANCESTORS WHO WERE BROUGHT TO
THE CAPE AGAINST THEIR WILL,

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.930
AS SLAVES.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.430
CAPE TOWN WAS FOUNDED IN
1652 TO SUPPLY FOOD AND WATER

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.030
FOR THE MERCHANT SHIPS OF THE
DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.130
ALSO KNOWN AS THE VOC.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.300
IT WAS A COMPANY TOWN,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.760
AND THE VOC WANTED
TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.730
COMMERCE WAS KING.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.760
Man: THE V.O.C. WAS
A COMMERCIAL COMPANY, BUT
IT WAS ALSO A GOVERNMENT.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.960
IT WAS A STATE WITHIN
A STATE, IF YOU LIKE.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.700
IT HAD BEEN GIVEN THE AUTHORITY
BY THE STATE'S GENERAL IN THE
NETHERLANDS TO RULE--

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.330
TO RUN LAW, TO MAKE
TREATIES, TO DECLARE WARS--

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.200
AS WELL AS TO TRADE,
SO IT WAS MUCH MORE THAN
JUST A TRADING COMPANY.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.630
IN THE CAPE, IT HAD TOTAL
POWER. IT WAS THE STATE,

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.630
AND IT HAD THE RIGHT OF LIFE
AND DEATH OVER ALL OF THE
INHABITANTS OF THE COLONY.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.700
Narrator: THE HISTORIC DOCUMENTS
OF THE VOC ARE HELD IN CAPE
TOWN'S PROVINCIAL ARCHIVES.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:02.460
HERE, 30 MILES OF DOCUMENTS
HOLD THE SECRETS OF LIFE IN
CAPE TOWN'S SLAVE SOCIETY

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.660
AND WHY THE MEERMIN WAS
BRINGING SLAVES HERE.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.800
THEY DID NOT WANT A SETTLER
COLONY HERE AT THE CAPE.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.960
THEY DIDN'T WANT LOTS OF
IMMIGRANTS COMING IN.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.600
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
EXPENSIVE FOR THEM.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.430
THEY DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE
TO ESTABLISH THEMSELVES
AS INDEPENDENT FARMERS,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.360
AND INSTEAD, THEREFORE, OF
ENCOURAGING IMMIGRANTS,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.330
THEY TURNED TO SLAVE LABOR.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.300
Narrator: THE VOC
BROUGHT 63,000 PEOPLE

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.760
TO CAPE TOWN AS SLAVES,
BEGINNING IN 1658.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.160
THEY CAME FROM ALL
AROUND THE INDIAN OCEAN,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.760
FROM EASTERN AFRICA THROUGH
INDIA TO INDONESIA.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.160
SLAVERY CONTINUED UNTIL 1838.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.530
UNTIL THEN, AS
CAPE TOWN EXPANDED,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.400
ITS FREE CITIZENS PURCHASED
SLAVES FOR DOMESTIC LABOR.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.100
CAPE TOWN BECAME
A SLAVE SOCIETY.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.030
NOW, THEIR DESCENDANTS
WANT TO KNOW THEIR HISTORY,

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:11.830
NONE MORE SO THAN HERITAGE
ACTIVIST LUCY CAMPBELL.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.260
Campbell: WHEN SLAVES
CAME TO THE CAPE, THEIR
NAMES WERE CHANGED.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.660
IF IT WAS A NAME LIKE
SANGORA OR MASSAVANNA

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.600
AND THEY ARRIVED IN CAPE
TOWN, SAY, ON FEBRUARY 15

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.160
OR SEPTEMBER, THEY WOULD
HAVE BEEN NAMED SEPTEMBER--
THE MONTH WHEN THEY ARRIVED.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.160
JUST LIKE TO INDICATE TO
YOU, THERE IS SEPTEMBER.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.900
LOOK AT ALL THESE NAMES.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.200
THOUSANDS OF THEM,
THOUSANDS OF THEM.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.860
LOOK AT ALL THE
FEBRUARYS YOU SEE HERE.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.460
ALL THESE ARE NAMES OF SLAVES
THAT WERE BROUGHT TO THE CAPE.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.760
A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
IN CAPE TOWN--I WOULD
SAY EVEN THE MAJORITY

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.830
OF THE PEOPLE IN CAPE TOWN--
ARE SLAVE DESCENDANTS,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.000
WHETHER THEY ARE WHITE,
WHETHER THEY ARE BLACK,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.900
OR WHETHER THEY ARE
SO-CALLED COLORED.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.600
Narrator: BY 1 766,
CAPE TOWN HAD GROWN INTO
A SIZABLE SETTLEMENT,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.260
WITH MORE THAN 7,000
INHABITANTS--2/3
OF THEM SLAVES.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.730
KEEPING SO MANY PEOPLE UNDER
CONTROL REQUIRED CONSTANT
SUPERVISION AND COERCION.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:19.260
EVEN THE ARCHITECTURE OF A
TYPICAL CAPE TOWN HOUSE WAS
DESIGNED TO CONTROL SLAVES.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.300
THIS IS KOOPMANS-DE WET HOUSE.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.600
NOW A MUSEUM, IT ONCE HOUSED
A FAMILY OF 13 EUROPEANS,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.500
THE DE WET FAMILY,
AND THEIR 26 SLAVES.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.560
THIS HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN A
HOUSE OF A VERY WEALTHY OWNER

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.960
THAT WOULD HAVE HAD SLAVES,
AND THE HOUSE WAS BUILT
SPECIFICALLY AROUND SLAVES,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.130
BECAUSE WITHOUT SLAVES,
THEY COULDN'T FUNCTION, THEY
COULDN'T FUNCTION AT ALL.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.500
SO THIS WOULD HAVE
BEEN THE CENTER

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.160
OR THE DOMAIN OF THE
MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.130
THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE COULD
WATCH OVER THE SLAVES OUTSIDE

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.030
AND SHE COULD WATCH
SLAVES COMING UP AND
DOWN FROM THE STEPS.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.130
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN
ALMOST LIKE A WEB,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.630
AND SHE WOULD HAVE
BEEN IN THE CENTER.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.630
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN
EYE ON THEM AT ALL TIMES.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.630
WHATEVER THEY DID, THERE
WAS AN EYE ON THEM,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.560
AND THE WEIRD THING IS, IS THAT
THERE WAS NOT PHYSICAL CONTROL,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.430
BUT THERE WAS A
PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTROL

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.960
WHERE THE MASTER OR
THE MISTRESS DIDN'T HAVE
TO USE PHYSICAL ABUSE,

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:41.360
BUT THE MENTAL SLAVERY IS
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SLAVERY.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.030
A SLAVE WAS AT THE MERCY
OF THE MASTER AT ALL TIMES.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.200
A MASTER COULD ASK
ANYTHING OF THAT SLAVE:

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.900
BRUSH MY SHOES,
PUT ON MY SHIRT,

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:54.700
CARRY THIS, CARRY THAT,

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.330
COME LAY WITH ME.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.830
THEY COULD BASICALLY
ASK FOR ANYTHING

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.030
BECAUSE THE MASTER
OWNED THAT SLAVE.

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.530
THAT SLAVE WAS A COMMODITY.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.560
Narrator: THE SLAVE SHIP MEERMIN
TRANSPORTED THIS COMMODITY.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.030
ITS SAILORS WOULD GIVE
THEIR TRIBAL KINGS

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.960
GUNS AND GUNPOWDER IN
EXCHANGE FOR PEOPLE.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.200
ON JANUARY 20, 1 766,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.800
THE SHIP SET SAIL FROM BETSIBOKA
BAY IN WESTERN MADAGASCAR.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.060
ITS HEADING IS FOR CAPE TOWN.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.800
3 CREW MEMBERS WILL
PLAY CRITICAL ROLES

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.660
IN WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.100
GERRIT MULLER IS
THE SHIP'S CAPTAIN.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:38.230
THIS IS HIS FIRST TIME
RUNNING A SLAVE SHIP.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:44.500
CHIEF MERCHANT JOHAN
CRAUSE IS IN CHARGE OF
THE VOC's CARGO OF SLAVES.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:49.800
CRAUSE HAS BEEN ON SLAVE
JOURNEYS TO MADAGASCAR BEFORE,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.800
AND SO HAS HIS
ASSISTANT, OLAF LEIJ.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.160
Worden: THE MEERMIN
STORY IS INDEED ONE
OF THE MOST REMARKABLE

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.000
OF THE WHOLE OF THE PERIOD
OF SLAVERY AT THE CAPE,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.800
ALTHOUGH IT'S RELATIVELY
LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT IN--BOTH
IN SOUTH AFRICA OR OUTSIDE IT.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.200
BUT WHAT IS PARTICULARLY
EXTRAORDINARY

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200
IS THAT WE HAVE RECORDS OF THAT.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.030
WE HAVE THE VERY WORDS OF THE
PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.660
THE DUTCH EAST INDIA
COMPANY WAS AN INCREDIBLY
BUREAUCRATIC ORGANIZATION,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.260
AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN
HELL TO WORK FOR.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.930
IT RECORDED EVERYTHING.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.830
Narrator: THESE WORDS WERE
RECORDED WHEN THE SURVIVORS
OF THE MEERMIN SHIPWRECK

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:30.630
WERE BROUGHT TO CAPE TOWN
AND QUESTIONED BY THE VOC's
VERY OWN COURT OF JUSTICE.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.430
ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT
MULLER WAS ONLY RECENTLY
APPOINTED AS A CAPTAIN.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.630
HE HADN'T HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE
OF BEING ON A SLAVE SHIP,

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.730
WHEREAS CRAUSE HAD, AND ALL
THE WAY THROUGH THE RECORDS,

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.430
WE SEE CRAUSE REMINDING
MULLER-- WHO IS,
IN FACT, HIS SUPERIOR--

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:51.800
THAT ACTUALLY HE KNOWS A
LOT MORE ABOUT HOW TO SAIL A
SLAVE SHIP THAN MULLER DOES.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.560
SO MULLER'S AUTHORITY IS BEING
RATHER UNDERMINED BY CRAUSE,

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.000
THIS YOUNGER MAN, BUT
NONETHELESS A MAN WHO HAS
MORE EXPERIENCE AT THIS.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.760
Narrator: THIS STRUGGLE
OVER LEADERSHIP WILL
COMPROMISE THE DUTCH CREW.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.460
[SHIP CREAKS]

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.630
THE VOC PREFERRED TO IMPORT
CHILDREN TO WORK IN CAPE TOWN.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.100
THEY SURVIVED THE VO YAGES
BETTER THAN THE ADULTS

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.030
AND WOULD PROVIDE MORE LABOR
OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.000
THE AVERAGE AGE OF
AN IMPORTED SLAVE

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.230
WAS JUST 16.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.000
THE TRUE FACE OF SLAVERY

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.630
CAN BE SEEN IN
PHOTOS OF CHILDREN

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.930
TAKEN FROM MADAGASCAR IN 1868.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:42.900
THE CHILDREN WERE RESCUED
WHEN A BRITISH NAVAL VESSEL
INTERCEPTED THE SLAVE SHIP.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:49.200
THE PHOTOS HAVE ATTRACTED THE
ATTENTION OF SOUTH AFRICA'S
LEADING HUMAN RIGHTS ADVOCATE,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.930
ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.760
THEY REMIND ONE SO VERY MUCH

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.860
OF PICTURES OUT
OF THE HOLOCAUST,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:03.060
BELSEN AND THINGS OF THAT SORT.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.630
WE ARE SHOWING OUR
INHUMANITY TO ONE ANOTHER.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:11.060
WE HAVE BANDIED ABOUT
THAT WORD, SLAVERY,

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:16.400
NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF
JUST HOW INHUMANE

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.700
THE CONDITIONS WERE.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.900
Narrator: BEGINNING
IN THE 15th CENTURY,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.360
SLAVE SHIPS TOOK MORE THAN 1 2
MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF AFRICA.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.330
THE VAST MAJORITY
WENT TO THE AMERICAS.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.300
THESE SHIPS ARE THE
RESEARCH SUBJECT

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.530
OF MARINE ARCHAEOLOGIST
JACO BOSHOFF.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:39.930
IF HE CAN FIND THE MEERMIN,
IT WILL BE ONE OF ONLY A FEW
SUCH VESSELS DISCOVERED.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.530
THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT IT
IS THAT SHE WAS A SLAVE VESSEL

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.560
AND THEN THE FACT THAT THERE
WAS A REBELLION ON-BOARD,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.600
AND THAT'S THE MAIN REASON
WHY SHE GOT WRECKED.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.300
ALSO, WE DO NOT KNOW TOO
MUCH ABOUT THESE VESSELS

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.000
THAT THE DUTCH EAST
INDIA COMPANY USED AT
THE CAPE FOR SLAVERY.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Narrator: THIS COASTLINE
IS CALLED ''THE GRAVEYARD
OF SHIPWRECKS.''

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.560
MORE THAN 200 BOATS
LIE BURIED HERE.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:10.100
THE LACK OF OXYGEN UNDER
THE SEABED SHOULD PRESERVE
THE MEERMIN WRECK.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.460
BUT WHERE IS IT?

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:15.160
Boshoff: WE KNOW THAT THE
MEERMIN DOES NOT HAVE A
LOT OF MATERIAL LEFT ON IT

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.960
BECAUSE A LOT OF
IT WAS TAKEN OFF AT THE
TIME WHEN SHE WRECKED,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.900
SO IT IS A BIT LIKE FINDING
A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK
UNDERWATER AND UNDER SAND.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.230
Narrator: THE MOST EFFECTIVE
WAY TO FIND IT IS BY LOCATING
ANY IRON-BASED ARTIFACTS

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.060
THAT WENT DOWN WITH
THE WOODEN SHIP.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.430
THIS CROP DUSTER IS EQUIPPED
WITH HIGHLY SENSITIVE
MAGNETOMETRY SENSORS,

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:43.030
WHICH CAN PENETRATE THROUGH
OCEAN WATER AND BEACH SAND.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.700
IF ANY IRON REMAINS OF
THE MEERMIN ARE HERE,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.530
THEY WILL LEAVE
A MAGNETIC TRACE.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:54.760
Boshoff: WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE
IN THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT THIS
SHIP'S PLAN OF THE MEERMIN,

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:59.830
WHICH WE FOUND WAS IN THE
SCHEEPVAART MUSEUM IN AMSTERDAM.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.530
IT WILL GUIDE US TOWARDS WHAT
THE SIZE OF THE VESSEL WAS:

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.760
HOW WIDE IT WAS, HOW
MANY RIBS DID IT HAVE.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.930
A VESSEL LIKE THIS--OBVIOUSLY,
MADE LARGELY OUT OF TIMBER--

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:16.530
WOULD HAVE USED
OAK, SO OAK IS SOMETHING
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR,

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.960
AND THE FASTENINGS
WOULD HAVE BEEN METAL,
WOULD HAVE BEEN IRON,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:24.700
SO THERE'S A LOT OF IRON THERE
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO
PICK UP WITH THE MAGNETOMETER.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:30.530
Narrator: IN THE END, IT WILL
BE THE SLAVES WHO DETERMINE
THE FATE OF THE MEERMIN.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.530
THEIR CHAINS DO NOT PREVENT
THEM FROM CHOOSING LEADERS
FOR THEIR REBELLION.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:42.860
EVEN BEFORE THE SHIP
SETS SAIL, ONE MAN LEADS AN
ESCAPE ATTEMPT, BUT FAILS.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.230
HIS NAME IS MASSAVANNA.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.700
HE IS FROM THE VILLAGE OF
TULEAR IN WESTERN MADAGASCAR.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:55.130
HE HAS MANY SUPPORTERS,
INCLUDING A STRONG
FIGHTER NAMED KOESAAIJ.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.660
[DOOR UNLATCHING]

00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:00.760
KOESAAIJ'S EXPERIENCE
ON-BOARD THE MEERMIN

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.930
WAS LATER RECORDED
IN DETAIL BY THE VOC.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.460
NOW, LUCY CAMPBELL WANTS TO
READ THIS FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.560
OF A FREE MAN TURNED SLAVE.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.300
I GATHER YOU WANT TO
KNOW ABOUT MASSAVANNA,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.330
WHAT WE CAN FIND OUT ABOUT HIM.

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:21.160
WHAT IS REALLY EXCITING
IS THAT HERE WE HAVE

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.760
THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF
MASSAVANNA AT HIS TRIAL,

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.930
AND HERE HE IS: ''MASSAVANNA
FROM MADAGASCAR.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:34.360
AGE ABOUT 26 YEARS
OLD,'' SO HE WAS--WE KNOW
THAT, THAT HE WAS 26.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.130
AND HE'S ASKED QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
ON-BOARD THE SHIP,

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:40.900
BUT ALSO, HE GIVES DETAILS

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.200
ABOUT HOW HE CAME TO
BE SOLD AS A SLAVE.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.460
Man: MY NAME IS MASSAVANNA.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:53.560
I WAS ASKED BY THE KING OF
TULEAR TO VISIT THE DUTCH SHIP.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.630
WE WENT TO VIEW THE SHIP.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:58.160
I WAS DRESSED IN CLEAN CLOTHES

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.960
WITH GOLD AND SILVER ORNAMENTS.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.960
WHEN THIS WAS DONE,

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.600
HALFWAY BACK, THE
KING TIED ME UP,

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.930
AND HIS PEOPLE UNDRESSED ME.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:14.900
THEY TOOK MY GOLD, SILVER,
AND CLOTHES OFF MY BODY

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:26.730
AND THEY SOLD ME AS A SLAVE.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.130
Narrator: SCATTERED AROUND
CAPE TOWN ARE THE REMAINS
OF OLD SLAVE LODGES,

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:36.400
WHERE THE MEMORIES OF
THE CITY'S SLAVE HISTORY
CAN STILL BE EXPERIENCED.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.930
Campbell: BEFORE THE
EUROPEANS CAME TO MADAGASCAR,

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.100
THE MADAGASCANS, THEY
FOUGHT AMONGST EACH OTHER.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:50.360
THOSE THAT WON THESE
BATTLES USED TO TAKE
SLAVES AS SPOILS OF WAR

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.030
AND THEY USED TO SELL THESE
SLAVES TO THE EUROPEANS,

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.800
SO NOW THERE WAS A MARKET
FOR THEM AND THE KING
TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS.

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.430
AND THIS IS HOW THEY STARTED
TO--IT BECAME A REGULAR THING,

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.460
AND IT BECAME A TRADING
POST FOR THE EUROPEANS

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:44.860
AND FOR THE MADAGASCANS
TO TRADE IN SLAVES.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.960
Narrator: MOST OF THE
SLAVES PURCHASED BY THE VOC

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.030
WOULD REMAIN THE
PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY,

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.700
BUT CAPE TOWN ALSO HAD
TRADERS WHO PROVIDED PRIVATE
INDIVIDUALS WITH SLAVES.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:01.630
A TYPICAL SLAVE WOULD
COST THE EQUIVALENT OF
TWO OXEN AND A CART.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.000
Campbell: YOU ARE
JUST A COMMODITY.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.730
YOU CAN'T THINK. YOU
CAN'T SAY ANYTHING.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.030
YOU HAVE TO BE
QUIET AT ALL TIMES.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.430
SO WHAT I'M GOING TO BE DOING
IS I'M GOING TO BE SELLING YOU.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:17.500
NOW, REMEMBER, THERE IS GOING
TO BE PEOPLE STANDING THERE.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.030
THEY ARE THE BUYERS, AND THEY
ARE GOING TO BID FOR YOU.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.760
SO NOW I WANT YOU
TO COME FORWARD.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:31.800
I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR... CAN HE HEAR PROPERLY?

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.130
CAN HE SEE?

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.960
DO YOU HAVE ALL YOUR TEETH?

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.600
[MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.960
Campbell: YOU'VE
GOT STRONG MUSCLES,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.330
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT I HAVE A STRONG SLAVE

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:53.630
BECAUSE WHAT'S THE USE
THERE, FOR ME TO BUY YOU
IF YOU CAN'T WORK FOR ME?

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.360
I WILL NOW HAVE ME THE SLAVE.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.100
PERFECT, HE'S YOUNG.
HE'S STRONG ENOUGH

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.100
AND HE CAN WORK
FOR ME LONG HOURS,

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.730
CAN CARRY WOOD,
CAN CARRY WATER,

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.200
AND WE CAN HAVE LOTS
OF OTHER SLAVES.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:15.130
Narrator: THE MEERMIN
HAS A 4-WEEK JOURNEY FROM
MADAGASCAR TO CAPE TOWN

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:16.860
AT THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.230
TEMPERATURES CAN
EXCEED 100 DEGREES.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:24.560
THE MISERY BELOW DECK
IS ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.830
IT IS A NIGHTMARISH VO YAGE.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:33.530
ARCHAEOLOGIST JACO BOSHOFF IS
CONDUCTING A DETAILED STUDY
OF THE MEERMIN BLUEPRINTS

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:39.060
TO CREATE AN ACCURATE
3-D COMPUTER GRAPHIC
MODEL OF THE SLAVE SHIP.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.860
KNOWING THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE
SHIP WILL HELP HIM UNDERSTAND
HOW THE REBELLION HAPPENED.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:50.360
Boshoff: THE VESSEL WAS
ABOUT 30 ODD METERS LONG,
SO THAT'S QUITE SMALL.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.560
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
A BIG VESSEL BECAUSE
IT COSTS MORE MONEY.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.730
Narrator: THE MEERMIN WAS A
MULTI-PURPOSE CARGO VESSEL,

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:02.860
OUTFITTED IN AMSTERDAM
IN 1 761 TO CARRY SLAVES.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.660
WHEN SAILING ON A
SLAVING VO YAGE,

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:11.000
MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE
WOULD BE CRAMMED ON-BOARD.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.260
THOSE OFF-DUTY WOULD BE IN THE
FORWARD CABINS AT THE BOW.

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.560
THE OFFICERS WERE
BASED TOWARD THE STERN,

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.060
THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN BUILT
UNDER THE QUARTER DECK.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.700
BELOW THIS IS THE GUN ROOM,

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:31.330
WHERE AMPLE SUPPLIES OF
GUNS AND GUNPOWDER WERE
KEPT TO TRADE FOR SLAVES.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.430
IF THE VESSEL WAS
FOLLOWING VOC RULES,

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.100
NO SIGN OF THE HUMAN CARGO WOULD
BE PERMITTED ON THE TOP DECK.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:44.660
THEY WOULD BE KEPT BELOW.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:53.000
THEY WERE EXPECTED TO
REMAIN HERE FOR THE COURSE
OF THE MONTH-LONG JOURNEY.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.100
Boshoff: THESE PEOPLE WOULD BE
SHACKLED UP IN THE SLAVE DECK,

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.860
SO WE'D HAVE ROWS OF
PEOPLE-- TWO, TWO--SHACKLED,

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:03.860
AND THEY WOULD OFTEN
HAVE ONE LONG CHAIN
RUNNING THE WHOLE LENGTH

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.860
TO GET AS MANY SLAVES
IN AS POSSIBLE.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:11.930
REMEMBER, IN THE 18th CENTURY,
THERE WAS NO HUMAN RIGHTS.
HUMAN RIGHTS DIDN'T EXIST.

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.400
Narrator: THERE WOULD
BE LITTLE LIGHT.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.330
ALL THE GUN HATCHES ARE
SEALED UP TO PREVENT
SLAVES FROM ESCAPING.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:22.560
ONLY TWO SMALL PORTALS PROVIDE
VENTILATION FOR THE SLAVES.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:26.730
Boshoff: IN FACT, SOME
OF THESE VESSELS, YOU
COULDN'T LIGHT A CANDLE

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:32.130
BECAUSE IT WAS SO
STUFFY AND ROTTEN.

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:33.930
Narrator: NIGEL WORDEN
IS INVESTIGATING

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.700
JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE
ENSLAVED ON THE MEERMIN.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:41.130
Worden: ONE OF THE
PUZZLING THINGS ABOUT
SOME OF THESE SOURCES IS

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.660
THAT THE NUMBERS OF SLAVES
ON-BOARD THE SHIP DON'T ADD UP.

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:48.160
YOU COULD SAY THAT THAT WAS
BAD MEMORY, BUT I THINK THERE'S
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.200
WE KNOW THAT ON-BOARD
ALL VOC VESSELS,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.960
CERTAINLY THE CAPTAIN AND THE
HIGHER OFFICERS WERE CARRYING

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.200
GOODS WHICH THEY WERE NOT
TO CARRY INTO THE COMPANY

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.160
AND THEY WERE SELLING OFF
PRIVATELY THEMSELVES.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.860
THIS IS HOW MOST SLAVES,
ACTUALLY, GOT TO THE CAPE,

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.530
AND IN THIS CASE, WHAT I
THINK IS CLEARLY HAPPENING IS
THAT THEY'VE GOT MORE SLAVES

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.200
THAN THEY'VE OFFICIALLY
ADMITTED TO THE COMPANY,
AND THEY'RE HOPING

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.830
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL
THEM OFF PRIVATELY THEMSELVES
WHEN THEY GET TO CAPE TOWN.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:17.760
AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS
IS THAT THE PEOPLE LIKE MULLER
AND CRAUSE ARE DESPERATE

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.260
TO CRAM AS MANY SLAVES ON-BOARD
THE SHIP AS THEY CAN, MORE SO
THAN THEY ARE DECLARING,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:26.500
WHICH MEANS THERE'S GOING
TO BE OVERCROWDING, DESPERATE
OVERCROWDING AS A RESULT.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.800
CONSEQUENCE THAT YOU GET
IS DISEASE. YOU WOULD GET
THINGS LIKE DYSENTERY,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.400
TYPHUS, AND THINGS LIKE
THAT THAT COULD BREAK OUT
UNDER CONDITIONS LIKE THIS,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:42.360
AND YOU'VE HAD SOME
OF THESE VESSELS WITH
LARGE AMOUNTS OF DEATHS.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.200
Narrator: THE MEERMIN SURVIVORS
LATER TESTIFIED TO THE VOC

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:52.130
THAT DISEASE WAS RIFE
ON THEIR SHIP, TOO.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.800
SLAVES WERE DYING...

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.660
AND DISEASE WAS SPREADING.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.900
Campbell: I THINK THE SITUATION
IN THE DECK WAS VERY VOLATILE

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.400
WITH THE SMELL AND THE
STENCH AND THAT SICKNESS

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.760
BECAUSE THERE WAS DISEASE,
ALSO, UNDERNEATH THE SHIP.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.130
THE DUTCH WERE SCARED THAT
SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:17.530
THEY WERE GOING TO DIE
AND THEY WERE GOING
TO LOSE THE COMMODITY.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.830
Narrator: TWO DAYS
INTO THE VO YAGE, CRAUSE
MAKES A FATAL DECISION,

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.900
ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN MULLER'S
TESTIMONY FOR THE VOC.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:28.960
Boshoff: CRAUSE STRONGLY
REQUESTED THAT THE SLAVES BE
FREED FROM THEIR SHACKLES

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.460
AND THAT ''WE SHOULD LET
THEM LOOSE ON THE SHIP.''

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:34.700
Worden: WHEN YOUR CARGO IS
SPICES OR MATERIAL GOODS

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.200
BEING BROUGHT FROM
ASIA, WHICH MOST OF THE
SHIPS WERE CARRYING,

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.700
THEN IT WAS IN THE INTERESTS OF
BOTH OF THEM TO KEEP THEM SAFE
AND TO KEEP THE SHIP SAILING.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.900
BUT WHEN YOUR CARGO
ARE HUMAN BEINGS

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.360
AND THE ISSUE IS THEIR HEALTH
AND KEEPING THEM ALIVE,

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.360
BY BRINGING THEM UP ON-BOARD
THE DECK, WHICH CRAUSE DID,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.100
IT'S ACTUALLY ENDANGERING
THE SECURITY OF THE SHIP.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.100
THEN YOU'VE GOT
A DIVISION IN INTEREST
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.100
[SPEAKING DUTCH]

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:05.130
Worden: SO HERE WE HAVE MULLER
SAYING THAT CRAUSE HAD SAID

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:10.230
THAT ON ALL THESE OTHER
JOURNEYS, HE'D LET THE SLAVES
FREE FROM THEIR CHAINS

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.900
SO HE'D NEVER HAD ANYTHING
TO FEAR FROM THEM.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.500
Man as Muller: I DID NOT WANT
TO GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:21.000
BUT THE SURGEON SAID THERE
WERE NO MEDICINES ON-BOARD
TO PREVENT ILLNESS

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.860
AND THAT THE CREW WAS
ALSO STARTING TO SUFFER.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:29.100
THE CAPTAIN'S AUTHORITY
WAS TO DO WITH THE VESSEL
ITSELF, SAILING THE VESSEL.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.630
SO, IN ESSENCE,

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.430
THE HEAD MERCHANT HAD
A LOT OF INFLUENCE

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.130
IN TERMS OF WHAT HAPPENS TO
THE SLAVES ON THE VESSEL.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.600
Muller: CRAUSE TOLD ME THAT
IF THE SLAVES BECAME ILL,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.830
AND IF SOME OF THEM DIED, IT
WOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.560
I AGREED THAT SOME
SLAVES COULD BE FREED.

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.930
Narrator: IT IS A
CRITICAL DECISION.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:54.930
IT PLAYS RIGHT INTO THE
HANDS OF THE SLAVES.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:01.230
Massavanna: THE SLAVES
PLANNED FOR A LONG TIME TO
BECOME MASTERS OF THE SHIP.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:05.330
OUR AIM WAS TO GO BACK
TO OUR OWN COUNTRY.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:07.630
Campbell: I THINK THAT
UNDERNEATH THE DECK,

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.300
THEY BELIEVED THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO TAKE OVER THE SHIP

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.760
BECAUSE THEY WERE FREE
MEN IN THEIR MENTALITY.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.730
THEY WERE NOT MENTALLY
ENSLAVED AT THAT POINT YET.

00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:22.600
THEY WERE STRONG MEN
THAT BELIEVED THAT THEY
WERE GOING TO BE FREE,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:29.100
EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IN
CHAINS AND IN SHACKLES.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.700
Massavanna: WE WERE ORDERED
TO WORK ON THE SHIP.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.200
WE OFTEN PULLED ROPES.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.200
WE WORKED WITH SAILS.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.030
Narrator: PUTTING THE SLAVES
TO WORK MAKES THE JOURNEY
EASIER FOR THE SAILORS,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.860
SOMETHING THEY
COULD GET USED TO.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.130
Muller: CRAUSE TOLD ME
IT WAS NOT DANGEROUS TO
UNSHACKLE THE SLAVES.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.560
FROM TIME TO TIME THEREAFTER,
MOST SLAVES WERE FREED.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:57.330
Boshoff: YOU'VE GOT ALL
THE AMMUNITION, IF YOU WILL,
FOR AN EXPLOSIVE SITUATION.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.760
ALL THE ELEMENTS ARE
THERE. BASICALLY, ALL YOU
NEEDED WAS A TRIGGER,

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.030
AND THAT TRIGGER WAS
SUPPLIED BY THE SENIOR
MERCHANT, FUNNY ENOUGH,

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.900
AND THE MAN WHO WAS THE
GREEDIEST OF THE LOT.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.930
Muller: IT WAS FEBRUARY 18.

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:16.130
SAILOR HERMAN COPES WAS
ORDERED TO FETCH THE ASSEGAIS
AND SWORDS TO BE CLEANED.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:21.760
Narrator: ASSEGAIS ARE
TRADITIONAL WEAPONS OF
WAR FROM MADAGASCAR--

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.730
SPEARS.

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.800
Boshoff: BUT WHAT THE
DUTCH OFTEN FORGOT,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.830
AND CERTAINLY IN THE CASE
OF THE MEERMIN STORY,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.630
IS THAT THE MADAGASCANS
WAS A WARLIKE PEOPLE,

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.830
SO YOU WOULD HAVE CHARACTERS
ON-BOARD THIS VESSEL

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:36.460
THAT INHERENTLY
WANTED TO BREAK FREE.

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:38.760
Massavanna: IT WAS MORNING.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.230
A SAILOR BROUGHT
THE ASSEGAIS TO US,

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.160
6 IN TOTAL.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.360
Boshoff: CRAUSE WAS
LAUGHING AND SAID, ''I'M
SURE THERE ARE PEOPLE

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.230
WHO WOULD DOUBT THE
WISDOM OF ASKING SLAVES
TO CLEAN THESE WEAPONS.''

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:54.530
Campbell: I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THEY ACTUALLY DID IT.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:26:01.060
I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU
GIVE SLAVES WEAPONS?

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.160
AT THAT POINT, THEY
DIDN'T THINK THAT THE
SLAVES WOULD DO IT

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.260
BECAUSE A SLAVE DOESN'T THINK.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.360
A SLAVE DOESN'T MAKE DECISIONS.

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:13.960
A SLAVE DOESN'T HAVE AN OPINION.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:19.000
A SLAVE IS PROPERTY.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.560
Massavanna: THE SLAVES HAD 4
ASSEGAIS IN OUR POSSESSION

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.360
WHEN THE BATTLE STARTED.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:30.400
WE ALL ATTACKED
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:36.360
[SLAVES CLAMORING]

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:43.830
Muller: SUDDENLY I HEARD
SCREAMING AND GROANING
OF SOME OF THE CREW.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:48.060
Massavanna: CRAUSE WAS STABBED
IN HIS CHEST AND ALSO HIS BELLY.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:57.200
HE FELL DOWN DEAD IMMEDIATELY.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.400
SEVERAL SAILORS FLED
INTO THE MAINTOP.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.960
3 OF THEM WERE THROWN OVERBOARD.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.930
Muller: THEN I STARTED
RUNNING TO THE CABIN.

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:10.600
I WAS THEN STABBED
ON MY LEFT SIDE.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.360
I RECEIVED ANOTHER
TWO STABS IN MY BACK.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:21.860
ALL THESE WOUNDS WERE
INFLICTED ON ME BY MASSAVANNA.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.400
Narrator: THE CAPTAIN
ISN'T SAFE IN HIS CABIN.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.330
THE SLAVES COULD BREAK THROUGH
THE DOOR AT ANY MOMENT,

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:31.260
SO HE CLIMBS OUT THE PORT WINDOW
AND SLIDES DOWN THE RUDDER

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:36.100

TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.230
TO BECOME MASTERS OF THE SHIP,

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.600

AT THE SEA A LONG TIME.

Campbell: I THINK HE ACTUALLY
DID SURPRISE HIMSELF.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:07.800
IN THAT FEW HOURS, HE
CONQUERED THE MIGHTY VOC,

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.130
AND HE TOOK OVER THAT SHIP.

ONLY A SACK OF POTATOES,

SOME RAW BACON, AND
A CASK OF PALM WINE

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:34.500
TO FORTIFY THEIR NERVES.

REGAIN CONTROL OF THEIR SHIP.

THERE'S VERY LITTLE SUPPLIES
IN THE AREA WHERE THEY ARE

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.630
BECAUSE MOST OF THE SUPPLIES
WOULD HAVE BEEN KEPT UP FRONT,

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.960
AND FOR THEM TO GET TO THAT,
THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO RUN

BUT THEY WEREN'T QUITE
FULLY IN CONTROL.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.830
THE REASON BEING THAT THEY WERE
NOW IN CHARGE OF A MACHINE

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.630
THAT THEY DIDN'T
KNOW HOW TO OPERATE,

BUT IT DOES GET THE

TO TELL THEM THAT THE SAILORS

WOULD BLOW UP THE WHOLE

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.360
BY SAILING--BY SAILING EAST,

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:00.330
BUT IN FACT, THEY SAIL
THE SHIP NORTHWEST,

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:04.000
AND THEREFORE THE SHIP'S GOING
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.430
Narrator: THE DECEPTION
IS A BREATHTAKING GAMBLE.

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:11.030
RETURNING TO MADAGASCAR
MEANT LOSING THE
VOC's PRECIOUS CARGO,

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:14.560
BUT SAILING TO CAPE TOWN
MIGHT MEAN LOSING THEIR LIVES

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.130
IF THEIR PLAN IS DISCOVERED.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.430
Worden: IT IS A
VERY RISKY STRATEGY.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.360
FIRST OF ALL, THEY REALLY
DON'T KNOW JUST HOW MUCH

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:26.530
THE SLAVES AND MASSAVANNA
WOULD KNOW ABOUT THE
CURRENTS AND WHERE THEY ARE.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.300
Narrator: THE NORTH-NORTHWEST
HEADING THE CAPTAIN SETS

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.030
WILL TAKE THE SHIP STRAIGHT TO
THE SOUTHERNMOST TIP OF AFRICA,

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:37.830
THE GRAVEYARD OF SHIPWRECKS.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:42.800
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE
BOSHOFF'S MAGNETOMETRY SURVEY.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.830
HE NOW HAS THE RESULTS.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.530
THIS BLUE BAND REPRESENTS
THE FLIGHT PATH

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.330
OF THE AIRCRAFT THAT
CARRIED THE MAGNETOMETERS,

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.200
AND WHAT IT SHOWS US
ARE THESE ANOMALIES,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.160
THE RED DOTS THAT YOU CAN SEE.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.160
LIKE THAT ONE FOR INSTANCE IS A
FISHING TRAWLER THAT WE KNOW OF.

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.800
WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING
ARE THE SMALLER ONES

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:03.260
THAT YOU CANNOT SEE
SO CLEARLY THAT ARE VERY
LIKELY TO BE THE MEERMIN

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.260
BECAUSE SHE WAS A
SMALLER SHIP AND WOODEN

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.860
AND HAS BROKEN UP OVER
THE YEARS OBVIOUSLY.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.230
SO WE ARE REALLY
INTERESTED IN THOSE.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:18.300
Narrator: OF COURSE THESE
SITES ARE ALL UNDERWATER.

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:20.130
BOSHOFF WANTS TO
SAIL OUT INTO THE BAY

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:26.530
TO SEE FOR HIMSELF WHERE THE
SLAVE SHIP DRAMA PLAYED OUT.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:31.660
10 DAYS AFTER THE MUTINY, THE
MEERMIN SAILS INTO VIEW OF LAND

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.900
NEAR THE DUTCH
SETTLEMENT OF STRUTSBAAI.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.160
MOST OF THE SLAVES
THINK THEY ARE HOME,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.830
BUT MASSAVANNA HAS DOUBTS.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:43.430
[SPEAKING MALAGASY]

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:45.000
Worden: BUT THEN, AS
IT'S DESCRIBED HERE,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.600
THE LEADER ASKS LEIJ
WHY HE HAD NOT TAKEN
THEM TO THEIR COUNTRY,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.730
AND HOW DID HE KNOW
THIS? WELL, HE KNEW THIS

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.800
BECAUSE THE SUN WASN'T
RISING IN HIS FACE.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.800
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY
WEREN'T FACING EAST

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.400
AS THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.360
AND LEIJ, WHO HAS BEEN RUMBLED
OF COURSE AT THIS POINT,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.760
WITH FAIRLY QUICK WITS
PERHAPS, SAID, WELL, THEY'RE

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.700
ON THE EAST SIDE OF MADAGASCAR.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.030
THEN THE LEADER POINTS
OUT SOMETHING ELSE.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:11.160
Muller: A NUMBER
OF BIRDS WERE SEEN,

00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:15.960
AND THE SLAVE SAID THAT
ONE COULDN'T FIND SUCH
BIRDS ON MADAGASCAR.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.700
AND LEIJ THEN COMES
UP WITH THIS ANSWER.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.660
''WELL, THESE ARE THE KINDS
OF BIRDS THAT ARE FOUND

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.600
''ON SMALL ISLANDS LYING
OFF THE COAST OF MADAGASCAR

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.030
''AND WERE TYPICAL TO THE ONES
WHICH WOULDN'T HAVEN'T BEEN

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.500
FOUND ON THE WEST COAST.''

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.860
I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT
THAT IF WE PUT OURSELVES

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.260
OR TRY TO PUT OURSELVES
IN THE MINDS OF THE SLAVES

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:35.030
AND OF MASSAVANNA, THEY
MIGHT HAVE REALIZED

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.960
OR SUSPECTED THAT
SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG HERE,

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.730
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, AT
LAST THEY'RE SEEING LAND,

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:42.360
AND THEY'RE HOPING
AGAINST HOPE THAT FREEDOM

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.100
IS GOING TO BE THEIRS AT LAST.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.830
Boshoff: ONE COULD PROBABLY
THINK OF THE MALAGASIES

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:50.560
ON THE SHIP THINKING THAT
THIS MIGHT BE MADAGASCAR

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.730
IN EXCITEMENT, YOU KNOW.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:58.500
FINALLY AFTER SO MANY DAYS
GETTING OFF THE STINKING TUB

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.500
AND BEING EXCITED.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.130
AND YOU HAVE THE SAILORS
IN THE OTHER SENSE

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.930
ALSO BEING EXCITED BUT
FOR A DIFFERENT REASON

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.030
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY'RE
AT THE CAPE AGULHAS,

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.600
AND THEY KNOW THAT SALVATION
IS AT HAND FOR THEM.

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.200
Narrator: DROPPING
ANCHOR A MILE OFFSHORE,

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.800
THE BELEAGUERED
MEERMIN WILL NOW DRAW

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.560
A NEW GROUP OF CHARACTERS
INTO ITS STORY.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.960
LOCAL FARMERS NOTICE THE
SHIP'S FLAG IS NOT FLYING,

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.300
A SIGN OF DISTRESS.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.700
A REPORT OF A SUSPECT
SHIP IS IMMEDIATELY SENT

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:31.830
TO THE VOC's HEAD OFFICIAL FOR
THE AREA JOHANNES LE SUEUR.

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.800
I THINK LE SUEUR, THE
MAGISTRATE IN STELLENBOSCH,

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.660
IS THE KEY FIGURE HERE.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:38.600
HE HAS TO GO THERE.

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.060
IT'S PART OF HIS DISTRICT,

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.900
THIS ENORMOUS DISTRICT
OF THE COLONY,

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.030
AND AGULHAS IS NOT CAPE TOWN.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:46.900
HE'S IN A VERY REMOTE
PART OF THE COLONY.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.030
THERE ARE NOT TROOPS AROUND HIM.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.830
SO HE'S ON HIS OWN THERE.

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.200
Narrator: LE SUEUR KNOWS HE MUST
CONTAIN THE SLAVE REBELLION.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.660
AFTER ALL, THE VOC IS
RUNNING A SLAVE SOCIETY.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:04.130
[SPEAKS DUTCH]

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:06.460
NEWS OF A SUCCESSFUL
SLAVE REVOLT

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.230
COULD SEND PANIC
THROUGH THE COLONY

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.260
AND EMPOWER MORE
SLAVES TO TAKE UP ARMS.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.100
Muller: THE NEXT MORNING,
THE SLAVES DEMANDED TO GO

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.730
TO THE SHORE IN A ROWBOAT.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.130
AS MANY AS POSSIBLE BOARDED.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:21.160
THE BOAT WOULD RETURN AFTER
THE SLAVES LANDED ASHORE.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.330

THE SLAVES WILL LIGHT

IF IT IS MADAGASCAR.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.630
NO. LEIJ'S PLAYING A
VERY CUNNING GAME HERE,

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.460
AND HE'S TRYING TO
OUTWIT THE SLAVES

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.430
AT THEIR OWN GAME, AS IT WERE,

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.060
BUT OF COURSE HE'S
A VERY DESPERATE MAN

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.360
BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT ONCE
THOSE SLAVES GET ASHORE

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.630
AND DISCOVER THEY'RE
NOT IN MADAGASCAR

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.200
AND IF THEY GET BACK TO THE
SHIP AND REPORT THAT BACK

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.430
TO MASSAVANNA AND THE
OTHERS, ALL HELL IS
GOING TO BREAK LOOSE

BREAK THROUGH THE HOLD

IN A RATHER CRAMPED HANDWRITING.

IS EXTREMELY ERRATIC,

AND IT'S A LETTER
OF DESPERATION.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:51.000
Man as Leij: THROUGH THE
GUIDANCE OF OUR ALMIGHTY
AND BELOVED GOD,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.530
THE 1 40 MALE AND FEMALE SLAVES
WHICH WE EXCHANGED AT MADAGASCAR

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.000
HAVE REVOLTED AND
TAKEN OVER THE MEERMIN.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.230
ABOUT 70 OF THEM WENT
ASHORE WITH THE BOAT,

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:06.460
BUT AT LEAST 50 HAVE
REMAINED ON BOARD.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.630
32 OF THE EUROPEANS
ARE STILL ALIVE,

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.700
BUT MOST OF THEM ARE WOUNDED.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.000
THE SLAVES ARE IN
CONTROL OF THE WHOLE SHIP

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.700
EXCEPT FOR THE GUN ROOM,
TO WHICH WE HAVE FLED.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:23.730
Worden: ONE OF THE MOST
EXTRAORDINARY THINGS

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.400
IN THIS EXTREMELY
EXTRAORDINARY CASE

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:36.530
IS THE STORY OF THIS BOTTLE
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT.

Leij: WE ARE SCARED THE
SLAVES MAY ATTACK AND
KILL US AT ANY MOMENT.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.560
WE CONTINUALLY PRAY TO
OUR LORD FOR HIS MERCY

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.900
AND THAT HE MAY RESCUE US
FROM OUR MISERABLE PLIGHT.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:52.860
THIS IS A MAN WHO IS
FACING THE FACT THAT HE'S
ABOUT TO MEET HIS MAKER.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.300
HE BELIEVES HE'S GONNA
DIE, AND HIS ONLY HOPE

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:59.400
IS TO BE ABLE TO HOPE THAT BY
THROWING THE BOTTLE OVERBOARD

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.660
SOMEBODY'S GONNA FIND
IT AND THE AUTHORITIES

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:10.960
ARE GONNA COME TO THEIR RESCUE.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.460
IF YOU WROTE THIS UP IN A
NOVEL, NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE IT,

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:22.230
BUT IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED,
AND IT HAPPENED LIKE THIS.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:26.330
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THE BOTTLE
IS FOUND BY THIS KHOI WOMAN

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.100
WHO IS OUT ON THE SHORE.

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.360
SHE TAKES IT TO
THE AUTHORITIES, AND
WHO'S THE AUTHORITY?

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:34.900
JUST HAPPENS TO BE THE LANDROST
OF STELLENBOSCH, WHO'S THERE.

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.930
Leij: ALTHOUGH WE TRUST
IN THE LORD TO SAVE US,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.860
WE KINDLY REQUEST THE FINDER
OF THIS LETTER TO LIGHT

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:44.530
3 FIRES ON THE BEACH AND STAND
GUARD AT THESE BEHIND THE DUNES

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:48.030
SHOULD THE SHIP RUN AGROUND SO
THAT THE SLAVES MAY NOT BECOME

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.830
AWARE THAT THIS IS
A CHRISTIAN COUNTRY.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.830
THEY WILL CERTAINLY KILL
US IF THEY ESTABLISH

00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:59.100
THAT WE MADE THEM BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS THEIR COUNTRY.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:05.100
IN THE NAME OF THE LORD, WE
REMAIN YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.730
HE'S GOT TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:14.000
EITHER WAY HE'S
TAKING A BIG RISK,

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.260
AND HE'S TAKING A RISK FOR,
IN THE ONE CASE PERHAPS,

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.260
THE FUTURE OF THE
COLONY, ONE MIGHT SAY,

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:25.300
CERTAINLY THE DANGERS OF
SLAVES RUNNING AMUCK ON LAND.

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:27.530
ON THE OTHER HAND,
HE RUNS THE RISK

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:31.700
OF LOSING THE CARGO,
LOSING THE SHIP,

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:34.030
AND I SUSPECT AS A RESULT
HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS JOB

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:35.800
AND PROBABLY A GREAT
DEAL MORE, AS WELL.

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.860
SO IN THE END, WHAT
DOES HE DECIDE TO DO?

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:56.230
HE TAKES THE RISK.
HE'LL LIGHT THE FIRES.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.800
Narrator: A WEEK AFTER
ARRIVING AT STRUTSBAAI,

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:06.960
THE SLAVES FINALLY SEE THE
SIGNAL THEY ARE WAITING FOR.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:12.000
HA HA! MADAGASCAR! HA HA HA!

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.330
Narrator: THEY ARE
EAGER TO GET ASHORE.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.760
THE WEATHER IS IN THEIR FAVOR.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.600
HIGH WINDS AND CURRENTS PUSH THE
SHIP CLOSER AND CLOSER TO SHORE.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.260
Muller: THE VESSEL DRIFTED
TOWARDS THE BEACH.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.200
TO AVOID DISASTER, IT WAS
DECIDED TO BEACH THE SHIP.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:31.060
IN STRONG SEAS, THE SHIP
WOULD HAVE BEEN SMASHED UP

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:36.000
AND NO SOULS WOULD
HAVE BEEN SAVED.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.700
WHEN THE SHIP TOUCHED
GROUND, I GAVE THE ORDER

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.300
TO CUT THE MAINMAST.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.830
Narrator: THE FIRST GROUP
OF SLAVES GOES ASHORE

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.330
IN THE ONE REMAINING ROWBOAT.

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:51.000
LE SUEUR POSITIONS
HIS HOMEGROWN MILITIA

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.100
OUT OF SIGHT BEHIND THE DUNES.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:56.660
HE HAS ORDERS FROM CAPE
TOWN TO RECAPTURE THE SLAVES

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.760
BUT NOT HARM THEM,

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:04.800
BUT HE QUICKLY LOSES CONTROL
OF THE NERVOUS FARMERS.

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:17.730
Muller: THEY WERE ATTACKED
NEAR THE DUNES AND SHOT AT.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:24.100
Narrator: FINALLY MASSAVANNA
AND HIS COUNTRY MEN REALIZE
THEY'VE BEEN DECEIVED.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:35.430
[SPEAKING MALAGASY]

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:38.860
HA HA HA! MADAGASCAR!

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.930
[SPEAKS MALAGASY]

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.800
Narrator: THEY KNOW THEY
WILL NEVER RETURN HOME.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.230
I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A MOMENT OF DISTRESS,

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:55.300
A MOMENT OF PAIN KNOWING
THAT THIS IS THE END,

00:43:55.300 --> 00:44:03.460
THAT ''I'M GOING TO BE TAKEN.''

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.300
Narrator: 19 DAYS AFTER
TAKING OVER THE MEERMIN,

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:34.260
MASSAVANNA AND HIS COUNTRYMEN
GIVE UP THEIR STRUGGLE.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.400
THEY ARE TAKEN TO
CAPE TOWN IMMEDIATELY.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:45.200
THE MEERMIN IS LEFT BEHIND
TO SINK INTO THE OCEAN.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.760
FURIOUS ABOUT THEIR
FINANCIAL LOSS,

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:55.400
THE VOC COURT OF JUSTICE
PUTS BOTH THE SLAVE LEADERS
AND THE SAILORS ON TRIAL.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.800
THE VOC HAS A SEVERE PUNISHMENT

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.760
FOR ANY SLAVE WHO
ATTACKS HIS MASTER--

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.830
DEATH BY IMPALEMENT ON A STAKE.

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:17.960
[SCREAMING]

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:22.000
THE END OF THE TRIAL--
THIS RECORD THAT WE'VE
GOT OF ALL THE TRIAL,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.560
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT THE
RESULT OF THIS WOULD BE

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:30.530
THAT MASSAVANNA WOULD
RECEIVE THE MOST GRUESOME
KIND OF DEATH SENTENCE,

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:34.200
WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED
TO SLAVES WHO REVOLTED
AGAINST THEIR OWNERS

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.130
OR AGAINST THE COMPANY,

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:39.430
AND YOU WOULD ALSO
EXPECT THAT MULLER,

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:41.630
WHO'S ALSO PUT ON
TRIAL FOR NEGLIGENCE,

00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:45.200
WOULD PERHAPS HAVE GOT A MILD
PUNISHMENT OR A TICKING OFF,

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.060
BUT IT'S REALLY MASSAVANNA
WHO WOULD HAVE GOT

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.660
THE FULL FORCE OF THE LAW.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.830
ABSOLUTELY THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS.

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:57.900
Narrator: GERRIT MULLER
IS STRIPPED OF HIS
CAPTAIN'S RANK AND WAGES

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.100
AND FORBIDDEN FROM
SERVING IN THE VOC

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.700
FOR THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:07.030
HE IS BANNED FROM THE CAPE
AND PUT ON THE FIRST SHIP
RETURNING TO AMSTERDAM,

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.430
ON WHICH HE MUST
WORK FOR HIS PASSAGE.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:15.960
HE IS FINED ONE MONTH'S
WAGES AND ORDERED TO PAY
THE COSTS OF THE CASE.

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:23.630
AND DESPITE ALL
HIS EFFORTS, OLAF LEIJ IS
ALSO FIRED FROM THE VOC.

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:25.130
AS ASSISTANT CHIEF MERCHANT,

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:31.060
HE WAS EXPECTED TO HAVE
OBEYED COMPANY RULES.

00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:34.200
Worden: ALL THROUGH THE
TRIAL, MASSAVANNA DENIES SOME

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.960
OF THE KEY THINGS THAT
HE'S BEEN ACCUSED OF.

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:38.660
I GET THE SENSE OF HIM
AS A VERY FORCEFUL MAN.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.260
LOOK AT THESE ANSWERS HE GIVES
TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.130
YOU KNOW, IT'S SORT OF,
''IS IT NOT THE CASE

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:46.160
''THAT YOU HAD
PLANNED TO DO THIS

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:48.300
AND TO ATTACK THE EUROPEANS?''

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.460
''NO!'' EXCLAMATION
MARK, YOU KNOW.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.760
DEFIANT. HE'S FORCEFUL--

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.060
DEFIANT. EXACTLY.

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.930
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
FOR THE COURT TO HAVE

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:59.000
ENOUGH DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE
TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE HIM.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.230
IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU HAD SOMEBODY

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.960
WHO COULD PROVIDE
DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.860
AGAINST SOMEONE IN A TRIAL,

00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.600
WHO WERE HONORABLE
MEN, TRUSTWORTHY MEN.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.730
THERE WEREN'T MANY OF THESE
AROUND IN THIS TRIAL,

00:47:09.730 --> 00:47:15.330
SO REALLY THE COMPANY IS CAUGHT
IN ITS OWN LEGAL LAWS HERE.

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:16.460
THESE ARE ARE THE
WORDS THEY USE--

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.630
[SPEAKS LATIN]

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.060
THEY HAVEN'T GOT
DEFINITIVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.500
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PASS
A DEATH SENTENCE ON HIM,

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.460
AND INSTEAD THEY ARE GOING
TO PLACE HIM PROVISIONALLY--

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:32.760
THEY'RE GOING TO BAN
HIM TO ROBBEN ISLAND.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:34.600
WHAT I THINK IS
PARTICULARLY MOVING

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:41.860
IS THAT HE SIGNS RIGHT
AT THE END HERE. THERE.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.100
HE SIGNS WITH HIS
MARK, HIS CROSS.

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.000
HE MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.830
THIS IS THE ONE MARK
IN THIS HUGE ARCHIVE

00:47:49.830 --> 00:48:01.160
WHICH MASSAVANNA HIMSELF
LEFT DIRECTLY ON THE PAGE.

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.260
Narrator: MASSAVANNA'S
STORY DOESN'T END HERE.

00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.700
NIGEL WORDEN HAS DISCOVERED
ONE MORE DOCUMENT

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:11.060
IN THE VAST VOC ARCHIVE.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.900
SO THESE ARE THE REGISTERS

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.360
WHO WERE SENT TO
ROBBEN ISLAND,

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.030
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
THIS IS IN 1 776,

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:18.500
SO JUST AFTER HIS TRIAL.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.860
''MASSAVANNA FROM MADAGASCAR,

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:24.460
SENTENCE AT THE CAPE ON
THE 25th OF AUGUST,''

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.160
AND THERE HE IS.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:28.100
IT SAYS--SEE HERE THE
PEOPLE WHO'D ARRIVED,

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:29.530
AND THERE'S MASSAVANNA TOGETHER

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:31.660
WITH KOESAAIJ,
THE TWO OF THEM.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.100
WHAT TO ME IS THE MOVING PART,

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.760
IT GIVES THE DETAILS
OF EVERYBODY ELSE,

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.830
OF HOW LONG THEY'VE BEEN
SENTENCED FOR ON THE ISLAND--

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:39.300
5 YEARS, 15 YEARS--

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:40.630
BUT FOR MASSAVANNA
AND KOESAAIJ,

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:44.230
IT SAYS, ''PUT ON THE ISLAND
UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.''

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:47.300
SO THEY'RE DUMPED THERE
AT THE MERCY OF THE COURT

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.730
TO DECIDE HOW LONG
THEY'RE GONNA STAY THERE.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:51.900
THERE'S NO TERMINATION TO THIS.

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.930
Massavanna: IN OUR COUNTRY
IF SOMEBODY KILLS A PERSON,

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.230
THE KING WILL FINE THE MURDERER.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:05.230
I AM AN IMPRISONED
MAN AND ONLY A SLAVE,

00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:12.360
AND YOU CAN DO WITH
ME WHAT YOU WANT.

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.900
Narrator: FOR CENTURIES,
ROBBEN ISLAND WAS USED

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.460
TO IMPRISON TROUBLESOME
REBEL LEADERS,

00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:22.100
INCLUDING ITS MOST FAMOUS
RESIDENT NELSON MANDELA.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:25.100
MASSAVANNA WAS IN GOOD COMPANY.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:29.530
AND THEN 4 YEARS LATER,
WE GET THE NEWS HERE

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:35.600
THAT MASSAVANNA HAS DIED ON
THE 20th OF DECEMBER 1 769.

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.860
JUST OVER 3 YEARS HE
LIVED ON THE ISLAND

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.400
AND THEN DIED AS
A COMPANY SLAVE.

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:45.130
Narrator: ROBBEN ISLAND
WAS WHERE PEOPLE WERE
SENT TO BE FORGOTTEN,

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:48.760
BUT MASSAVANNA'S MEMORY AS
A FREEDOM FIGHTER LIVES ON.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.630
IT DOES SHOW PEOPLE
THAT THE RESISTANCE

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:54.930
TO OPPRESSION IS
NOT A NEW THING.

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:57.000
IT'S PART OF HISTORY.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.100
Narrator: IT'S WHAT
KEEPS BOSHOFF SEARCHING

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:02.200
FOR THE WRECK OF THE MEERMIN.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.830
Boshoff: SOMEONE ASKED A FAMOUS
MOUNTAINEER AT ONE STAGE

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:05.860
''WHY DO YOU CLIMB MOUNTAINS?''

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:07.260
AND HE SAID, ''BECAUSE
IT'S THERE.''

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.830
AND I THINK IT'S
IN A SENSE SIMILAR.

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.030
I THINK THE WRECK IS
THERE. I NEED TO FIND IT.

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:16.500
Narrator: HE IS NOW READY
TO BEGIN THE NEXT PHASE
OF THE MEERMIN STORY,

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:19.000
TO FIND THE WRECK ITSELF.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.630
AS FOR THE VOC, IT
WENT BANKRUPT IN 1 798

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:27.630
DUE TO RAMPANT CORRUPTION.

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:31.660
FOR LUCY CAMPBELL, MASSAVANNA'S
MUTINY WAS A TRIUMPH.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.500
HE NEVER MADE IT HOME,
BUT HE DID DESTRO Y THE
SLAVE SHIP MEERMIN.

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:37.600
Campbell, voice-over:
THE FACT THAT THAT BOAT,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.900
THE MEERMIN WILL NEVER,
EVER SAIL AGAIN FOR
ME IS A CELEBRATION,

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.100
THAT THEY WILL NEVER
CARRY HUMAN CARGO,

00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:48.800
THAT THE MEERMIN IS A WRECK.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.030
Narrator: MASSAVANNA'S
CO-LEADER KOESAAIJ SURVIVED

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.560
20 YEARS HERE.

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:56.200
BOTH MEN ARE BURIED
ON ROBBEN ISLAND.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.560
Campbell: I WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER,

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.360
BUT THERE ARE SO
MANY UNMARKED GRAVES.

00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.230
IT COULD BE ANY ONE,

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:05.560
BUT FOR ME THE
MEMORY OF MASSAVANNA

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.930
WILL ALWAYS LIVE ON

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:09.630
BECAUSE I'VE GOTTEN
TO KNOW MASSAVANNA,

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.730
AND THIS MEMORY
I WILL CARRY OVER

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.230
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:15.830
FOR ME, HE IS HERE SOMEWHERE,

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:25.530
AND FOR ME, HE'S AMONGST
THE HEROES OF ALL HEROES.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:29.430
IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT
HUMAN BEINGS THERE THERE IS

00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:42.460
SOMETHING IN US THAT REFUSES TO
BE REGARDED AS LESS THAN HUMAN.

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.830
