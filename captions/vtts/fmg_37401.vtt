00:00:00.000 --> 00:01:04.250



00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.980

        When I met Angel, I was 14.


00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.220

        When I turned 15, he came to my
        house to ask for permission
      

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.480

        to be with me, and my mom
        said a definite no.
      

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.590

        After I turned 16 and I decided
        to marry him, I wanted
      

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.890

        to be with him for a lot
        of different reasons.
      

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.460

        To start, I thought I was
        expected to marry him because
      

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.110

        I was intimate with
        him before, right?
      

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.670

        So in our culture, it just
        doesn't seem right to be with
      

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.090

        somebody and then end the
        relationship or something.
      

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.550

        It's something to last and
        forever to keep, right?
      

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.210

        Has Daddy ever hit you
        in the stomach
      

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.830

        when you were pregnant?


00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.300

        Why do you want to know that?


00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.400

        How did you feel?


00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.010

        Why do you want to know that?


00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.260

        Because.


00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.620



00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.550

        How did I feel?


00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.300

        Well, I felt hurt and angry.


00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.960

        And I felt double guilt because
        I was allowing him to
      

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:18.100

        hurt me and I was allowing him
        to injure the pregnancy.
      

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.800

        If I ever did say, you know,
        I'm pregnant, like just
      

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.230

        please, right?


00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.480

        He said, well, why do I care?


00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.450

        That baby's probably
        not even mine.
      

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.660

        And it was like this, not
        only with my first son.
      

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.950

        It was like this throughout my
        three other pregnancies.
      

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.380



00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.980

        Did you ever feel scared?


00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.290

        It was something that
        was uncertain.
      

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.620

        I didn't know when.


00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.460

        We would have problems. It was
        very often so it really didn't
      

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.920

        give me a chance to miss it.


00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.820

        But yeah, it was scary
        sometimes.
      

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.860

        If I did have a thing that I
        thought or I'd considered he
      

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.490

        would think is wrong, I knew
        what was happening to me.
      

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.590

        I knew it was going to happen
        and I was always threatened.
      

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.400

        I always thought or felt that I
        had to do what he told me or
      

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.950

        else I would get hit.


00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.130

        Did you ever think that he would
        think of killing you?
      

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:32.090



00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.580

        [NODS HEAD AFFIRMATIVELY]


00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.080

        What did you do?


00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.070



00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.740

        What did I do or
        what did he do?
      

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.140

        What did you do?


00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.020

        What did I do?


00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.000

        Yeah.


00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.820

        I always stayed thinking that--
        I didn't believe he
      

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.350

        would, but I was taken to
        the hospital two times.
      

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:01.940



00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.000

        So it's really dumb sometimes.


00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.020

        You know that the threat
        is there, but you
      

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.270

        don't listen to it.


00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.480



00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.280

        OK, Ruby, do you want
        to stop it now?
      

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.040

        Just think of more things
        to talk about
      

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.270

        and we'll do it after.


00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.870

        Yeah?


00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.910

        OK.


00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.540

        Hi, everybody.


00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.120

        We're in the car because
        we couldn't
      

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.600

        do it inside yesterday.


00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.140

        But the funny thing is what I
        was going to tell you is that
      

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.360

        your dad would be nice in
        front of everybody.
      

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.320

        Most of the times, he was
        always happy, smiling.
      

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.060

        Maybe it's hard for them to
        picture him hitting me.
      

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.410

        I don't know because more and
        more, a lot of times they saw
      

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.250

        bruises, and they know that
        I went to the hospital two
      

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.770

        times, so it's not like they're
        ignorant to all this,
      

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.620

        but maybe they just didn't want
        to believe it and they
      

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.830

        wanted to blame me
        for how things.
      

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.840

        On September 28, 2002, that's
        the last incident, and that
      

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.610

        was after we got
        back together.
      

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.260

        That was the first time
        he touched me.
      

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.650

        He hit me, and I couldn't
        take it.
      

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.260

        And he forced me out
        of the apartment.
      

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.340

        My son was sleeping in the
        bedroom, and he wouldn't let
      

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.000

        me back in.


00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.180

        And my cousins were inside.


00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.380

        They were, you know, obviously
        very scared.
      

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.700

        They had never seen things
        like this, right?
      

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.080

        Then one of my cousins said to
        him to relax, to calm down.
      

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.580

        Nothing was happening,
        you know?
      

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.460

        So he kicked them out of
        the apartment as well.
      

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.360

        So all five of us were outside
        and he wouldn't let me come
      

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.250

        back in the apartment.


00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.070

        I just begged him to let
        me go in to get my son.
      

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.150

        And I kept on putting my
        leg to not let him
      

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.670

        fully close the door.


00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.310

        You know, because we lived
        on the eighth floor.
      

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.500

        I figured he's too angry.


00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.030

        He could do anything
        to the baby, right?
      

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.620

        Things just came to my mind.


00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.570

        And that's what I kept
        on asking him.
      

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.570

        Just let me get the
        baby outside.
      

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.440

        Just let me take him.


00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.380

        And he wouldn't.


00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.640

        So one of the neighbors said
        to me, are you OK?
      

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.020

        Do you want to use my phone
        to call the police?
      

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.340

        And I was just in the
        hallway by the
      

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.570

        elevators of the building.


00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.430

        I saw him coming out
        with my son in his
      

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.480

        arms. My son was sleeping.


00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.260

        I said to him, I said I already
        called the police.
      

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.710

        They're on their way now.


00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.780

        If you want to leave, leave, but
        you're not taking my son.
      

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.660

        If you want to kill me for
        this, I don't care.
      

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.350

        And when I mentioned to him that
        I had called the police,
      

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.800

        I figured he'd relax himself
        a little bit.
      

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.580

        And yes, he did give
        me my son.
      

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.140

        From the time that I knew he was
        out and that I had called
      

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.040

        the police, I knew he
        wouldn't be back.
      

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.600

        I knew it.


00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.890

        And I felt relief.


00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.660

        Everybody, this is the person
        doing my interview.
      

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.310

        This is one of my prides.


00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.250

        It's not even on.


00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.440

        Are you sure?


00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.560

        [LAUGHS]


00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.460

        I'm scared that he's going to
        take them to El Salvador.
      

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.290

        This is one thing that he kept
        on saying to me, maybe to
      

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:18.240

        scare me off and to make me
        scared and go back with him.
      

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.820

        And he kept on telling me that
        he was going to take my kids
      

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.730

        and bring them to his mother
        in El Salvador.
      

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.760

        How do you feel about Mommy
        and Daddy separating?
      

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.400



00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:39.630

        Well, I kind of feel good
        because she's happy, but then
      

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.880

        at the same time,
        I miss my dad.
      

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.150

        We don't hardly see him, because
        he says that he's
      

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:49.850

        always really busy and stuff.


00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.710



00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.180

        The only thing that hurts
        me is my kids.
      

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:05.970



00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.340

        I would do anything for them.


00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.550



00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.440

        Sometimes I feel like going back
        to him when I see them.
      

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.690

        They miss him.


00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:19.560



00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.420

        He doesn't come and see them.


00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.170

        And sometimes they feel
        guilty for it.
      

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.510

        I mean, I feel guilty
        because, you know.
      

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.800



00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.330

        So when I tell you, like I
        wanted them to grow up with
      

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.840

        him, because he was
        a good dad.
      

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.960

        I'm not going to say--
        he never abused them.
      

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.570

        No, nothing.


00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.150

        He was a good father.


00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.400

        So I thought maybe I should
        have taken it for them.
      

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.720

        Maybe I should've just stayed,
        and they wouldn't have to go
      

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.970

        through this.


00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.850



00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.450

        What is your message
        to these kids?
      

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.700

        What can you tell them?


00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.220



00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:05.560

        Tell their parents if they
        could stop fighting.
      

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.590

        If the next day, and the next
        day, and the next day, and the
      

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:12.890

        next day, and the next day the
        dad keeps on hurting the mom,
      

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.480

        ask the mom to separate
        and to not be scared.
      

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:26.860

        And if you're still little,
        I don't know.
      

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.270

        You can't do anything.


00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:32.750



00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.420

        But if you're big, you can.


00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.920



00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.070

        But then if you try to get them
        together again, you're
      

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:48.580

        just wasting your time telling
        your mom to get separated.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:10:22.790



00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:27.280

        Mom, I have some questions for
        you regarding your marriage
      

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.510

        because of all the abuse you
        were getting from my dad.
      

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:36.350

        Can you tell me a little bit
        about how you met Dad?
      

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.300

        There's just one more thing
        around these questions.
      

00:10:39.300 --> 00:11:28.190



00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.770

        When did you and dad
        start to fight?
      

00:11:30.770 --> 00:12:30.140



00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.160

        If you were still fighting with
        dad before marriage, then
      

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.540

        why would you marry him?


00:12:35.540 --> 00:13:24.550



00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.550

        Did grandpa saw when
        you'd get hurt?
      

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.670

        Oh, yeah.


00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.790

        Many times, Shaan.


00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.040

        Many times.


00:13:33.040 --> 00:14:04.140



00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.330

        Did Dad ever try to get help?


00:14:06.330 --> 00:15:41.900



00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.700

        When you moved from the shelter
        to the apartment now
      

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.930

        to our brand new home, what
        challenges did you face
      

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:50.840

        raising me and Gurjis?


00:15:50.840 --> 00:16:56.290



00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.410

        My counselor is like
        a family to me.
      

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.560

        We are family now.


00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.490

        So it's not that I just receive
        formal help, which is
      

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.900

        as required to complete this
        paperwork, that paperwork.
      

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.770

        But in part to deal with the
        loneliness and day-to-day
      

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.040

        operations.


00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.470

        A lot is required.


00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.470

        Not everyone has that.


00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:19.030

        No.


00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:19.970

        No.


00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.660

        One of the things that I find
        interesting is, you see, often
      

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:27.390

        within the mainstream community
        the whole issue of
      

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.970

        wife abuse is looked on purely
        as if this is a cultural
      

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:31.770

        phenomenon.


00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:35.440

        As if in diverse cultures
        that this is the norm.
      

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.590

        That this is what is
        happening to abused
      

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.180

        women in their culture.


00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.210

        So somehow in South Asian
        culture and black culture and
      

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.390

        Hispanic culture, what these men
        do to these women-- and I
      

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:49.830

        look at from a totally different
        point of view.
      

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.260

        These are in all cultures,
        in all religions, in all
      

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.370

        socioeconomic strata, whether
        someone is well educated,
      

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.880

        someone is not well educated.


00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.560

        There are individuals that
        through their learned behavior
      

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.420

        have decided to behave towards
        another human being in a
      

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.090

        particular fashion.


00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:16.080

        So how in different cultures
        is violence against women
      

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.380

        taken care of whether they
        are in villages or
      

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.780

        whether they aren't.


00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:22.720

        And my take on it was
        that there is
      

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.290

        much more family support.


00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.680

        There is much more support from
        the brothers, from the
      

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.380

        relatives, from even--


00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.560

        Even neighborhoods.


00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.760

        --even the neighbors because
        everybody makes sure that it
      

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.610

        is everybody's business.


00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:39.380

        Is the chicken done?


00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.020

        If it's burning, I'm not
        going to eat it.
      

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.530

        You need to.


00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.480

        One of the things which then
        becomes an issue is how do
      

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:51.710

        police expect our women
        to call 9-1-1?
      

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:53.850

        From my experience-- I can
        speak only from my
      

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.070

        experience-- I never called.


00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.610

        I've been through a lot of
        difficult time in my life.
      

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:03.910

        Not even for a single minute I
        think that calling 9-1-1 is an
      

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:05.510

        option for me.


00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:10.000

        Most of the women are now--
        immigrant women-- are saying
      

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.270

        is that we would like the
        abuse to end and not the
      

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.090

        marriage to end.


00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:18.880

        So perhaps they are scared that
        if the police arrest my
      

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.280

        husband, there is no chance
        in hell for us to
      

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.520

        then get back together.


00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.280

        So how can-- from an immigrant
        woman's experience-- can the
      

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.430

        police intervention or judicial
        system help an
      

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:32.410

        immigrant woman?


00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:37.570

        I think the system can provide
        some more community-based,
      

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.340

        culturally appropriate service
        in their own community, which
      

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.000

        is available to women when
        women need help.
      

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.930

        That's what I see.


00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.390

        It's not the question of a
        service between 8:30 to 4:30.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.940



00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.360

        Even born here, guys I went to
        high school with, that I've
      

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.410

        known since kindergarten, they
        want their wives to stay at

        home, cook and clean, all
        that kind of stuff.
      

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.240

        I think they have sometimes even
        a worse mentality than
      

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.150

        people who were born
        elsewhere.
      

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:04.930

        Or they want to go to India
        because they know they can
      

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.500

        take advantage of their wives.


00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.870

        So eventually, I went to check
        the door, and there were cops.
      

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.280

        They told me that my wife
        pressed charges
      

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.530

        against me for assault.


00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:34.850

        So I told them, assault?


00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:35.760

        What do you mean by assault?


00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.480

        I pushed her.


00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.830

        They told me in Canadian
        law, that's assault.
      

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:44.080

        When we did put you in
        jail, we just needed
      

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.290

        time away from you.


00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.120

        We didn't want you
        to go to jail.
      

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.250

        Can I come in?

        Sorry about the interruption,
        everybody.
      

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.900

        We didn't want to hurt you.


00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.400

        We just wanted some
        time alone.
      

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.480

        But when they told us that you
        were supposed to be in jail
      

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.470

        for 11 days, we didn't
        want to.
      

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.030

        We tried to negotiate.


00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.000

        We tried to negotiate really
        hard, trust me.
      

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.020

        And when I found out that you
        got handcuffed, I was really
      

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.250

        hurt, because you're not a
        criminal and you're not a bad

        met the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

        We got the good side back.


00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.800

        The main thing I learned
        from him is I had to
      

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.010

        accept what I did.


00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.430

        It's not I can't.

        I can.

        this thing, you know what?

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.950

        she's the homemaker.
      

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:57.900

        But on the contrary, she's also
        a part of breadwinning.

        so I get mad.
      

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.500

        When I get mad, I
        lose my control.
      

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.490

        When I lose my control,
        there's a violence.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:18.410

        I went upstairs with my card,

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:23.460

        we're playing African music,
        and chopping up okra, and

        I go into the family room and

        think you're a man.

        music was coming from.


00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.860

        you've got balls, come
      

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.190

        plug it back in.

        lift off the ground, I lifted
        and fell onto the couch, face
      

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.090

        down on the couch.


00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:27.310

        And he jumped on top of
        me, straddled me.
      

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:32.510

        He had one hand on the back of
        my head and the other one in
      

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.070

        the back of my-- the back of my
        neck and on the back of my
      

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:40.220

        head, and he was suffocating
        me in the couch.
      

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:43.560

        I could hear the screaming
        from afar.

        He's screaming, I'm
        going to kill you.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.900

        I was punched.


00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:00.020

        I was kicked by him.


00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:08.610

        My eldest, who was 15 at the
        time, would jump in front of
      

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.690

        him when he'd go to hit.

        her pulling him off and getting
        in front of me, he
      

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.310

        would have done it.


00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.670

        He would have killed me because
        that was what he
      

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:39.810

        intended to do.

        Leave it running.


00:32:55.090 --> 00:33:01.100

        And at one point, he told her
        that if she interferes again,
      

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.600

        he's going to crack her skull.


00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.820



00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.450

        But it didn't stop her, because
        every time he came at
      

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.770

        me, she would jump
        in front of him.
      

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.760

        I don't know why you feel
        uncomfortable with it.
      

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.060

        I'm honoring you.


00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.050

        I want you to stop
        it right now.
      

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:17.810

        I'm honoring you.


00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:18.760

        I'm going to stop it.


00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:18.970

        OK.


00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.070

        Stop it.


00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:22.950

        Mom, I don't like--


00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:30.450

        My eldest daughter did an
        interview with me and it moved
      

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:38.810

        me in ways that I didn't
        think I would be moved.
      

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.240

        If you feel someone's done
        something bad to you, me,
      

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.500

        personally, I'm not going
        to just stick around.
      

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.650

        If my hand's on a hot iron,
        I'm not going to leave it
      

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:48.610

        there because I know I'm
        going to get a scar.
      

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:51.700

        It isn't as clear-cut as putting
        your hand on a hot
      

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.860

        iron, getting burnt, and
        instinctively removing it.
      

00:33:54.860 --> 00:34:01.800

        Every instinct is to defend
        yourself and to get away from
      

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.640

        harm's way.


00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:06.960

        But understanding the psychology
        of abuse and the
      

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.550

        abuser, it's about layers.


00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:17.920

        It takes years of gradual
        wearing down somebody to such
      

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.100

        a stage you don't even recognize
        the difference
      

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.040

        between your hand
        and the iron.
      

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.090

        I thought that when you
        love somebody, right?
      

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:31.340

        When you love someone, that
        you are to forgive them.
      

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:38.420

        When you love somebody,
        love is all consuming.
      

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.250

        It would help him.


00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.910

        If I showed him that even with
        all the weaknesses that he was
      

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:48.850

        demonstrating, even with all the
        physical assaults, if he
      

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.780

        could understand that I loved
        him no matter what, then he
      

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:58.200

        would know that I was a good
        person, and he would somehow
      

00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.230

        love me back.


00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:01.460

        If you say that this has
        happened to you again and
      

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:06.110

        again and again, I just don't
        understand exactly why you
      

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.470

        would stay.


00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.610

        I think that's why-- that's
        where my idea of you being
      

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:10.860

        weak comes from.


00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.310



00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:15.170

        I guess that is a sign
        of weakness.
      

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.840



00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.490

        She's angry at me and
        I recognize that.
      

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:21.980

        She's angry at her dad.


00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.120

        Apart from all the teenage angst
        that a 17-year-old, has,
      

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:34.240

        but to complicate their lives
        with this degree of hostility.
      

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.490

        I wasn't angry at you.


00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:41.820

        I guess, just disappointed,
        I don't know.
      

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.430

        Disappointed how?


00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.610

        Well, if I'm in a situation
        where I'm-- what's happening
      

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.880

        to me I'm not comfortable with,
        I wouldn't just stay
      

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:54.080

        there and not do anything
        about it.
      

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.770

        So you believe that I
        stayed and didn't do
      

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.490

        anything about it?


00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:57.400

        Well, look, that's
        not believe.
      

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.650

        That's just a fact.


00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.790



00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:09.520

        When she was asking me the
        questions and I realized that
      

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:14.830

        if I didn't work on myself, then
        I would be failing not
      

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:23.240

        just her and her sister, but
        myself and other women.
      

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:28.500

        So part of me working on myself
        is to be honest with
      

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.990

        her, is to be honest
        with myself.
      

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:37.590

        Part of me helping my
        kids-- oh, sorry.
      

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.840

        Just hold on one second.


00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:45.160



00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.410

        I said I wasn't going to cry.


00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:53.010



00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.340

        The justice system needs
        a lot of work.
      

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:02.930

        He was given 60 days house
        arrest, effectively.
      

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.950



00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:12.540

        For what he did, 60 days.


00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:18.550

        My son for three months was
        wetting the bed, three months
      

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.390

        after this happened.


00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:31.440

        Do you worry about becoming
        violent as a result of what
      

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.720

        you experienced?


00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:39.140

        In the beginning, I guess I
        worried a lot because I had a
      

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:43.850

        lot of emotions.


00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.720

        I had a lot of emotions.


00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.880

        I didn't know how to
        decipher them.
      

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.330

        And actually, I was a little
        bit worried about becoming
      

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.640

        like him, but then when I
        would get irritated more
      

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.780

        easily [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE],


00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.770

        I'd worry that I was
        becoming angrier.
      

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:10.690

        Do you think your brother
        will beat up women?
      

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:10.980

        No.


00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:11.700

        Why not?


00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.680

        Because he has lots of girls
        in the house already.
      

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.860

        He has lots of girls
        in the house.
      

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.010

        He has lots and lots of
        girls in the house.
      

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.660

        So no, he's not beating
        up any woman.
      

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.010

        Plus he's always cuddled,
        isn't he?
      

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:23.440

        Yeah.


00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.200

        And we tell him we love
        him, don't we?
      

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:29.010

        Mom?


00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:29.460

        Mm-hm?


00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.360

        But Dad wasn't actually just
        beating you up all
      

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.140

        the time, was he?


00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.190

        Actually, he beat me up
        a lot of the time.
      

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.590

        All the time?


00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.940

        It wasn't every day.


00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:45.400

        He wouldn't come home every
        day and pow-pow-pow.
      

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.460

        But he beat me up a
        lot of the time.
      

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.020

        For years, I was silent.


00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:55.750

        For years, I kept his secret.


00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:01.090

        For years, everybody who knew
        us saw this perfect family:
      

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:04.920

        affluent, intelligent,
        articulate, bright children,
      

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.510

        wonderful husband.


00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:11.180

        Mom, how do you think
        Dad feels?
      

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:16.770

        How do you think that Dad feels
        about you hitting him?
      

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.200

        About me hitting him?


00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.950

        What you did to him in this
        [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?
      

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:33.840

        Well, I didn't attack him.


00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.960

        The time's I scratched him,
        I was trying to defend--
      

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.900

        To get him off of you?


00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:39.600

        That's right.


00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.850

        I was trying to defend myself.


00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:44.310



00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.570

        I don't fight him.


00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.340

        I didn't fight him that day.


00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:53.570

        And I think he knows that,
        but what he says
      

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:54.820

        is something else.


00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:02.180



00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:10.010

        I'm disappointed that we're
        here today, right?
      

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:15.660

        This isn't the life that I
        had wanted for myself.
      

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.900



00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.320

        This isn't the relationship
        that I had wanted.
      

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:27.400



00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.950

        And it isn't about
        fairy tales.
      

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.200

        It really isn't.


00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.340



00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.700

        I just wanted to be happy.


00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.670

        Mom, if you were the Government,
        would you change
      

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.870

        that thing about men
        beating up women?
      

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.660

        If I was the Government?


00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:49.810

        Yeah, the president of
        this whole country.
      

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:50.740

        The prime minister.


00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.120

        Yeah, prime minister.


00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.440

        Well, yes.


00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:00.200

        You know this women's institute
        that I'm running,
      

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.760

        well, that's what we're trying
        to do is to talk to the
      

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.490

        Government, and talk to women,
        and talk to the police, and
      

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.500

        talk to lawyers, so that
        everybody works together to
      

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.820

        help stop violence against
        women, right?
      

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.780

        Because it affects
        everybody, right?
      

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.400

        Yeah.


00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.400

        Were you affected when
        I was beaten up?
      

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:24.690

        Well, actually, I was actually
        quite scared.
      

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.010

        I know, my darling.


00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:28.380

        You were very, very scared.


00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.820

        But you were very brave,
        as well, right?
      

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.270

        Mm-hm.


00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:32.190

        Mm-hm.


00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.730

        I had already received an
        undergraduate degree in law
      

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:37.910

        from University College
        Cardiff.
      

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.220

        And when the divorce proceedings
        started, I decided
      

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:46.720

        to enroll here at Osgoode Hall
        to do my masters in law, and
      

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:50.520

        that was one of the best
        decisions I made because it
      

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.360

        brought me back into the legal
        profession in a way that I've
      

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.800

        been able to utilize in the
        work that I'm doing now.
      

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.260

        Even you as a seven year
        old, almost eight,
      

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.610

        you know your rights.


00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.390

        And when somebody's doing
        something that's wrong, what
      

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:10.240

        do you say to them?


00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.200

        That ain't right?


00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.170

        That ain't right.


00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:13.650

        That's a good thing
        to say to them.
      

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.550

        You tell them that's wrong.


00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.720

        And then you go-- are
        you listening?
      

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.140

        Yeah.


00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:23.370

        And then you go and you tell
        the authorities and the
      

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.900

        authorities are the police.


00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.140

        But sometimes police
        don't listen.
      

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.110

        They usually listen to men.


00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.740

        Who told you that?


00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.400

        Well, I know that for a fact.


00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.380

        You know that for a fact?


00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.920

        These are human rights
        violations that's happening to
      

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.610

        us as women and it's happening
        to our children.
      

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:45.270

        When we talk about what
        practical things that the law
      

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:50.060

        can do, well, for starters it
        can marry-- excuse the pun--
      

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:56.240

        it can marry the Criminal Courts
        with the Family Law,
      

00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:00.280

        because that way, you get to
        hear the totality of the life
      

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:01.320

        of the woman.


00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.250

        When you separate it and one
        court doesn't know what the
      

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:06.780

        other is doing, the woman
        is the one that becomes
      

00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.780

        revictimized, and it is to the
        advantage of her abuser.
      

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:18.190

        From the day, Mother's Day, May
        11, 2003, when I sat at 42
      

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:26.660

        Division and explained what my
        ex-husband had done to me that
      

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:31.390

        day, since that day, I haven't
        stopped talking.
      

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:32.950

        And I can't.


00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:35.130

        And I won't.


00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.380
