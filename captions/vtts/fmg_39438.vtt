WEBVTT

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:35.224
HUMAN BEINGS SPEND A
GREAT DEAL OF TIME

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:38.184
THINKING ABOUT HOW
TO FEED THEMSELVES.

00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:40.234
BUT HAVE THEY GIVEN
ENOUGH THOUGHT

00:01:40.235 --> 00:01:42.274
TO THE WAY IN
WHICH THEY DO SO?

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.334
HAVE THEY REFLECTED ON
THE CAUSES FOR WHICH

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:46.424
SOME CONSUME TOO
MUCH WHILE OTHERS

00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:49.304
BARELY HAVE ENOUGH TO
COVER THEIR BASIC NEEDS,

00:01:49.305 --> 00:02:25.314
RISKING DEATH
BY STARVATION?

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:28.314
THIS CLIENT OF A FAST
FOOD RESTAURANT IS

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:31.224
DEVOURING A CHEESEBURGER
FILLED WITH KETCHUP,

00:02:31.225 --> 00:02:34.244
SIDE OF FRENCH FRIES,
AND A SUGARY SOFT DRINK.

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:37.384
AN IMAGE MOST OF
US IDENTIFY WITH.

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:39.284
IN DEVELOPED NATIONS

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:41.384
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
DIE EVERY YEAR

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:44.354
DUE TO NUTRITION
RELATED DISEASES.

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:47.264
AT THE SAME TIME THREE
QUARTERS OF THE POPULATION

00:02:47.265 --> 00:02:53.204
OF THE WORLD ARE BUSY
TRYING TO SURVIVE HUNGER.

00:02:53.205 --> 00:02:58.404
HALF OF ALL FEMALE
EUROPEAN TEENAGERS ADMIT

00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:03.274
TO HAVING BEEN ON A DIET AT
SOME POINT DURING THE YEAR.

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:05.344
IN THE UNITED STATES
OBESITY AFFLICTS

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.314
A THIRD OF
THE POPULATION

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:10.314
AND KILLS THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE EACH YEAR.

00:03:10.315 --> 00:03:13.304
IN THE MEANTIME, 850
MILLION HUMAN BEINGS

00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:26.234
GO HUNGRY EVERY DAY.

00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:30.194
HUNGER IS THE MOST EXTREME
RAMIFICATION OF POVERTY.

00:03:30.195 --> 00:03:32.434
IT IS ALSO A VIOLATION
OF THE MOST BASIC OF

00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:45.354
HUMAN RIGHTS, THE RIGHT
TO SUFFICIENT FOOD.

00:03:45.355 --> 00:03:47.384
HUNGER IS A
MORAL BLIGHT

00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:50.284
BUT IT IS ALSO AN
ECONOMIC HANDICAP.

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:53.344
A HUNGRY POPULACE CANNOT
WORK AT FULL CAPACITY.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:57.254
IT IS PERENNIALLY SICK AND
CANNOT THINK STRAIGHT.

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:59.474
WITH HUNGER,
PRODUCTIVITY DECLINES,

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:03.194
NATIONS CANNOT PROSPER,
AND THE SUSTAINABLE USE

00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:06.204
OF NATURAL RESOURCES
IS COMPROMISED.

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:07.434
HUNGER IS AT
THE SAME TIME

00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:24.464
A CAUSE AND AN
EFFECT OF POVERTY.

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:27.194
TOWARDS THE END OF
THE 20TH CENTURY,

00:04:27.195 --> 00:04:28.474
THE WORLD SUMMIT
ON NUTRITION

00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:31.204
ESTABLISHED A GOAL
OF REDUCING BY HALF

00:04:31.205 --> 00:04:33.364
THE NUMBER OF HUNGRY
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

00:04:33.365 --> 00:04:37.394
THE DEADLINE THEY AGREED
ON WAS THE YEAR 2015.

00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:40.254
SOME TIME LATER THE
MILLENNIUM DECLARATION

00:04:40.255 --> 00:04:42.394
OF THE UNITED NATIONS
SET THE SAME OBJECTIVE

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:44.434
ALONG WITH
ANOTHER SEVEN

00:04:44.435 --> 00:04:47.274
MOST OF WHICH WERE RELATED
TO REDUCTION OF HUNGER

00:04:47.275 --> 00:04:49.334
AND POVERTY, TO
IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF

00:04:49.335 --> 00:04:53.184
CHILD REARING MOTHERS,
TO REDUCE INFANT MORTALITY,

00:04:53.185 --> 00:05:06.414
AND TO GUARANTEE THE
HEALTH OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:08.474
WE ARE FAST APPROACHING
THIS DEADLINE

00:05:08.475 --> 00:05:11.254
AND WE CAN ALREADY
DRAW SOME CONCLUSIONS.

00:05:11.255 --> 00:05:13.334
SOME COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN
ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY

00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:16.394
REDUCE HUNGER, BUT MOST
ARE FAILING MISERABLY.

00:05:16.395 --> 00:05:18.374
THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE
BEEN SET IN MOTION

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:20.324
IN LATIN
AMERICA AND ASIA

00:05:20.325 --> 00:05:23.214
HAVE PRODUCED MODEST
RESULTS AT BEST.

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:26.184
COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA
AND VIETNAM HAVE, HOWEVER,

00:05:26.185 --> 00:05:29.234
IMPROVED THEIR
SITUATION DRASTICALLY.

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:31.244
IN SUB-SAHARAN
AFRICA, HOWEVER,

00:05:31.245 --> 00:05:33.294
HUNGER IS
ON THE RISE.

00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:36.204
ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR
UNDERNOURISHED PERSONS

00:05:36.205 --> 00:05:44.254
ON THE PLANET IS
FROM THIS REGION.

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:49.304
THE FIGHT AGAINST HUNGER
BEGAN AFTER WORLD WAR II

00:05:49.305 --> 00:05:52.344
WITH THE SO CALLED
"GREEN REVOLUTION".

00:05:52.345 --> 00:05:55.414
SINCE THEN FOOD PRODUCTION
HAS ALWAYS BEEN GREATER

00:05:55.415 --> 00:05:57.454
THAN POPULATION GROWTH.

00:05:57.455 --> 00:06:00.294
WE ARE NOW ABLE TO
PRODUCE ENOUGH CALORIES

00:06:00.295 --> 00:06:02.474
TO FEED THE
ENTIRE PLANET...

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:26.264
THEY JUST HAVE TO BE
PROPERLY DISTRIBUTED.

00:06:26.265 --> 00:06:28.354
THIS INCREASE IN
PRODUCTION WAS ACHIEVED

00:06:28.355 --> 00:06:31.254
BY INCREASING THE
PRODUCTIVITY OF FARMLANDS.

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:34.314
NEW VARIETIES OF WHEAT,
RICE AND CORN

00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:40.384
WERE DEVELOPED AND
RESULTS WERE SPECTACULAR.

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:44.204
THE SUB-SAHARAN REGION
OF AFRICA IS THE ONLY

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:46.394
PLACE ON EARTH THAT
HAS NOT BENEFITED

00:06:46.395 --> 00:06:49.334
FROM THE GREEN
REVOLUTION.

00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:52.194
AFRICA DOES NOT HAVE
QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE,

00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:54.394
THERE ARE NO DECENT ROADS
OR PORTS, AND INTERNAL

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:58.454
MARKETS ARE IRRELEVANT
TO THE WORLD ECONOMY.

00:06:58.455 --> 00:07:01.304
EXTERNAL DEBTS DROWN
THE POPULATION

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:03.194
IN EVER MORE MISERY.

00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:05.364
QUALIFIED LABOR IS BEING
DRAINED FROM THE COUNTRY.

00:07:05.365 --> 00:07:08.254
AGRICULTURE IS PRIMITIVE
AND INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL

00:07:08.255 --> 00:07:11.254
PROJECTS HAVE FAILED
DUE TO POOR EXECUTION.

00:07:11.255 --> 00:07:13.284
IT'S NO WONDER
THAT AFRICA BOASTS

00:07:13.285 --> 00:07:41.334
THE WORST STATISTICS
IN THE WORLD.

00:07:41.335 --> 00:07:44.324
IN THE MEANTIME, ASIA
HAS HAD MIXED RESULTS

00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:46.424
IN ITS FIGHT
AGAINST HUNGER.

00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:49.254
WHILE CHINA AND VIETNAM
ARE FAST APPROACHING

00:07:49.255 --> 00:07:52.274
2015 OBJECTIVES,
NORTH KOREA, PAKISTAN

00:07:52.275 --> 00:07:54.454
AND BANGLADESH MORE
CLOSELY RESEMBLE

00:07:54.455 --> 00:07:59.314
SOME OF THE POOREST
COUNTRIES IN AFRICA.

00:07:59.315 --> 00:08:02.244
THE MAJOR CITIES IN THESE
COUNTRIES CONTINUE TO

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:05.314
SUFFER FROM THE EFFECT OF
A MASSIVE RURAL EXODUS.

00:08:05.315 --> 00:08:07.334
COUNTRIES SUCH AS
CHINA AND VIETNAM

00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:09.474
HAVE HAD SUCCESS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:08:09.475 --> 00:08:12.424
BEEN ABLE TO CREATE A
DYNAMIC RURAL ECONOMY.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:14.394
MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE
STARVING LIVE IN

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:17.184
RURAL AREAS AND IT
IS IN THESE AREAS

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:19.394
WHERE SOLUTIONS
MUST BE FOUND.

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:22.384
IN BOTH CASES, THESE
COUNTRIES INVESTED HEAVILY

00:08:22.385 --> 00:08:25.464
IN RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE,
PROVIDED ACCESS TO LAND,

00:08:25.465 --> 00:08:29.384
AND RAISED THE PRICES OF
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:31.474
MARKETS WERE THUS
JUMP-STARTED AND THE

00:08:31.475 --> 00:08:36.204
BUYING POWER OF FARMERS
INCREASED ACCORDINGLY.

00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:38.274
THE END RESULT IS THAT
IN CHINA AND VIETNAM

00:08:38.275 --> 00:09:36.434
STARVATION HAS
BEEN CUT IN HALF.

00:09:36.435 --> 00:09:39.424
NOTWITHSTANDING PROGRESS
IN PARTS OF ASIA,

00:09:39.425 --> 00:09:41.444
WE ARE VERY FAR
FROM REACHING THE

00:09:41.445 --> 00:09:47.294
MILLENNIUM OBJECTIVES
THAT PERTAIN TO NUTRITION.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:53.204
MORE THAN HALF OF THE 11
MILLION CHILDREN THAT DIE

00:09:53.205 --> 00:09:56.404
EACH YEAR DO SO BECAUSE
THEY'RE MALNOURISHED.

00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:59.274
WHAT'S MORE, TWO BILLION
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD

00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:00.434
ARE ANEMIC.

00:10:00.435 --> 00:10:02.444
OF THOSE, HALF ARE
PREGNANT WOMEN.

00:10:02.445 --> 00:10:04.454
AND OF THE REST,
MOST ARE CHILDREN

00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:31.194
UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE.

00:10:31.195 --> 00:10:33.424
THE CORRELATION BETWEEN
LOW BIRTH WEIGHT

00:10:33.425 --> 00:10:36.464
AND HIGH INFANT MORTALITY
RATES IS WELL KNOWN.

00:10:36.465 --> 00:10:40.304
NEWBORNS WEIGHING LESS
THAN TWO AND A HALF KILOS

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:42.334
ARE MORE
PROBABLE TO DIE

00:10:42.335 --> 00:10:45.344
DURING THEIR
FIRST FEW MONTHS.

00:10:45.345 --> 00:10:48.184
WHAT'S MORE, THE
PERIOD IN WHICH BABIES

00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:50.214
ARE MOST AT RISK
OF MALNOURISHMENT

00:10:50.215 --> 00:11:04.204
COINCIDES WITH THEIR
NATURAL LACTATION PERIOD.

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:07.234
THE SCARCITY OF NUTRIENTS
FROM MALNOURISHED MOTHERS

00:11:07.235 --> 00:11:10.224
RESULTS IN A LACK
OF SUFFICIENT MILK,

00:11:10.225 --> 00:11:13.324
WHICH IS USUALLY OF
LOW NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

00:11:13.325 --> 00:11:16.234
THIS IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM
OF THE POOREST STRATA

00:11:16.235 --> 00:11:53.354
OF HUMAN POPULATIONS.

00:11:53.355 --> 00:11:55.414
WOMEN ARE THE
MAIN BREADWINNERS

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:57.264
IN RURAL SOCIETIES.

00:11:57.265 --> 00:11:59.204
THEY PRODUCE
FOOD PRODUCTS,

00:11:59.205 --> 00:12:01.194
KEEP THE
HOUSEHOLD STOCKED,

00:12:01.195 --> 00:12:03.334
AND PREPARE THE MEALS
TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES.

00:12:03.335 --> 00:12:07.274
EVEN THE POOREST WOMEN ARE
EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE

00:12:07.275 --> 00:12:11.474
ABOUT THE USE OF
NATURAL RESOURCES.

00:12:11.475 --> 00:12:14.304
THE MALNOURISHMENT OF
WOMEN IS THEREFORE

00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:16.244
MUCH MORE DRAMATIC.

00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:18.264
WITHOUT ACTIVE,
WELL-NOURISHED WOMEN

00:12:18.265 --> 00:12:20.364
IN SOCIETY, NOT
ONLY THE PRESENT

00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:50.404
BUT THE FUTURE WILL
BE SEVERELY IMPAIRED.

00:12:50.405 --> 00:12:53.444
MALNOURISHMENT IS
ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:57.214
IN THE SAHEL FRINGE
WHERE THE SAHARA DESERT

00:12:57.215 --> 00:13:00.184
FUSES WITH THE
AFRICAN SAVANNAH.

00:13:00.185 --> 00:13:02.234
CLIMATE CHANGE IS
RAPIDLY INCREASING

00:13:02.235 --> 00:13:07.414
THE SIZE OF THE DESERT.

00:13:07.415 --> 00:13:11.334
THE DRY SEASONS ARE
BECOMING LONGER.

00:13:11.335 --> 00:13:14.454
IN RECENT YEARS THE
NOMADIC PEOPLE OF NIGER

00:13:14.455 --> 00:13:17.344
HAVE LOST MORE THAN
HALF THEIR CATTLE.

00:13:17.345 --> 00:13:20.234
BECAUSE OF THIS, FAMILIES
HAVE CHANGED THEIR

00:13:20.235 --> 00:13:24.264
EATING HABITS AND NOW
EAT ONLY ONCE A DAY.

00:13:24.265 --> 00:13:27.444
MANY PEOPLE CONSUME
ONLY PLANTS AND LEAVES.

00:13:27.445 --> 00:13:29.314
INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH, THOUGH,

00:13:29.315 --> 00:13:31.344
BECAUSE OF THE MANY
ANIMALS THAT HAVE DIED

00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:34.314
MORE MEAT IS
SIMULTANEOUSLY CONSUMED.

00:13:34.315 --> 00:13:54.184
BUT THIS WILL NOT
LAST TOO LONG.

00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:56.274
THE DRYING OF WELLS
HAS MADE IT NECESSARY

00:13:56.275 --> 00:13:58.344
FOR THOSE WHO LIVE BY
NOMADIC SHEPHERDING

00:13:58.345 --> 00:14:00.414
TO DO SO IN
AGRARIAN AREAS.

00:14:00.415 --> 00:14:03.324
MANY YEARS AGO THE
FRINGE BETWEEN THE DESERT

00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:05.454
AND ARABLE LAND WAS
WIDE ENOUGH TO CREATE

00:14:05.455 --> 00:14:07.394
A KIND OF
BUFFER ZONE.

00:14:07.395 --> 00:14:09.474
NOWADAYS THAT
FRINGE IS SO NARROW

00:14:09.475 --> 00:14:13.364
THAT CONFLICTS
ARE FLOURISHING.

00:14:13.365 --> 00:14:17.184
THEIR MAIN PROBLEM
IS THAT WHAT THEY SELL

00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:22.234
HAS BECOME CHEAPER AND WHAT
THEY BUY IS TOO EXPENSIVE.

00:14:22.235 --> 00:14:24.294
ANIMAL PRICES
ARE VERY LOW.

00:14:24.295 --> 00:14:27.244
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS
THE PRICE OF A COW

00:14:27.245 --> 00:14:30.374
HAS BEEN CUT IN HALF.

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:33.224
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE
PRICE OF MIHO SEED

00:14:33.225 --> 00:14:42.274
AND SORGO HAS DOUBLED.

00:14:42.275 --> 00:14:45.404
MORE AND MORE NOMADS
VIEW THE MAJOR CITIES

00:14:45.405 --> 00:14:48.274
AS THE ONLY ANSWER
TO THEIR PROBLEMS.

00:14:48.275 --> 00:14:50.284
THIS CRISIS CANNOT
BE SOLVED ONLY BY

00:14:50.285 --> 00:14:52.384
INCREASING THE
AVAILABILITY OF FOOD.

00:14:52.385 --> 00:14:55.184
THE CRISIS OF
NOURISHMENT IN SAHEL

00:14:55.185 --> 00:15:24.294
AFFECTS EIGHT
MILLION PEOPLE.

00:15:24.295 --> 00:15:28.224
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES CONFIRM
THAT THE PROBLEM OF

00:15:28.225 --> 00:15:32.364
MALNUTRITION IS NOT DUE TO
A LACK OF FOOD, BUT RATHER

00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:36.264
TO INADEQUATE DISTRIBUTION
OF RESOURCES.

00:15:36.265 --> 00:15:38.464
FEEBLE ATTEMPTS BY MOST
GOVERNMENTS TO DECREASE

00:15:38.465 --> 00:15:41.464
HUNGER HAVE ENDED IN
MEDIOCRE MEASURES DESIGNED

00:15:41.465 --> 00:15:45.324
TO WIN OVER THE LEGITIMACY
OF THEIR PEOPLE.

00:15:45.325 --> 00:15:47.464
NUMEROUS SMALL VICTORIES
IN DIFFERENT CORNERS

00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:50.234
OF THE WORLD HAVE
DEMONSTRATED THAT

00:15:50.235 --> 00:15:52.254
BY EXECUTING RELATIVELY
SIMPLE MEASURES

00:15:52.255 --> 00:15:54.354
IMPORTANT ADVANCES
CAN BE MADE.

00:15:54.355 --> 00:15:56.384
AND IT CAN BE DONE
BY JUST PROTECTING

00:15:56.385 --> 00:15:58.384
SMALL FARMERS OR
CATTLE RANCHERS,

00:15:58.385 --> 00:16:01.354
BY DRASTICALLY
IMPROVING MATERNAL LACTATION,

00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:14.474
AND ACCESS TO COMPETENT
HEALTH COVERAGE.

00:16:14.475 --> 00:16:18.224
HOWEVER, BOTH IN DEVELOPED
AND IN THIRD WORLD NATIONS,

00:16:18.225 --> 00:16:20.314
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THESE ARE GENUINE

00:16:20.315 --> 00:16:43.344
GOVERNMENT CONCERNS.

00:16:43.345 --> 00:16:47.434
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THERE
ISN'T ENOUGH ARABLE LAND.

00:16:47.435 --> 00:16:50.424
FOR MANY REASONS, LESS
THAN HALF OF ARABLE LAND

00:16:50.425 --> 00:17:02.234
IS USED FOR
AGRICULTURE.

00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:05.184
MOST OF THE LAND THAT
IS USED FOR CROPS

00:17:05.185 --> 00:17:07.304
IS DEDICATED
ENTIRELY TO EXPORT

00:17:07.305 --> 00:17:10.324
OR TO THE PRODUCTION
OF FOOD FOR ANIMALS.

00:17:10.325 --> 00:17:13.304
TODAY A LARGE PART OF
FOOD GROWN IN THIRD

00:17:13.305 --> 00:17:16.454
WORLD COUNTRIES IS
CONSUMED BY ANIMALS.

00:17:16.455 --> 00:17:19.324
IN MANY OF THESE COUNTRIES
MORE THAN A THIRD

00:17:19.325 --> 00:17:22.394
OF ALL GRAIN IS
GROWN FOR CATTLE.

00:17:22.395 --> 00:17:24.474
THESE ANIMALS IN
TURN ARE CONSUMED

00:17:24.475 --> 00:17:27.224
IN DEVELOPED NATIONS.

00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:30.324
THE RESULT IS THAT THE
MOST AFFLUENT HAVE A DIET

00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:32.474
RICH IN ANIMAL PROTEIN
WHILE THE POOREST

00:17:32.475 --> 00:17:35.304
ARE LEFT WITH VERY
LITTLE FARMING LAND

00:17:35.305 --> 00:17:42.364
TO FEED THEIR
OWN FAMILIES.

00:17:42.365 --> 00:17:46.224
AND MANY OF THE AVAILABLE
FARMLANDS OFTEN BELONG TO

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:48.454
SPECIAL INTERESTS, THUS
WORSENING THE PLIGHT

00:17:48.455 --> 00:17:51.324
OF LOCAL FARMERS.

00:17:51.325 --> 00:17:54.394
THEREFORE THE PROBLEM OF
HUNGER HAS A LOT TO DO

00:17:54.395 --> 00:17:57.414
WITH THE WAYS IN WHICH
ARABLE LAND IS USED.

00:17:57.415 --> 00:18:00.404
THIS UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION
LEAVES LOCAL FARMERS

00:18:00.405 --> 00:18:03.284
AT A LOSS AND IS ONE OF
THE MAIN REASONS FOR THE

00:18:03.285 --> 00:18:20.434
SCARCITY OF FOOD IN MANY
AREAS OF THE WORLD.

00:18:20.435 --> 00:18:24.374
AFTER WORLD WAR II THE
AMOUNT OF GRAZING LANDS

00:18:24.375 --> 00:18:27.364
AND HEADS OF CATTLE
DOUBLED IN SOUTH AMERICA.

00:18:27.365 --> 00:18:30.284
IN THE MEANTIME, THE
CONSUMPTION OF BEEF

00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:33.194
BY LOCAL CITIZENS
DIMINISHED.

00:18:33.195 --> 00:18:36.234
THE PRODUCTION OF BEEF WAS
EXPORTED TO NORTH AMERICAN

00:18:36.235 --> 00:18:58.394
AND EUROPEAN MARKETS.

00:18:58.395 --> 00:19:01.204
IN BRAZIL DURING THE
SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES

00:19:01.205 --> 00:19:03.394
THOUSANDS OF HECTARES OF
AMAZONIAN RAIN FOREST

00:19:03.395 --> 00:19:06.444
WERE DESTROYED TO MAKE
ROOM FOR CATTLE RANCHERS.

00:19:06.445 --> 00:19:08.434
IN COLUMBIA
AND PERU

00:19:08.435 --> 00:19:11.314
A SIMILAR
PHENOMENON OCCURRED.

00:19:11.315 --> 00:19:14.224
THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS
GROWTH WAS THE INCREASE

00:19:14.225 --> 00:20:06.424
IN DEMAND FOR HAMBURGER
MEAT BY FAST FOOD CHAINS.

00:20:06.425 --> 00:20:09.374
THE PROBLEM OF
OBESITY IS AN EPIDEMIC

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:12.224
AND A THREAT TO
DEVELOPING NATIONS.

00:20:12.225 --> 00:20:14.444
THE CULTURE OF CONSUMERISM
IN FIRST WORLD NATIONS

00:20:14.445 --> 00:20:17.274
AND THE ABUNDANCE
OF AVAILABLE FOOD

00:20:17.275 --> 00:20:21.214
DROWN THESE POPULATIONS
IN THEIR OWN ABUSES

00:20:21.215 --> 00:20:25.334
SO MUCH SO THAT IN
COUNTRIES SUCH AS

00:20:25.335 --> 00:20:28.454
THE UNITED STATES OBESITY
HAS SURPASSED SMOKING

00:20:28.455 --> 00:20:31.354
AS THE MAIN CAUSE OF
PREVENTABLE DEATHS.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.474
THE NUMBER OF OBESE
PERSONS HAS DOUBLED

00:20:33.475 --> 00:20:36.454
IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS
OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY.

00:20:36.455 --> 00:20:39.374
IN DEVELOPED NATIONS
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE

00:20:39.375 --> 00:20:42.454
DESTINED EACH YEAR TO
OFFSET THE EXTENSIVE ARRAY

00:20:42.455 --> 00:21:17.304
OF OVEREATING
RELATED DISEASES.

00:21:17.305 --> 00:21:21.194
THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD WE
EAT IS INCREASINGLY WORSE.

00:21:21.195 --> 00:21:24.324
WHAT IS THE FAVORITE
VEGETABLE OF AMERICANS?

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.454
FRENCH FRIES.

00:21:25.455 --> 00:21:28.224
AND THE MOST WIDELY
CONSUMED GRAIN?

00:21:28.225 --> 00:21:30.334
PROCESSED WHEAT IN
THE SHAPE OF PASTA

00:21:30.335 --> 00:21:32.184
OR HAMBURGER BUNS.

00:21:32.185 --> 00:21:34.444
THUS IT IS UNDERSTANDABLE
THAT FAST FOOD CONSTITUTES

00:21:34.445 --> 00:21:44.344
THE BASIS OF THE
MODERN FOOD PYRAMID.

00:21:44.345 --> 00:21:48.364
BUT THE PROBLEM IS NOT
ONLY LOW NUTRITION LEVELS

00:21:48.365 --> 00:21:51.354
AND THE EXCESSIVE CALORIC
CONTENT OF FAST FOOD.

00:21:51.355 --> 00:21:54.194
THE SIZE OF PORTIONS
MOST PEOPLE EAT

00:21:54.195 --> 00:22:01.294
HAS NOTABLY INCREASED.

00:22:01.295 --> 00:22:06.254
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES
SEEM TO BE ENGAGED

00:22:06.255 --> 00:22:09.314
IN AN EATING CONTEST.

00:22:09.315 --> 00:22:12.204
FOR EXAMPLE, A TYPICAL
BURGER KING HAMBURGER

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:14.414
WHICH HALF A CENTURY
AGO HAD 200 CALORIES

00:22:14.415 --> 00:22:17.404
NOW HAS ALMOST
400 CALORIES.

00:22:17.405 --> 00:22:20.304
A SIDE OF FRENCH FRIES
AT MACDONALD'S NOW HAS

00:22:20.305 --> 00:22:36.444
MORE THAN THREE TIMES
AS MANY CALORIES.

00:22:36.445 --> 00:22:40.274
AS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM,
POST INDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES

00:22:40.275 --> 00:22:43.284
HAVE FOMENTED SITUATIONS
WHICH ENDANGER THE HEALTH

00:22:43.285 --> 00:22:44.394
OF THEIR CITIZENS.

00:22:44.395 --> 00:22:46.404
STRESSFUL WORKING
CONDITIONS HAVE MADE

00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:49.234
FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS
COMFORTABLE BUT GREASY

00:22:49.235 --> 00:22:52.184
SUBSTITUTES FOR
HOMEMADE MEALS.

00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:54.434
A MACDONALD'S HAPPY MEAL
CONTAINS HALF OF THE DAILY

00:22:54.435 --> 00:22:57.364
CALORIES A HEALTHY ADULT
NEEDS, BUT MUCH LESS

00:22:57.365 --> 00:23:30.244
THAN HALF OF THE
NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS.

00:23:30.245 --> 00:23:33.294
IN COMPARISON WITH HEALTHY
MEALS WHICH AREN'T EASY TO

00:23:33.295 --> 00:23:36.324
OBTAIN AND ARE EXPENSIVE
AND SCARCELY PROMOTED,

00:23:36.325 --> 00:23:39.324
FAST FOOD ITEMS ARE BETTER
ADVERTISED, CHEAPER,

00:23:39.325 --> 00:24:04.374
AND ARE DESIGNED TO
PLEASE MORE TASTEBUDS.

00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:08.304
ALTHOUGH THE UNITED STATES
HAS THE MOST OBESE PEOPLE,

00:24:08.305 --> 00:24:11.464
THIS IS REALLY A WORLDWIDE
PROBLEM ESPECIALLY IN

00:24:11.465 --> 00:24:14.424
RECENTLY INDUSTRIALIZED
COUNTRIES SUCH AS MEXICO,

00:24:14.425 --> 00:24:22.234
SOUTH AFRICA, TUNISIA,
TURKEY, IRAN AND THAILAND.

00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:25.244
IN FACT, CITIZENS OF
LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

00:24:25.245 --> 00:24:28.274
ARE ALSO GAINING WEIGHT
EVEN IF THE AVAILABILITY

00:24:28.275 --> 00:24:32.404
OF FOOD IS INFERIOR TO
THAT OF THE UNITED STATES.

00:24:32.405 --> 00:24:35.304
THIS REPRESENTS A MENACE
TO THESE COUNTRIES

00:24:35.305 --> 00:24:38.254
WHICH IN JUST A FEW YEARS
WILL SURPASS NORTH AMERICA

00:24:38.255 --> 00:24:44.324
IN OBESITY AND WEIGHT
RELATED DISEASES.

00:24:44.325 --> 00:24:47.184
A REDUCTION IN
PHYSICAL EFFORT

00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:49.464
DUE MAINLY TO THE
TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION

00:24:49.465 --> 00:24:52.334
COMPOUNDED WITH
NUTRITIONAL EXCESSES

00:24:52.335 --> 00:25:01.194
ARE AMONG THE MAIN CAUSES
OF THIS WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC.

00:25:01.195 --> 00:25:04.404
BUT THERE IS MUCH
INTERCONTINENTAL

00:25:04.405 --> 00:25:07.244
CONTRAST AS WELL.

00:25:07.245 --> 00:25:09.394
LET'S TAKE A CLOSER
LOOK AT AFRICA.

00:25:09.395 --> 00:25:12.354
IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS
ETHIOPIA AND BURKINA FASO

00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:14.304
TWO THIRDS OF
THE POPULATION

00:25:14.305 --> 00:25:16.384
ARE AFFECTED
BY HUNGER.

00:25:16.385 --> 00:25:18.424
YET IN SOUTH
AFRICA AND TUNISIA

00:25:18.425 --> 00:25:23.384
OBESITY IS MORE COMMON
THAN MALNUTRITION.

00:25:23.385 --> 00:25:26.344
FURTHER TO THE EAST,
AFTER CHINA UNDERTOOK

00:25:26.345 --> 00:25:29.224
ITS VAUNTED
COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION,

00:25:29.225 --> 00:25:31.314
AND BECAUSE IT HAS THE
HIGHEST PER CAPITA

00:25:31.315 --> 00:25:33.354
CHICKEN CONSUMPTION
RATE IN THE WORLD,

00:25:33.355 --> 00:25:38.374
FAST FOOD CHAINS SUCH
AS KFC HAVE FLOURISHED.

00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:41.364
AND FURTHER TO THE
SOUTH ON THE AUSTRALIAN

00:25:41.365 --> 00:25:45.254
CONTINENT, DIETS RICH IN
FAT HAVE MADE AN ALREADY

00:25:45.255 --> 00:25:49.434
HEAVYSET POPULATION AMONG
THE FATTEST ON THE PLANET.

00:25:49.435 --> 00:25:52.254
IN MANY CASES THE
ACCUMULATION OF FAT

00:25:52.255 --> 00:25:54.454
IN THE LIVER CAN
CAUSE CIRRHOSIS.

00:25:54.455 --> 00:25:57.414
EXCESS ABDOMINAL FAT
IS DIRECTLY RELATED

00:25:57.415 --> 00:26:01.224
TO COLON CANCER.

00:26:01.225 --> 00:26:04.284
BEING OVERWEIGHT ALSO
CAUSES A LOSS OF CARTILAGE

00:26:04.285 --> 00:26:17.194
IN JOINTS WHICH CAN
LEAD TO ARTHRITIS.

00:26:17.195 --> 00:26:19.424
THE RISK OF HIGH BLOOD
PRESSURE AND STROKE AS A

00:26:19.425 --> 00:26:22.374
RESULT OF THE ACCUMULATION
OF CHOLESTEROL IN ARTERIES

00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:24.434
IS YET ANOTHER
COMMON PROBLEM.

00:26:24.435 --> 00:26:27.394
MOST OBESE PEOPLE WILL
SUFFER FROM DIABETES

00:26:27.395 --> 00:26:30.184
WHICH CAN IN TURN LEAD
TO A LOSS OF EYESIGHT

00:26:30.185 --> 00:26:37.254
AND HEMORRHAGING.

00:26:37.255 --> 00:26:40.184
THE GREEN REVOLUTION
AS WE KNOW IT

00:26:40.185 --> 00:26:43.384
IS SHOWING SYMPTOMS OF
CONCLUDING PREMATURELY.

00:26:43.385 --> 00:26:46.324
THIS IS DUE TO THE
IMPOSSIBILITY OF CREATING

00:26:46.325 --> 00:26:50.224
ARABLE LAND IN PROTECTED
AREAS, TO THE FACT THAT

00:26:50.225 --> 00:26:52.454
THE VARIETIES THAT MADE
THIS REVOLUTION POSSIBLE

00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:55.424
ARE REACHING THE LIMITS
OF THEIR PRODUCTIVITY,

00:26:55.425 --> 00:26:58.454
AND ABOVE ALL TO THE FACT
THAT THIS EXPANSION IN

00:26:58.455 --> 00:27:01.394
PRODUCTIVITY WAS OBTAINED
THANKS TO AN EQUALLY

00:27:01.395 --> 00:27:04.354
IMPRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT
IN IRRIGATION METHODS.

00:27:04.355 --> 00:27:06.444
IF AVAILABLE
LAND IS SCARCE,

00:27:06.445 --> 00:27:09.214
ACCESS TO WATER
IS EVEN MORE SO.

00:27:09.215 --> 00:27:11.324
CURRENTLY ALMOST HALF
OF THE WORLD PRODUCTION

00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:14.274
OF FOOD COMES FROM FIELDS
THAT ARE IRRIGATED.

00:27:14.275 --> 00:27:17.184
WATER LEVELS ARE
DIMINISHING EVERYWHERE,

00:27:17.185 --> 00:27:19.434
ESPECIALLY IN AND AROUND
THE MEDITERRANEAN SEA,

00:27:19.435 --> 00:27:22.214
INDIA, AND
PARTS OF CHINA.

00:27:22.215 --> 00:27:24.264
THE RATE OF CONSUMPTION
IS MUCH HIGHER

00:27:24.265 --> 00:27:26.234
THAN THE RATE
OF REPLENISHMENT.

00:27:26.235 --> 00:27:28.344
IN THE SHORT TO MID TERM
IT SEEMS THAT HALF OF THE

00:27:28.345 --> 00:27:30.444
WORLD'S POPULATION WILL
SUFFER FROM PROBLEMS

00:27:30.445 --> 00:27:33.294
DUE TO SCARCE
ACCESS TO WATER.

00:27:33.295 --> 00:27:35.344
IT'S AN ILLUSION
TO THINK THAT

00:27:35.345 --> 00:27:44.434
IRRIGATION CAN
BE EXPANDED.

00:27:44.435 --> 00:27:48.334
A NEW STRATEGY OF FOOD
PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION

00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:50.244
IS NEEDED.

00:27:50.245 --> 00:27:52.334
A NEW STRATEGY IS
ALSO NEEDED TO ACCESS

00:27:52.335 --> 00:27:55.184
ARABLE LAND AND TO
INCREASE THE CAPACITY

00:27:55.185 --> 00:27:57.424
TO ACQUIRE
AND PRODUCE FOOD.

00:27:57.425 --> 00:28:00.264
EVEN TODAY TOO MANY
PEOPLE ARE TOO POOR

00:28:00.265 --> 00:28:02.394
TO BUY
AVAILABLE FOOD.

00:28:02.395 --> 00:28:05.194
THEY'RE HUNGRY BECAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY,

00:28:05.195 --> 00:28:13.414
NOT BECAUSE THERE'S
NO FOOD AVAILABLE.

00:28:13.415 --> 00:28:18.364
EVEN SOME OF THE POOREST
COUNTRIES HAVE ENOUGH

00:28:18.365 --> 00:28:22.374
RESOURCES FOR ALL OF
THEIR POPULATIONS.

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:25.474
IN FACT, MOST MALNOURISHED
CHILDREN LIVE IN NATIONS

00:28:25.475 --> 00:28:28.354
WITH A SURPLUS OF FOOD.

00:28:28.355 --> 00:28:31.374
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST
OF THE CITIZENS OF THOSE

00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:53.224
NATIONS SIMPLY CANNOT PAY
SUCH HIGH PRICES FOR FOOD.

00:28:53.225 --> 00:28:55.434
THE SOLUTION TO THE
PROBLEM OF REDUCING HUNGER

00:28:55.435 --> 00:28:59.284
IS SUSTAINABLE RURAL AND
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:28:59.285 --> 00:29:02.204
IN SPITE OF THE MEASURES
TAKEN, THE NUMBER OF

00:29:02.205 --> 00:29:04.344
HUNGRY PEOPLE IN THE
WORLD IS NOT DIMINISHING

00:29:04.345 --> 00:29:07.414
FAST ENOUGH TO REACH THE
MILLENNIUM OBJECTIVES.

00:29:07.415 --> 00:29:10.424
IN ORDER TO DO SO, HUNGER
WOULD HAVE TO BE REDUCED

00:29:10.425 --> 00:29:14.204
AT A RATE OF 26
MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR.

00:29:14.205 --> 00:29:18.344
IN TRUTH, THE REDUCTION
HAS AMOUNTED TO ONLY

00:29:18.345 --> 00:29:24.184
SIX MILLION - ONE QUARTER
OF THE STATED GOAL.

00:29:24.185 --> 00:29:30.194
TODAY THE PROBLEM IS
NOT THE AMOUNT OF FOOD

00:29:30.195 --> 00:29:32.404
BEING PRODUCED -
ALTHOUGH IN THE SHORT

00:29:32.405 --> 00:29:35.294
TO MID TERM IT MAY
BECOME JUST THAT -

00:29:35.295 --> 00:29:38.334
THE PROJECTED POPULATION
INCREASE COUPLED WITH THE

00:29:38.335 --> 00:29:41.304
EROSION OF THE ENVIRONMENT
AND THE LACK OF WATER

00:29:41.305 --> 00:29:45.244
MAY LEAD US TO AN
UNPRECEDENTED FOOD CRISIS.

00:29:45.245 --> 00:30:15.444
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO
AVOID THIS OUTCOME?

00:30:15.445 --> 00:30:19.474
THE PROGRESS OF MODERN
AGRICULTURE IS BASED ON

00:30:19.475 --> 00:30:22.434
THE EXPERIENCE ACQUIRED
FROM A CENTURY AND A HALF

00:30:22.435 --> 00:30:24.474
OF SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITY.

00:30:24.475 --> 00:30:27.384
THE GREEN REVOLUTION IS
PART OF THIS PROCESS.

00:30:27.385 --> 00:30:31.184
IT'S BASED ON ITS CAPACITY
TO MODIFY THE ENVIRONMENT

00:30:31.185 --> 00:30:33.454
SO THAT THE MOST IDEAL
CONDITIONS FOR AGRICULTURE

00:30:33.455 --> 00:30:40.354
AND CATTLE RAISING
CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE.

00:30:40.355 --> 00:30:43.274
FOR EXAMPLE, IF
THE CLIMATE IS DRY

00:30:43.275 --> 00:30:45.184
IRRIGATION IS USED.

00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:46.444
IF THE GROUND
IS NOT FERTILE,

00:30:46.445 --> 00:30:48.394
FERTILIZERS
ARE USED.

00:30:48.395 --> 00:30:52.374
IF WEED AND PESTS INVADE
CROPS, FIELDS ARE SPRAYED.

00:30:52.375 --> 00:30:56.204
IF MORE ENERGY IS NEEDED
TO ROTATE ARABLE FIELDS,

00:30:56.205 --> 00:30:58.324
MECHANIZED VEHICLES
AND FOSSIL FUELS

00:30:58.325 --> 00:31:00.194
COME INTO PLAY.

00:31:00.195 --> 00:31:02.444
THE GREEN REVOLUTION WAS
BASED ON PRECISELY THAT.

00:31:02.445 --> 00:31:05.244
THERE ARE MANY BENEFITS
BUT THERE IS ALSO

00:31:05.245 --> 00:31:21.364
MUCH HARM DONE TO
THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:31:21.365 --> 00:31:24.414
THE NEXT STEP IS THE
USE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY -

00:31:24.415 --> 00:31:27.434
AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS
OF GENETIC ENGINEERING.

00:31:27.435 --> 00:31:30.304
IT IS THE NEW
GREEN REVOLUTION.

00:31:30.305 --> 00:31:32.454
AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS
FRAUGHT WITH BOTH MORAL

00:31:32.455 --> 00:31:44.384
ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR THE FUTURE.

00:31:44.385 --> 00:31:54.334
HOW IS GENETIC ENGINEERING
APPLIED TO NUTRITION?

00:31:54.335 --> 00:31:57.204
ALL LIVING BEINGS CONTAIN
GENETIC INFORMATION

00:31:57.205 --> 00:31:58.344
IN THEIR CHROMOSOMES.

00:31:58.345 --> 00:32:01.224
CHROMOSOMES ARE MADE
UP OF STRANDS OF DNA

00:32:01.225 --> 00:32:03.244
WHICH ARE
FORMED BY GENES.

00:32:03.245 --> 00:32:06.274
EACH GENE IS MADE UP OF
A NUMBER OF THESE UNITS.

00:32:06.275 --> 00:32:09.224
GENES DETERMINE, BY WAY
OF THEIR COMPLEX CODE,

00:32:09.225 --> 00:32:11.414
THE CHARACTERISTICS
OF EACH ORGANISM.

00:32:11.415 --> 00:32:13.414
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE
A CERTAIN GENOME

00:32:13.415 --> 00:32:25.324
WHILE LETTUCE, FOR
EXAMPLE, HAS ANOTHER.

00:32:25.325 --> 00:32:28.194
BY USING GENETIC
ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES

00:32:28.195 --> 00:32:31.424
A GENE FROM ONE ORGANISM MAY
BE INTRODUCED INTO ANOTHER.

00:32:31.425 --> 00:32:34.344
FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS
POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE

00:32:34.345 --> 00:32:37.244
A SCORPION GENE
INTO LETTUCE.

00:32:37.245 --> 00:32:41.234
THIS IS KNOWN AS
GENETIC MANIPULATION.

00:32:41.235 --> 00:32:43.384
THUS THE PHYSIOLOGICAL
CHARACTERISTICS

00:32:43.385 --> 00:32:46.234
OF AN ORGANISM
CAN BE ALTERED.

00:32:46.235 --> 00:32:48.384
IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE,
FOR INSTANCE,

00:32:48.385 --> 00:32:51.454
TO MAKE A CERTAIN LETTUCE
THAT HAS BEEN IMPLANTED

00:32:51.455 --> 00:32:55.324
WITH A SCORPION GENE
PRODUCE SCORPION VENOM.

00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:58.334
THE NEW ORGANISM IS KNOWN
AS A GENETICALLY MODIFIED

00:32:58.335 --> 00:33:04.254
ORGANISM, OR MORE COMMONLY
AS A TRANSGENIC ORGANISM.

00:33:04.255 --> 00:33:06.464
ARE TRANSGENIC
FOODS GOOD OR BAD?

00:33:06.465 --> 00:33:09.184
IS THE USE OF
BIOTECHNOLOGY IN

00:33:09.185 --> 00:33:11.384
AGRICULTURE A GOOD
OR A BAD IDEA?

00:33:11.385 --> 00:33:14.204
IT ISN'T EASY TO
ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS,

00:33:14.205 --> 00:33:16.284
BUT WE MUST TRY
TO DO SO BECAUSE

00:33:16.285 --> 00:35:17.394
THE FUTURE OF OUR NUTRITION
DEPENDS ON THESE ANSWERS.

00:35:17.395 --> 00:35:20.304
WOULD PLANTS THAT RESIST
THE COLD AND DROUGHT

00:35:20.305 --> 00:35:23.284
BE USEFUL IF THEIR
YIELD WERE IMPROVED?

00:35:23.285 --> 00:35:26.244
WOULD PLANTS THAT REQUIRE
LESS HERBICIDES, WATER,

00:35:26.245 --> 00:35:28.354
AND ENERGY HELP STOP
THE DETERIORATION

00:35:28.355 --> 00:35:30.214
OF THE ENVIRONMENT?

00:35:30.215 --> 00:35:31.444
OBVIOUSLY, YES.

00:35:31.445 --> 00:35:33.454
THAT IS PRECISELY
THE "RAISON D'ETRE"

00:35:33.455 --> 00:35:43.464
OF BIOTECHNOLOGY.

00:35:43.465 --> 00:35:46.444
HOWEVER, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF THE DEVELOPMENT AND

00:35:46.445 --> 00:35:49.254
DISTRIBUTION OF SAID
TECHNOLOGY WERE IN THE

00:35:49.255 --> 00:35:51.454
HANDS OF A HALF DOZEN
PRIVATE BUSINESSES THAT

00:35:51.455 --> 00:35:54.324
ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH
COMMERCIAL STRATEGIES

00:35:54.325 --> 00:35:57.284
THAN WITH THE INTERESTS
OF THE POPULATION?

00:35:57.285 --> 00:35:59.394
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT IS OCCURRING.

00:35:59.395 --> 00:36:01.384
THE BUSINESS OF GENETIC
ENGINEERING IS IN

00:36:01.385 --> 00:36:03.384
THE HANDS OF LARGE
AGRO-CHEMICAL

00:36:03.385 --> 00:36:33.454
AND PHARMACEUTICAL
MULTINATIONALS.

00:36:33.455 --> 00:36:37.194
TRANSGENIC FOODS ARE
ALREADY ON OUR TABLES.

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:39.464
THEY'RE A PART OF
ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION.

00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:48.314
BUT ARE WE AWARE
OF THEIR RISKS?

00:36:48.315 --> 00:36:51.364
THE EXTENSIVE USE
OF TRANSGENIC CROPS

00:36:51.365 --> 00:36:54.284
STIMULATES THE USE
OF HERBICIDES WHICH

00:36:54.285 --> 00:36:57.354
CONTAMINATE THE WATER WE
DEPEND ON AND ARABLE LAND.

00:36:57.355 --> 00:37:00.374
THESE HERBICIDES ARE ALSO
A DANGER TO PUBLIC HEALTH

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:05.294
BECAUSE OF
THEIR TOXICITY.

00:37:05.295 --> 00:37:08.464
ANOTHER REASON TO DOUBT
THE BENEFITS OF TRANSGENIC

00:37:08.465 --> 00:37:12.234
FOODS IS THAT THE ECONOMIC
POLICIES THAT SPONSOR THE

00:37:12.235 --> 00:37:15.194
PRODUCTION OF GENETICALLY
ALTERED FOOD HAS HAD

00:37:15.195 --> 00:37:24.234
GRAVE CONSEQUENCES ON
THE LIVES OF FARMERS.

00:37:24.235 --> 00:37:27.424
ONE OF THE BASES OF THIS
BUSINESS IS THE SO-CALLED

00:37:27.425 --> 00:37:29.404
"TERMINATOR" GENE.

00:37:29.405 --> 00:37:32.364
THIS GENE RENDERS SEEDS
INFERTILE AND FORCES

00:37:32.365 --> 00:37:35.284
FARMERS TO BUY THE
ORIGINAL SEEDS EVERY YEAR

00:37:35.285 --> 00:37:38.254
WHICH ENABLES CORPORATIONS
TO EASILY CONTROL

00:37:38.255 --> 00:37:43.464
AGRICULTURE AND
WORLD FOOD MARKETS.

00:37:43.465 --> 00:37:48.234
THERE ARE NO ADVANTAGES
TO THIS EXCEPT

00:37:48.235 --> 00:37:51.344
FOR AGRO-INDUSTRIAL
MULTINATIONALS.

00:37:51.345 --> 00:37:54.244
TRANSGENIC SEEDS ARE
MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

00:37:54.245 --> 00:37:56.454
CONVENTIONAL SEEDS AND
BECAUSE THEY ARE PATENTED

00:37:56.455 --> 00:37:59.284
FARMERS CANNOT
USE THE NEW SEEDS

00:37:59.285 --> 00:38:21.194
TO PLANT THEM FOR
THE NEXT SEASON.

00:38:21.195 --> 00:38:24.314
COMPANIES DERIVE HUGE
PROFITS FROM EXERTING

00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:27.204
CONTROL OVER THE
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

00:38:27.205 --> 00:38:28.424
OF THE GENETIC
CHARACTERISTICS

00:38:28.425 --> 00:38:30.424
OF THE PRINCIPLE
CROPS IN THE WORLD

00:38:30.425 --> 00:38:32.454
WHILE THE POOREST
FARMERS ON THE PLANET

00:38:32.455 --> 00:38:37.184
BECOME INCREASINGLY
POORER.

00:38:37.185 --> 00:38:41.374
SO IF TRANSGENIC FOODS
CAUSE SO MANY PROBLEMS,

00:38:41.375 --> 00:38:45.194
WHY DO WESTERN GOVERNMENTS
SPONSOR THEIR USE?

00:38:45.195 --> 00:38:47.464
THE ANSWER LIES IN
THE GREAT GEOPOLITICAL

00:38:47.465 --> 00:38:49.434
ECONOMIC GAIN.

00:38:49.435 --> 00:38:52.194
LARGE MULTINATIONALS
INTERESTED IN

00:38:52.195 --> 00:38:55.194
TRANSGENIC FOODS
WIELD ENORMOUS POWER

00:38:55.195 --> 00:38:57.434
AND THAT ECONOMIC POWER
ENABLES THEM TO WIELD

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:21.184
ALMOST UNLIMITED
POLITICAL POWER.

00:39:21.185 --> 00:39:23.234
IS THERE A PLACE
FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY

00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:25.234
IN THE AREA OF
FOOD PRODUCTION?

00:39:25.235 --> 00:39:26.434
OF COURSE THERE IS.

00:39:26.435 --> 00:39:29.304
NOT ONLY MUST WE MAKE USE
OF IT, BUT TO A LARGE

00:39:29.305 --> 00:39:32.254
DEGREE THE CHANCES OF
ERADICATING WORLD HUNGER

00:39:32.255 --> 00:39:40.404
DEPEND ON AN APPROPRIATE USE
OF THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

00:39:40.405 --> 00:39:42.434
BUT THE SUCCESS
OF THIS CHALLENGE

00:39:42.435 --> 00:39:45.334
DEPENDS ON THE
OBJECTIVES WE ESTABLISH.

00:39:45.335 --> 00:39:47.334
WHAT ARE
THE OBJECTIVES?

00:39:47.335 --> 00:39:49.384
TO INCREASE PROFIT
MARGINS OF LARGE

00:39:49.385 --> 00:39:52.334
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS OR
TO GUARANTEE LONG TERM

00:39:52.335 --> 00:39:55.454
SUSTAINABLE FOOD AND
ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT?

00:39:55.455 --> 00:40:01.194
WE MUST DEFINE
OUR PRIORITIES.

00:40:01.195 --> 00:40:06.244
THERE IS ROOM FOR
BIOTECHNOLOGICAL METHODS

00:40:06.245 --> 00:40:09.264
THAT CREATE GENETICALLY
NEW CROPS THAT CAN

00:40:09.265 --> 00:40:17.384
COMPLEMENT THOSE WE
ALREADY CONSUME.

00:40:17.385 --> 00:40:21.184
THERE IS ROOM FOR THE
SORT OF BIOTECHNOLOGY

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.274
THAT PRODUCES MORE
RESISTANT PLANTS

00:40:23.275 --> 00:40:25.424
DURING DROUGHTS AND
ONSLAUGHTS OF PESTS

00:40:25.425 --> 00:40:28.414
AND THAT ARE LESS
DEPENDENT ON AGROCHEMICALS;

00:40:28.415 --> 00:40:31.364
THE TYPE OF AGRICULTURAL
PLANNING THAT IS COMPATIBLE

00:40:31.365 --> 00:40:33.464
WITH ECOLOGICALLY
SUSTAINABLE IDEALS

00:40:33.465 --> 00:40:36.284
BUT THAT NEVER LOSES
SIGHT OF THE NEED TO FEED

00:40:36.285 --> 00:40:41.304
SEVEN BILLION MOUTHS
IN A COUPLE OF DECADES.

00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:43.374
THERE IS ALSO ROOM
FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY

00:40:43.375 --> 00:40:45.434
THAT IS FINANCED
BY GOVERNMENTS

00:40:45.435 --> 00:40:48.224
AND IS AT THE SERVICE
OF THE POOREST -

00:40:48.225 --> 00:42:23.354
BIOTECHNOLOGY AT THE
SERVICE OF THE PEOPLE.

00:42:23.355 --> 00:42:27.234
MALNUTRITION HAS BEEN
A PLIGHT ON HUMANITY

00:42:27.235 --> 00:42:30.224
SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF ITS HISTORY.

00:42:30.225 --> 00:42:33.334
CIVILIZATION BEGAN WITH
THE DOMESTICATION OF

00:42:33.335 --> 00:42:36.204
PLANTS AND ANIMALS -
INVENTIONS THAT ALLOWED

00:42:36.205 --> 00:42:38.354
HUMANS TO FEED THEMSELVES
WITHOUT HAVING TO

00:42:38.355 --> 00:42:41.434
SPEND ALL THEIR
ENERGIES IN DOING SO.

00:42:41.435 --> 00:42:44.364
ALSO SINCE THE DAWN OF
MAN AND IN DIFFERENT

00:42:44.365 --> 00:42:47.324
REGIONS OF THE WORLD
AND MOMENTS IN HISTORY,

00:42:47.325 --> 00:42:49.404
THE MASTERY OF
ONE SMALL GROUP

00:42:49.405 --> 00:42:52.314
OVER THE REST HAS
BEEN A CONSTANT THAT

00:42:52.315 --> 00:42:54.394
EXPLAINS THE OVER
ABUNDANCE OF SOME

00:42:54.395 --> 00:43:04.334
AT THE EXPENSE OF
THE MISERY OF MANY.

00:43:04.335 --> 00:43:07.254
BUT ONLY NOW DOES MAN
HAVE THE ABILITY TO FEED

00:43:07.255 --> 00:43:09.284
THE ENTIRE POPULATION
OF THE WORLD

00:43:09.285 --> 00:43:12.204
WITHOUT RUINING
THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:43:12.205 --> 00:43:14.384
WE HAVE THE MEANS,
WHAT WE DO NOT HAVE

00:43:14.385 --> 00:43:18.284
IS THE POLITICAL WILL.

00:43:18.285 --> 00:43:22.214
THE GREEN REVOLUTION WITH
ALL ITS IMPERFECTIONS

00:43:22.215 --> 00:43:24.344
SHOWED THE WAY.

00:43:24.345 --> 00:43:27.244
THE MILLENNIUM OBJECTIVES
ARE A LOFTY GOAL

00:43:27.245 --> 00:43:29.404
THAT WE CANNOT
SEEM TO ACHIEVE.

00:43:29.405 --> 00:43:31.414
IN THE AREA
OF FOOD SUPPLY

00:43:31.415 --> 00:43:34.234
IT IS NECESSARY TO
FIND A NEW PARADIGM,

00:43:34.235 --> 00:43:37.194
NEW PRODUCTION AND
CONSUMPTION HABITS.

00:43:37.195 --> 00:43:39.354
WE NEED FOOD THAT IS
BASED LESS ON FATS

00:43:39.355 --> 00:43:42.264
AND RICHER IN LEGUMES,
FRUIT AND VEGETABLES

00:43:42.265 --> 00:43:44.334
AS WELL AS HEALTHY
PROTEINS THAT

00:43:44.335 --> 00:43:47.394
REQUIRE LESS ENERGY
TO BE PRODUCED.

00:43:47.395 --> 00:43:52.294
WE MUST INCREASE OUR
DEPENDENCE ON MORE

00:43:52.295 --> 00:43:54.424
ENERGETICALLY
SOUND ANIMALS

00:43:54.425 --> 00:43:58.354
VIS A VIS STANDARD
FATTY CATTLE.

00:43:58.355 --> 00:44:01.354
WE MUST PROMOTE
RESPONSIBLE BIOTECHNOLOGY

00:44:01.355 --> 00:44:04.384
METHODS AND DEPEND LESS
ON FOSSIL FUELS AND WATER

00:44:04.385 --> 00:44:15.364
WHEN PRODUCING
OUR FOOD SOURCES.

00:44:15.365 --> 00:44:18.214
MALNUTRITION IS NOT
ONLY A CONSEQUENCE

00:44:18.215 --> 00:44:21.304
BUT ONE OF THE CAUSES
OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT.

00:44:21.305 --> 00:44:24.204
WHEN ALL IS
SAID AND DONE,

00:44:24.205 --> 00:44:26.404
THIS UNDERDEVELOPMENT
WILL THREATEN THE PATH

00:44:26.405 --> 00:44:28.414
TO COMMON WELFARE
AND SECURITY,

00:44:28.415 --> 00:44:31.384
MAKING THESE LOFTY
GOALS AVAILABLE ONLY TO

00:44:31.385 --> 00:44:45.364
A SELECT FEW AND ALWAYS
SUBJECT TO VIOLENT CRISES.

00:44:45.365 --> 00:44:48.434
A PARENT THAT GOES TO BED
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH AND AN

00:44:48.435 --> 00:44:52.234
EVEN EMPTIER SOUL FOR NOT
BRINGING FOOD TO THE TABLE

00:44:52.235 --> 00:44:56.194
TO FEED HIS FAMILY CANNOT
FEEL SECURE AND BE AT PEACE.

00:44:56.195 --> 00:44:58.194
BUT HIS NEIGHBOR
WITH A FULL STOMACH

00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:00.344
CANNOT FEEL SATISFIED
EITHER IF HE KNOWS

00:45:00.345 --> 00:45:03.394
THAT THERE IS HUNGER
JUST NEXT DOOR.

00:45:03.395 --> 00:45:06.464
IN A GLOBAL WORLD
THE INJUSTICE OF AN

00:45:06.465 --> 00:45:09.465
UNBALANCED ACCESS TO FOOD
IS EVERYONE'S PROBLEM.
