(gentle music)

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.092
- [Voiceover] Several
grains of the ancient world

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:39.208
are recently making a comeback

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:41.041
due to modern man's pursuit

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.667
of a healthier lifestyle.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:44.999
Quinoa, amaranth, spelt,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.208
some of the grains
that flourished

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.041
during the early civilization,

00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:50.999
and yet perished as
the world entered

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.375
the modern era.

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:55.125
But if there is one
ancient grain that can

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:58.500
personify immortality,

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.709
that would be maize.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:02.583
Belonging to the grass
tribe Andropogonae,

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:08.041
of the family gramineae,

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:09.792
maize or zea maize, is
believed to have been

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:12.999
cultivated first in Mesoamerica,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.583
in 2100 BC.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.709
The Mayan civilization,

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:20.999
one of the greatest
early civilizations

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.999
in America and in the world,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.125
was primarily based on maize.

00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.291
The Mayans were
great agriculturists.

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:30.999
They were not only
known for their

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:32.667
sophisticated irrigation system,

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.000
but also for the advanced
cultivating techniques

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.999
they used to develop
maize from a wild variety

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:40.792
of grass called teosinte.

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.125
For some time, maize's
true origin was a mystery

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:47.750
for botanists, archaeologists,

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:49.999
historians, and
even geneticists.

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.792
Many questioned if
teosinte is maize's

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.166
true ancestor, due to
their dissimilarities.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:59.999
Until in 1932, American
Nobel Prize winner,

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:04.375
George Beadle of
Cornell University

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:06.959
conducted researches
and experiments

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:09.208
that scientifically
validated that maize

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:11.999
and teosinte share
similar chromosomes,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.999
and that they came
from the same specie.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.542
In a more recent study,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:21.333
botanist John Doebley of
the University of Wisconsin,

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.792
was able to identify
maize's paternity.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.583
By comparing DNA
profiles of teosinte

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.000
from various
geographical locations

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:34.333
and different
varieties of maize,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.667
he found out that maize
and the teosinte found

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:39.291
in central Balsas River
Valley of southern Mexico,

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:42.999
were the most
genetically similar.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:45.959
So, he postulated
that central Balsas

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.625
is the cradle of
maize evolution,

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:51.417
and estimated that
domestication occurred

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.834
about 9,000 years ago.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.083
Maize is a very adaptable plant

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.875
since it can grow in
almost any type of soil,

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.750
except in soils
with high salinity.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:06.999
And depending on the variety,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:08.417
soil and climate conditions,

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.333
growing maize can
take as little as

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.375
60 days, or as long as 120 days.

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:15.917
It's a very tall
plant that grows up to

00:03:17.417 --> 00:03:19.625
an average height of eight feet.

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:22.208
Its singular stem is
physically similar

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:24.625
to that of a bamboo cane.

00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:26.583
With an average of 20
alternating internodes,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.417
and from each node, a
leaf sprouts with an

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:32.000
average length of four feet.

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.999
It grows a tassel on
its top most part,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.333
which can release
millions of grains,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.875
and is responsible
for producing pollen

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.999
that can fertilize
the cob or ear.

00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.750
A cob is usually 15
to 39 centimeters long

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:48.999
and can have up to 800 kernels.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.333
Yellow is the most
famous color of maize.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:56.458
However, due to
hybridization there are

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.999
over 60 varieties of this grain

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.208
in the market today,

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.834
and it comes in different colors

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.792
such as red, pink, black,

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.375
blue, and purple.

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:09.999
Each variety has
its specific use,

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:12.125
and it reaches the market
in a specific form.

00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:15.375
For example, the
variety saccharata,

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:18.999
or rugosa, cultivated
to have young ears

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.999
and more sugar than
other varieties,

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.083
is known in the market
at "sweet corn".

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.917
The variety, amylacea,

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:30.208
grown to have starchy kernels,

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.458
is processed into what
we know as corn flower.

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:36.250
The variety everta,

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:38.208
arrives in the
market as popcorn.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:40.999
And the variety
called indentata,

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.333
is mostly grown
as livestock feed,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.999
and is an ingredient in
some industrial products.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.166
It's simply fascinating
how a grain can

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.709
withstand the test
of time and history,

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.083
and remain invaluable
and indispensable today,

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.999
as it did thousands
of years ago.

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:05.125
(gentle music)

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:12.542
(upbeat music)

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.917
The ancient grain maize,

00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:39.250
has provided the
Mayan civilization

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:41.667
a great service of
feeding and nourishing

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:43.999
its people, physically
and spiritually.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.999
Aside from its religious roles,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.999
its nutrient profile
is also responsible

00:05:51.083 --> 00:05:53.709
for allowing the Mayans,
and other indigenous

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:55.999
Americans enjoy healthy lives.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.999
Maize's high fiber content
makes it beneficial

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.999
to people who are at
risk of heart diseases,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.792
due to its cholesterol
reducing capabilities.

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:10.709
The soluble fiber of
maize binds itself

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:12.999
with cholesterol and
excretes it naturally,

00:06:13.083 --> 00:06:16.333
thus preventing the body
from absorbing it further.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.999
Meanwhile, the
insoluble fiber of maize

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.709
removes toxins from
the digestive tract.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:25.999
It absorbs water
which softens stools

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:28.500
for easier and more
regular bowel movements.

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:31.333
Since it prevents constipation,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.083
promotes a cleaner and
healthier digestive system,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.875
it reduces the risk
of colon cancer.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:40.999
Maize has more
vitamin A compared

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:45.000
to other grains.

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.000
It has beta crypto-xanthin,

00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:48.999
a phytonutrient,
converted into vitamin A,

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:52.125
and is believed to
have anti-inflammatory

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:54.542
properties that
can benefit people

00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:56.999
with rheumatic arthritis.

00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.333
It can also provide
B vitamins, thiamin,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.999
niacin, and folate, which
promote healthy nerves,

00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:05.834
and cognitive functions.

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.000
These also aid the
body's natural metabolism

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:10.709
process by facilitating
the conversion

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.333
of carbohydrates into energy.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.667
Folic acid deficiency
is common among pregnant

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:19.458
women, so eating maize
may keep them and

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:22.542
their babies nourished
throughout the pregnancy.

00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:26.583
Potassium,
phosphorous, megnesium

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.083
are maizes top three minerals,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.375
which are all crucial in
maintaining bone health.

00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:34.417
In addition, magnesium
also contributes

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:37.208
in regulating heart rate.

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.999
Maize also contains
various anti-oxidants,

00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:42.999
and phytonutrients.

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:44.999
However, presence and amounts

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:46.834
depend on the variety.

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.709
For example, yellow
corn is rich in

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.583
carotenoids, lutein,
and zeaxanthin.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.999
Blue corn has a high
anthocyanin content.

00:07:58.083 --> 00:08:01.083
And purple corn contains
protocatechuic acid.

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:06.000
Other phytonutrients
found in maize are

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.792
ferulic acid, beta-carotene,

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.999
vanillic acid, coumaric acid,

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:17.834
caffeic acid, and syringic acid.

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:21.709
To fully appreciate
its nutritional value,

00:08:25.625 --> 00:08:28.291
here's how much 100
grams of maize can

00:08:28.458 --> 00:08:30.999
contribute to a person's
daily requirement

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.709
of nutrients,
minerals, and vitamins.

00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:36.417
100 grams of maize can
provide a person with

00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:41.999
eleven percent of
his daily requirement

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:44.166
of dietary fiber,
six percent of his

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:47.083
protein and carbohydrate
requirements,

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.999
and four percent of his
calorie requirement.

00:08:49.999 --> 00:08:53.083
For a person's daily
requirement of mineral intake,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
100 grams of maize can provide

00:08:59.166 --> 00:09:01.208
nine percent magnesium,
nine percent phosphorous,

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:04.999
eight percent potassium,

00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.750
and eight percent manganese.

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:09.125
Intake of 100 grams
of maize also provides

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:15.542
thirteen percent of the
daily required thiamin,

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:19.500
eleven percent of the
daily required Vitamin C

00:09:19.667 --> 00:09:22.208
and folate, and
nine percent of the

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:25.041
daily required niacin.

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:27.333
Good thing maize comes
in varying forms,

00:09:32.542 --> 00:09:34.999
so it can be enjoyed
in numerous ways.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.667
Whether it's consumed
as an ingredient

00:09:40.999 --> 00:09:42.875
in baked goods, as
a morning cereal,

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.166
or straight from the cob,

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:47.291
maize is undeniably
one of nature's

00:09:47.458 --> 00:09:49.250
greatest gifts to mankind.

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:51.999
(gentle piano music)

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:55.291
(gentle music)

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.333
(upbeat music)

00:10:17.999 --> 00:10:21.959
Many of the early
cultures of the world

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.542
highly revered
nature for providing

00:10:36.709 --> 00:10:38.917
almost everything
that mankind needs

00:10:38.999 --> 00:10:41.375
for the continuance
of its specie.

00:10:41.542 --> 00:10:43.583
The Mayan civilization
regarded maize

00:10:51.999 --> 00:10:54.583
as a sacred grain.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.792
For the Mayans, maize
played a key role

00:10:56.959 --> 00:10:59.250
in their creation.

00:10:59.417 --> 00:11:02.125
According to legend,
men were made from

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:04.667
a white corn seed hidden inside

00:11:04.834 --> 00:11:07.417
a great mountain.

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.250
A rain deity used an ax
made from lightening,

00:11:09.417 --> 00:11:12.041
to split open the mountain.

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:14.291
This burnt some
of the corn seeds,

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:16.500
resulting in other seed colors,

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:18.917
yellow, black,

00:11:18.999 --> 00:11:21.625
and red.

00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:24.500
The deities then
took the corn seeds,

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.875
ground them, and
used them as dough

00:11:26.999 --> 00:11:28.999
to form the first humans.

00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:31.375
The Native Americans
who migrated north,

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.583
also have legends
centering on maize.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:54.375
The Sauk, and Mesquakie Indians

00:11:54.542 --> 00:11:56.583
who lived in what
we know now as Iowa,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:59.041
had a story on how
maize, or corn,

00:11:59.208 --> 00:12:01.875
came to be.

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.999
According to their legend,

00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:05.667
while two of their
ancestors were sitting

00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:07.500
by a fire roasting
a deer to eat,

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:10.041
a beautiful woman
descended to Earth

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:12.500
from the clouds.

00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:14.000
Assuming that the
woman was hungry,

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:15.999
they offered the deer to her.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:18.375
After that, the woman
instructed them to

00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:20.500
return to that
place after one year

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:22.999
to get their reward.

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:24.999
The woman floated
back to the clouds

00:12:25.041 --> 00:12:26.875
and disappeared.

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:28.500
A year later, together
with their village people,

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.709
they returned to the
place and they saw maize

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:33.458
growing from where
the woman's right

00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:35.125
hand had rested,

00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:36.999
beans from where
left hand rested,

00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:40.875
and tobacco from
where she was seated.

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:43.542
Other societies from
Mesoamerica also had

00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:50.166
legends and deities
dedicated to maize.

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:53.959
The Aztecs had Centeotl,
and Chicomeocatl,

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:57.999
the god and goddess
of corn respectively.

00:12:58.041 --> 00:13:01.333
The Cherokees had the
corn goddess Selu.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.500
And the Keresan
people of the American

00:13:06.917 --> 00:13:08.959
southwest had Iyatiku.

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:11.834
Maize also played a part
in the history of slavery.

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:22.917
Because maize was
one of the major

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:24.542
plantation crops, it
was one of the rations

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:27.417
usually given to
slaves along with

00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:29.709
meat, peas, and okra.

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.417
Some of the common
foods slaves made

00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:34.291
from maize were Cush, a sweet

00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:36.709
and fried cornmeal cake.

00:13:36.875 --> 00:13:38.999
Fufu, also called
Turnmeal and Flower

00:13:38.999 --> 00:13:41.417
in South Carolina,
made by mixing cornmeal

00:13:41.583 --> 00:13:44.709
and flower in a pot
of boiling water,

00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:47.333
creating a mixture
to make a hotcake,

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.375
or ash cakes.

00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:51.208
And Pone Bread, made
from a mush of cornmeal.

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:54.999
There is one fascinating
view on maize,

00:13:58.375 --> 00:14:00.999
and that is how its
morphology embodies

00:14:00.999 --> 00:14:03.083
the complementing natures
of a male and female.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.999
The tassel, identified
as the male part

00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:09.166
of a maize plant,
produces pollen that

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:11.875
fertilizes the ear,
the female part.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:14.500
(upbeat music)

00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:17.999
Different legends and
myths involving maize

00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:39.834
have been handed down
from one generation

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:41.999
to the next.

00:14:42.125 --> 00:14:43.875
But regardless of
these varying beliefs,

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:45.999
one truth remains,

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:48.000
and that is maize's
immense contribution

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:50.417
to man across history.

00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:52.291
(gentle music)

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:55.375
(gentle music)

00:15:10.999 --> 00:15:13.625
(gentle piano music)

00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:23.999
For 9,000 years, maize
remains one of the

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:02.583
top cultivated
crops in the world.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.500
From its origin in Mesoamerica,

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:07.999
it traveled to Europe,
Africa, and Asia,

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:10.875
and offered its many
uses to other cultures.

00:16:10.999 --> 00:16:14.208
According to the United
States' Department

00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:20.041
of Agriculture database,

00:16:20.208 --> 00:16:21.999
the United States
was top producer

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.041
of maize in 2011,

00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:26.500
with 328,033,000 metric tons.

00:16:26.667 --> 00:16:30.917
China came in second with
178,000,000 metric tons,

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:35.333
and Europe came in
third with 60,093,000

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.875
metric tons.

00:16:38.999 --> 00:16:40.583
Brazil, Argentina,
Mexico, India,

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.583
Ukraine, South
Africa, and Canada

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.834
round off the top ten.

00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:48.625
In 2012, the United States
remained the world's

00:16:52.208 --> 00:16:54.709
top maize producer,
harvesting 87.4 million

00:16:54.875 --> 00:16:58.917
acres of field, and
accounted for 32 percent

00:16:58.999 --> 00:17:01.999
of the world's total harvest.

00:17:02.083 --> 00:17:04.750
Corn is processed into
different products,

00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:11.792
like flour,

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:13.709
flakes,

00:17:13.875 --> 00:17:15.000
popcorn,

00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.583
and cornmeal.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.375
But it's also processed
to make corn oil,

00:17:20.999 --> 00:17:23.709
syrups and sweeteners,

00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:25.625
particularly high
fructose corn syrup.

00:17:25.792 --> 00:17:28.999
And it's also a
traditional source

00:17:28.999 --> 00:17:30.834
of bourbon whiskey.

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:33.375
In addition to its
traditional and conventional

00:17:36.375 --> 00:17:38.583
uses in cooking and livestock,

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.999
it's also being used
to produced ethanol.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.999
Wet milling and dry
milling are the two known

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:54.750
processes in creating ethanol.

00:17:54.917 --> 00:17:57.375
Though both
processes effectively

00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:00.834
produce ethanol from maize,

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:02.999
dry milling is
more commonly used.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:05.750
Kernels are ground and
combined with water

00:18:12.542 --> 00:18:14.917
to form a mash.

00:18:14.999 --> 00:18:16.792
Enzymes are then added
to convert the starch

00:18:16.959 --> 00:18:18.999
into a simple sugar
called dextrose.

00:18:19.125 --> 00:18:21.999
Prior to fermentation,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.917
bacteria levels are reduced

00:18:23.999 --> 00:18:25.875
by cooking it in
high temperature.

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:28.417
And then yeast is added
to begin fermentation.

00:18:28.583 --> 00:18:30.999
Sugar begins to be
converted into ethanol

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:36.083
and carbon dioxide.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.583
After fermentation, ethanol
is finally distilled

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:41.999
and blended with about
five percent denaturant,

00:18:42.083 --> 00:18:44.999
like natural gasoline,
before its distributed

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:48.041
and sold as biomass fuel.

00:18:48.208 --> 00:18:50.999
(gentle piano music)

00:18:55.625 --> 00:18:58.917
Ever wonder how ancient
maize wound up with

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.500
over sixty varieties?

00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:06.208
It's because it's one
of botany and genetics

00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:08.417
early favorite subjects.

00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:10.999
In the early 1900's,
George Hall explored

00:19:10.999 --> 00:19:14.083
maize cross-breeding, and
reported that hybrids,

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.375
or the cross-bred maize,

00:19:17.542 --> 00:19:19.125
showed more vigor and yield.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:21.625
His findings lead to better
cultivation and yield,

00:19:21.792 --> 00:19:24.500
not just of maize, but
other crops as well,

00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:27.417
which proved beneficial
during the war

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:29.999
and post-war eras.

00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:31.500
No wonder maize managed
to remain in the

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:50.999
spotlight for
thousands of years.

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:53.999
Its food and non-food
uses made it a source

00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:56.458
of endless fascination
and possibilities

00:19:56.625 --> 00:19:59.041
for man's growing needs.

00:19:59.208 --> 00:20:01.999
(gentle music)

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:13.875
(upbeat music)

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:22.333
Most grains are usually ground

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:26.333
before they can be consumed.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.583
But not maize.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.417
Certain varieties of maize,

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:32.166
particularly the sweetcorn,

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:33.959
can be eaten straight
from its cob.

00:20:33.999 --> 00:20:36.667
Just boil it and then
season with butter,

00:20:36.834 --> 00:20:38.999
salt, and pepper.

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:40.625
Italians have a native
dish called polenta,

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.041
made from a mash of ground corn,

00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:48.125
and is today
synonymous to cornmeal.

00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:50.500
Here's a simple cornmeal
recipe you can try called

00:20:52.542 --> 00:20:55.417
Breakfast Cornmeal with
Warm Berry Compote.

00:20:55.583 --> 00:20:58.999
For the compote you will need

00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:00.667
one tablespoon of butter,

00:21:00.834 --> 00:21:02.709
three tablespoons of honey,

00:21:02.875 --> 00:21:04.542
one tablespoon of
fresh lemon juice,

00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:07.083
a dash of ground cinnamon,

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:09.417
and assorted frozen berries.

00:21:09.583 --> 00:21:11.417
To make the compote,

00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:14.834
in a pan melt butter,

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:16.709
add the berries,
honey, and cinnamon.

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:19.458
Bring it to a boil,
then simmer until

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.959
thoroughly heated.

00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:23.709
Mix in lemon juice,
and set aside.

00:21:23.875 --> 00:21:25.999
For the cornmeal
prepare the following,

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:29.041
two cups of water,

00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:31.166
two cups of milk,

00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:33.458
one cup of cornmeal or polenta,

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:36.917
three tablespoons of sugar,

00:21:36.999 --> 00:21:38.999
and one teaspoon salt.

00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:40.999
Combine milk and one
cup water in a saucepan,

00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:44.625
and bring to a boil.

00:21:44.792 --> 00:21:46.709
In another bowl, combine
remaining one cup

00:21:46.875 --> 00:21:48.999
of water, with cornmeal,
sugar, and salt.

00:21:48.999 --> 00:21:51.834
Then add this mixture
to the boiling water.

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:55.125
Stir constantly to get
a thick consistency.

00:21:55.291 --> 00:21:58.583
Reduce heat, let it cook
for another five minutes,

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.999
and then serve with
a berry compote.

00:22:02.083 --> 00:22:04.000
Here's a refreshing
side dish using corn

00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:07.750
called Sweetcorn with
Baby Beets and Basil.

00:22:07.917 --> 00:22:11.667
Just prepare a
pinch of core salt,

00:22:11.834 --> 00:22:14.250
and freshly ground pepper,

00:22:14.417 --> 00:22:16.166
two ears of corn
husked and halved,

00:22:16.333 --> 00:22:18.917
eight baby beets
trimmed and scrubbed,

00:22:18.999 --> 00:22:21.750
extra virgin olive
oil for drizzling,

00:22:21.917 --> 00:22:24.417
and one to two tablespoons
torn, fresh basil.

00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:27.999
First, cook corn
in a pot of water,

00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:30.625
season with salt and
bring it to a boil

00:22:30.792 --> 00:22:32.999
in about four minutes.

00:22:32.999 --> 00:22:34.999
Remove from water
and put on a plate.

00:22:35.083 --> 00:22:38.000
Then cook the beets in
the same pot of water

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:40.625
for 30 to 35 minutes.

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:43.125
Cool them first before peeling

00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:45.083
and cutting them into quarters.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:47.041
Using a knife or corn kerneler,

00:22:47.208 --> 00:22:49.166
separate the kernels on the cobs

00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:51.291
and put them in a bowl.

00:22:51.458 --> 00:22:53.333
Add the beets, drizzle with oil,

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.709
garnish with torn basil,

00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:57.709
and lastly season with
salt and pepper to taste.

00:22:57.875 --> 00:23:01.000
(gentle music)

00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:06.041
It doesn't matter
whether you call it maize

00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:08.917
or corn, it still refers
to that very unique

00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:11.999
and versatile grain
which connects the modern

00:23:12.125 --> 00:23:14.625
world to its early
and humble beginnings.

00:23:14.792 --> 00:23:17.792
