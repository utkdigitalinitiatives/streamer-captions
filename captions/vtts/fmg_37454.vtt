00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
LATIN AMERICAN LITERATURE
OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
WAS FORGED DURING AN ERA
OF TUMULT AND CHANGE.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
INDEPENDENT COUNTRIES
EMERGED FROM THE

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
FORMER COLONIES
OF THE NEW WORLD,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
AND THE VOICE OF THE
INDIGENOUS PEOPLES

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
- VIOLENTLY REPRESSED
THROUGH THE COURSE

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
OF THE CONQUEST - BEGAN
TO REASSERT ITSELF

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
IN THE CULTURAL DIALOG
OF THE CONTINENT.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
THE PROCESS OF ACHIEVING
INDEPENDENCE WAS COMPLEX

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
AND FRAUGHT WITH BOTH
POLITICS AND SYMBOLISM

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
AS LATIN AMERICA
TOOK ON THE TASK

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
OF GRAPPLING
WITH ITS PAST.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
UTOPIAN VISIONS OF THE
FUTURE CO-MINGLED WITH

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
FRANK ASSESSMENTS OF
THE PAST, AND THE NEWLY

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
DEFINED POPULATIONS OF
THIS CONTINUALLY EVOLVING

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
CONTINENT SET ABOUT
CREATING A LANGUAGE

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
AND A LITERATURE THAT
WERE NEW, LOCAL,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
AND UTTERLY
THEIR OWN.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:27.000
*

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000
*

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
*

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT
WHEN THE MAJOR AESTHETIC

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
MOVEMENTS OF NINETEENTH
CENTURY EUROPE

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
- ROMANTICISM, REALISM,
AND NATURALISM -

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
MADE THEIR WAY ACROSS
THE OCEAN, THE NEW WORLD

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
INTERPRETED THEM IN
ENTIRELY NEW WAYS.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
WHILE ENORMOUSLY
INFLUENTIAL,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
THESE MOVEMENTS
LANDED IN A VIBRANT

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
CULTURAL MILIEU WITH
ITS OWN HISTORY.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
IN LATIN AMERICA THE
CLEAR-CUT LINES OF

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
DEMARCATION BETWEEN
ROMANTICISM, REALISM,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
AND NATURALISM
BECAME BLURRED AND,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
IN SOME CASES,
IRRELEVANT.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
IN THE LITERATURE OF THIS
PERIOD, INSPIRATION FLOWED

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
FROM THE SAME SOURCES THAT
FED THE EMERGING LOCAL AND

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
CONTINENTAL IDENTITIES
- IDENTITIES WHICH,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
WHILE NEVER
COMPLETELY HARMONIOUS,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
WERE ALWAYS DISTINCT
AND COMPELLING.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
1800'S, THE GENRE THAT HAD

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
DOMINATED ALL OF LATIN
AMERICA LITERATURE WAS,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
WITHOUT QUESTION,
THE NOVEL.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
BASED ON THE ROMANTIC
MODEL AND ON THE

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
MYRIAD ACCOUNTS THAT
CHRONICLED THE CONQUEST,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
THE LATIN AMERICAN
NOVEL OF THIS PERIOD

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
BROUGHT TOGETHER
HISTORY AND LITERATURE

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
IN A SYNTHESIS THAT OWED AS
MUCH TO SIR WALTER SCOTT

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
AS IT DID TO
ROMANTIC NOTIONS

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
OF NATION, HISTORY,
AND SUBJECTIVITY.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
AND WHILE LATIN AMERICAN
NOVELS UNDOUBTEDLY

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
MIRRORED THE INFLUENCE OF
IMPORTED EUROPEAN AESTHETICS,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
THAT REFLECTION WAS
OFTEN SO DISTORTED,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
REFINED, AND ADAPTED BY
NEW WORLD SENSIBILITIES

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
AS TO BE VIRTUALLY
UNRECOGNIZABLE

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
TO OLD WORLD ARTISTS.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE
AROSE NARRATIVES

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
THAT WOULD PROVE TO BE
CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
NOT ONLY
AESTHETICALLY,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
BUT IDEOLOGICALLY AND
POLITICALLY AS WELL.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
IN THEM, LOCAL HISTORY
AND FICTION INTERTWINE,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
CREATING TALES THAT FORM
THE IDEA OF NATIONHOOD,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
A CRUCIAL STEP IN THE
POST-INDEPENDENCE PROCESS.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
WHEN ONE THINKS OF THE
EMERGENCE OF THE NOVEL

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
IN LATIN AMERICA IN THE
1800'S, IT IS GENERALLY

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
ASSOCIATED WITH THE
ISSUE OF NATIONHOOD,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
OF BECOMING A NATION.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
HOWEVER, IF WE
LOOK AT SOME CASES

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
THAT WE MIGHT
CALL "LOCAL",

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
WE SEE IMPORTANT
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
WHEN CONSIDERING
THE EMERGENCE

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
OF THE NOVEL GENRE.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
AMONG THE CLASSIC
FOUNDATIONAL TALES ARE

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
AMALIA BY
JOSE MARMOL,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
SAB BY GERTRUDIS
GOMEZ DE AVELLANEDA,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
MARIA BY
JORGE ISAACS,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
ENRIQUILLO BY
MANUEL JESUS GALVAN,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
AND MARTIN RIVAS BY
ALBERTO BLEST GANA.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
BEFORE, THE
CRITICS WOULD SAY,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
SURE MARTIN RIVAS IS
A SENTIMENTAL NOVEL,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
BUT THERE'S MORE
TO IT THAN THAT.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
LET'S TALK ABOUT ITS MOST
OBVIOUS CHARACTERISTIC.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
IT'S A
SENTIMENTAL NOVEL.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
IT MAKES YOU THINK,
FEEL, BREATHE,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
LISTEN TO YOUR HEARTBEAT
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
PHENOMENON AS A WHOLE...

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
AND IT OCCURS
BETWEEN 1850 AND 1880.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
OVER THE SPAN OF
ONE GENERATION.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
DEMOCRACY THEN HAD A WIDE
RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
PEOPLE WERE ABLE
TO IMAGINE,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
OR AT LEAST LONG FOR,
RELATIONSHIPS BASED ON

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
EQUALITY, MUTUAL
DEPENDENCY,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
AS OPPOSED TO THOSE BASED
ON ABUSING THE OTHER PERSON.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
THE TRADITION OF THE
SENTIMENTAL NOVEL REACHES

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
BACK TO PRE-ROMANTIC
ANTECEDENTS SUCH AS

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU, WHO
DESCRIBED THE FUNDAMENTAL

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
DIVIDE BETWEEN SOCIETY AND
HUMAN NATURE, AND TO THE

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
ROMANTICISM OF JOHANN
WOLFGANG GOETHE'S NOVEL

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
THE SORROWS OF
 YOUNG WERTHER.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
THESE WRITERS EMPHASIZED
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
SENTIMENT, VIRTUE,
SENSIBILITY, AND SOCIETY

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
- GIVING RISE TO A
LITERARY TRADITION

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
THAT WOULD SET DEEP
ROOTS IN LATIN AMERICA.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
PERHAPS THE MOST
EXCEPTIONAL SENTIMENTAL

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
NOVEL OF THE PERIOD WAS
 MARIA, A WORK BY THE

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
COLOMBIAN JORGE ISAACS,
WHO EARNED THE NICKNAME

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000
"THE GENTLEMAN
OF THE TEARS".

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
MARIA WAS FIRST
PUBLISHED IN BOGOTA,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
COLUMBIA IN 1867.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
ITS PUBLICATION AS
A FULL-FLEDGED NOVEL

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
WAS ITSELF REMARKABLE, AS
MOST NOVELS OF THE TIME

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
WERE SERIALIZED
IN NEWSPAPERS.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
THIS FATEFUL
LOVE STORY

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
ENJOYED ALMOST
IMMEDIATE SUCCESS;

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.000
BY 1889 IT HAD REACHED
ITS TWENTY-FIRST EDITION.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
MARIA TELLS THE TRAGIC
LOVE STORY OF MARIA AND

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
HER COUSIN EFRAIN, WHO ARE
FROM VALLE DEL CAUCA -

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
A STATE IN WESTERN COLOMBIA
THAT BORDERS THE PACIFIC.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
THIS IS A NOVEL ABOUT
LOSS AND BANISHMENT,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
ABOUT PARADISE LOST, AND BY
ANALOGY IT ADDRESSES THE

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
DIFFICULTIES OF CREATING
A NATION OUT OF A COLONY.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
IN KEEPING WITH THE
ROMANTIC IDEALIZATION

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
OF THE ARTIST, THE STORY
IS HIGHLY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
ISAACS HIMSELF WAS A
NATIVE OF VALLE DEL CAUCA

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
AND, LIKE HIS
HERO EFRAIN,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
WENT TO BOGOTA TO
PURSUE HIS STUDIES.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
MARIA IS A NOVEL THAT CAN
BE READ ON DIFFERENT LEVELS.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
SO THERE'S AN EMOTIONAL
LEVEL, WHICH IS A MORE

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
ADOLESCENT READING
OF THE NOVEL.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
BUT THERE'S ALSO A
POLITICAL READING BECAUSE

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
IT'S A NOVEL WHERE THE
ISSUE OF SLAVERY APPEARS.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
AND PERHAPS
THIS IS OVERLOOKED

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
IN AN EMOTIONAL
READING OF THE BOOK.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
WHAT IS IT THAT IS MOST
MEMORABLE ABOUT MARIA?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
THE POLITICAL PART?
THE EMOTIONAL PART?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
IT'S ALSO A NOVEL THAT HAS
AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL SLANT.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
AND THAT ALLOWS FOR
READING ON ANOTHER LEVEL.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
IT CAN ALSO BE READ
LOOKING AT THE PASSAGE OF

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000
A PRE-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY
TO A MODERN SOCIETY.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
A PRE-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY
TO A MODERN SOCIETY.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
THE NOVEL UNFOLDS ALMOST
DETERMINISTICALLY,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
THE OUTCOME KNOWN TO THE
READER FROM THE OUTSET

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
THANKS TO A DEDICATION
THAT ANTICIPATES

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
THE PROTAGONISTS' DEATH:

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
THUS, THE SKY,
 THE HORIZONS,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
THE PAMPAS AND THE
 SUMMITS OF THE CAUCA

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
MAKE ANYONE WHO CONTEMPLATES
 THEM FALL SILENT.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
THE GREAT BEAUTY OF
 CREATION CANNOT BE SEEN

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
AND SUNG OF
 SIMULTANEOUSLY.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
THEY MUST RETURN
 TO ONE'S SOUL,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
MADE PALLID BY
 UNFAITHFUL MEMORY.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
LATIN AMERICA'S HISTORICAL
NOVELS CARRIED ON

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
IN THE TRADITION OF SIR
WALTER SCOTT'S IVANHOE

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
AND WERE IMBUED WITH
THE SENSIBILITIES OF

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
ROMANTICISM, THE DOMINANT
AESTHETIC OF THE TIME.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
HOWEVER, THE CONTINENT
TURNED TO ITS OWN PAST FOR

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
INSPIRATION, RECOUNTING
THE DEEDS AND EXPLOITS OF

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
THE CONQUISTADORS WHILE
AT THE SAME TIME SHOWING

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
THE INFLUENCE OF ALEXANDRE
DUMAS AND VICTOR HUGO.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
THE FIRST LATIN AMERICAN
HISTORICAL NOVEL,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
PUBLISHED ANONYMOUSLY IN
1826, TOLD THE STORY OF AN

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
INDIGENOUS WARRIOR NAMED
JICOTENCAL WHO DID BATTLE

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
WITH THE INVADING FORCES
LED BY HERNAN CORTES.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
WHILE A MINOR NOVEL
BY ANY STANDARD,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
JICOTENCAL MARKED
THE GENESIS OF

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
A GENRE THAT WOULD
BECOME WILDLY POPULAR

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
THROUGHOUT
THE CONTINENT.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
THESE WORKS WERE UNITED
BY A COMMON GOAL:

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
TO REBUILD
THE CONTINENT'S

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
NATIONAL AND
CULTURAL IDENTITIES

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
IN THE WAKE OF
ACHIEVING INDEPENDENCE.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
THEY TRUSTED IN THE
POWER OF THE PAST

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
TO INFORM THE PRESENT,
AND ASSUMED THAT

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THERE WAS AN ORGANIC
SUCCESSION TO EVENTS

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
WHICH WOULD HAVE
MEANING FOR THE READER.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000
HISTORY, LIKE LITERATURE,
IS LOCAL AND COMPLEX.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:06.000
THE IDEA OF IDENTITY AS
SOMETHING ESSENTIAL...

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
IS A MYTH...

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
AND SOMETIMES A
MYSTIFICATION.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
BUT THEY WERE CONSIDERING
HOW TO BUILD A NEW SOCIETY

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
WHICH HAD CHARACTERISTICS
THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
SHARE WITH A RATHER
LIMITED AUDIENCE,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:40.000
IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE
THERE WEREN'T MANY READERS.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
AND ALSO BECAUSE THE
READERS MIGHT HAVE BEEN

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000
RELUCTANT DUE TO THEIR
READINGS OF FRENCH AUTHORS.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
SOME OF THE MOST OUTSTANDING
AUTHORS OF THIS GENRE

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
WERE THE ECUADORIAN
JUAN LEON DE MENA,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THE DOMINICAN MANUEL
DE JESUS GALVAN,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
THE MEXICAN VICENTE

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
THE BOLIVIAN
NATANIEL AGUIRRE,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
AND ALBERTO BLEST
GANA FROM CHILE.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
BESIDES THE CONQUEST
OF THE NEW WORLD,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
THE PREDOMINANT
THEMES IN THEIR WORKS

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
WERE PRE-COLOMBIAN
SOCIETIES

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
AND THE STRUGGLES OF
THE EARLY COLONIALISTS.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
MANY WORKS, SUCH AS
 THE HERETIC'S LOVE

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
BY THE ARGENTINEAN WRITER
VICENTE FIDEL LOPEZ,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION
TO THE OVERFLOW

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
OF THE SPANISH INQUISITION
INTO THE NEW WORLD,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY
VIRULENT IN PERU AND MEXICO.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
PIRACY AND LIFE
ON THE HIGH SEAS

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
WERE ALSO FAVORITE
TOPICS, LEADING TO

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
THE BUCCANEER BY
JUSTO SIERRA O'REILLY

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
AND THE PIRATES OF THE GULF
BY VINCENTE RIVA PALACIO,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000
BOTH OF WHOM
WERE FROM MEXICO.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
A SEMINAL TEXT OF THIS
TIME IS THE NOVEL

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
GUATIMOZIN: LAST
 EMPEROR OF MEXICO

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
BY CUBAN WRITER GERTRUDIS
GOMEZ DE AVELLANEDA,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
PUBLISHED IN 1846.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
HER NOVEL REACHED DEEP
INTO THE CONTINENT'S

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
PSYCHE AND PAST, PLUMBING
FOUNDATIONAL TEXTS SUCH AS

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
HERNAN CORTES'
 LETTERS OF RELATION,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE
 CONQUEST OF NEW SPAIN

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
BY BERNAL DIAZ
DEL CASTILLO,

AND THE HISTORY OF
 THE CONQUEST OF MEXICO

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
BY ANTONIO DE SOLIS.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
LEAVENING HISTORY WITH
IMAGINATION, AVELLANEDA

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
RECOUNTED THE ADVANCE
OF THE SPANISH ARMY

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
ON AMERICAN TERRITORY,
ITS ALLIANCES WITH THE

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
TLAXCALTECS, THE WAR WITH
THE AZTECS, AND THE FALL

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
OF TENOCHTITLAN - THE
CAPITAL OF THE AZTEC

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
EMPIRE THAT IS NOW THE
SITE OF MEXICO CITY.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
THE NOVEL OFFERS A NUANCED
VIEW THAT BOTH JUSTIFIES

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
CORTES' ACTIONS AND CONDEMNS
HIS INDIGENOUS ALLIES.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
MESO-AMERICAN
SOCIETIES ARE, HOWEVER,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
PRESENTED IN A GENERALLY
POSITIVE LIGHT;

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
IN PARTICULAR THE
FIGURE OF CUAUTEMOC,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
THE AZTEC EMPEROR WHO
SUCCEEDED MONTEZUMA,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
IS PORTRAYED
AS A TRAGIC HERO.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
THEY REACHED THE PLACE
 CHOSEN FOR MARTYRDOM,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
WHERE THE UNRULY TROOPS
 AWAITED TO TAKE THEIR

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
VICTIMS WITH CRIES
 OF FEROCIOUS JOY.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
ALREADY HAD THEY
 PREPARED THE GRATES

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
IN WHICH THEY
 WOULD BURN.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
ANOTHER HISTORICAL NOVEL
OF NOTE IS CUMANDA,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
WRITTEN BY JUAN LEON MERA
AND PUBLISHED IN 1879.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
INSPIRED BY THE WORKS
OF CHATEAUBRIAND

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
AND AIMED AT EUROPEAN
READERS, THE NOVEL IS,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
AS ITS SUBTITLE DECLARES,
A "DRAMA AMONG SAVAGES".

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
IT RECOUNTS THE LOVE
AFFAIR BETWEEN CUMANDA,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
A YOUNG WOMAN WHO BELIEVES
HERSELF TO BE INDIAN,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
AND CARLOS,
A WHITE MAN.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
IN A TWIST OF FATE THAT IS
A HALLMARK OF ROMANTICISM,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
THE STAR-CROSSED LOVERS
TURN OUT TO BE SIBLINGS.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
CONSIDERED TO BE THE
FIRST ECUADORIAN NOVEL,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
THE WORK IS RIFE WITH
ROMANTIC FLOURISHES:

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
FATALISM, THE
CELEBRATION OF SENTIMENT,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:57.000
THE PERFECTION AND GOODNESS
OF THE YOUNG HEROINE.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
IT'S ONCE AGAIN A LOVE
AFFAIR BETWEEN A WHITE MAN

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
AND AN INDIAN, WHO TURNS
OUT NOT TO BE INDIAN,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
BUT RATHER HIS SISTER.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
INCEST IS A VERY INTERESTING
TOPIC IN THESE NOVELS.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
BECAUSE OF THE EXTRAMARITAL
AFFAIRS OF WEALTHY MEN,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:23.000
ONE NEVER KNOWS WHO
MIGHT BE THEIR SIBLING.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
FRAMED BY LUSH
DESCRIPTIONS OF FLORA,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
FAUNA, AND INDIGENOUS
CUSTOMS, THE PLOT TRACES

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
THE UNFOLDING OF THEIR
UNKNOWINGLY INCESTUOUS

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
RELATIONSHIP - A THEME
THAT WILL BE REVISITED

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
OFTEN IN LATIN
AMERICAN LITERATURE,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
AS IN THE CASE OF ONE
 HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
BY THE COLOMBIAN AUTHOR
GARCIA MARQUEZ.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
CUMANDA'S POLITICAL AGENDA
BEGINS TO TAKE FORM

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
ONLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE
CONTEXT OF ECUADOR IN THE

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
1800'S, WHERE A MAJORITY
OF THE INDIAN POPULATION

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
EXISTS IN A STATE OF ABJECT
POVERTY AND SERVITUDE.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
YET MERA'S FICTIONAL
"GOOD SAVAGES" HAVE LITTLE

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
IF ANYTHING IN COMMON WITH
THEIR REAL COUNTERPARTS,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
WHO TOILED UNDER
THE OPPRESSIVE

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:11.000
SHARECROPPING SYSTEM
KNOWN AS HUASIPUNGO.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
HALF WAY THERE,
 NIGHT FELL.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
A BOY WHO WAS COMING
 FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
UPRISING TOOK PLACE TOLD
 HIM THAT SEVERAL HOUSES

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE HAD
 BEEN BURNED BY THE INDIANS,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
WHO HAD NOT LEFT A SINGLE
 WHITE PERSON ALIVE.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
DON JOSE DOMINGO BURST
 THE GUTS OF THE HORSE,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
WHICH MADE VALIANT
 EFFORTS TO CLIMB A HILL,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
BUT DIED OF EXHAUSTION.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
IT DID NOT MATTER: THE
 FEAR OF ARRIVING LATE,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
THE DESIRE TO FLY, THE
 ANXIETY, GAVE HIM WINGS

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
AND HE MADE IT
 UP THE HILL.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000
HE SAW THICK
 CLOUDS OF SMOKE.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000

EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE

THROUGH AN IMAGINATIVE
AND INTERPRETIVE ACT OF

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
MEMORY, AGUIRRE USED THE
NOVEL TO CONFRONT THE PAST

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
WHILE ENVISIONING THE
POSSIBILITY OF A FUTURE.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
THROUGH 26 CHAPTERS,
 JUAN DE LA ROSA LAYS OUT

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
AND OF A CONTINENT.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
THE NARRATIVE ROAMS ACROSS
THE FACE OF THE AMERICAS

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
- PARTICULARLY THE
ANDEAN COUNTRYSIDE -

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
AND IS POPULATED WITH
IDEALIZED FEMALE CHARACTERS

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
CUT FROM ROMANTIC CLOTH.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
AGUIRRE INCORPORATED
INDIGENOUS CHARACTERS,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
OFTEN DEPICTED AS POOR
AND OPPRESSED, AS WELL AS

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
SONGS, POEMS, AND
MELANCHOLY INDIAN DIRGES

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
KNOWN AS YARAVIES, WHICH
ARE PRESENTED IN QUECHUA

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
AND TRANSLATED
INTO SPANISH.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
WHEN I AWOKE, I HEARD A
 FEW MUSKET AND RIFLE SHOTS

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
IN THE DISTANCE,
 AND A LITTLE LATER,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
CALLS TO ARMS COMING
 FROM THE HIGH TOWER

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
OF THE MATRIZ,
 IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
BY THE GREAT BELL OF SAN
 FRANCISCO, AND THEN BY

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
THE BELLS FROM
 CHURCHES ALL AROUND.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
I QUICKLY DRESSED,
 AND RAN TO THE DOOR.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000
THERE WAS SUCH AN UPROAR
 COMING FROM THE SQUARE!

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
LARGE CROWDS OF
 MEN AND WOMEN

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
WERE RUSHING IN
 THAT DIRECTION.

OR CHIEF, WHO WAS RAISED BY
THE SPANISH AND EMBODIED

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
VIRTUOUS ELEMENTS OF BOTH
THE NEW AND OLD WORLDS.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000

PERIOD DURING WHICH

SPANISH OVERLORDS
WHO COLLECTED TAXES

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
FROM INDIANS
WORKING THE LAND,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
AND THEN FORCED THE
CATHOLIC FAITH ON THEM.

IN THE NOVEL, ENRIQUILLO
LEADS A REBELLION

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000

FICTIONALIZED DOCUMENTARY

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:53.000
OF THE INDIANS' LIFE OF
POVERTY AND SERVITUDE.

 MYTHOLOGICAL NARRATIONS

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
BEEN BESTOWED BY NATURE
 WITH ALL THE CHARMS

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
TO SEDUCE IMAGINATION.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
AS SUCH PLACES, THE
 INDIAN KINGDOM OF JARAGUA

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
APPEARS BEFORE THE
 MODERN ARGONAUTS

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
IN SEARCH OF
 ITS CONQUEST,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000
AS A RICH, CONTENT
 AND MARVELOUS REGION.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
WHEN IT COMES TO
REVISITING AND

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
REINTERPRETING
THE PAST,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
FEW WRITERS CAN SURPASS
RICARDO PALMA OF PERU.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
PALMA IS CREDITED WITH
CREATING AN ENTIRELY

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
NEW LITERARY GENRE
CALLED TRADICION

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
WHICH SYNTHESIZES
FICTION AND HISTORY

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
TO FORM A KIND OF
HISTORICAL ANECDOTE.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
TRADICION WEAVES TOGETHER
TREATISES, JOURNALISM,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
FOLKTALES, ORAL HISTORIES,
AND SCHOLARLY RESEARCH

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
TO CREATE AN ALTERNATIVE
KIND OF HISTORY,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
ONE WITH MORE IN COMMON
WITH FABLES AND FOLKLORE

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
THAN WITH JOURNALS
AND PRIMARY SOURCES.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
RICARDO PALMA
WAS BORN IN 1833.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
DURING HIS CAREER HE WAS BY
TURNS A POET, JOURNALIST,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
AND DIRECTOR OF THE
PERUVIAN NATIONAL LIBRARY.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
AS A MEMBER OF THE
ROYAL SPANISH ACADEMY,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
HE WAS KNOWN THROUGHOUT
THE CONTINENT

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
AND KEPT UP A PROLIFIC
CORRESPONDENCE WITH

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
SOME OF THE OUTSTANDING
INTELLECTUALS OF THE TIME

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
SUCH AS WRITER
JUANA MANUELA GORRITI

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
AND THE CRITIC JUAN
MARIA GUTIERREZ.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
PERU IN THE MID NINETEENTH
CENTURY WAS STRUGGLING TO

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
COME TO TERMS WITH ITS
INCAN HERITAGE, AND PALMA

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN
FIXING HIS COUNTRY'S PAST

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
FIRMLY IN THE INDIGENOUS
CULTURAL TRADITION.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
THOUGH HIS HISTORIES WERE
IMPRECISE AND RELIED

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
HEAVILY ON HEARSAY,
THEY PROVIDED READERS

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
WITH A SENSE OF
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
TO LIVE IN THE
VANISHED INCAN ERA.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
PALMA COMBINED
PHILOLOGY

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
- THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE AS
USED IN LITERATURE -

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
WITH SATIRE TO CREATE
HIS TRADICIONS.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
WHILE GROUNDED
IN ROMANTICISM,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
HIS WORKS AT
THE SAME TIME

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
SUBVERTED ROMANTIC
SENSIBILITIES BY USING

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
GOSSIP, OLD-WIVES' TALES,
AND PROVERBS TO PRESENT

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000
A CARNIVALESQUE,
BOTTOM-UP VIEW OF LIFE

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
THERE'S A SAYING THAT SAYS
 THAT THE MULE AND PATIENCE

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
GET WEARY IF
 THEY ARE RUSHED.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
AND THE SAME
 GOES FOR LOVE.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
BENEDICTA AND AQUILINO
 WENT OFF IN SUCH A HURRY

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
THAT HALF A YEAR
 AFTER THEIR ESCAPE,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
THE BORED LOVER TOOK A
 FRENCH LEAVE, THAT IS,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
HE SIMPLY DISAPPEARED,
 AND THERE'S THE CHEESE,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
LEFT TO BECOME
 THE MICE'S LUNCH,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
AND HE ENCOUNTERED HIS
 HUMANITY ON MOUNT PASCO.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
BENEDICTA SPENT DAYS AND
 WEEKS WAITING FOR THE

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
RETURN OF THE SMOKE OR,
 WHICH IS THE SAME, THAT OF

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
THE SCOUNDREL THAT LEFT
 HER MORE UNDRESSED THAN A

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
KEYHOLE; UNTIL, CONVINCED
 OF HER MISFORTUNE,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
SHE DECIDED NOT TO
 RETURN TO HER AUNT'S,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
AND RENTED A SMALL PLACE
 ON ALAMEDA STREET.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
PALMA'S PARLOR TRICK OF
MAINTAINING CONTINUITY

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
BREAKING WITH THE PAST

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
WAS ACHIEVED
THROUGH HIS DEFT

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
MANIPULATION
OF LANGUAGE.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
HE RAIDED THE LINGUISTIC
TOOL KIT OF THE COMMON MAN

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
- SAYINGS, PROVERBS,
ARCHAIC TURNS OF PHRASE -

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
TO POKE FUN AT THE
RELIGIOUS, LEGAL,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
AND ROYAL PROCLAMATIONS
OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
PALMA INSISTED ON SPANISH
BEING AN AMERICAN LANGUAGE,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
INTRINSICALLY BOUND TO
THE CONTINENT'S IDENTITY.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000
WHILE SPANISH MAY
BE A SHARED TONGUE,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
IT IS AT THE SAME TIME ONE
INFLECTED BY LOCAL NUANCES

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
AND PECULIARITIES.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
LATIN AMERICA IN THE
NINETEENTH CENTURY

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
WAS A BREEDING GROUND
FOR LITERATURE

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
THAT OPENLY DEFIED
EASY CATEGORIZATION.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
WHEREAS THEIR EUROPEAN
COUNTERPARTS OFTEN

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
ASSOCIATED THEIR WORK
WITH A PARTICULAR SCHOOL

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
OR GENRE, WRITERS IN
THE NEW WORLD SEEMED TO

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
DELIGHT IN SPLITTING
THE DIFFERENCE

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.000
BETWEEN REALISM
AND ROMANTICISM,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
BETWEEN THE HISTORICAL
AND THE SENTIMENTAL,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
BETWEEN LOVE STORIES AND
NATIONALISTIC FICTION.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF
THIS TREND IS AMALIA

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
BY THE ARGENTINEAN
WRITER JOSE MARMOL.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
WHILE ON ONE LEVEL
A LOVE STORY,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
THE NOVEL IS AT THE SAME
TIME HIGHLY POLITICAL,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
AND IT IS SET DURING
THE TENURE OF THE

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
REAL-LIFE DICTATOR
JUAN MANUEL DE ROSAS.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
ROSAS WAS A CAUDILLO, A
MILITIA LEADER WITH A

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
CHARISMATIC PERSONALITY
AND A POPULIST PROGRAM

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
THAT GAINED HIM
BROAD SUPPORT.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
AMALIA TAKES PLACE DURING
A VERY STRANGE TIME

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
IN THE ROSAS
GOVERNMENT:

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
1840, KNOWN AS THE
YEAR OF TERROR.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
IT WAS JUST BEFORE
THE FALL OF LAVALLE.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
AND MARMOL IS AN
INTERESTING FIGURE BECAUSE

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
HE IS A LITTLE YOUNGER
THAN ECHEVERRIA,

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
ALBERDI, GUITIERREZ
AND SARMIENTO.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
MARMOL MANAGES TO
SYNTHESIZE THE REGRETS

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
OF THIS WHOLE GROUP.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
IN A TIME WHEN DIRECT
POLITICAL ACTION ENTAILED

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
HUGE PERSONAL RISK,
FICTIONAL ACCOUNTS LIKE

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
AMALIA OFFERED THE AUTHOR
A MEASURE OF PROTECTION.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
MARMOL WROTE THE WORK
WHILE LIVING IN EXILE

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
IN MONTEVIDEO;

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
UNSURPRISINGLY, MOST
ARGENTINEAN LITERATURE

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
FROM THIS PERIOD WAS
CREATED BY EXILED WRITERS.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
IN THE DEDICATION TO
 AMALIA, MARMOL WROTE THAT

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
HE WANTED HIS BOOK, "TO BE
READ BY FUTURE GENERATIONS

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
- AS IN THE CASE OF
EVERYTHING THAT IS WRITTEN,

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
GOOD OR BAD - RELATIVE
TO THE DRAMATIC ERA

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000
OF THE ARGENTINEAN
DICTATORSHIP".

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
CLEARLY, THIS IS INTENDED
TO BE A POLITICAL NOVEL.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
ONE THAT CANNOT BE
COMPLETELY EXPLAINED

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
ON THE BASIS OF ITS
ROMANTIC ELEMENTS.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
THIS IS A WORK THAT
SIMULTANEOUSLY REVELS IN

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
AND TRANSCENDS
ROMANTICISM.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
AMALIA HIGHLIGHTS
A TENSION BETWEEN

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
ROMANTICISM AND REALISM.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
WHILE ROMANTICISM
EMPHASIZES ABOVE ALL

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
THE FICTIONAL
ASPECTS OF THE NOVEL,

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
AS IN THE LOVE AFFAIR
BETWEEN AMALIA AND EDUARDO,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
ITS AUTHOR'S
PENCHANT FOR REALISM

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
CAN BE READILY
DISCERNED

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
IN THE DOCUMENTARY
FEATURES OF THE WORK.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000
IN PARTICULAR, THE REAL
LIFE FIGURE OF ROSAS

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
AND THE MACHINATIONS OF
HIS PARAMILITARY FORCE

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
KNOWN AS LA MAZORCA,
OR "THE CORNCOB".

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
ON A MAY 4, 1840, AT 10:30
 PM., SIX MEN WERE WALKING

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
ACROSS THE PATIO OF A
 LITTLE HOUSE ON THE

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
CALLE DE BELGRANO, IN
 THE CITY OF BUENOS AIRES.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
IN REACHING THE ENTRYWAY,
 AS DARK AS THE REST OF THE

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
HOUSE, ONE OF THEM HALTED
 AND SAID TO THE OTHERS,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
"STILL ONE MORE
 PRECAUTION".

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
"IF WE GO ON LIKE
 THIS, WE'LL BE TAKING

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
PRECAUTIONS ALL NIGHT
 LONG", ANOTHER ANSWERED,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
APPARENTLY THE YOUNGEST OF
 ALL OF THEM, WITH A LONG

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
SWORD AT HIS SIDE, HALF
 CONCEALED BY THE FOLDS OF

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
A BLUE WOOL CAPE HANGING
 FROM HIS SHOULDERS.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
ANOTHER SEMINAL PIECE OF
ARGENTINEAN LITERATURE

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
IS ESTEBAN ECHEVERRIA'S
STORY ENTITLED

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, WRITTEN
BETWEEN 1838 AND 1840

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
DURING HIS EXILE
IN MONTEVIDEO.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
ECHEVERRIA, ONE OF
THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
ROMANTIC WRITERS
IN LATIN AMERICA,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
DIDN'T LIVE TO SEE
HIS STORY PUBLISHED.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
IT WAS ONLY REDISCOVERED
AFTER HIS DEATH BY THE

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
NOTED EDITOR AND CRITIC
JUAN MARIA GUTIERREZ.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
IT WAS PUBLISHED IN
1871 IN THE JOURNAL

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
REVISTA DEL RIO
 DE LA PLATA.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
EXAMINES A DICHOTOMY

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
AT THE CORE OF LATIN
AMERICAN SOCIETY

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
THAT TRACES ITS ROOTS BACK
TO THE SPANISH CONQUEST.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
ON THE ONE HAND, THERE IS
THE CIVILIZING INFLUENCE

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
THAT IS EUROPE, WITH
ITS ANCIENT CULTURAL

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
INSTITUTIONS, MORALS,
AND TRADITIONS.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
ON THE OTHER, THERE IS
WHAT IS PERCEIVED AS A

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
PRIMITIVE AND VIOLENT
INDIGENOUS SOCIETY.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES
LIES A GREAT IRONY,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
IN THAT THE "CIVILIZING"
OF THE NEW WORLD

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
WAS EXECUTED WITH
BREATHTAKING SAVAGERY.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
SO THE CLASH BETWEEN
CIVILIZATION AND BARBARISM

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000
THAT IS AT THE CORE
OF THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000
IS NOT ONLY THEMATIC,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
IT IS ALSO HISTORICAL
AND IT IS CRITICAL.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
THERE IS NO WAY THAT
CONTEMPORARY READERS

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
COULD NOT HAVE READ IT
AS SOMETHING OTHER THAN

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
A POLITICAL ALLEGORY
CONDEMNING THE DICTATOR

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
JUAN MANUEL DE ROSAS.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
IN THE CASE OF THE
 SLAUGHTERHOUSE,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
CONCERNING THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
ROMANTICISM AND REALISM
AND THEIR AESTHETICS,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
IT'S INTERESTING HOW
ANYTHING RELATED TO

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
THE REPRESENTATION
OF THE REFINED WORLD,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
OF HIGH SOCIETY, THE
WORLD OF THE UNITARIO

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
WHO WILL BECOME
VICTIMS OF ROSAS' FORCES

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
AT THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, IS
REPRESENTED IN A STYLE

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
THAT IS SUPPOSEDLY
HIGH AND REFINED.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
THE TENSIONS THAT DRIVE
THIS STORY ARE MANY;

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
BETWEEN ADVOCATES OF THE
RURAL FOLKS - GAUCHOS AND

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
RESIDENTS OF LAS PAMPAS
- AND URBAN DWELLERS;

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
BETWEEN UNITARIOS WHO
WANTED TO CONCENTRATE ALL

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
POLITICAL POWER IN BUENOS
AIRES AND FEDERALES WHO

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
ADVOCATED SPREADING POWER
THROUGHOUT THE PROVINCES.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
ROSAS HAD BEEN A
FEDERALIST WAR HERO WHO

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
AMASSED HUGE TRACTS OF
LAND DURING THE CIVIL WAR

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000
BETWEEN THESE
TWO PARTIES.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE
AT THE CENTER OF

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000
ECHEVERRIA'S STORY
IS A HUGE FACILITY,

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VAST
HOLDINGS ROSAS CONTROLLED.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000
ROSAS HAD SUPPORT FROM A
VARIETY OF DEMOGRAPHICS,

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000
RANGING FROM POWERFUL
LANDOWNERS TO THE POOR,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
WHO HOPED THAT THE
POWER OF THE DICTATOR

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
WOULD EASE THEIR PLIGHT.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
THIS POLITICAL
COALITION IS REFLECTED

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
IN WHAT ECHEVERRIA
DESCRIBES AS

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
"THE GROUP OF PEOPLE OF
DIFFERENT SKIN COLORS"

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
THAT ARE FOUND IN
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000
THE AUTHOR CONDEMNS THOSE
WHO PASSIVELY SUBMITTED

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
TO POWER AND,
BY THEIR SUBMISSION,

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
FACILITATE THE EVIL
OF THE ROSAS REGIME.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
THE STORY IS INTERWOVEN
WITH THE PERVASIVE TROPE

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
THAT "THE FEDERALES
NEVER UNDERSTAND"

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
- A NOTION THAT WILL
BE REITERATED

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
IN DOMINGO SARMIENTO'S
 FACUNDO.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
THIS FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF
UNDERSTANDING EXTENDS TO

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
THE ALMOST WILLFUL,
DEFIANT IGNORANCE

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:12.000
OF A PEOPLE WHO DO NOT
WANT TO HEAR THE TRUTH.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE RESISTS
COMPROMISE BETWEEN ELITISM

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
AND POPULISM, BETWEEN
FEDERALES AND UNITARIOS.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:26.000
AT THE CENTER OF POWER
SITS THE RESTORER.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000
SUCH INSOLENCE!

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
YOU HAVE GOTTEN
 MUCH ANGRIER.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
I WILL HAVE YOUR TONGUE
 CUT OUT IF YOU SPEAK.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
TAKE THIS IDIOT'S DRAWERS
 DOWN AND CANE HIS

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
BARE BOTTOM, KEEPING HIM
 WELL TIED-UP ON THE TABLE.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
THE JUDGE HAD BARELY
 UTTERED THIS WHEN FOUR

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
BLOOD-SPATTERED HENCHMEN
 GRABBED THE YOUTH

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
AND HELD HIM SPREAD-EAGLED
 ON THE TABLE,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
PINNING ALL
 OF HIS LIMBS.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
"I'D SOONER HAVE MY THROAT
 SLIT THAN BE STRIPPED,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
VILLAINOUS SWINE".

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
THE DOMINANT ARTISTIC MODE
OF THE FIRST HALF OF THE

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
NINETEENTH CENTURY
WAS ROMANTICISM,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
AND IN LATIN AMERICA THIS
AESTHETIC WAS INEXTRICABLY

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
ALLIED WITH NATIONAL
INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENTS.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
HOWEVER, ROMANTIC
SENSIBILITIES HAD

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
PRECURSORS LONG BEFORE
ROMANTICISM EVER LANDED

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
ON THE SHORES OF
THE NEW WORLD.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
SUCH AS ESTEBAN ECHEVERRIA'S
 THE CAPTIVE WOMAN,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
A LONG NARRATIVE POEM
ABOUT A WHITE WOMAN

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
ABDUCTED BY AN
INDIGENOUS TRIBE.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
ECHEVERRIA WAS AN
INTELLECTUAL WHO BECAME

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
POPULAR IN BUENOS AIRES
AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE WHO

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
BECAME ATTACHED TO THESE
NEW IDEAS AND CONCEPTS

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:53.000
OF LITERATURE
AND POLITICS.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
IN LATIN AMERICA,
POETRY IS PARTICULARLY

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
WELL-SUITED FOR TAKING
POLITICAL STANDS.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
THE PUBLIC IMAGE OF
THE POET HAS LONG BEEN

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
THAT OF A SEER, A
SPEAKER OF THE TRUTH,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
ONE WHO HAS THE METTLE
TO TAKE UP THE PEN

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
TO PROCLAIM HIS NOTIONS
OF COUNTRY AND LIBERTY.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
MOREOVER, MANY
LATIN AMERICAN POETS

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
WERE EITHER IN EXILE OR
CONSTANTLY ON THE MOVE,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
WHICH SEGUES NEATLY
WITH ROMANTIC NOSTALGIA

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
FOR A LOST FATHERLAND.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
AMONG THE EARLY
ROMANTIC POETS WERE

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
JOSE JOAQUIN OLMEDO,
ANDRES BELLO,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
AND JOSE
MARIA HEREDIA,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
A CUBAN WRITER
BORN IN 1803.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
NEOCLASSICIST BY EDUCATION
BUT ROMANTIC TO THE CORE,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000
HEREDIA'S ENTIRE OUTPUT
TEEMS WITH PASSION, LOVE,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:54.000
NATURE, PATRIOTISM,
FREEDOM, AND DEATH.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:02.000
IT'S A RICH MIX, VERY
DIFFICULT TO STUDY.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
WHY? BECAUSE THERE IS
INDEPENDENT DEVELOPMENT

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
OF HISTORICAL AND
LITERARY THOUGHT

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
THERE IS ADAPTATION

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
OF THAT WHICH IS
COMING FROM EUROPE.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
BUT THIS DOESN'T
TAKE PLACE

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
AT THE SAME
PACE AS IN EUROPE.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
SO WE HAVE AUTHORS
OF THE ENLIGHTENMENT

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
WHO WERE ALREADY READING
ROMANTIC AUTHORS.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
AMONG HIS KEY
WORKS ARE THE POEM

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
IN THE TEOCALLI OF CHOLULA,
PUBLISHED IN 1820;

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000
AND NIAGARA,
FROM 1824.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
I WAS SEATED AT THE
 FAMOUS CHOLULTEC PYRAMID.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
THE VAST PLAIN
 STRETCHING BEFORE ME

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
INVITED THE EYES
 TO SPACE OUT.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
WHAT SILENCE!
 WHAT PEACE!

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
TO THINK THAT ACROSS
 THESE BEAUTIFUL FIELDS

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
THERE REIGNS A
 BARBAROUS OPPRESSION,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
AND THAT THIS LAND,
 FERTILE WITH HUMAN BLOOD,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
FLOODED IN WAR
 AND SUPERSTITION,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
GROWS SO RICH
 A GRAIN?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
THE PROCESS OF GAINING
INDEPENDENCE IS

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000
FUNDAMENTALLY A PROCESS
OF DEFINING NATIONAL

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
IDENTITY, AND AT THE CORE
OF NATIONAL IDENTITY

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
IS THE QUESTION
OF LANGUAGE.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
IN LATIN AMERICAN
LITERATURE, THIS ISSUE WAS

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
PLAYED OUT IN LARGE PART
IN THE GENRE KNOWN AS

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
"GAUCHO LITERATURE".

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
THIS BODY OF WORK
HIGHLIGHTS AN UNLIKELY

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000
ALLIANCE THAT FORMED
IN NINETEENTH CENTURY

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
ARGENTINA BETWEEN
THE GAUCHO

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
- ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO
NORTH AMERICA'S COWBOY -

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
AND THE EDUCATED ELITE.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000
THIS LITERATURE GAVE
VOICE, FOR THE FIRST TIME,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
TO AN ENTIRE SEGMENT OF THE
POPULATION THAT HAD BEEN

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
MUTE, ITINERANT,
OFTEN ILLITERATE;

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
THE GAUCHO WAS A MAN OF
ACTION, NOT OF WORDS.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
AND, NATURALLY,
THIS NEWFOUND VOICE

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
WAS OFTEN
RAISED TO PROCLAIM

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
BLATANTLY
POLITICAL MESSAGES.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.000
WHAT DEFINES GAUCHO
LITERATURE IS THE USE OF

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
THE GAUCHO'S VOICE BY
AN EDUCATED WRITER.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000
SOMEONE WHO TAKES THE
VOICE OF THE GAUCHO

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
AND MAKES HIM SPEAK.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000
AND NORMALLY
IT'S POETRY,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:23.000
ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES
IT'S PROSE.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
BARTOLOME HIDALGO IS
CONSIDERED BY MOST

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
TO BE THE
FIRST GAUCHO POET.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
HIS PERIOD OF PRODUCTIVITY
COINCIDED WITH THE

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
POLITICAL CAREER OF
JOSE GERVASIO ARTIGAS,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
KNOWN AS "THE FATHER OF
URUGUAYAN INDEPENDENCE".

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
HIDALGO'S STYLISTIC
INNOVATION WAS TO

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
INCORPORATE THE
VOICE OF THE PEOPLE

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
INTO LATIN
AMERICAN POETRY.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
THIS AESTHETIC INNOVATION
COINCIDED WITH

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
THE LAND REFORM MOVEMENT
THAT BROUGHT GREATER

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
ENFRANCHISEMENT TO GAUCHOS,
BLACKS, AND SLAVES.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
IN HIS POEMS, HIDALGO USED
A METER AND RHYME SCHEME

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
THAT WAS EASILY
MEMORIZED,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
ALLOWING THE POEMS TO
BE RECITED FROM MEMORY.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
THIS STYLE SOON SPREAD
ACROSS THE CONTINENT.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
IN ARGENTINA, HILARIO
ASCASUBI PRODUCED

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
HIS FAMOUS POEM
 THE SHY WOMAN,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
IN WHICH HE CHANNELED THE
VOICE OF THE COMMON FOLK

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST
THE ROSAS GOVERNMENT.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
IT'S COMPLEX
BECAUSE OF THIS:

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
TRYING TO PORTRAY THE
BARBARIANISM OF ROSAS,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
THE HORROR OF ROSAS,
BY GIVING VOICE TO

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000
A GAUCHO ON THE
 SIDE OF ROSAS.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
HE GIVES HIM THE VOICE TO
BETTER PORTRAY THE HORROR.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
SO WHAT THE POEM SHOWS
IS THAT THE PERSON

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
NARRATING THIS
SITUATION ENJOYS IT,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:56.000
AND THE TORTURE SCENE
BECOMES A PARTY.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
MANY SCHOLARS ASSERT
THAT THE PINNACLE OF

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
GAUCHO POETRY IS MARTIN
 FIERRO, AN EPIC POEM

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
BY THE ARGENTINE
WRITER JOSE HERNANDEZ.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.000
THE POEM WAS PUBLISHED
IN TWO PARTS,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
THE GAUCHO
 MARTIN FIERRO

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
AND THE RETURN
 OF MARTIN FIERRO.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
THE AUTHOR WAS A MEMBER OF
THE PRIVILEGED CLASS WHO

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
HAD A PASTORAL VISION OF
LATIN AMERICA'S FUTURE.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
HERNANDEZ WAS A STAUNCH
FEDERALIST, AND HIS POEM

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
LAMENTS THE EUROPEAN
INFLUENCE AND

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM
OF ARGENTINE PRESIDENT

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
DOMINGO FAUSTINO
SARMIENTO.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
THE REBELLIOUS MARTIN
FIERRO DOMINATES PART ONE,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
A FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE
AND FROM THE ARMY

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
FOR OPPOSING
THE DRAFT.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
BY PART TWO, A
MORE "DOMESTICATED"

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000
FIERRO APPEARS, YEARNING FOR
A HOUSE, LAND, AND A WOMAN.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
MARTIN FIERRO WAS WILDLY
POPULAR, A CULTURAL

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
PHENOMENON READ ALOUD IN
BARS AND TAVERNS TO A

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
CAPTIVE AUDIENCE OF
GAUCHOS, VERY FEW OF WHOM

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
COULD READ AND PRACTICALLY
NONE OF WHOM COULD WRITE.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
IN ARGENTINA, THE
ILLITERACY RATE

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
AT THE TIME WAS 80%.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
HAVING TO READ OR RECITE
THE WORK ALOUD WAS

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
IRONICALLY INSTRUMENTAL
TO ITS SUCCESS.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
HERE, FINALLY, WAS
LITERATURE FOR AND ABOUT

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
THE REGULAR FOLK;
A WORK THAT INVESTIGATED

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A GAUCHO,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
TO BE A PEOPLE,
TO BE A COUNTRY.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
THE POEM ALSO MADE A CLEAR
DELINEATION BETWEEN

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
THAT WHICH IT DEEMED
RIGHT AND WORTHY

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
- WOMAN, HOUSE, AND LAND -

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
AND THAT WHICH WAS
DEEMED WRONG AND HARMFUL

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
- INDIANS,
INSUBORDINATION, NOMADISM.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS
ETHICAL CONSTRUCT,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
IT HELPS TO KNOW THAT THE
GAUCHOS TRADITIONALLY

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
LED A NOMADIC
WAY OF LIFE.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
THIS PROVED USEFUL DURING
THE WARS OF INDEPENDENCE

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000
AND THE ROSAS REGIME,
BUT MUCH LESS SO FOR

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
A TERRITORY WHOSE LANDS,
SNATCHED FROM THE INDIANS

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
DURING THE INFAMOUS
DESERT CAMPAIGN,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
NEEDED TO BE WORKED
AND CULTIVATED.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
THE DEMONIZATION OF THE
NATIVE POPULATIONS,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
MUCH EVIDENT IN
 MARTIN FIERRO,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
COINCIDES WITH
THEIR DECIMATION

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000
OVER THE COURSE OF
THE DESERT CAMPAIGN.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
HERE I COME TO SING TO
 THE BEAT OF MY GUITAR.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
BECAUSE A MAN WHO
 IS KEPT FROM SLEEP

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
BY AN UNCOMMON SORROW
 COMFORTS HIMSELF

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
WITH SINGING LIKE
 A SOLITARY BIRD.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
I BEG THE SAINTS IN HEAVEN
 TO HELP MY THOUGHTS:

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
I BEG THEM HERE AND NOW AS
 I START TO SING MY STORY

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
THAT THEY REFRESH
 MY MEMORY

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
AND MAKE MY
 UNDERSTANDING CLEAR.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
REALISM AROSE IN EUROPE
PRIMARILY AS A REACTION

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
TO THE IDEALISM
OF ROMANTICISM.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
THE REALIST MOVEMENT WAS
AN ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
THE WORLD AS IT REALLY
WAS, NOT AS WE WOULD

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
WISH IT TO BE, AND AS SUCH
WAS OFTEN LINKED WITH

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
A CALL FOR SOCIAL
AND POLITICAL REFORM.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
IN EUROPE, THE
PROPONENTS OF REALISM

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
INCLUDED SUCH NAMES
AS STENDHAL, BALZAC,

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
GUSTAVE FLAUBERT,
AND EMILE ZOLA.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
REALISM ARRIVED IN THE
NEW WORLD IN TYPICALLY

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
OUT-OF-SYNCH FASHION AND
EXISTED SIDE-BY-SIDE,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
AND AT TIMES INEXTRICABLY
INTERMINGLED,

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
WITH ROMANTICISM FOR MUCH
OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
WHEN IT DID TAKE HOLD,
HOWEVER, REALISM FOUND

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
ITS HOME IN THE CITIES
OF SOUTH AMERICA,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
TURNING ITS COLD, OBJECTIVE
EYE ON THE PLIGHT OF THOSE

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
LIVING IN
URBAN SQUALOR.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
IN ARGENTINA, WE SEE THE
WORK OF WRITERS SUCH AS

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
MANUEL GALVEZ AND
ELIAS CASTELNUOVO.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
IN CHILE, WE FIND THE
NOVELIST BLEST GANA

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
WRITING REALIST WORKS THAT
ATTEMPTED TO RECONCILE

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
RELIGIOUS AND
MORAL IDEALS.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
IN PERU, COLOMBIA, AND
MEXICO, NEWSPAPER SERIALS

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
AND ROMANTIC SET PIECES
DOMINATED THE 1800'S,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
THOUGH BY THE END
OF THE CENTURY

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
AUTHORS SUCH AS CLORINDA
MATTO DE TURNER,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
MERCEDES CABELLO
DE LA CARBONERA,

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
MIGUEL EDUARDO PARDO
AND EMILIO RABASA WERE

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:14.000
WRITING WORKS WITH DECIDEDLY
REALIST ATTRIBUTES.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
AT THE CROSSROADS OF
ROMANTICISM AND REALISM

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
WE FIND LUCIO
V. LOPEZ,

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
A WRITER WHO EXAMINED
THE CORROSIVE MIX

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
OF POLITICS, FAMILY, AND
HISTORY IN HIS 1884 WORK

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
THE GREAT VILLAGE.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
WITH A REALIST'S EYE
FOR THE TELLING DETAIL

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000
AND THE ROMANTIC'S SENSE
OF MORAL CERTAINTY,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
LOPEZ PICKED APART THE
HYPOCRISIES OF THE

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
BUENOS AIRES BOURGEOISIE
IN A TALE THAT IS AT ONCE

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:48.000
COOLLY OBJECTIVE AND
INTENSELY AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
DON CAMILO, A MAN OF
 CONSIDERABLE EARNINGS,

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
WAS A PUBLIC MAN, EVEN
 A DISTINGUISHED MAN.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
I FELT THE HOPELESSNESS,
 THE TERRIBLE HOPELESSNESS

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
THAT ONE CAN FEEL WHEN
 FACED WITH THE IMPOSSIBLE,

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000
WITH DEATH, WITH
 THE IRREVERSIBLE,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
AND I WONDERED IF THE SOUL
 COULD BE TORN FROM THE BODY

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
AND THROWN AWAY AS A
 USELESS OBSTACLE OF LIFE.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
ANOTHER SEMINAL WORK WITH
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL OVERTONES

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
IS THE STORY
 JUVENILIA,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.000
WRITTEN BY MIGUEL
CANE IN 1884.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
IN IT, CANE RECOUNTED
HIS EDUCATION AT THE

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
COLEGIO NACIONAL
IN BUENOS AIRES.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000
HE IDEALIZED A
MODEL OF EDUCATION

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
AND LEARNED CULTURE,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000
CONSTRUCTING A MEMORY OF
CHILDHOOD FLECKED WITH

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
HUMOR AND IRONY,
LAUGHTER AND VILLAINY,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
IN SCENES PAINTED WITH
DECIDEDLY REALIST STROKES.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
AT THE BORDERS OF
ROMANTICISM AND REALISM

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
CAN BE FOUND
TEXTS SUCH AS

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
POTPOURRI BY
EUGENIO CAMBACERES,

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
PUBLISHED IN 1881;

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
INNOCENT OR GUILTY BY
JUAN ANTONIO ARGERICH,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.000
PUBLISHED IN 1884;

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
AND SOCIAL LAW BY
MARTIN GARCIA MEROU.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
AS MANY EUROPEAN AND LATIN
AMERICAN WORKS COMBINE

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
BOTH TRENDS, THE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
REALISM AND NATURALISM
IS OFTEN NOT CLEAR;

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
HOWEVER, CRITICS AGREE
THAT "NATURALIST" NOVELS

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000
ARE TYPICALLY
THOSE WRITTEN

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
IN THE TRADITION
OF EMILE ZOLA.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000
HIS MOST FAMOUS NOVEL,
 NANA, CIRCULATED

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
THROUGHOUT LATIN AMERICA
IN THE EARLY 1880'S,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
CAUSING A SENSATION.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
THE PUERTO RICAN NOVELIST
MANUEL ZENO GANDIA

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
SPENT TIME STUDYING
MEDICINE IN BARCELONA,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
WHERE HE DEVELOPED
A LOVE OF THE

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
CONTINENTAL
LITERATURE OF THE DAY.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
HE INTERNALIZED ZOLA'S
NOVELISTIC PERSPECTIVE

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
WHICH HE COMBINED WITH
HIS SCIENTIFIC APTITUDE

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
TO ANALYZE PUERTO
RICO'S RURAL SOCIETY.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
THE RESULT WAS NOVELS SUCH
AS THE POND FROM 1894,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
AND GARDUNA FROM 1896 -
WORKS WHICH INTERLACE

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000
REALIST SENSIBILITIES
WITH MODERNIST PROSE.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000
THE VOICE TWIRLED
 IN THE AIR AND,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
REFLECTING ITSELF ON
 THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
EASED DOWN INTO THE RIVER
 BED WHERE IT WAS DIMMED

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
AMONG MURMURS OF
 CASCADES AND WHIRLPOOLS.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
BY THE RIVER,
 CROUCHED UPON A STEADY

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
AND PLAIN STONE,
 LEANDRA WASHED AWAY.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
HER DRESS WAS TIED
 BACK BEHIND HER KNEES,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
REVEALING HER LEGS THAT
 WERE WET WITH SOAPY WATER.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
AT LAST, SHE
 HEARD THE VOICES,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:27.000
SHE LOOKED UP
 AND SAW SILVINA.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
IN MEXICO, THE WRITER AND
DIPLOMAT FEDERICO GAMBOA

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
CREATED AN EXTENSIVE
BODY OF WORK, INCLUDING

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
ONE OF THAT COUNTRY'S MOST
FAMOUS NOVELS, SANTA.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
THE TALE FOCUSES ON A
FEMALE PROTAGONIST, SANTA,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
WHO, BETRAYED BY HER
FIRST LOVER AND DISOWNED

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:52.000
BY HER FAMILY, TURNS TO
PROSTITUTION FOR SURVIVAL.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
HERE WE HAVE A FIRST
PASSAGE FROM THE COUNTRY

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
TO THE CITY.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000
THE COUNTRY IS THE
PURE AND VIRGINAL.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
THE CITY IS
FULL OF VICE.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
AND IN THE CITY, SANTA'S
BODY BECOMES AN ALLEGORY,

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
IF I MAY SAY THAT.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
AND IT SAYS THAT IN THE
NOVEL, THE WHOLE OF

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
SOCIETY WENT THROUGH
SANTA'S BODY.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
AND IT GIVES EXAMPLES.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:28.000
AND HOW DOES THAT BODY
END UP? THAT SOCIAL BODY?

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
DISEASED.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
IT'S A BODY CONTAMINATED
BY THE VICES OF SOCIETY.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
A PROSTITUTED BODY, BY
HERSELF AND BY OTHERS.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
COMBINING REALIST AND
MODERNIST ELEMENTS,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
SANTA STANDS OUT FOR
DEPICTING THE FRINGES

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.000
OF SOCIETY AND
DESPAIRING CHARACTERS.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000
BY FEATURING A PROSTITUTE
AS PROTAGONIST - ONE WHOM,

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
NOT INCIDENTALLY, THE
NARRATOR HIMSELF MORALLY

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
CONDEMNS - GAMBOA
ANTICIPATED THE WORK OF

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:08.000
LATER REALIST WRITERS
SUCH AS MANUEL GALVEZ.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
THE OUTPUT OF ARGENTINEAN
WRITER EUGENIO CAMBACERES

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
DEMONSTRATES THE
NATURALIST'S DESIRE

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000
TO DESCRIBE
OBJECTIVE REALITY

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
THROUGH THE LENS
OF SCIENTIFIC RIGOR.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.000
IN WORKS SUCH AS
 SENTIMENTAL MUSIC,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
SIN RUMBO,
AND IN THE BLOOD,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
CAMBACERES EXAMINED THE
PROBLEM OF HEREDITY,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
A CONCEPT NATURALISM
BORROWED FROM BIOLOGY

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
AND ELEVATED TO
NEAR DIVINE STATUS.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
