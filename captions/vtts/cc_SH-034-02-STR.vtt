00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.070


2
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.600


3
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.170
As when the golden sun salutes the morn

4
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.970
and, having gilt the ocean with his beams,

5
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.330
gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach

6
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.300
and overlooks the highest peering hills, so Tamora.

7
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.230
Upon her wit doth earthly honor wait,

8
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.030
and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.

9
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.370
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts

10
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.000
to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.600
and mount her pitch whom thou in triumph

12
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.270
long hast prisoner held, fettered in amorous chains

13
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.400
and faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes

14
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.630
than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.

15
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.770
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts.

16
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.770
I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold

17
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.370
to wait upon this new-made empress.

18
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.170
To wait, said I, to wonton with this queen,

19
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.530
this goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,

20
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.970
this siren that will charm Rome's Saturnine

21
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.000
and see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.

22
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.200
Holloa, what storm is this?

23
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.570
Chiron, thy years want wit; thy wit wants edge

24
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.830
and manners, to intrude where I am graced,

25
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.770
and may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.

26
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.030
Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all,

27
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.500
and so in this, to bear me down with braves.

28
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.230
'Tis not the difference of a year or two

29
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.070
makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate.

30
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.630
I am as able and as fit as thou to serve

31
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.430
and to deserve my mistress' grace.

32
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.770
And that my sword upon thee shall approve

33
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.100
and plead my passions for Lavinia's love.

34
00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.070
Clubs, clubs; these lovers will not keep the peace.

35
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.230
Why, boy, although our mother unadvised

36
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.300
gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,

37
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.200
are you so desperate grown to threat your friends?

38
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.600
Go to.

39
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.430
Have your lath glued within your sheath

40
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.100
till you know better how to handle it.

41
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.800
Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,

42
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.770
full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.

43
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.430
Grow ye so brave?

44
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.400
Why, how now, lords.

45
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.200
So near the emperor's palace dare ye draw

46
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.870
and maintain such a quarrel openly?

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.800
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge.

48
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.300
I would not for a million of gold

49
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.800
the cause were known to them it most concerns,

50
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.600
nor would your noble mother for much more

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.330
be so dishonored in the court of Rome.

52
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.630
For shame, put up.

53
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.070
Not I, till I have sheathed my rapier in his bosom

54
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.400
and withal thrust those reproachful speeches

55
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.100
down his throat that he hath breathed in my dishonor here.

56
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.300
For that I am prepared and full resolved.

57
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.400
Foul-spoken coward that thunder'st with thy tongue

58
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.930
and with thy weapon nothing darest perform.

59
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.570
Away, I say.

60
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.470
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,

61
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.970
this petty brabble will undo us all.

62
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.530
Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous

63
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.670
it is to jet upon a prince's right?

64
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.830
What, is Lavinia then become so loose

65
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.430
or Bassianus so degenerate that for her love such quarrels

66
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.830
may be broached without controlment,

67
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.830
justice, or revenge?

68
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.600
Young lords, beware.

69
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.470
And should the empress know this discord's ground,

70
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.270
the music would not please.

71
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.600
I care not, I, knew she and all the world.

72
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.870
I love Lavinia more than all the world.

73
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.100
Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice.

74
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.700
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.

75
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.000
Are you mad, or know you not in Rome

76
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.400
how furious and impatient they be

77
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.070
and cannot brook competitors in love?

78
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.370
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths by this device.

79
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.430
Aaron, a thousand deaths would I propose

80
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.800
to achieve her whom I love.

81
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.070
To achieve her; how?

82
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.530
Why make'st thou it so strange?

83
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.470
She is a woman, therefore may be wooed.

84
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.700
She is a woman, therefore may be won.

85
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.530
She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.

86
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.200
What, man.

87
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.130
More water glideth by the mill than wots the miller of.

88
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.570
And easy it is of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know.

89
00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.470
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother,

90
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.170
better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.

91
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.370
Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.

92
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.800
Then why should he despair that knows to court it

93
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.200
with words, fair looks, and liberality?

94
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.000
What, hast not thou full often struck a doe

95
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.700
and borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?

96
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.570
Why, then, it seems some certain snatch or so

97
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:09.670
would serve your turns.

98
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.270
Ay, so the turn were served.

99
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.770
Aaron, thou hast hit it.

100
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.100
Would you had hit it too;

101
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.400
then should not we be tired with this ado.

102
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.130
Why, hark ye, hark ye,

103
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.770
and are you such fools to square for this?

104
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.270
Would it offend you, then, that both should speed?

105
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.800
Faith, not me.

106
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.100
Nor me, so I were one.

107
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.000
For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar.

108
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.430
'Tis policy and stratagem must do that you affect.

109
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.730
And so must you resolve

110
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.230
that what you cannot as you would achieve

111
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.330
you must perforce accomplish as you may.

112
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.930
Take this of me:

113
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.730
Lucrece was not more chaste than this Lavinia,

114
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.270
Bassianus' love.

115
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.170
A speedier course than lingering languishment

116
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.670
must we pursue, and I have found the path.

117
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.170
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand.

118
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.270
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop.

119
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.800
The forest walks are wide and spacious,

120
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.570
and many unfrequented plots there are

121
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.970
fitted by kind for rape and villainy.

122
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.500
Single you thither, then, this dainty doe,

123
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.900
and strike her home by force, if not by words.

124
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.230
This way or not at all stand you in hope.

125
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.630
Come, come; our empress, with her sacred wit

126
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.770
to villainy and vengeance consecrate,

127
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.400
will we acquaint with all that we intend,

128
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.630
and she shall file our engines with advice

129
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.100
that will not suffer you to square yourselves,

130
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.200
but to your wishes' height advance you both.

131
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.330
The emperor's court is like the house of fame,

132
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.730
the palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears.

133
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:52.300
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull.

134
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.870
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns.

135
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.630
There serve your lust, shadowed from heaven's eye,

136
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.670
and revel in Lavinia's treasury.

137
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.300
Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice.

138
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.700
Be it right or wrong,

139
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.930
till I find the stream to cool this heat,

140
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.430
a charm to calm this fits, I am in hell.

141
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.870
The hunt is up.

142
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.970
The morn is bright and grey.

143
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.770
The fields are fragrant, and the woods are green.

144
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.830
Uncouple here, and let us make a bay,

145
00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.830
and wake the emperor and his lovely bride

146
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.600
and rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,

147
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.170
that all the court may echo with the noise.

148
00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.930
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,

149
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.400
to attend the emperor's person carefully.

150
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.600
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,

151
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.770
but dawning day new comfort hath inspired.

152
00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.030
Many good morrows to Your Majesty.

153
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.230
Madam, to you as many and as good.

154
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.270
I promised your grace a hunter's peal.

155
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.570
And you have rung it lustily, my lords;

156
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.700
somewhat too early for new-married ladies.

157
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:31.030
Lavinia, how say you?

158
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.300
I say no.

159
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.630
I have been broad awake two hours and more.

160
00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:37.470
Come on, then.

161
00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.400
Horse and chariots let us have, and to our sport.

162
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.800
Madam, now shall ye see our Roman hunting.

163
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.170
I have dogs, my lord,

164
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.270
will rouse the proudest panther in the chase

165
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.700
and climb the highest promontory top.

166
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.170
And I have horse will follow where the game make way

167
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.100
and run like swallows over the plain.

168
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.800
Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,

169
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.830
but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

170
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.970
He that had wit would think that I had none,

171
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.370
to bury so much gold under a tree,

172
00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.500
and never after to inherit it.

173
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.330
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly

174
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.500
know that this gold must coin a stratagem,

175
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.170
which, cunningly effected, will beget

176
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.470
a very excellent piece of villainy.

177
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.570
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest

178
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:34.030
that have their alms out of the empress' chest.

179
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.730
My lovely Aaron, wherefore looks thou sad,

180
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.600
when every thing doth make a gleeful boast?

181
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.400
The birds chant melody on every bush,

182
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.300
the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,

183
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.100
the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind

184
00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.400
and make a checkered shadow on the ground.

185
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.300
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,

186
00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.930
and whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,

187
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.630
replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,

188
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.530
as if a double hunt were heard at once,

189
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:10.870
let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise.

190
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.430
And after conflict such as was supposed

191
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:17.330
the wandering prince and Dido once enjoyed,

192
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.600
when with a happy storm they were surprised

193
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.670
and curtained with a counsel-keeping cave,

194
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.800
we may, each wreathed in each other's arms,

195
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.130
our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;

196
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:36.470
whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds

197
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.600
be unto us as is a nurse's song of lullaby

198
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.770
to bring her babe asleep.

199
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:48.600
Madam, though Venus govern your desires,

200
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.530
Saturn is dominator over mine.

201
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.700
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,

202
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.270
my silence and my cloudy melancholy,

203
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:01.670
my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls

204
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:04.370
even as an adder when she doth unroll

205
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.170
to do some fatal execution?

206
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.030
No, madam, these are no venereal signs.

207
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.370
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand.

208
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.300
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.

209
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.530
Hark, Tamora, the empress of my soul,

210
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:24.800
which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,

211
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.430
this is the day of doom for Bassianus.

212
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.970
His Philomel must lose her tongue today,

213
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.630
thy sons make pillage of her chastity

214
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.470
and wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.

215
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.200
Seest thou this letter?

216
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.530
Take it up, I pray thee,

217
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.830
and give the king this fatal plotted scroll.

218
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.100
Now question me no more.

219
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.430
We are espied.

220
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.900
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty

221
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.900
which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.

222
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.630
O, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life.

223
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.900
No more, great empress; Bassianus comes.

224
00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.970
Be cross with him, and I'll go fetch thy sons

225
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.000
to back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.

226
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:12.900
Who have we here, Rome's royal empress,

227
00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.070
unfurnished of her well-beseeming troop?

228
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.330
Or is it Dian, habited like her,

229
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.970
who hath abandoned her holy groves

230
00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:21.630
to see the general hunting in this forest?

231
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.330
Saucy controller of my private steps,

232
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:27.230
had I the power that some say Dian had,

233
00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.300
thy temples should be planted presently with horns,

234
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.300
as was Actaeon's, and the hounds

235
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.730
should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,

236
00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.900
unmannerly intruder as thou art.

237
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.430
Under your patience, gentle empress,

238
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.600
'tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning

239
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.530
and to be doubted that the Moor and you

240
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.000
are singled forth to try experiments.

241
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.700
Jove shield your husband from his hounds today.

242
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.730
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.

243
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.370
Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian doth make your honor

244
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.270
of his body's hue: spotted, detested, and abominable.

245
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.700
Why are you sequestered from all your train,

246
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:03.870
dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed,

247
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.970
and wandered hither to an obscure plot,

248
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.000
accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,

249
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.700
if foul desire had not conducted you?

250
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.170
And being intercepted in your sport,

251
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:18.600
great reason that my noble lord be rated for sauciness.

252
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.430
I pray you, let us hence,

253
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.500
and let her joy her raven-colored love.

254
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.900
This valley fits the purpose passing well.

255
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.270
The king, my brother, shall have note of this.

256
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.270
Good king, to be so mightily abused.

257
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.330
Why have I patience to endure all this.

258
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:34.630
How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother.

259
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:35.970
Oh!

260
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.200
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?

261
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.530
Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?

262
00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.100
These two have 'ticed me hither to this place.

263
00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.870
a barren detested vale, you see it is.

264
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.300
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,

265
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.870
overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe.

266
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.630
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,

267
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.300
unless the nightly owl or fatal raven.

268
00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.700
And when they showed me this abhorred pit,

269
00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.900
they told me, here, at dead time of the night,

270
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.530
a thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,

271
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:06.800
ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,

272
00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.300
would make such fearful and confused cries

273
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.470
that any mortal body hearing it should straight run mad,

274
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.330
or else die suddenly.

275
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:16.600
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,

276
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.900
but straight they told me they would bind me here

277
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.870
unto the body of a dismal yew

278
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.070
and leave me to this miserable death.

279
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:26.470
And then they called me foul adulteress,

280
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:29.670
lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms

281
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.700
that ever ear did hear to such effect.

282
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.900
And had you not by wondrous fortune come,

283
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.330
this vengeance on me had they executed.

284
00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.900
Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,

285
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.470
or be ye not henceforth called my children!

286
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.670
This is a witness that I am thy son.

287
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.000
And this for me, struck home to show my strength.

288
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.800
Ay, come, Semiramis nay, barbarous Tamora,

289
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.970
for no name fits thy nature but thine own!

290
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.370
Give me the poniard; you shall know, my boys,

291
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.670
your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.

292
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.770
Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her.

293
00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.600
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw.

294
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.930
This minion stood upon her chastity,

295
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.600
upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,

296
00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.500
and with this painted hope braves your mightiness.

297
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.500
And shall she carry this unto her grave?

298
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.570
And if she do, I would I were an eunuch.

299
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:25.030
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,

300
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.700
and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.

301
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.230
But when ye have the honey we desire,

302
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.570
let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.

303
00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.630
I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.

304
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:36.370
Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy

305
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.470
that nice-preserved honesty of yours.

306
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.570
O, Tamora, thou bearest a woman's face

307
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.330
I will not hear her speak; away with her.

308
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.470
Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.

309
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.600
Listen, fair madam; let it be your glory

310
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.200
to see her tears, but be your heart to them

311
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.170
as unrelenting flint to drops of rain.

312
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.030
When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?

313
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.870
O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee.

314
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.670
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble.

315
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.430
Even at thy teat, thou hadst thy tyranny.

316
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.070
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike.

317
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:09.130
Do thou entreat her, show her a woman's pity.

318
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.900
What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?

319
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.530
'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark.

320
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.270
Yet have I heard

321
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.500
O, could I find it now

322
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.700
The lion, moved with pity,

323
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.900
did endure to have his princely paws pared all away.

324
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.230
Some say the ravens foster forlorn children,

325
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.030
the whilst their own birds famish in the nest.

326
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.570
O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,

327
00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.400
nothing so kind, but something pitiful!

328
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.900
I know not what it means. Away with her!

329
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.300
O, let me teach thee!

330
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.630
For my father's sake, that gave thee life

331
00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.330
when well he might have slain thee,

332
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.400
be not obdurate; open thy deaf ears.

333
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.500
Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,

334
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.770
even for his sake am I pitiless.

335
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:58.530
Remember, boys, I poured forth tears in vain

336
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.670
to save your brother from the sacrifice.

337
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.530
But fierce Andronicus would not relent.

338
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.770
Away with her.

339
00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.130
Use her as you will.

340
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.030
The worse to her, the better loved of me.

341
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.570
O, Tamora, be called a gentle queen,

342
00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:13.370
and with thine own hands kill me in this place.

343
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:19.070
For 'tis not life that I have begged so long.

344
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:21.700
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.

345
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.730
What beg'st thou, then, fond woman?

346
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.030
Let me go.

347
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:28.900
'Tis present death I beg, and one thing more

348
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.200
that womanhood denies a tongue to tell.

349
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.300
O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,

350
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.830
and tumble me into some loathsome pit,

351
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.500
where never man's eyes may behold my body.

352
00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.970
Do this, and be a charitable murderer.

353
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:50.100
So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee.

354
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.130
No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.

355
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.130
Away, for thou hast stayed us here too long.

356
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.870
No grace?

357
00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.170
No womanhood?

358
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.700
Ah, beastly creature!

359
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.300
The blot and enemy to our general name.

360
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.200
Confusion fall

361
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.970
Nay, then I'll stop your mouth.

362
00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:14.430
Bring thou her husband.

363
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.670
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.

364
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.070
Farewell, my sons.

365
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.230
See that you make her sure.

366
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:23.000
Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,

367
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.870
till all the Andronici be made away.

368
00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.600
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor

369
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.570
and let my spleenful sons this trull deflower.

370
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:55.070
Come on, my lords, the better foot before.

371
00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.630
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit

372
00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.800
where I espied the panther fast asleep.

373
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.230
My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.

374
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.670
And mine, I promise you.

375
00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:08.070
Were it not for shame,

376
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.330
well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.

377
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.570
What subtle hole is this

378
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.630
whose mouth is covered with rude-growing briers,

379
00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:23.500
upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood

380
00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.470
as fresh as morning dew distilled on flowers?

381
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.470
A very fatal place it seems to me.

382
00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.100
Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

383
00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.370
O brother, with the dismalest object hurt

384
00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:40.500
that ever eye with sight made heart lament.

385
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.300
Now will I fetch the king to find them here,

386
00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.300
that he thereby may have a likely guess

387
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.200
how these were they that made away his brother.

388
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.330
Why dost not comfort me and help me out

389
00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:54.770
from this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?

390
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.230
I am surprised with an uncouth fear.

391
00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.000
A chilling sweat o'erruns my trembling joints.

392
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.170
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.

393
00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:07.230
To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,

394
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.070
Aaron and thou look down into this den

395
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.500
and see a fearful sight of blood and death.

396
00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:15.200
Aaron is gone, and my compassionate heart

397
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.100
will not permit mine eyes once to behold

398
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.870
the thing whereat it trembles by surmise.

399
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.730
O, tell me who it is, for nigh till now

400
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.270
was I a child to fear I know not what.

401
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.070
Lord Bassianus lies bewrayed in blood,

402
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:31.000
all on a heap, like to a slaughtered lamb,

403
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.330
in this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.

404
00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.070
If it be dark, how does thou know it is he?

405
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.100
Upon his bloody finger he doth wear

406
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.530
a precious ring that lightens all this hole,

407
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:42.470
which, like a taper in some monument,

408
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.470
doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks

409
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.530
and shows the ragged entrails of this pit.

410
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:49.830
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus

411
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.570
when he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.

412
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.600
O, brother, help me with thy fainting hand

413
00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.770
if fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath

414
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.870
out of this fell devouring receptacle,

415
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.330
as hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.

416
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.070
Give me thy hand, that I may help thee out

417
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.470
or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,

418
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:10.400
I may be plucked into the swallowing womb

419
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.230
of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.

420
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.970
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.

421
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:24.000
Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.

422
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.600
Thy hand once more.

423
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.670
I will not loose again, till thou art here aloft or I below.

424
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.470
Thou canst not come to me.

425
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.670
I come to thee.

426
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:38.900
Along with me!

427
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.200
I'll see what hole is here

428
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.930
and what he is that now is leapt into it.

429
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.900
Say, who art thou that lately did'st descend

430
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.870
into this gaping hollow of the earth?

431
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.670
The unhappy sons of old Andronicus,

432
00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.500
brought hither in a most unlucky hour

433
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.670
to find thy brother Bassianus dead.

434
00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:05.730
My brother dead?

435
00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:09.130
I know thou dost but jest.

436
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:11.130
He and his lady both are at the lodge

437
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.900
upon the north side of this pleasant chase.

438
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.800
'Tis not an hour since I left them there.

439
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:18.530
We know not where you left them all alive,

440
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:21.900
but out alas, here have we found him dead.

441
00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.200
Where is my lord the king?

442
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.600
Here, Tamora; though grieved with killing grief.

443
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.330
Where is thy brother Bassianus?

444
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:33.070
Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound.

445
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.600
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.

446
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.730
Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,

447
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.330
the complot of this timeless tragedy,

448
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:44.930
and wonder greatly that man's face can fold

449
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:48.300
in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.

450
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:51.300
"And if we miss to meet him handsomely, sweet huntsman

451
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.530
"Bassianus 'tis we mean

452
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.730
"do thou so much as dig the grave for him.

453
00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.870
"Thou know'st our meaning.

454
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.830
"Look for thy reward among the nettles at the elder-tree

455
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.070
"which overshades the mouth of that same pit

456
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.570
"where we decreed to bury Bassianus.

457
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:10.630
Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends."

458
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:12.970
O, Tamora, was ever heard the like?

459
00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:18.770
This is the pit and this the elder tree.

460
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.230
Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out

461
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:23.930
that should have murdered Bassianus here.

462
00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.900
My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

463
00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.470
Two of thy whelps, fell curs of bloody kind,

464
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.630
have here bereft my brother of his life.

465
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.030
Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison.

466
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.470
There let them bide until we have devised

467
00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:48.130
some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.

468
00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.200
What, are they in this pit?

469
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.770
O, wondrous thing!

470
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:54.700
How easily murder is discovered.

471
00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.530
High Emperor, upon my feeble knee,

472
00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.570
I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed,

473
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.230
that this vile fault of my accursed sons

474
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.600
accursed if the fault be proved in them

475
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.330
If it be proved!

476
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.900
You see it is apparent.

477
00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:11.230
Who found this letter?

478
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:12.370
Tamora, was it you?

479
00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.700
Andronicus himself did take it up.

480
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:19.100
I did, my lord, yet let me be their bail;

481
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.230
for, by my fathers' reverend tomb,

482
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.600
I vow, they shall be ready at your Highness' will

483
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.630
to answer their suspicion with their lives.

484
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.930
Thou shalt not bail them; see thou follow me.

485
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.430
Some bring the murdered body, some the murderers.

486
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.570
Let them not speak a word.

487
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.830
The guilt is plain.

488
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:39.370
For by my soul, were there worse end than death,

489
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.800
that end upon them should be executed.

490
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.200
Andronicus, I will entreat the king.

491
00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.630
Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.

492
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:05.430
Come, Lucius, come.

493
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.700
Stay not to talk with them.

494
00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.930
Now go tell, and if thy tongue can speak,

495
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.170
who it was that cut thy tongue and ravished thee.

496
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.330
Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,

497
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.970
and if thy stumps will let thee, play the scribe.

498
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.670
See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.

499
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.270
Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.

500
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.230
She hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash.

501
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.370
And so let's leave her to her silent walks.

502
00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.870
And 'twere my cause, I should go hang myself.

503
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.800
If thou had'st hands to help thee knit the cord.

504
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.730
Who is this?

505
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.370
My niece, that flies away so fast?

506
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:57.130
Cousin, a word.

507
00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.670
Where is your husband?

508
00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.870
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me.

509
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.530
If I do wake, some planet strike me down,

510
00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.700
that I may slumber in eternal sleep.

511
00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.600
Speak, gentle niece.

512
00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:19.870
What stern, ungentle hand

513
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:24.370
hath lopped and hewed and made thy body bare

514
00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:27.530
of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,

515
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:31.030
whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in?

516
00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.230
Why dost not speak to me?

517
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.300
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,

518
00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.600
like to a bubbling fountain stirred with wind,

519
00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.030
doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,

520
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.630
coming and going with thy honey breath.

521
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.470
But sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee

522
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.630
and, lest thou should'st detect him, cut thy tongue.

523
00:26:55.630 --> 00:27:00.230
Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame.

524
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.200
And notwithstanding all this loss of blood

525
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.600
as from a conduit with three issuing spouts

526
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.570
yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face

527
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.130
blushing to be encountered with a cloud.

528
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:18.130
Shall I speak for thee?

529
00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:19.670
Shall I say 'tis so?

530
00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:26.930
O, that I knew thy heart and knew the beast,

531
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.670
that I might rail at him to ease my mind.

532
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.730
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopped,

533
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.700
doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.

534
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.530
Fair Philomel, why she but lost her tongue

535
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.870
and in a tedious sampler sewed her mind.

536
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.830
But, gentle niece, that mean is cut from thee.

537
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.370
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,

538
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.730
for he hath cut thy pretty fingers off

539
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.830
that could have better sewed than Philomel.

540
00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.900
O, had the monster seen those lily hands

541
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.730
tremble like aspen leaves upon the lute

542
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:01.430
and make the silken strings delight to kiss them,

543
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.400
he would not then have touched them for his life.

544
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.800
Or had he heard the heavenly harmony

545
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.270
which that sweet, sweet tongue hath made,

546
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.000
he would have dropped his knife and fell asleep

547
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.630
as Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.

548
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:25.030
Come, let us go and make thy father blind,

549
00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:29.130
for such a sight will blind a father's eye.

550
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.900
When one hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads,

551
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:36.700
what will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?

552
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.130
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee.

553
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.630
O, could our mourning ease thy misery.

554
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.630
