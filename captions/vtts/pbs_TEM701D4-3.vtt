But you cant always
get what you want.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.800
WOMAN: Is happiness an
experience that comes and goes

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.060
or is it a state
that you can live in

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.700
for long periods of time?

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.560
I dont... I dont know.

heights of ecstasy

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.360
to the depths of despair
and every place between.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.430
WOMAN: All emotions have a role

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.730
in a healthy life.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.060

and clinicians who are
trying to help them find it.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.360
WOMAN: What Ive taken away

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.460
is the resilience
of the human spirit.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.430
It is just amazing what we
can go through and be okay.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.860
(explosion)

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.800

was going crazy--

"the dreams, the nightmares."

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.330
But Im not letting it beat me.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.430
What more can I say?

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.760
Im a happy camper. (laughs)

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.360
GILBERT: Well see how our
greatest source of happiness

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.960
lies in the people around us.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.630
"MAN: A basic need for
human beings is love,"

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.100

GILBERT: Well explore the
obstacles to happiness--

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.300
"emotions such as fear,
sadness and anger."

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.460
Have I lost it to the point

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.600
where I did feel
like Ive lost it?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.700
Yeah.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.600
I went through like
six or seven years

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.930
of real depression.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960
I just was never quite
given the right pill.

what causes it and why we look
for it in all the wrong places.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.100
MAN: I won the lottery

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.400
but being happy/content
takes work.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.230
WOMAN: I used to think that
things would make me happy.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.300
"Or money, success."

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.460
Im realizing now that
thats not the fact.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.600
Happiness comes from within.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.030
And happiness comes from
experiences that we have

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.660
with people that we love.

Its a universal human desire.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.330
But it's a desire
not easily satisfied.

"We search without finding
it, and when we do find it,"

it doesn't seem

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.600
WOMAN: Why is it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.830
that it is so difficult for
us to hold onto contentment?

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.560
"And why are we so fleeting,
and why are we so fickle?"

"Why is it that one day the
things that make us happy,"

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.130

a temporary state,"

GILBERT: I'm Dan Gilbert.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.500
Im a social psychologist

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.130

at Harvard University.

"But in the last few decades,
psychologists, neuroscientists,"

even economists have
begun to study happiness

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.830
using the same scientific
methods they use to study

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:27.130
every other aspect
of human behavior.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.160

"GILBERT: Turn on
the television, surf the
Web, visit a bookstore,"

no shortage of people

known as the self-help industry.

"This industry may or may
not have made anyone happy,"

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.000

some people very rich.

Youre in the preferred section.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.960

money was brought in by
conferences like this one,"

and personal fitness

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.800
"to ""Fairy Magic""

"Wow, theres a lot of
money to be spent here."

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.500
"Yes, there is."

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.860
How much money are you
going to spend here?

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.030
"Well, we didnt even make
it around the tables,"

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.230
but it looks like we're
going to be spending a lot.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.630
Stuff looks great.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.700
GILBERT: The desire
for happiness drives
different people

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.330
toward different things.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.360
Some have come here
hoping to lose weight;

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.330
"some are hoping to
find a new partner,"

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.800
"a new career, or a whole
new view of the universe."

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.430
"Unbelievingly, amazingly, about
the mind over body connection."

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.730
"Getting a better job,
love, relationships..."

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.400
All the good things in life.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.330
GILBERT: But some people
have come here with
very serious problems

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.800
and they may not be
in the right place.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.260
"Many have been drawn by Louise
Hay, the founder of Hay House."

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.800
She claims to have
cured herself of cancer

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.760
"through positive thinking and
other self-help techniques,"

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.330
"and she tells others
that they can do it, too."

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.560
"Although her claims have never
been medically verified,"

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.400
shes been a guest on Oprah

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.360
"and her memoir,
Heal Your Life, has sold
over 35 million copies,"

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.560
making her one of the best-
selling authors of all time.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.200
WOMAN: Please join me in
welcoming Louise Hay.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:55.130
(applause)

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.930
I choose the thoughts
that make me feel good.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.630
"And if you will be very careful
about the thoughts you think,"

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.560
that you choose to think...

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.060
GILBERT: Hay is
right when she says

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.060
that our thoughts
affect our feelings

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.460
and that we have some control
over the thoughts we think.

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.030
"HAY: Life loves
you, I love you."

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.530
Do you love you?

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.430
Thats the important thing.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.200
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.630
"Thank you, thank
you, I accept."

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.230
"I do, you're damn right!"

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.330
(laughter)

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.030
GILBERT: But Hay also believes
that thoughts are the cause

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:30.460
of all misfortunes...

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.900
"Because, remember,
somebody who has depression"

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.460
is choosing thoughts that
make them feel rotten.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.030
GILBERT: That by
thinking the wrong way we
can give ourselves cancer

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.330
"or AIDS or depression,
cause cars to hit us,"

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.130
or make ourselves the target
of a terrorist attack.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.700
"HAY: When I became
80, I decided"

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.660
"that it was going to be the
best decade of my entire life,"

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.660
and it is. (applause)

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.660
Im 82.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.100
"As I go through your book,"

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.530
I see all sorts of maladies
and various kinds of thoughts

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.560
that you say can cause them.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.860
Alzheimers is an
inability to face life;

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.930
"leprosy, an inability
to handle life at all."

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.660
"Oh, youre picking
the fun ones."

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.400
People who have Alzheimers

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.000
are really removing themselves
from life completely.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.560
How do you know?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.360
"How do you know what
you're saying is right?
Oh, my inner ding."

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.400
Your ding? My inner ding.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.160
It speaks to me.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.530
"Yes, it feels right or
it doesnt feel right."

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.860
Happiness is choosing thoughts
that make you feel good.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.960
Its really very simple.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.660
I hear you saying that
even if there were no proof

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.400
"for what you believed,"

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:41.230
"or even if there was
""scientific evidence""
against it..."

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.260
"Well, I dont believe in
scientific evidence,"

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.030
I really dont.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.430
Science is fairly new.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.760
It hasnt been around that long.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.730
"We think its such a big
deal, but its, you know,"

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.530
its just a way of
looking at life.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.430
But youre telling it
to millions of people

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.830
"and you're telling them
it's right for them, too."

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.500
I'm telling them
what's right for me.

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.760
(sighs)

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.160
"My inner ding,
that's all I can say."

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.600
GILBERT: You know what?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.530
Science is fairly new.

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:11.360
But when we want to know
what causes stars to explode

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.330
"or butterflies to migrate,"

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.660
we rely on scientific evidence
rather than our inner ding.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.500
So why not do the
same thing to find out

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.800
what causes human happiness?

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.160
"MAN: For thousands of years,"

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.530
philosophers were
asking about happiness

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.400
and talking about happiness
but without any data.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.560
And only probably in
the last 30 or 40 years

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.060
"have we actually collected
scientific data, rigorous data,"

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.430
measured happiness and started
to begin to see what is it

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.860
that leads to happiness.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.960
GILBERT: Psychologist
Ed Diener is a pioneer

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.000
in the study of happiness.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.560
"Since 1980, he and
his collaborators"

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.230
"have crossed the
globe to measure it,"

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.860
"surveying diverse
communities from the
Maasai tribe in Africa,"

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.730
"to the Inuit of
northern Canada,"

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.800
to the Amish of
rural Pennsylvania

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.400
"and many, many others."

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.360
And the methods Diener uses are
as diverse as his subjects.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.700
"DIENER: In happiness
research, we ask people
how happy they are"

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.260
on a one to ten scale.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.430
We also look at brain waves.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.260
You can look at hormones

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.630
"like cortisol that reflects
stress, for example."

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.430
You can also ask
family and friends

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.200
"how happy that person is,"

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.960
because family and friends see
how happy they say they are

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.660
and how happy they
act in everyday lives.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:33.260
GILBERT: Diener has
gathered data on nearly
a quarter million people

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.100
"and has found that the happy
ones have better health,"

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.330
"better relationships, better
sex lives, better careers"

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.730
and better just about
everything else.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.160
DIENER: We think thats
an evolutionary thing.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.660
And the people who are happy

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.300
probably out-achieve the other
people and out-reproduce them

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.130
and theres more
of us around now.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.900
"GILBERT: Dieners findings
have been confirmed
by psychologists,"

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.560
neuroscientists and
economists around the world.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.300
We now know a great deal about

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.530
"what actually
makes people happy,"

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:06.730
and it isnt always
what we think.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:07.830
What does happiness mean to you?

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.200
Im a firm believer

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.300
in money is happiness.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.530
"Okay, I have to be honest."

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.300
My children cause
I love my children.

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.260
I like my summer camp the best.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.730
Is that the best?

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.630
That makes you happy?

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.260
What do you do to
make yourself happier?

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.730
"Well, I dont mean
to be recalcitrant,"

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.830
but I dont do anything
in order to be happy.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.130
Rolling down your
window and letting...

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.030
"turn the music on, letting
the breeze come in."

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.430
What would you say is your
greatest source of happiness?

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.760
"Well, I get a great
deal of happiness"

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.660
from beautiful jewelry.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.760
Jewelry? Yes.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.360
(laughter)

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.260
GILBERT: There are a lot
of different opinions
about what causes

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.800
"happiness, but
research suggests"

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.960
that not all of them
are exactly on target.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.330
Do you think marriage is
a source of happiness?

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.060
BOTH: Most of the time.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.700
Depends on what your
marriage is like.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.330
What do you think
about marriage?

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.060
Do you think its a source of
happiness for most people? No.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.930
What about marriage?

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.800
Do you think married people are
happier than unmarried people?

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.360
No.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.660
I dont think theyre less happy;
I think it just depends.

00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.800
"GILBERT: Not everyone lives
happily ever after, of course,"

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.100
"but studies do show
that on average,"

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.000
"married people are wealthier,"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.430
"healthier and, yes,
happier than others."

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.730
Do you think children
make people happy?

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.530
I think so.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.160
"I mean, I think theyll be
a part of my happiness."

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.060
Yes or no: do children
make you happy?

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.430
Mine do.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.960
GILBERT: So what about
those bundles of joy?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.660
"Well, studies show that parents
are no happier than non-parents"

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.960
and are often less happy.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.860
GILBERT: Can money
buy happiness?

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.130
"No. No, it doesnt."

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.530
"Do you think money can buy
happiness, can bring happiness?"

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:42.260
No.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.530
Does money buy happiness?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.660
Not at all.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.860
What about money?

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.200
Do you think money
makes people happy?

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.700
Absolutely.

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:50.100
And the more the better?

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.030
"For me, especially,
the more the better."

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.260
GILBERT: Guess what?

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.660
Money does cause happiness.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.630
"On average, the more
money people have,"

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.260
the happier they tend to be.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.060
"So, money? Yes."

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.760
Marriage? Probably.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.130
Children? Not so much.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.060
What science is
teaching us about these

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.600
"and many other things is that
they are related to happiness,"

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.830
but not necessarily in
the way you might think.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.130
MAN: I grew up in
the South Bronx.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.930
"We had every gang banger, the
Savage Skulls and the Bloods,"

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.100
and the this and the that.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.660
It was difficult to survive.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:30.230
And I was always one paycheck
away from being homeless.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:33.930
"So, for two-and-a-half
years, every week,"

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.330
"regardless of what
the jackpot was,"

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.660
I would go in and
just play the lottery.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.760
(chiming bell)

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:47.060
NEWSCASTER: Falcon
won $45 million.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.030
He is New York's
single-largest winner ever.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.800
Today the former starving artist
said hell take his winnings

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.860
and begin his dream performance:
a one-man show he calls

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.900
"""A Short Puerto Rican Guy
Sings Songs of Angst."""

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.600
"Now I can afford to rent
out a theater and do it,"

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.030
and do it the way
I want to do it.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.260
Im a performance artist.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.800
Usually people are
always telling me

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.430
"what it is I should be doing,
and I shouldnt be doing that,"

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.400
and I should be and now I'm
just gonna do it my way.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.260
Flash

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.230
Bam

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.930
Wonderful you

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.060
Came by.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:23.730
(applause)

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:31.930
FALCON: Life is change and
money is going to change you.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:33.930
I moved into a
beautiful building.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:36.900
"An uber-luxury apartment,
in an uber-luxury building."

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.560
I'm getting all the things
that I dreamt of getting.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.360
Anything Italian is
a great pleasure.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.860
(laughs)

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.130
It applies to so many things:

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.230
"the art, the clothing."

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.030
"All the good stuff is from
Italy; it just is, you know?"

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.460
"It's the fun of collecting, and
I've always been a collector."

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.630
"GILBERT: When people
are asked what would most
improve their lives,"

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.200
they almost always
say more money.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.000
But are they right?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.060
Weve done a lot of research
on money and happiness

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.600
over the last couple of
decades and what we find is

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.130
coming out of poverty
increases your happiness.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.400
"So, if you take somebody
who wins a lottery,"

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.760
"and they were in financial
trouble, they had no money,"

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.960
it could make a significant
difference to their happiness.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.000
"Now, on the other hand, what if
the richest man in the world"

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.400
wins a hundred-million lottery?

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.630
"And now, instead of
having 50 billion,"

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.530
he has 50 billion and
a hundred million.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.000
It's nothing.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.760
"So, it really does make a
difference where you start"

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.160
in terms of what kind of
impact money will make.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.460
"GILBERT: When
it comes to happiness,
every dollar you earn"

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.330
buys just a little bit
less than the last one.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.460
"Of course, if money
doesnt make you happy,"

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.060
then you just might not
be spending it right.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.130
What we know about
lottery winners is that

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.160
"when they make changes in their
life and lose their friends,"

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.660
when they make changes in
their life and misspend money

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.100
"on drugs, and so forth,
from a number of cases,"

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.900
we know that that's going
to make you unhappy.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.130
"On the other hand, some people
who use their money correctly,"

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.900
"and they use their money
to help their family,"

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.860
"they use their money
to help charity,"

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.160
those kind of people
can be happier.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.730
"The thought came to me,"

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.500
"""Oh, my goodness, Ill
be able to, you know,"

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.100
"""send my niece and
nephew to college."

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.830
"I'll be able to
pay for college."""

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.560
And I got weak in the knees.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.330
I never would have thought Id
be able to give them anything

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:31.330
but flying kites...

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.600
(laughs)

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.500
an occasional electrified
train or something.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.860
"I mean, heres the idea"

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:43.860
"that they can go to
college, and any college."

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.030
"Oh, did the new money
strain any relationships?"

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:49.000
"Yes, quite a few."

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.160
There were friends
that Ive had...

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.860
"you know, well, all these..."

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:59.460
"all my friends were struggling
painters, writers, singers,"

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.030
"performance artists, whatever,"

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:02.630
and a few of them
couldn't handle it.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.560
All of a sudden I became
something else to them

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:07.430
and they just
couldn't handle it.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.800
Why?

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.500
"I don't know, cause
we stopped speaking."

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.360
"But you know, there are other
friends who did hang around"

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.760
and were still friends.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.360
WOMAN: Hes very open.

00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.000
You dont meet people that are
as open as he is that often.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.630
"John is a person you can laugh
with, you can get serious with,"

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.130
you can argue with.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.400
"And hes just a very
stimulating, fun,"

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.030
interesting man.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:35.530
GILBERT: Lois Mirviss is one of
John Falcon's oldest friends.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.560
She met him 20 years ago when
both were struggling artists.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.460
"MIRVISS: Wow, these
are beautiful."

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.700
"GILBERT: After John won
the lottery, he hired Lois"

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.730
to help design and
decorate his home.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:46.860
It needs to be longer
or thicker or something

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.660
just to be a little
more presentational.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.760
But it's a beautiful doorknob.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.330
MIRVISS: I dont know if I've
ever told this to John.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:54.960
When my husband came
home and told me

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.500
"that John had won the lottery,
I got very concerned."

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.400
"I thought, ""Oh, poor John."

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.900
"What a responsibility."""

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.260
Money is fun.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.430
"Money gives you the freedom
to do all kinds of things,"

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.030
but its also a burden.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.330
And I've always
impressed with John.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.430
I have to give him
credit for that.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.200
"He's a frivolous man,
but hes not foolish."

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:18.260
And Ive watched him
take this responsibility

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.000
and to have fun and yet be
supportive to his family.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.960
"So, hes taken all
of these elements"

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.330
"that are quite often misused,
and he's used them very well."

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.530
It takes a lot more
work to be happy

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.100
"than it does to be
unhappy, to be miserable."

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.860
Misery is so easy.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.300
You can just go right into it.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.830
"""I'm unhappy about this."

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.230
"""I don't like that color;
I dont like scallops."

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:44.730
"I don't like..."""

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.430
"You can just go right
into it, and just..."

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.730
"it snowballs, it snowballs."

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:53.200
But being happy/content
takes work.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.860
You have to work at it.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.230
"Yeah, I think so
far it's been fun."

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:01.730
But is it a life well lived?

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.130
I don't think a life well
lived depends on money.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.030
"So, I don't know if
my life is well lived."

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.630
I think other people
have to judge that.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.100
Anyone that tells you

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.860
"money doesnt bring happiness
is an ass, is a fool."

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.060
I think what happens
with more money

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.560
"is that there are
more highs available,"

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.860
"so theres more access to
shopping, drugs, trips,"

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.260
theres more access to highs.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.960
"So if we call that happiness,
yeah, more available."

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.800
(laughs) But I don't
call that happiness.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.330
"There is no key to happiness
in my book, except maybe,"

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:42.100
"you know, another $20 million
film, which will never happen."

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.530
(laughs)

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.130
"So, I can't look forward to,
like, great happiness ahead."

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:50.630
Money can't buy you fulfillment.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:55.460
"It can, at some times,
buy you peace of mind,"

00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:01.330
"but it cant make you a happier
person and, in some ways,"

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:08.830
knowing that makes you even
less of a happy person.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.160
"GILBERT: So, what is
the relationship between
money and happiness?"

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.630
"Well, most of us think that if
we were a whole lot richer,"

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.400
wed be a whole lot happier.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.330
But research shows this
isn't necessarily true.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.560
"So, why do we all believe it?"

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.100
"Well, as it turns out,"

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.800
people arent very
good at predicting

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.630
what will and won't
make them happy.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.900
"In a recent experiment,"

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.000
researchers went
to a health club

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.100
and asked a simple question.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.830
Youre gonna live in the woods
for two days and two nights.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.300
"You can have food or
water but not both,"

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.760
which would you rather have?

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.330
Food or water?

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:44.360
Food.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.360
"Uh, I'd say food."

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.930
"Okay, circle that."

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.030
GILBERT: Some of the people
were asked this question

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.360
before they worked out.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.600
Some were asked after
they worked out.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.800
And when they were asked

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.630
made a huge difference
in how they answered.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.800
"In fact, people were 50%
more likely to say ""water"""

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.700
if theyd just
finished working out

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.030
than if they were
about to start.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:09.130
Water.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.530
Definitely water.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.260
GILBERT: Why?

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.500
"People were thirsty
after exercising,"

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.130
"and because they
were thirsty now,"

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.600
they imagined being
thirsty in the future.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.560
This is something our
brains do all the time.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.430
"When we think about how
well feel in the future,"

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.960
our thoughts are shaped by
how we feel in the present.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.260
Its as if our brains cant
believe that we might feel

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.760
differently later
than we do now.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.860
Thats not the only thing our
brains cant quite believe.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.100
We all know that feelings
inevitably change over time--

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.760
"that new love fades,
that fresh wounds heal."

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.830
"And yet, when we imagine our
future joys and future sorrows,"

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:53.500
we tend not to think about
how time will change them.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.360
We sure do have the
compelling intuition

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:00.460
"that somehow improving our life
circumstances, our situations,"

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:04.060
"whether it has to
do with relationships
or jobs or health,"

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:05.800
that that's going
to make us happier.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.960
"And the truth is that
it does make us happier,"

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.530
but it doesnt make us happier
for as long or as intensely

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.000
as we think it would.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.200
GILBERT: Psychologist
Sonja Lyubomirsky suggests

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.060
that were sadly mistaken when
we expect that the things

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.930
that make us happy for a day

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.760
will make us happy
for a lifetime.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.360
"LYUBOMIRSKY: Its a phenomenon
called hedonic adaptation,"

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.100
which means that human
beings basically are just

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.260
"incredibly good at
getting used to,"

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.200
"getting accustomed to,
adapting positive changes,"

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.260
"especially in their lives, like
the new car or the new house."

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:41.730
And so thats one of the
reasons that we keep

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.960
sort of buying more
stuff is that we...

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.160
"you know, we get the handbag,
that gives us a boost."

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.560
It wears off and then
we get a new handbag.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.760
GILBERT: Adaptation
affects our experience

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.460
of both good things
and bad things

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.060
in ways that we find
difficult to anticipate.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.060
This is something my colleagues
and I have been studying

00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:00.500
in the lab.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.700
And wed be very happy to
give you one as a gift

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.430
for participating
in the experiment.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:05.930
Which one would
you like to have?

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.700
"GILBERT: In one experiment,
we brought people into a room"

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.830
filled with art posters and
offered to give them one.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.230
We told half of the participants

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.900
that their decision
was irreversible

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.560
"and that once theyd made it,"

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.400
they could never
change their minds.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.430
We told the other half that
they could exchange the poster

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:27.200
they chose for a different
poster any time they wanted.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.800
"After making their choices,"

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.500
we asked both groups
to rank their posters.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.060
And guess what?

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.100
The people who knew they
couldnt exchange their posters

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.530
liked them more than the
people who knew they could.

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.830
Why? Because they had no choice.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.030
And so they adapted.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.430
The lesson of this
study was clear:

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.930
people find ways to like things
when they're stuck with them.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.330
"When we cant change
our circumstances,"

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.230
we change the way we think
about those circumstances.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:59.860
And yet most of us dont seem
to realize this will happen.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:04.230
MAN: Theres a part of me that is

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.060
the most hyper person ever.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.400
"The minute I was
born, I was running."

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.860
I was like a Red Bull baby.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.530
GILBERT: Francesco Clark was
a young man with big dreams

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:17.800
when he moved to New York City
to take a job in publishing.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.430
CLARK: It was very exciting.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:23.000
"It was movies, it was
television, it was celebrities,"

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.500
it was everything that

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:30.300
a 22-year-old graduating
college kind of dreams of.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:33.600
"GILBERT: Then, in
the blink of an eye,"

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:35.900
his life was forever
transformed.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.860
"CLARK: I had a summer rental,
and I get to the house"

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.400
and there's a pool.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.300
"And it was a nice summer day,"

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.500
so naturally I wanted
to go swimming.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.430
"The second that I
dove into the pool,"

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.300
my chin hit the bottom
and my head snapped back.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:25:00.100
"In one millisecond, my
life changed completely."

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.000
I was told I was going to
die three times that night.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I couldn't breathe on my own.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.160
I was on a ventilator.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:10.900
I had a tube going
down my mouth.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.030
GILBERT: Francescos doctors said

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.530
that hed never be
able to move again.

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.830
CLARK: I was depressed
after the accident.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:19.560
"That's a pretty
big change of life,"

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.930
"to then suddenly not be
able to eat on your own,"

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.800
"or not be able
to brush your teeth, or
to go to the bathroom."

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.160
"Its... you know, theres
a sense of embarrassment"

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.530
that comes with it at first.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:33.230
"When you cant feed yourself,"

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:38.200
"when you cant scratch your
nose, it can drive you crazy."

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.000
"So, I just wanted to fix it."

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.400
"I just wanted to, you know,"

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.330
show them that I was
gonna get better.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:45.660
I had to; I had no choice.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.160
"I mean, what are you gonna do?"

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.800
Are you just gonna sit?

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.060
You're just gonna lay
in bed and wither away?

00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.360
I didn't... I didn't
want to do that.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:26:02.160
I wanted to... I wanted to live.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.760
I started to feel better.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.360
"It wasnt a specific day and
it wasnt a specific time,"

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:11.800
"but I realized that it wasnt
about my injury anymore,"

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.130
and it wasnt about this
metal frame that I sit on.

I want to do with my life?"""

CLARK: I started a skin care
line called Clarks Botanicals.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.400
That started because
of my injury.

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.030
I lost the ability to sweat.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:33.460
"It looked like I had specks
of sand under each pore,"

"and it was red, it was flaky,
it was gray, it was sensitive."

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.160
It looked like it was aging.

tried everything prescription,"

"Ive tried everything
over the counter."""

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.600
I started to look at essential
oils and botanical extracts.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.400
"So, I had these, like, ugly
little vials that I would use."

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.060
"And then my sister
started using it,"

"running his own

as an advocate for
people with disabilities.

"I love every aspect of my
life, from work to my friends"

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.260
to being with my family
to thinking about

living an independent life.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.400

exactly who I was before.

"I laugh at the same jokes,
I love the same movies."

"I have the same
sense of curiosity,"

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.160

everything is more...

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.260
(sighs)

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.830
"I don't know, Im just as
stupid as I was before."

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:58.330
It's just that I've
learned more about myself.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:02.430
"GILBERT: The ability to
bounce back is admirable,
but it isnt unusual."

00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:05.500
People who suffer a wide range
of traumas and tragedies

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.030
tend to recover more quickly

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.400
than they themselves
would have predicted.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.730
"Yes, theyre sad,
theyre miserable,"

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:13.730
"theyre even devastated
for a while,"

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.900
but studies show that most
people end up being as happy

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.130
or nearly as happy
as they were before.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.930
Resilience isn't rare.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.660
"In fact, its very common."

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.700
There is some set
point to happiness

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.230
that you tend to return toward

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.900
and for some people
its very happy

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.830
and for other people
its mildly happy.

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:35.200
"And unfortunately, for a few
people it may not be happy."

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.700
But the set point is
good in the sense that

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.860
"when we have something terrible
in our life happen to us,"

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.900
"we get very depressed, we get
less satisfied with our life,"

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.660
"but slowly, over time, we come
back toward that set point."

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:53.160
GILBERT: This process is
critical to human happiness.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.460
But how do we do it?

00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.060
And why do some of us do it so
much more easily than others?

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.530
"For more than 15 years,
Dr. Dennis Charney"

shown exceptional resilience

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.000
"after trauma,"

CHARNEY: It was fascinating to
deal with resilient individuals

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.200
"because when you met them, you
looked at them and thought,"

"""Well, how did you...
how did you do this?"""

GILBERT: One of Charneys
most interesting subjects

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.600
"was Bob Shumaker, a
former Navy pilot."

SHUMAKER: I grew up on a
farm in western Pennsylvania.

"My parents were middle class,"

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.600
so I consider myself
fairly average.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.330
But average people get thrown
into extraordinary situations.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.730
"GILBERT: Bobs ordeal
began in 1965,"

combat duty in Vietnam.

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.160

and had a son.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.400
"Then, suddenly, life as
he knew it came to an end."

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.300
SHUMAKER: The mission I was on

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.860
was just north of the
demilitarized zone

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.300
that separated North
Vietnam from South Vietnam.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:10.860
We were really low and I pulled
out right over a flak site.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.360
(explosions)

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.060
And they managed to hit
me in the tail section

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.130
and the plane
flipped upside down

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.660
"and I ejected and the
parachute fortunately opened,"

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.500
but opened only 35
feet above the ground

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:29.660
and so I broke my
back as I landed.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.860
"That was it, you know,
they got me, they bound me,"

00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:37.660
had handcuffs on me behind
my back and marched me off.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:39.230
"GILBERT: For eight years,
Shumaker was shuttled"

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.500
"between North
Vietnamese prisons,"

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.460
"including the
infamous Hanoi Hilton,"

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.660
where he was brutally tortured.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:48.400
SHUMAKER: The really worst
technique was what wed call

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.660
"the rope treatment, where
they would tie a rope"

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:52.330
"from your handcuffs,
up over your shoulders,"

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.030
"and down to your feet,"

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:56.030
and they would
tighten this thing up

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:59.260
so that eventually your
head would reach your feet.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.700
"And you think it cant
happen, you know,"

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.000
"particularly when your
knees are straight, but..."

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.500
"it was excruciating,"

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.730
and then they jammed an
iron bar down my throat

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.560
to keep me from screaming.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.260
"So, that was the technique
that would get you to condemn"

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.960
your own grandmother
if you had to.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.660
GILBERT: The torture Shumaker
endured was not just physical.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:24.160
"For almost three years, he was
held in solitary confinement."

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.830
"SHUMAKER: There were 11
of us in cells, no windows"

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.600
and a solitary light
bulb hanging down

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.800
that burned 24 hours a day.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.600
"GILBERT: To deal
with his isolation,"

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.260
Shumaker imagined the
house that he would build

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.130
for his young family
if he ever returned.

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:42.700
Im almost embarrassed to admit
to you that there would be days

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.460
when I would spend
maybe ten or 12 hours

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:48.600
just thinking about how many
bricks were in this house.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.830
"I knew that there were, say,
5,227 nails in the thing,"

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:56.660
so many board feet of lumber.

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.430
Id spend a year and a half
designing the perfect house

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.930
"and then one day Id say,
""Well, what would happen"

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.400
"if I moved the fireplace from
this room to that room?"""

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.860
Itd send me back to square one
and I'd redesign the thing.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.400
GILBERT: Although Shumaker
was physically isolated

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.730
"from the other prisoners,"

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.000
together they created an
ingenious form of communication.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.630
SHUMAKER: We developed
a tap code in which the
alphabet was arranged

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:25.030
in a square that had five
rows and five columns.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:28.160
Youd say (tapping)...

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:29.460
"thats the second
row, second column,"

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.630
"this is ""G""."

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:32.800
(tapping)

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.760
"First row, second
column-- ""B""--"

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.160
"and ""U"" is..."

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.260
(tapping)

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.130
"Fourth row, fifth
column is the ""U"","

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.800
"so ""GBU"" was
""God bless you."""

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.660
"So the tap code really
kept our spirits alive,"

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:48.860
"our hopes alive, our dreams."

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:53.400
So we transmitted things like
French lessons through the wall

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.130
and music lessons and how
to fix a television set

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.300
"and biology lessons,"

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.330
so we spent a lot
of time on the wall.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.560
"GILBERT: These
conversations were crucial
to Shumakers survival,"

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.430
and they became a focus of
Dennis Charneys research.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:12.800
CHARNEY: Social
support is a key factor

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.900
in becoming a
resilient individual.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.700
You can't do it alone.

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.430
You need other people.

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:22.160
I think the tap code
experience of the POWs

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:25.560
is among the most
important lessons.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.430
"And we use the phrase,
""Everybody needs a tap code."""

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:31.660
Everybody needs a way of
communicating with other people

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.160
"to establish friendships
that are supportive,"

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.600
"to establish relationships
that provide you a guidepost,"

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.160
as you get through tough times.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.630
GILBERT: Charney also discovered
that highly resilient people

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.930
tended to share some
other qualities as well.

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:50.460
"They tended to have strong
religious or moral beliefs,"

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.800
"strong role models, and a
strong streak of optimism."

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.100
It was not a
unrealistic optimism.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.530
They were able to accurately
apprise themselves

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.200
of what they were facing.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.000
"So, it wasnt denial."

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.760
They knew that they
had been traumatized

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.800
or they were facing a
very difficult situation.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.130
"But they had an ability
to be optimistic,"

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.230
that somehow that
they would prevail.

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.530
SHUMAKER: I only received
seven letters in eight years

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.830
"and the letters were...
occasionally were pessimistic,"

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.960
like telling me my
mother had suddenly died

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.930
and things like that.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.230
"And you just have to be able
to, you know, just suck it up"

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.630
and reach down
somewhere in your soul

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:37.460
and come out with the
wherewithal to overcome

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:42.130
the present circumstances and
be upbeat and get on with it.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:45.500
"GILBERT: After eight
years of captivity,"

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.760
"Bob Shumaker was
finally released,"

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.030
his spirit unbroken by
the horrors he endured.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:54.300
The first thing he
did was call his wife.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.760
WOMAN: I wondered
who this man was.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.130
I didnt know him very much.

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:03.660
We had a very short courtship.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.800
Our baby was born
just five weeks

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:10.860
before Bob was shot
down and captured.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.700
"I remember this
phone call saying,"

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:18.700
"""Hi, honey,"" and
that literally erased
eight years of time."

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:25.400
"It's hard to explain that, but
that was the person I knew."

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:30.830
And that was the person
that returned home.

00:36:30.830 --> 00:36:33.830
GILBERT: Shumaker had done
more than just survive.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.230
"In his view, he had grown."

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.400
I suppose one way of looking
at eight years of imprisonment

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.660
"is to say, ""Hey,
thats just wasted time."

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:45.560
"You know, I have to put that
behind me, its unfortunate."""

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.830
"But, paradoxically,
I gained something"

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.760
out of this eight
years of experience.

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.630
"GILBERT: In the years
after his release,"

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.830
"Shumaker became a rear
admiral, a college professor,"

00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:59.900
"a devoted husband and father,"

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.630
and he turned the house
that hed so often imagined

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:04.830
into a reality.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.560
"SHUMAKER: It was something in
my soul I just had to get out,"

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.330
"you know, and see
to fulfillment."

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.460
I wanted a house that had
a lot of openness to it

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.860
and I think that was probably as
a result of my being confined

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.300
"without windows or anything,"

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.600
so the house I designed
has a lot of glass.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.900
"I was deprived of freedom
for such a long time,"

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:30.130
I think I really cherish freedom
more than most people do now.

"CHARNEY: Bob, like
almost all the other POWs"

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:35.860
"that we interviewed and
got to know very well,"

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:40.100
"said that, to the
following question,"

"In other words, you couldve
just wiped that out,"

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.030
it never happened.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.530
"And Bob, like many of
the others, said, ""No,"

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:54.660
"""because I learned
things about myself
during that experience,"

There are a lot of things we can
do without and still be happy.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.830
CHARNEY: The key lessons
from Bob Shumakers story

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:28.630
are that inside almost all of
us is the capacity to overcome

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.930
the most horrific of
stresses in our life

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.800
and even ultimately learn
from that stress and thrive

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.400
and grow as a person.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:44.060
MAN: You learn resilience
by falling down and
getting back up again.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.530
"And as you fall down and
get back up again, you say,"

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.660
"""Oh, my God, Im...
Im back up again."

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.460
"""The setback or the
failure that I thought"

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.800
"""I would never recover from,"

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.500
"""in fact Ive recovered
from perfectly well,"

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.160
"which means that I
can do that again."""

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.700
WOMAN: My resilience has been

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.560
slowly learning to trust

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.960
that whatever path I
take can be positive.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.860
"You know, even the worst
decisions Ive made have had,"

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.600
"you know, positive
ramifications if I choose
to learn from them."

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.330
"Well, I want to make
sure that people know"

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.500
"that Im happy that I had
a messed-up childhood,"

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.830
"that Im glad I was damaged,"

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.000
"because it made
me a better actor,"

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.060
"it made me a better writer,
it made me a better creator."

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:24.860
So I thank my family for that.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:26.800
I wouldnt trade it for
anything in the world.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.660
"Then I would
have, but not now."

"GILBERT: Human beings have
a talent for adapting,"

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.100
a talent for finding happiness
where wed least expect it.

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.760
But if we can adapt to a
lifetime in a wheelchair

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.530
"or a decade in prison,"

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.460
then why cant we adapt

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.430
to the ordinary misfortunes
of everyday life?

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.830
The answer is that adaptation
is something the mind does

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:49.560
when there's nothing
else it can do.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.960
"We adapt to misfortunes when
we know we cant change them,"

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.060
"but when we stand a
fighting chance, we fight."

00:39:56.060 --> 00:40:03.830
And that's why we struggle so
much with temporary misfortunes.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.760
MAN: I was always good at math.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.000
My dad worked in finance.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.030
When I was in high school
I took an economics class

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:14.200
where you had to pick stocks
and I just always liked it.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.860
"Went to college,
studied it there."

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.060
"My brother was on Wall
Street at the time,"

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:20.530
"he helped me get my first job,"

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:26.860
"and, uh, ten years later, here
I am, unemployed in a chair."

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.800
GILBERT: Bill OConnor was a bond
salesman at Lehman Brothers

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.660
when Wall Street began to
collapse in the spring of 2008.

Stephanie had a new baby,"

on that day that you join,"

"they inscribe your name
on it, and someday,"

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:54.230
"if you stay there long enough,
that bullet will be fired."

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.560
"GILBERT: Bill saw a lot of
his friends being laid off,"

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.530
and he worried about
what would happen to him.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.900
"But when the axe finally fell,"

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.100
Bill did something
a bit unusual.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:06.760
"Steph was on maternity leave,"

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.860
and she planned to have a
sabbatical before going back

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.960
"to work, so she was planning
on having six months."

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.630
"I said, ""You know, I
dont think I want to..."

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:15.900
"""just start pounding the
pavement, looking for a job."

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.930
"Why don't... what do you
think if we buy an RV?"""

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:20.830
(laughing)

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:22.360
"And I said, ""I
think you're crazy."""

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.700
"And his mom was living here,"

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.560
"and she said, ""I
think you're crazy."""

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.660
Yeah.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.530
Wasn't a well-received
idea at first.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:32.760
"I found a very cheap
Winnebago online,"

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.460
spent the summer
together as a family

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.300
driving around the country.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.000
Were just going to break
away for a little while.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.900
GILBERT: Why would you buy
an RV if you lost your job

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.400
and had a new baby?

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.900
"Well, research on
happiness suggests that
Bill and Stephanie"

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.800
may have been spending their
money wisely by investing

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.600
in a shared experience
rather material goods.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:53.160
O'CONNOR: It was great.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.500
You get up in the morning

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.430
and you go out and
have lunch by a lake

00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:58.800
or you go swimming.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.560
It was just time together.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.200
There's just freedom.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.360
"You can just be driving
along and you see something,"

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.360
"and you say, ""That
looks interesting;
let's stop there."""

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.200
"""All right, let's
stop there."""

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.360
"You know, we went and saw the
six-legged cow in Kansas."

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:16.730
It was a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.160
STEPHANIE: I think it
really turned out to be

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.200
one of the best things we
could have done for ourselves.

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.430
"GILBERT: But no
vacation lasts forever,"

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.660
"and when Bill and Stephanie
returned to New York,"

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:28.830
Bills unemployment began to seem

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:32.200
much less like an opportunity
and much more like a problem.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.830
OCONNOR: Coming back to
New York was not good.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:39.760
I was coming back
to play Mr. Mom

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:47.430
"and look for a job that, you
know, doesn't seem to be there."

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.760
OCONNOR: What time do you
have to go to work tomorrow?

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.160
You're just working
in the office?

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.860
STEPHANIE: Im working
in the office.

00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:56.030
"GILBERT: With their vacation
a rapidly vanishing memory,"

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.530
Bill found himself
struggling to adjust to life

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:00.600
as a stay-at-home father.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.130
What else do I have
to do this week?

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:05.760
Itd be great if you can
get to the grocery store.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:18.030
Because were pretty limited in
what we have in the fridge.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:21.000
"Now we're going to shop, bud."

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.700
"Is Tide really worth six
dollars more, Matty?"

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.300
Your mothers using
generic right now.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.830
"This could cause
a disagreement, but
we're getting it."

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:34.430
"These look identical, friend."

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.630
Think you're going generic.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:41.760
"Congratulations, you've
just saved us $12."

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:47.230
"OCONNOR: I hate
expensive grocery stores,
so I opt to go across"

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:52.200
to New Jersey to Pathmark
or Shoprite or something.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.230
We get toilet paper... we
didnt get toilet paper yet.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.560
Goodness. (sighs)

00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.630
We have to reorganize.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.360
OCONNOR: Its bizarre
to have gone from a world
where I put on my headset

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.260
in the morning and I had
150 phone lines and...

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.360
"Im kind of lost without
that, without the dialogue,"

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.130
without the interaction.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.030
"And then just the confusion
of, ""Where am I going?"""

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.230
"I don't know, I have no idea."

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.960
On your back.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.660
Smile.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.930
O'CONNOR: The challenging
thing... it's a full-time job.

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.900
Ive opted for a full-time job.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.230
(baby coos)

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.660
"Matty, whatcha doing?"

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.130
"When you just want a moment,
you can't have a moment,"

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.000
so that's exhausting.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.760
(dog panting)

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.230
(baby crying)

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:44.500
OCONNOR: I never saw
myself doing the job
Im doing right now.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.800
It's bizarre.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.500
"STEPHANIE: You could tell
when he had a successful day,"

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.360
"when he had a good deal,
it was so fun for him."

00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.660
He loved what he did.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.230
"When he lost his job,"

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:03.730
it seemed like he really
lost part of his identity.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.500
"O'CONNOR: You question,
you know, ""Why me?"

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:09.760
"How could they
possibly pick me?"""

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.330
"I still send instant messages
to the guy who I sat next to,"

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:18.560
"like were chit-chatting,
you know, every day, so..."

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:21.060
"The relationships
are still there,"

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.630
but its like you got kicked
off the train or something.

00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.760
You gotta watch that thing
keep going down the tracks.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.760
"GILBERT: Bills
struggle isnt over yet,"

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.800
and theres no telling
how long it will go on.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.030
"For now, one thing is clear:
Playing the role of Mr. Mom"

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:40.100
doesn't seem to suit
him all that well.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.200
"Being unemployed obviously
makes us unhappy,"

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.930
but the reasons arent
entirely financial.

00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.000
"When someone asks us
who we are, we often
tell them what we do,"

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.660
because work is more
than a way to make money;

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.360
it's a part of our identity.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:55.100
"Thats why when
we lose our jobs,"

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.930
we lose a piece of ourselves.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:59.760
The same is true of illness.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.500
"Being sick makes us unhappy,"

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.300
but the reasons are
not entirely medical.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.530
"Illness, like unemployment, can
tear a hole in our identities"

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:12.260
and leave us wondering
who we really are.

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.530
WOMAN: My hair was me.

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:23.830
"My hair was red, full,
curly, shiny, long."

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.400
So I was all hair.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.900
"It had a presence,
and I had a presence."

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:34.160
GILBERT: Michele Gossett was
a 51-year-old single mother

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.430
when she learned that
she had ovarian cancer.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:40.160
GOSSETT: Losing my hair
was probably one of the
most devastating things

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:43.230
that happened to
me with my cancer.

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:46.360
I lost my hair in one day...

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:49.430
and I thought that
I lost my identity.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:55.730
"I thought I lost my
soul, I lost my strength."

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:02.260
I actually have a different
hairstyle almost every day.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:10.160
"For instance, I'll wear my
pink wig when I feel playful."

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.300
My red hair with the roots
I think looks very natural

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.860
and I put that on to
kind of even me out

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:21.800
but with a little edge.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.130
The brown ones... they more
or less resemble a hairstyle

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:29.500
that I would possibly
adapt myself.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:32.100
And then I have little
short sassy ones.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:38.100
And those are fun
just for a change.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:40.560
Sometimes it's not easy.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:47.500
"Sometimes I'll get up and look
at the wigs and... ""Why?"""

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:50.660
I realize I still have cancer.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:54.630
So sometimes it doesn't
really cut through that.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:48:00.730
(indistinct train
station announcement)

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:04.930
I worry about my daughter.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.400
Natalie is absolutely
the apple of my eye.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.660
She is my pride and joy.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:13.730
And Natalie and I have been
through a lot together.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.860
"I was a nurse,"

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.600
worked in critical care
for a number of years.

00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.000
"Oh, its so nice to see you."

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.060
I decided to go to
anesthesia school.

00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.400
When I finished school I had
a promise of a wonderful job

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.300
with a fabulous salary.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.660
I had a house on the water.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:38.130
My dreams were that Natalie
and I could live a secure life

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:40.260
"in my future,"

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:48.930
and that didn't materialize.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:53.160
"I was diagnosed two weeks
after my graduation,"

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:56.300
and I'm on
chemotherapy right now.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:49:00.100
My fears with my illness lie

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.760
in that Natalie might
not have her mother.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:08.560
Natalie is as important
to me as myself.

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:10.830
"So, how are you feeling?"

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:12.930
"Well, I'm really tired."

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:15.700
"It went well,
everything went great."

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:19.360
GILBERT: Michele is struggling
with her fear and anxiety.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.060
"And like many others
in the same situation,"

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.530
shes turning to the self-help
industry for advice.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:30.530
GOSSETT: Im just looking for
secrets to find inner peace.

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:33.400
I'm using aromatherapy.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.130
"Aromatherapy baths,
aromatherapy around my home."

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:42.100
Im living and eating
more organic food.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.160
Ive found that I have been
reading a lot of self-help books

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:51.830
"lately, inspirational readings,
inspirational writers."

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.830
"William Dyer,
Marianne Williamson,"

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:57.330
"Louise Hay, different authors."

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:00.300
"""You can heal
yourself"" type things."

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:01.960
"And I think thats
what we all want,"

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.130
we want to enjoy life.

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:05.530
(cheers and applause)

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:08.960

from going to the conference

"GILBERT: There is, of course,
no scientific evidence"

00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.260
to suggest that self-help
techniques can cure cancer

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:45.230
or any serious physical malady.

00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:47.200
But what about other
kinds of problems--

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.030
"problems like addiction, or
depression, or marital strife?"

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:54.430
"For many people, self-help
appears to be a simple"

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:58.030
and inexpensive alternative
to therapy or counseling.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:01.360
But do these techniques
actually work?

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.930
"Well, Im a big proponent

"GILBERT: Over the
last 20 years,"

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.160
psychology professor
John Norcross

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.960
"has directed a systematic study
of the self-help industry,"

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.730
examining over a thousand
different books and programs.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:21.000
NORCROSS: We should
be cheering about the
proliferation of self-help.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:26.400
Approximately 75% of those
who successfully changed

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.930
a behavior or relationship
have done so on their own

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.500
without professional treatment.

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.560
Self-help is the major pathway
to how most of us grow.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:36.630
At the same time there
are inherent limitations

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:38.000
"to self-help,"

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.660

there is particularly good.

Great book.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:45.860
And then a not-so-great book.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.360
GILBERT: Norcross worries
that whats advertised
as expert advice...

00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:51.330
All on the same shelf.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:52.900
"Yes, right next to each other."

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.760
GILBERT: ...is often nothing
more than untested opinion.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.430
More than 95% of all
self-help books are published

00:52:59.430 --> 00:53:01.800
without any scientific research

00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:05.160
attesting to their
effectiveness or safety.

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:10.600
And we estimate more than 99%
of the Internet self-help sites

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.230
are launched without
any scientific research

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.900
attesting to their value.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:18.660
"So youre not just saying that
some self-help is worthless,"

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.460
youre saying that some of
its positively dangerous.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.030
"Without any regulation and
without scientific research,"

00:53:24.030 --> 00:53:25.400
"its a ""buyer beware"""

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.300
and theyre not sure
what theyre getting.

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:30.700
I remember someone
once comparing it

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.060
to taking a two-year-old
toddler on a walk.

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.760
"As youre walking around,"

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.300
the toddler will
occasionally pick up

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.400
perhaps something of value but
mostly theyre just picking up

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.960
dirt and germs.

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.930
GILBERT: Self-help offers
quick and easy solutions
to complex problems.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:49.160
Thats why its so appealing
and so profitable

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.960
from the corners of
your local bookstore

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.000
to the media capitals
of the world.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.130
"And yet, despite
the proliferation"

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:57.960
"of self-proclaimed experts,"

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.960

"At 5:00, when he comes
on in our area, is
when the TV goes on."

"We see Dr. Phil,
then have dinner."

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.130
I like Dr. Phil.

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:14.700
I like his whole family; you
just feel like a part of it.

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.660
How long have you been
watching Dr. Phil?

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.360
"Well, when he was first
on Oprah years ago,"

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.130
I wouldnt watch it on that day

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.960
because I thought
he was so mean.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.660
"I was like, ""He's
so hard on people."""

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.230
"I mean, now I think thats
what I like about him,"

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.300
"is that hes just very direct,"

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.800
"just the way he does, like,"

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.760

ya?"" thing, you know?"

"""If it's not working, stop
doing it,"" so I like that."

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.100
"Its like the type of
family that I come from,"

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.430
you don't talk
about your issues.

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:42.830
"You just kind of, you know,
push it under the rug"

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:47.000
"and you dont repeat
it, because there's a
lot of shame involved."

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.930
"And so Dr. Phil,
he brings it out."

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:52.260
Its almost like an accelerated
way to fix your problem.

00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:54.830
"Because you can beat
around the bush for years,"

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:57.630
"or you can just, you know,
nip it in the bud right then."

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:12.900
(audience cheers)

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.960
DR. PHIL: And so your
goal is to inflict pain.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.300
"WOMAN: It becomes my goal,"

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:19.200
but I dont think that
when we start fighting

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.700
"that thats my goal,"

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.330
but it becomes my
goal during the fight.

00:55:22.330 --> 00:55:24.100
"Are you proud of
that? No, Im not."

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.630

serious about it."

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:27.960
"Im not, Im not. Dont
give me that crap."

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.960
GILBERT: Dr. Phil is
clearly a showman.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:33.130
But hes also a
trained psychologist

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.800
who respects
scientific evidence.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.630
DR. PHIL: I have a staff of
over 300 people on this show

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:41.630
and many of them
are researchers.

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:44.060
"So theyll get into
the psych abstracts,"

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:47.460
"the medical abstracts, the
sociological literature,"

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:53.160
and pull out those cutting-edge
overviews of everything

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.160
that is at least the
current understanding.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.400
"In my journey through the
land of psychotherapy,"

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.100
"looking into self-help,
meeting therapists,"

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:06.000
going to self-help conferences

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.060
I found that theres huge
distinctions to be made

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.960
between different
sources of help.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.300
I think science
informs practice.

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.360
I think practice
informs science.

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:19.300
"And if you dont
have that exchange,"

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:22.830
I think youre gonna miss some
really important elements.

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:25.930
"But Im not one of those
people that thinks, you know,"

00:56:25.930 --> 00:56:28.030
you can think your
way to illness

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:29.800
or you can think
your way to health.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:32.700
I think its a
multifaceted aspect.

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:36.330
"GILBERT: Dr. Phil is in
the helping business,"

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:38.930
but hes also in the
entertainment business...

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:41.900
Im going to tell them and
you how to fight fair.

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:44.830
GILBERT: ...and he knows what
it takes to keep ratings high.

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:46.860
Ill tell him that
he sucks in bed;

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.460
its just one more
way to hurt him.

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:52.160
"GILBERT: In the end,
a television show
is no substitute"

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.460

"A lot of couples go through
this kind of thing,"

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.830
which is why Im talking to yall.

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.930
GILBERT: ...something Dr.
Phil appears to recognize.

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.760
"DR. Phil: A lot of people
at home are thinking,"

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.930
"""Whew, my marriage isnt as
bad as I thought it was."""

00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:04.300
GILBERT: People watch your show

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:05.930
"hoping to get
answers, and they do."

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:08.560
"Some people watch your show
hoping to get all the answers,"

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:09.860
"and, of course, they don't."

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:11.700
"Dan, Ive never been
under the misconception"

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.660
that were doing eight-minute
cures on the Dr. Phil show.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:19.030
What we do try and do is
give people a wake-up call.

00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:22.930
"To get themselves thinking, to
get themselves considering."

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:25.230
But this is just that--
its a beginning place.

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:30.560
"It should open a dialogue, it
should open a thought process."

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.530
It should cause them to maybe
write down five questions

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:36.200
to ask their therapist or their
doctor the next time they go in

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.600
"and see em, or to discuss
with their spouse that night."

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.200
Then that's a great thing.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.760
"If they take it beyond that,"

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:47.260
"I think theyre trying to do
too much with the platform,"

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.630
too much with the venue.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.900

undoubtedly helping some people

"by reducing the
stigma of therapy,"

00:57:55.630 --> 00:58:01.460
but dealing with life's
problems is hard work.

"Self-help programs often focus
on changing how we think,"

00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.800
but research suggests that
it can be more effective

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.100
to change how we behave.

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:12.230
And one program in particular
has a track record

00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:14.300
of doing just that.

loved me unconditionally;

"GILBERT: William Cope
Moyers, son of veteran
journalist Bill Moyers,"

00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.000
found out at a young age

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.930
that all the family support
in the world wasn't enough.

00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:31.860
MOYERS: There was something
going on inside of me

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.260
that wasnt satisfied

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:36.230
by all of those external factors

00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:42.930
that would typically define
happiness or success.

00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:46.300
I was struggling with
the sense of purpose

00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.060
and the sense that I
wasn't good enough.

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.460
I discovered the solution
to this hole in the soul.

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:56.130
I could medicate it in a way
that required me only to use

00:58:56.130 --> 00:58:57.730
mood- and mind-altering
substances.

00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:01.200
I didn't have to try so
hard anymore to be happy.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.100
I didn't have to try so
hard anymore to be perfect.

00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.630
I could just get high.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:08.660
Taking drugs and drinking
probably became a problem

00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:10.230
from the moment I did them.

was crack cocaine.

I had money in my pocket.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:35.530
My problem was
finding my connection.

relapse from my addiction,"

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.260
into a pit of negativity.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:55.460
But Im getting to
the point where...

01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:59.000
LUSKIN: What I see is so often
people have become paralyzed

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.560
"because their
anger hasnt worked,"

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.060
they have no idea
what else is available

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.400
and are stuck by something
thats not working.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.260
"Anger, over time,
becomes less helpful."

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.660
It actually becomes crippling.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.660
ROWELL: And sometimes I cant

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:14.730
get beyond.

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:15.830
Thats right.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.200
...whats happened in the past.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.160
So what would forgiveness be?

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.560
"Youre right, and
what would it mean"

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.700
to forgive?

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.160
"Well, for me it would
mean everything."

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.900
Somebody else.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:30.230
GILBERT: Dr. Fred Luskin
created this program in 1999.

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:33.660
"Since then, it's been
tested around the globe."

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.700
"LUSKIN: We worked with people
from Northern Ireland,"

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.060
from both sides
of that conflict.

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:39.330
We have really good data
that it was helpful to them.

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.400
"People would come,
some of whom..."

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.730
"whose children had been
murdered decades ago,"

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:45.400
and it was just
eating them alive.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.400
"And we taught them
things about forgiveness,"

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.600
and we could show that it
made a significant difference.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.160
So what would be a
question out of that?

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.260
"LUSKIN: They had reduced
depression, reduced anger,"

01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.300
"physical improvements, reduced
stress and more hopefulness."

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:04.060
"LUSKIN: Does thinking
that someone doesnt
deserve compassion,"

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.900
does that help
solve your problem?

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.060
"No, it doesn't."

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:08.430
Does thinking

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:11.330
that someone doesnt
deserve compassion

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:12.800
help you feel at peace?

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.860
No.

01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:15.930
So why do you continue to do it?

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:19.960
"GILBERT: In each class,
Luskin provides exercises
to help students see"

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.600
"that they cant control
what happened to them,"

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.730
but they can control
how they think about it.

01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:26.400
The idea is to get people to see

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.460
"that even though their
anger is justified,"

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:31.060
it isn't hurting
anyone but them.

01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.600
LUSKIN: So the theme
through all of this is:

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.860
Is the way youre dealing
with it helpful to you?

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:38.330
"If it is, keep it."

01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:39.560
"If it's not, change it."

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.100
Try being more grateful.

01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:43.030
Try being more compassionate.

01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:44.900
Try telling a different story.

01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:48.300
Try arguing yourself out
of feeling so entitled.

01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:50.230
"Any one of those
things can work,"

01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:54.360
"but the first recognition is,
I may not be helping myself."

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:59.400
"If you do the same old same
old, expect the same result."

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.760
And don't blame
anybody else for that.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.530
Because we get something
out of being righteous.

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:07.530
We get something.

01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:10.530
"It's a substitute
for happiness, but
we get something."

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:12.660
ROWELL: Dr. Luskin
kind of provoked me.

01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:16.030
I actually left our second
class very frustrated

01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:18.630
because I disagreed with him.

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:22.530
"But, you know, I went back"

01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:27.760
"and kind of really
thought about what he
was saying, and..."

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:34.000
that's where I started
to see a shift.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.300
"You know, what is it about me?"

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.200
"You know, asking myself,
what is it about me"

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:44.700
that I can do to change things?

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.230
I really felt sort
of a breakthrough

01:08:47.230 --> 01:08:49.130
"in taking the class,"

01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:51.560
that it was sort
of a turning point.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:54.130
"Following the course, I..."

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:59.430
"I called my attorney and
said, ""Im ready to settle."

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:02.000
"""Im ready to just
put this behind me"

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.900
"and start moving forward."""

01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:08.230
I have reached a point
of forgiving this man.

01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:12.300
I feel like I can finally
join the living again.

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:18.800
And I can't tell you how
incredibly uplifting that is.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.760
GILBERT: One way
to change your life

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.230
is to identify your
weaknesses and fix them.

01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:26.730
"But recently, some
researchers have suggested"

01:09:26.730 --> 01:09:29.100
"that rather than worrying
about our weaknesses,"

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:32.600
"we should instead learn to
capitalize on our strengths,"

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.800
and theyre developing
programs to accomplish this--

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.060
"programs that are
inspired by self-help,"

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:40.460
but that are
grounded in science.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:44.000
"The question is, what
self-help actually works,"

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.030
and what self-help is
false and doesn't work?

01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:51.600
GILBERT: Psychologist Martin
Seligman is a professor

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.330
at the University
of Pennsylvania

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.300
and one of the leaders
of a new movement

01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.860
he calls positive psychology.

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.730
I realized that psychology
had been all about whining

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:03.700
"and suffering and anxiety,
depression, victims,"

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.660
"suicide, drug addiction,"

01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:08.630
"and I had spent 35 years
working on those things,"

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:10.200
but that that was half-baked.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.730
"Were pretty good at misery,"

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:15.300
but what we werent good at was
what made life worth living.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:18.430
GILBERT: What distinguishes
positive psychology

01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:20.230
from any other
kind of self-help?

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:23.730
"According to Seligman, it isn't
the message, but the method."

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:26.800
"We do random-assignment,
placebo-controlled studies"

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.730
and ask: does that make people
happier six months later

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:31.100
and less depressed?

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.360
So this is an empirically
based endeavor

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.060
and a scientifically
based endeavor.

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:41.960
GILBERT: Positive psychology
has gotten a lot of attention

01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.260
and its programs are now being
implemented all over the world

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.800
"in businesses, in hospitals,
and even in the military."

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.460
"At West Point, the
U.S. Army is hoping"

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.300
that positive
psychology training

01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.800
will enhance leadership skills

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.600
and make officers more resilient
in the face of battle.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:00.900
COLONEL PAT SWEENEY: The
graduates from West Point know

01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:02.230
"that theyre going out,"

01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:04.330
and theyre going to lead
men and women in combat.

01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:08.060
"And in ten to 12 months, theyll
report to their first unit,"

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.760
"and, you know, depending on
their combat deployment cycle,"

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:13.830
"they may be reporting straight
into Iraq or Afghanistan,"

01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:17.900
and theyll be responsible for
the lives of 45 men and women.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.700
"If you were the commander
of a lost battalion,"

01:11:19.700 --> 01:11:22.460
"in combat, in dire situation,"

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.060
what character strengths
did you rely on

01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:27.430
that were important for
leadership in combat?

01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:28.960
"WOMAN: Everyone always thinks
of physical leadership,"

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.600
but in this situation

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.130
its that mental leadership
that you were talking about.

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:35.400
I think of the
optimism and the hope

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.430
that he is providing for them.

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:38.930
"If you know what
youre good at,"

01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:40.960
you can be mindful
of those skills

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.630
and then use them
when you need them.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:45.330
And I think that's what
this course is all about.

01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:48.660
"GILBERT: Psychologist
Chris Peterson, a
colleague of Seligmans,"

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:51.300
has helped create this new
program for West Point.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.100
PETERSON: What we have
found in our research
over the past decade

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:56.260
"is that you cant cultivate
the whole of character,"

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.130
but you can certainly
cultivate its components.

01:11:58.130 --> 01:12:01.000
Right-- youre 100% correct.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.730
SWEENEY: The cadets really
like positive psychology

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:06.100
"because instead of
focusing on weaknesses,"

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:09.900
"what it is, is its a
focus on your strengths,"

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.800
"and certain strengths may
be at different levels,"

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.260
"but what were doing is saying,"

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:16.960
"""Hey, lets take that strength
and lets build on it."""

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.460
GILBERT: Petersons programs
revolve around the idea

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.760
"that if you want to
develop your character,"

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.260
you have to identify
your strengths

01:12:24.260 --> 01:12:26.900
and use them over
and over again.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:31.600
PETERSON: Most of the
interventions that have
been created to date

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.060
are based on a
very simple premise

01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.730
that you are what you do.

01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:36.730
"And if you do more
of these things,"

01:12:36.730 --> 01:12:39.830
then youll be more of
whatever they represent.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:42.830
"So, how frequently
are you kind?"

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:45.330
How often are you a leader?

01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:48.200
You start to keep track of that

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:51.800
and then you start to
try to increase it.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.560
"And youre measuring
it all along,"

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:58.000
so you can see your progress.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.900
GILBERT: West Point
is now testing

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:01.830
the effectiveness of
Petersons programs

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:03.530
and the outcome is uncertain.

01:13:03.530 --> 01:13:05.530
"Nonetheless, the
Army is creating"

01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:08.560
a positive psychology training
course that will be required

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:13.200
for all its soldiers.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:16.900
And positive psychology is
also being used by civilians

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:18.130
like Bill OConnor.

01:13:18.130 --> 01:13:21.560
"Yeah, it hasn't been a
good couple of weeks."

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.630
"GILBERT: Bill still
faces a bad economy, with
no jobs and no prospects."

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:28.700
How do you focus on doing
a financial job search

01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:33.430
when you can see the whole
system is just crashing?

01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:36.260
"How do you call up a guy
and say, ""Hey, you know,"

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:38.630
"you have any idea
who's hiring today?"""

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:42.500
"You sound like an
idiot, so its..."

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:46.300
"Yeah, thats going
nowhere, I mean, its..."

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:48.260
"GILBERT: With his
situation growing worse,"

01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:51.830
Bills sister-in-law
suggested that he get help

01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:53.460
from positive psychology
coach Senia Maymin.

01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.800
So what Ill give you

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.000
over the course of our
coaching are tools.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.760
"So literally, hammer,
screwdriver..."

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.930
I will give you tools
to start some goals.

01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:05.830
GILBERT: Senia received
a masters degree from
Martin Seligmans program

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:07.900
at the University
of Pennsylvania.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:11.300
Shes trying to help Bill put his
unemployment in perspective.

01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:12.800
Because the problem is obvious.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.160
The guy doesnt have a job

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.060
and he wants to figure
out what he's doing.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:17.460
"But that... okay,
he knows that."

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.600
He's known that for
a couple of months.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.730
"How can we, rather than
say, ""Thats the problem,"""

01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:23.060
how can we move around it

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:24.500
in a way that actually
feels fulfilling

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.830
at each step of the way?

01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:27.960
And one of the mind exercises

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:29.230
between this week and next

01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:31.960
"is whats called the ""three
good things"" exercise."

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.900
"So what it is,
is every evening"

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.900
"you write down, ""Today
this happened."""

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.230
"So, for example, ""Matty
was in a great mood"

01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:40.600
"the whole time we
were at the park."""

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.400
And then below it you write the
three reasons why they happened.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.100
"So, why was Matty in a
good mood at the park?"

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:48.160
"""I played with him""
or ""I engaged him."""

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:49.530
The reason the why is important

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:51.260
"is when we look at your
whole week of ""whys,"""

01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:53.030
were going to start
to see patterns.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:55.760
"OCONNOR: I feel like were
making baby steps right now,"

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.330
which is probably the
right thing to do.

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:01.460
Come up with three good
things that happened today

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:06.700
or identifying strengths.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.530
Its your mommy.

01:15:08.530 --> 01:15:10.760
"STEPHANIE: Hey,
Matty, how are you?"

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:15.030
"STEPHANIE: At first it
seemed like it moved him
in the right direction,"

01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:16.360
and I was happy about that.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.800
And he saw that he
got more gratification

01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.300
"out of the things he did do
right, which is things like,"

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.160
"""Well, I got Matty
on the subway today"""

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:25.960
"or ""Oh, today when
Matty took a nap,"

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.630
"""I had time to
work on my resume,"

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:28.900
"""I did this or I did that"

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:30.700
"or ""I made a bunch of
phone calls to people."""

01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:35.560
I think thats the best way for
him to think about things.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:37.160
"Because if he dwelled
on the negative,"

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.330
I think it would just
be a downward spiral.

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:44.530
"GILBERT: At Senias suggestion,
Bill takes an online survey"

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:48.830
to help him identify
his strengths.

01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:50.460
"BILL: ""Please be
honest and accurate."

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.830
"""We cannot rank

"Wow, all right."

"""I find the world a very
interesting place."""

01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:05.130
Sure.

"""Every day I look

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:08.400

"""I have never steered a friend
wrong by giving bad advice."""

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.730
Theres a lot of
negatives in that.

01:16:16.730 --> 01:16:19.260
"""I must stand up

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:22.330

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:36.160
"""I am the most

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.700
"What's up, buddy?"

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.200
GILBERT: This survey
has been taken

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.400
"by hundreds of thousands
of people online,"

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.800
and its a cornerstone of many
positive psychology programs.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.560
But it doesnt seem
to be helping Bill.

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.630
"OCONNOR: Yeah, its hard to
apply that all the time"

01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:55.030
to come up with tasks that
are gonna take advantage

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:56.200
of your strengths.

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.560
"If your strength
is, you know, humor,"

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:58.830
"which showed up as
one of my strengths,"

01:16:58.830 --> 01:17:01.600
Im not going to... I dont know.

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:02.930
What am I going to do?

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:06.060
"Just go out there and, you
know, stand on a corner"

01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:08.030
and tell jokes or something
until people laugh?

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:09.700
"I mean, its like...
yeah, I dont know."

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.360
Okay. Your industrys broken.

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.730
What are you going to do?

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:15.330
You know your skills
which you know.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:17.230
"You know how to do sales, you
know how to do high yield,"

01:17:17.230 --> 01:17:19.060
"you know derivatives, you know
a lot of different things."

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:20.560
So you have your skills.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.830
"And then you have
your strengths,"

01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:23.260
which are a little
broader than skills.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:33.560
So I am pulling out your VIA
signature strengths survey.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.830
"So, if we look at this,"

01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:39.360
"and youre looking at these
cards spread in front of you,"

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.430
"which one really
jumps out at you as,"

01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:43.630
"""Yes, this is
definitely me""?"

01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:44.700
I... I don't know.

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:50.160
"Ranking them is tough, um..."

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.530
PETERSON: Positive psychology
techniques and strategies

01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:55.060
are particularly helpful

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.900
for people in difficult
circumstances.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:02.500
"I have friends who have
lost jobs, and they say,"

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:06.200
"""What does positive
psychology tell me to do?"""

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.800
"And I go, ""Well, this positive
psychologist is telling you"

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.430
"""to apply for new jobs
and go to the interview"

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:15.430
"""and be cheerful
and be engaging."

01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:17.760
"Be the sort of person they
want to have around."""

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:20.800
"OCONNOR: Hi, Justin,
my names Bill OConnor."

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.900
I wanted to get a
little information

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.930
on a posting I saw you guys had
for a UAE investment analyst.

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:33.700
"GILBERT: Bill may not
be sure about the value
of positive psychology,"

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:38.430
but he never stopped
looking for work.

01:18:38.430 --> 01:18:40.700
Investment analyst.

01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.000
"GILBERT: After
months of searching,"

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.130
he finally found
another job in finance.

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:47.500
But his success didnt
change his views

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.430
about positive psychology.

01:18:49.430 --> 01:18:54.060
OCONNOR: Positive
psychology doesnt answer
the hard questions.

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.760
"You know, when we
look at, ""Where are
we going to live?""--"

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.400
that's not an
emotional decision.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:03.460
That's a rational decision
based on a number of variables.

01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:06.960
I guess it felt like I was
fishing a lot of times.

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.530
"GILBERT: Nevertheless,
Stephanie noticed"

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:11.700
some real changes
in her husband.

01:19:11.700 --> 01:19:13.730
STEPHANIE: He does have a
tendency to be skeptical

01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:21.630
about things that don't feel as
hard or quantitative or proven.

01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:24.760
"I think its really easy to
say, ""Oh, its jotting down"

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.200
"""three things that
you did well today"

01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.700
"or three things that were
good about today is minor."""

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.460
But I think it had
a really big impact.

01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:36.660
Giggle.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:41.560
"OCONNOR: My wife and my son
are everything to me, right?"

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.460
My family is the most
important thing in my life.

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.960
"It was in the beginning,"

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:48.730
"it was through this process,
it is going forward,"

01:19:48.730 --> 01:19:52.930
"so if anything through the
process, you know, you..."

01:19:52.930 --> 01:19:55.030
thats my real strength
and thats what Ive...

01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:56.330
I've drawn upon.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:58.260
Do you mind if I
do some unpacking

01:19:58.260 --> 01:19:59.460
while you play with him?

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.630
"No, no problem."

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:03.160
"Hi, buddy! Whats up?"

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:07.360
GILBERT: The idea of focusing on
strengths instead of weaknesses

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.330
"is interesting,
but does it work?"

01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:12.500
The jury is still out.

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:16.030
Even the founder of
positive psychology worries

01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:19.330
that the enthusiasm has
gotten ahead of the evidence.

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:22.900
I think the press
and the publicity

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.460
that positive psychology has had

01:20:24.460 --> 01:20:26.860
has greatly outstripped
the science.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.700
And I think one of the...

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:32.730
"when I think about clinical
psychology 50 years ago,"

01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:34.500
I think it got a great...

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:39.530
it was overpromised both by its
practitioners and by the press.

01:20:39.530 --> 01:20:44.000
"So for me, if I had my
druthers, it would be"

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.360
"to build the science, build
the science, build the science"

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:53.060
and then kind of leak
out the findings.

01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.560
Positive psychology has some
very promising new ideas.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.360
"But for now, its
probably fair to say"

01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.960
that they need more testing.

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.600
"Of course, some
scientists think that
the most promising ideas"

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.260
aren't new at all.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:07.260
One of the best-studied
techniques

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:08.700
for improving well-being

01:21:08.700 --> 01:21:11.260
"was developed not in a
clinic or a laboratory,"

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:17.460
"but on a mountaintop
2,500 years ago."

01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:21.100
RICHARD DAVIDSON: Meditation
changes our relationship

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.530
to our thoughts and emotions.

01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:25.630
There's nothing
magical about it.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:27.930
It's not mysterious.

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:32.900
It can be addressed with the
known mechanisms of science.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:35.900
GILBERT: Psychologist Richard
Davidson has been studying

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:40.000
"the benefits of
meditation since 1992,"

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.660
when the Dalai Lama
invited him to India

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:45.660
to measure the brain
activity of Buddhist monks.

01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.730
DAVIDSON: He had heard about
me through mutual friends

01:21:48.730 --> 01:21:49.960
and knew that I was

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:55.430
"a respectable, rigorous
neuroscientist"

01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:58.300
"who had interests
in meditation,"

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.500
and he was interested in
promoting scientific research

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.360
on meditation.

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:07.760
And we thought that this would
be an amazing opportunity.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.930
We can bring portable
equipment with us

01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:14.160
and schlep it up the mountain

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:17.530
and see if we can
collect some data.

01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:20.800
So we had quite a journey.

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:24.030
"We brought about 5,000
pounds of equipment with us."

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:27.330
We looked like this crazy
traveling rock band

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:31.330
"with, you know,
these enormous cases."

01:22:31.330 --> 01:22:34.900
"GILBERT: Unfortunately,
once Davidson was ready
to collect the data,"

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.130
the monks had a change of heart.

01:22:37.130 --> 01:22:38.660
DAVIDSON: They said
that theyd be happy

01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:41.600
"to teach us everything they
know about meditation,"

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:45.860
but they didnt really
want to do the tests.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.330
GILBERT: But the Dalai Lama
himself wanted to continue

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:51.800
fostering the dialogue between
Buddhism and Western science.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.160
"DALAI LAMA: This
kind of dialogue,"

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:58.630
very helpful to
expand human knowledge

01:22:58.630 --> 01:23:02.960
about these not yet explore.

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.400
"And still vast subject,"

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.560
our knowledge very limited.

01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.560
"So, particularly
about inner world,"

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.330
"inner science, inner space."

01:23:15.330 --> 01:23:19.430
"GILBERT: In 2000, the Dalai
Lama began sending monks"

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:21.760
"to Davidsons laboratory at
the University of Wisconsin,"

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.030
where they participated

01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:25.500
in a series of
neuropsychological studies.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.100
The results surprised
Davidson himself.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.730
DAVIDSON: I thought about
meditation as relaxation.

01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:34.460
"In fact, what we
see in the brain"

01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:36.300
of an advanced
meditation practitioner

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:37.660
when he or she is meditating

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:41.400
"is heightened activation,
not relaxation."

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:44.230
GILBERT: Davidsons
studies of Buddhist monks

01:23:44.230 --> 01:23:46.400
and other experienced meditators

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.960
"suggested that while they
may appear to be resting,"

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:52.000
their minds are actually
intensely focused.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.930
"And, as they meditate
more and more,"

01:23:53.930 --> 01:23:56.960
their brains begin to change.

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.400
When Davidson compared
scans of the monks

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:02.030
"to scans of people
whod never meditated,"

01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:04.600
he found that the monks showed
considerably more activity

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.200
"in the left prefrontal cortex,"

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.200
a part of the brain that
registers positive emotions.

01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.060
DAVIDSON: There are certain
circuits in the brain

01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:15.060
that are more sensitive to the
processing of negative emotions

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:18.060
and other circuits that are more
sensitive to the processing

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.330
of positive emotions.

01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:23.330
"And more than any other
organ in our body,"

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:27.130
the brain is built to change
in response to experience.

01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:28.560
Its a learning machine.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.460
The scientific evidence suggests

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:35.130
that we can actually
train our mind

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:37.530
and shape its
circuitry in our brain

01:24:37.530 --> 01:24:43.730
in very specific ways to promote
increased levels of well-being.

01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:47.630
"DALAI LAMA: I think
scientific findings
also very, very useful,"

01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:48.830
very convincing.

01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:54.030
It can be useful
for medical science.

01:24:54.030 --> 01:25:00.760
And also can be useful for
bringing new generation

01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.700
"more healthier mind,
more compassionate mind."

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:09.730
(bell chimes)

01:25:09.730 --> 01:25:13.930
"MICHAEL BAIME: Just
give yourself a chance to
settle into your seat,"

01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:22.260
"to settle into your body, and
to settle into this moment."

01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:25.230
GOSSETT: The toxic effects
of the chemotherapy

01:25:25.230 --> 01:25:27.060
keep all of the
cancer levels low.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:30.260
"So when I stop the chemo,"

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.400
whats to stop it from
just flourishing again

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:37.860
and from just devouring me?

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:40.530
Its really important that I
put myself in a state of mind

01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:44.000
that I can stay calm
and cope with it.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.830
BAIME: Allow the focus on
the breath to expand so...

01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:49.960
GILBERT: Michele Gossett
has begun studying

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:51.930
"""Mindfulness Meditation."""

01:25:51.930 --> 01:25:55.530
She attends a weekly class at
the University of Pennsylvania

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:58.660
and does daily exercises at
home in the hope of reducing

01:25:58.660 --> 01:26:01.400
her fear and anxiety.

01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:05.100
"GOSSETT: Im doing a 40-minute
meditation every day,"

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.530
"and its extremely difficult,"

01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:10.260
because our thoughts
distract us.

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.700
And it takes a
lot of discipline.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.730
BAIME: And the only security
that we can ever have

01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:19.960
is comfort with and
confidence in our ability

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:22.060
to manage uncertainty.

01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:24.160
DAVIDSON: I think most
people would agree

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:27.000
that physical exercise
is good for your health.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.760
And the same with
mental exercise.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.200
If we took the
training of our mind

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:35.760
"as seriously as we take
physical exercise,"

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:42.460
we can actually train our brain
to transform our happiness.

01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:45.300
GOSSETT: I dont
dwell on the sadness.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:50.460
I have a lot less anxiety now
since Ive been meditating.

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.100
And I have to say that
my anxiety has decreased

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:56.600
by at least 75%.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:00.630
I find that I'm
really not anxious.

01:27:00.630 --> 01:27:02.600
I'm very calm about it.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.360
I do get sad.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:08.600
But I don't dwell
on the sadness.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:11.500
I used to think that
things would make me happy

01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:17.260
"or money, success, prestige,
position, would make me happy."

01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:20.860
And Im realizing now
that that's not the fact.

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.830
I think you cant really
put a price on happiness

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:27.430
or put a label on happiness.

01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:29.660
Happiness comes from within

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:31.660
and happiness comes from
experiences that we have

01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:37.800
with people that we love.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.900
The secret to happiness is

01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.300
that there is no
secret to happiness--

01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:43.500
"that its a choice that
you make minute by minute,"

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.000
second by second.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.160
And you have to be willing to
take the sour with the sweet.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:55.430
"Is happiness an experience,
you know, that comes and goes?"

01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:57.700
Or is it a state
that you can live in

01:27:57.700 --> 01:27:59.230
for long periods of time?

01:27:59.230 --> 01:28:01.430
I don't... I dont know.

01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:03.860
Im just happy I have
my wife and my children

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:07.300
and my many dogs and
birds and cats and...

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.430
maybe if we could lose
a couple of those dogs.

01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:12.730
I think the secret to
happiness is being busy.

01:28:12.730 --> 01:28:14.460
"The secret to happiness is,"

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:17.530
you dont have time
to think: Am I happy?

01:28:17.530 --> 01:28:20.460
Human companionship
is the greatest joy.

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:24.300
"If I look at the times in my
life where Im most happy,"

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:26.000
where Im enjoying
myself the most

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.360
is when Im with my
friends or my family

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.660
"and Im doing something
adventurous,"

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:39.130
something kind of mildly
dangerous and laughing a lot.

01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:42.860
"GILBERT: So, is there
a secret to happiness?"

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:46.200
"Well, yes, but it isn't
very much of a secret."

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.230
Scientific research suggests
that a lot of things matter--

01:28:49.230 --> 01:28:52.930
"money, health, work-- but
that one thing matters a lot,"

01:28:52.930 --> 01:28:57.660
and that thing is
social relationships.

01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:00.530
Were one of the most social
animals on our planet.

01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:02.900
"We need each other for
just about everything,"

01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.530
so it isnt very surprising
that natures designed us

01:29:05.530 --> 01:29:08.560
to experience happiness when
we're connected to others.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:14.100
"Family, friends, lovers--"

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:17.000
those are the social connections
that matter the most.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.260
"When theyre
strong, were happy."

01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:21.760
"When theyre lost,
were devastated."

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.500
WOMAN: How are you?

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.830
"STUDENT: Im good, how are you?"

01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:27.530
Hello...

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:31.300
"GILBERT: Renee and Bryan Cloyd
live in Blacksburg, Virginia."

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:34.400
Theyre doing today what they
do several times each year--

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.930
driving a group of college
students over a hundred miles

01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:40.530
to rural Appalachia
to help repair homes

01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:45.530
in this impoverished community.

01:29:45.530 --> 01:29:47.260
You want to go head up this way?

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:49.200
GILBERT: The Cloyds are
volunteering their time

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.700
to help other people...

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:52.860
"No, dont touch it
until you get one."

01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:55.030
"There you go, you just
snap the line, ladies."

01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:57.060
GILBERT: But theyre also
hoping to help themselves.

01:29:57.060 --> 01:30:00.330
RENEE CLOYD: Someone said
theres been a shooting
at Virginia Tech.

01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:02.530
"I didn't think about it,"

01:30:02.530 --> 01:30:06.000
and then something just hit.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.360
(siren wailing)

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:08.800
"I turned on the
radio, just listening,"

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.400
"trying to find some news,"

01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:15.060
and I heard that 22 had
been shot and killed

01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:18.200
at Virginia Tech.

01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.000
"I remember screaming,"

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.230
and I called my mom cause
I knew she had a computer.

01:30:24.230 --> 01:30:26.730
"And I said, ""Could you please
check on the computer?"""

01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:31.560
"GILBERT: On April 16, 2007,
their daughter, Austin,"

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:35.400
"a freshman at Virginia
Tech, was killed
in a shooting rampage"

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.730
that left 33 people dead.

01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:41.400
BRYAN CLOYD: We were
trying to call Austin.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.260
Every other parent
and every other friend

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:48.560
was trying to call
those students.

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.760
And I heard from one of the
emergency response workers

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:56.860
the most difficult thing
for them was to hear

01:30:56.860 --> 01:31:04.400
the cell phones going off
and being unable to answer.

01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:13.000
"But just hearing all
those cell phones going
off, over and over."

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.100
That's what that day was like.

01:31:16.100 --> 01:31:23.860
It was a day of horror
and hopelessness.

01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.800
Sometimes its really
comforting to be in here.

"I mean, this is a picture
of she and her friend."

not only...

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:51.260
we had no sense of direction...

01:31:51.260 --> 01:31:58.400

Austin did volunteer

"If we do something to make
another person happy,"

01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.900
do they then do the same
thing for somebody else?

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:40.830
"In fact, new evidence suggests
that happiness may be"

"as contagious as
the common cold,"

along from person to person

Massachusetts."

learn about the behaviors

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.900
that cause heart disease.

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:11.630
Their work continues today.

01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:13.060
"Known as the
Framingham Heart Study,"

01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:15.300
its one of the
worlds most extensive

01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:16.560
"epidemiological studies,"

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:19.030
containing six
decades worth of data

01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:22.230
"on the health of more
than 15,000 people."

And hidden in this
mountain of data

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.660
is a deep and powerful secret

01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:30.630
about the nature
of human happiness.

01:35:30.630 --> 01:35:34.160
NICHOLAS CHRISTAKIS:
Your happiness depends

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.160
upon whole large clusters of
people you dont even know

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.130
and who you have
no way of knowing.

01:35:39.130 --> 01:35:43.960
GILBERT: Nicholas Christakis is
a physician and a sociologist.

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:46.100
He became interested
in the Framingham study

01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:48.360
"not because he was
interested in heart disease,"

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.900
but because he was interested
in social connections.

01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:52.300
CHRISTAKIS: These individuals

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:55.500
had had their social network
ties repeatedly assessed

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.500
over this 32-year period

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:59.430
"and, as it turns out,
had had various aspects"

01:35:59.430 --> 01:36:01.630
of their emotional
lives assessed as well.

01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:03.030
So what we could tell is

01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:05.500
we could tell who these
people were connected to

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.700
every four years
or so for 30 years

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.400
"and we could
tell, for example,"

01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:12.100
whether they were happy
or depressed or lonely

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.530
"and, in some cases, anxious,
repeatedly across time."

01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:17.760
"GILBERT: Using the
Framingham data,"

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.630
Christakis and his
colleagues mapped out a web

01:36:20.630 --> 01:36:22.630
"of more than
50,000 connections"

01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:24.860
"between friends,
family and co-workers"

01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.260
who participated in the study.

01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:30.600
Then they began to calculate
how changes in the happiness

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.700
of any single person affected
the happiness of others

01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:36.030
in this vast web
of relationships.

01:36:36.030 --> 01:36:38.330
The results were astounding.

01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:42.630
"CHRISTAKIS: What we
found is that if your
friend becomes happy,"

01:36:42.630 --> 01:36:44.660
it increases the probability
that you will become happy

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.600
by about 15%.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.430
And if your friends
friend becomes happy--

01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:49.800
"someone you dont
even know, perhaps--"

01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.260
it increases the probability

01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:53.200
that youll become
happy by about 10%.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.560
"Its only when we get to
four degrees of separation,"

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.060
only when were speaking

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:01.130
"of your friends
friends friends friend,"

01:37:01.130 --> 01:37:03.930
that that persons emotional
state is no longer associated

01:37:03.930 --> 01:37:05.460
with your emotional state.

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:09.230
"GILBERT: Everyone
knows that people can
make each other happy,"

01:37:09.230 --> 01:37:12.930
"but before this study,
no one had any idea"

01:37:12.930 --> 01:37:16.200
just how powerful
this effect could be.

01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:18.030
Christakiss work shows
that happiness spreads

01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:20.960
through social
networks like a virus;

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:25.630
"that happiness is, in a very
real sense, contagious."

01:37:25.630 --> 01:37:28.760
Theres no doubt about
it: were all connected.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.960
And those connections
exert a powerful influence

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.560
on our happiness.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:37.260
Sometimes they can
even save our lives.

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:40.400
"MICHAEL MADDAUS: I
lived here about 40 years
ago, when I was a kid."

01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:46.630
"Just walking in the door of my
house was so, so unpleasant."

01:37:46.630 --> 01:37:50.200
"GILBERT: Michael Maddaus was
born in Minneapolis, Minnesota,"

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:52.530
and the troubled relationships
of his childhood

01:37:52.530 --> 01:37:54.260
left an indelible mark.

01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:59.200
MADDAUS: I was an only child.

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:01.130
I grew up with my mother
and my grandmother.

01:38:01.130 --> 01:38:05.230
My mother worked two jobs
as a waitress to support us

01:38:05.230 --> 01:38:10.500
because my grandmother was home
all the time taking care of me.

01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.960
The lid came off

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.960
that predictable
situation by two events:

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.460
"my grandmother died,
which left us in a void,"

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:21.300
and then my stepfather came in.

01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:36.160
And that's when the
alcoholism reared its head.

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.830
My mother would be in bed.

01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:42.530
My stepfather would be up in a
chair with cocktail in hand.

01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:45.930
"My mother would be bedridden
for maybe up to a month,"

01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:50.300
and she would even call
for me in a drunken tone

01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:53.330
"to bring her a drink, or
food, or something like that."

01:38:53.330 --> 01:38:56.060
"I was, of course,
bitter and angry"

01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:58.400
about what was now going on.

01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.560
"In essence Id lost my mother,
the mother that I had known,"

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.300
to this alcoholic life.

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:09.300
And thats when I
began to really start

01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:12.800
living more on the streets...

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:17.400
"and started to get into trouble
with my friends, my new family."

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:20.160
"And the trouble started
simply with shoplifting,"

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:23.730
"escalated to
burglaries, car thefts,"

01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:25.630
so that we were pretty
much running around

01:39:25.630 --> 01:39:27.600
doing what we wanted.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.460
Right over here was my friends
house and he used to deal LSD

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.500
right out of the back
of the house there.

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:34.930
A good source for all
of us at the time.

01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:38.000
"I and my friends, wed just
do everything in our power"

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.100
to find ways to alter our mood.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:45.560
"We... you know, drinking,
drugs, LSD, speed, you name it."

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.860
It was pretty much anything
we could get our hands on.

01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:51.730
Right up here on
the left is a house

01:39:51.730 --> 01:39:54.930
that we were all holed up in
and we were busted up there

01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:58.400
by a very spectacular
bunch of police outside.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:02.100
"And they had us right over
here, in front of this house,"

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:07.500
"all of us pinned down,
handcuffed on the ground."

01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:09.930
I was arrested 24 times total.

01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:12.030
"The vast majority of
that was for car theft,"

01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:14.700
occasional break-ins

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:18.360
"and other sorts of
misdemeanors, drunken behavior,"

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.200
disorderly stuff and the like.

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:23.260
But I remember every
time going down

01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:26.130
to the juvenile detention center
with its drab green cement walls

01:40:26.130 --> 01:40:29.400
and just a profound
sense of depression

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:32.800
that would occur within me
and just the hopelessness.

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:36.160
And to this day I can remember

01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:38.760
"the deep, gut-wrenching
depression"

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.760
that would come
over me in a wave.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:48.130
"You know, I don't know
what the future holds."

01:40:48.130 --> 01:40:50.660
I had a meeting with
my parole officer

01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.860
after Id been arrested one
more time subsequently.

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:57.100
"And I was sitting in the car,
outside the high school,"

01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.630
"and he told me, ""You're done."

01:40:59.630 --> 01:41:02.460
"One more arrest and
you're going to be
tried as an adult."""

01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:05.730
I had at least the
insight to know

01:41:05.730 --> 01:41:07.930
"that if I stayed in
this environment,"

01:41:07.930 --> 01:41:10.330
I was gonna get
in trouble again.

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:12.860
"GILBERT: Although many
of his friends would
soon be in prison,"

01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:15.530
"fate had something different
in mind for Maddaus,"

01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:18.960
whose life was changed forever
by a single social connection.

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:21.400
I got a job at a very
high-end furniture store

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.000
that sold very expensive
modern furniture.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:29.900
Its an environment that
allowed me to learn a lot

01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:32.060
"about the other side of life,"

01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:35.600
"where there was money, culture,
art, wine and the like,"

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.700
and this was something I
had not experienced before.

01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:40.400
So it allowed me to become
aware of this as a possibility.

01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.860
But the real transition for me
in terms of helping to guide me

01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:48.300
came through a fluke
interaction that I had

01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:51.000
in delivering
furniture to a surgeon.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.400
"It was a very big
job that we had,"

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.500
and I ended up going
out there multiple times

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.100
to install custom-made
furniture.

01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:00.600
And so I got to know him.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.500
"For whatever reason,
he saw something in me"

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:07.960
and he decided to take
me under his wing.

01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:13.500
"STACY ROBACK: My first
impressions of Mike, when
he first came in the door,"

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:20.330
there was a spark there that
was blatantly obvious to me.

01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:25.900
And his persistence in
pursuing our relationship

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:30.900
was conspicuous and
it was infectious.

01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:33.230
I wrote a letter to the
dean of the medical school.

01:42:33.230 --> 01:42:34.860
"I mean, it makes
no sense. Right."

01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.230
I wouldnt do it today.

01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:38.300
MADDAUS: I would go out
to his house on Saturdays

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:40.460
and just hang out with him.

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:42.400
And he might take
a nap on the couch

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.930
while I would sit there and
watch football or something.

01:42:44.930 --> 01:42:47.600
But when it came time for
me to ask him questions

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:50.860
"and get some guidance,
he always gave
me the right advice."

01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:52.530
"He said, ""I had
a difficult time"

01:42:52.530 --> 01:42:55.230
"""even getting a
high school diploma,"

01:42:55.230 --> 01:42:57.860
"""and I havent been to
college, and I cant read,"

01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:00.500
"and I can't add a column
of numbers together."""

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:07.160
"And my response to that was,
""Well, just... just do it."""

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:11.360
"MADDAUS: He saw worth in me,
and it could be developed."

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:17.060
And that was what
decided my fate.

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.160
Im a full professor
of thoracic surgery

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:24.130
in the department of surgery at
the University of Minnesota.

01:43:24.130 --> 01:43:25.900
And I landed upon surgery

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.100
when I got onto the rotation
as a medical student.

01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:31.700
"All of a sudden, here we are in
a high-adrenaline environment,"

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:35.730
"risky activity,
life and death--"

01:43:35.730 --> 01:43:39.600
all the things that were
certainly embedded in me

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.700
and my past and how I grew up.

01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.800
I fit in just perfectly.

01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:48.460
ANN MASTEN: The story of Mikes
life illustrates beautifully

01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:50.460
what happens in childhood

01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:54.000
and going down a dark
road doesn't doom you.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.860
That you can turn
your life around

01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:03.030
and you can construct a new life
with the help of other people.

01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:04.660
GILBERT: Psychologist Ann Masten

01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:07.560
studies how children
respond to adversity.

01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:10.260
She became interested in Maddaus
because of the way he used

01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:14.500
his adult relationships to
overcome a troubled youth.

01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:18.360
He encountered people who
began to care about him.

01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:21.830
He connected with mentors
who opened doors for him

01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:22.930
and coached him.

01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:27.000
"Yeah, we probably
should check..."

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.460
"GILBERT: For almost 30
years, Masten has been
working on a study"

01:44:30.460 --> 01:44:32.530
"that tracks over 200 people,"

01:44:32.530 --> 01:44:37.600
"many of whom,
like Maddaus, grew up in
difficult circumstances."

01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:41.230
"MASTEN: We recruited
them when they were
eight to 12 years old,"

01:44:41.230 --> 01:44:43.600
"and then we followed them
up after about seven years,"

01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.200
ten years and then 20 years.

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:49.260
We wanted to study
what was happening

01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:50.730
both when things were going well

01:44:50.730 --> 01:44:52.400
and when things were
not going so well.

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.330
And we learned a lot
about the nature of stress

01:44:57.330 --> 01:44:59.330
that kids encounter

01:44:59.330 --> 01:45:02.260
and also about all the
kinds of protective factors

01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:04.660
that seem to make a difference
in children's lives.

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:06.630
GILBERT: Mastens
findings tell us

01:45:06.630 --> 01:45:09.530
that the key to overcoming
childhood adversity

01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:12.230
lies in developing
strong relationships

01:45:12.230 --> 01:45:14.730
"with competent and
caring individuals,"

01:45:14.730 --> 01:45:17.400
regardless of how or
when we meet them.

01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.530
"MASTEN: When you're young,
they're parenting-type figures."

01:45:19.530 --> 01:45:20.900
"When youre older,"

01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:23.430
"they can be mentors,
friends, romantic partners."

01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:25.100
Any concerns or issues?

01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:26.300
You got any pains?

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:27.660
"MASTEN: In Mikes case,"

01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:30.360
"these kind of people
came into his life late,"

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.900
when he was at the
doorstep of adulthood.

01:45:32.900 --> 01:45:37.360
"And he was optimistic, even
though he probably didnt have"

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:40.230
too many reasons
to be optimistic.

01:45:40.230 --> 01:45:42.800
"And I think people around
him responded to that,"

01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:47.000
to his motivation and interest
in going in a new direction.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.730
And I think what
you see in his life

01:45:49.730 --> 01:45:55.760
is a kind of positive snowball.

01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.860
"MADDAUS: When I reflect back
about, how did this happen?"

01:45:57.860 --> 01:46:01.960
How did I manage to make a
success out of this mess?

01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:05.430
I go back to the... the
observation of others

01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:09.460
and using those as
significant opportunities

01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:10.800
for personal development.

01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:13.460
(piano melody playing)

01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.960
"Without a doubt,"

01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:18.060
one of the most important
things that bring me happiness

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:21.800
"is being engaged in my family,
in taking care of them,"

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:24.500
"in fostering my
childrens development,"

01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.600
in being a good
husband to my wife.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:29.900
"These are sometimes trite
comments that people make,"

01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.560
"you know, being
a good husband,"

01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.060
"being a father and
all that stuff,"

01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:35.560
but I actually mean it and its
something I came to learn.

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:37.800
It wasn't something
that was just immediate.

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.700
"For me, happiness
means being engaged"

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:47.060
in things that
involve other people

01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:55.530
and being committed to something
that is about other people.

01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:59.030
GILBERT: Social connections are
clearly the key to happiness.

01:46:59.030 --> 01:47:02.630
"That's a cause for
celebration, but it's
also a cause for worry,"

01:47:02.630 --> 01:47:04.460
"because as people age,"

01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:07.800
"their social networks
get smaller and smaller,"

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.360
"which suggests that
the older we get,"

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.000
the unhappier we should become.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.560
"And yet, surprising
new evidence reveals"

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.000
its usually the
other way around.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.860
"As we get older, were
increasingly clear"

01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:22.730
"about what our strengths are,
what our weaknesses are."

01:47:22.730 --> 01:47:26.230
Were increasingly clear
about who cares about us

01:47:26.230 --> 01:47:27.700
"and who doesn't,"

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:30.030
and so we're able to
mold our worlds better.

01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:34.660
"GILBERT: Over the last
two decades, psychologist
Laura Carstensen"

01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:36.660
has been monitoring
hundreds of individuals

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.900
to see how their emotional
lives change as they age.

01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:41.400
CARSTENSEN: We recruited

01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:47.000
"a group of participants who
were initially aged 18 to 94,"

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:51.030
and we asked them to carry an
electronic pager with them.

01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:55.430
"Each time they were paged,
we asked them to tell us"

01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:57.700
the extent to which
they were feeling

01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:00.560
each of 19 different emotions.

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.560
And we had them give
us this information

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.600
35 times during a week.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.260
GILBERT: Carstensens findings
tell us that people become

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:11.600
"increasingly positive
as they grow older,"

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.500
as long as they arent suffering

01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:15.930
from physical pain or
debilitating illness.

01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:17.600
CARSTENSEN: It was
pretty dramatic.

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.030
"Essentially, what we
found is that 70-year-olds"

01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:23.900
were experiencing
fewer negative emotions

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:25.260
than 40-year-olds;

01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:27.130
40-year-olds were experiencing
fewer negative emotions

01:48:27.130 --> 01:48:28.830
than 20-year-olds.

01:48:28.830 --> 01:48:33.060
"GILBERT: In
later studies, Carstensen
identified several causes"

01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:35.130
for this remarkable shift.

01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:36.560
CARSTENSEN: Humans know
that they're mortal.

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:40.530
We know that we have only
a certain amount of time

01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:42.530
"on this planet,"

01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:46.200
and this changes
peoples motivation

01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.160
and changes their
emotional experience.

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:53.330
"As we age, it appears
that people are better"

01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:55.300
"at experiencing the moment,"

01:48:55.300 --> 01:48:59.060
enjoying what theyre doing at
a particular point in time.

01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:03.960
"In some sense, it's the
silver lining of getting old"

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:07.130
that we don't have to
prepare for the future.

01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:09.300
We don't have the
burden of the future.

01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:12.260
GILBERT: The major
consequence of this change?

01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.600
Older people tend to alter
their social behavior.

01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.130
CARSTENSEN: When
motivation shifts

01:49:17.130 --> 01:49:19.360
"so youre focusing on what
matters most in life,"

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.100
for most people they start to
focus on their relationships

01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:24.830
and their closest relationships.

01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:26.500
You value your friendships.

01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:29.830
"You value your
children, your family."

01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:32.960
GILBERT: Betty Schneider
is 87 years old.

01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:36.460
Shes one of hundreds of elderly
people who have participated

01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:37.960
in Carstensens studies.

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.130
"SCHNEIDER: As
Ive become older,"

01:49:40.130 --> 01:49:43.730
it seems that I really
appreciate my life even more.

01:49:43.730 --> 01:49:48.100
"When I was younger, I didn't
even think about old age."

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:54.460
But it turned out
to be wonderful.

01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:56.660
GILBERT: Betty is a widow.

01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:00.500
"Her husband, Jack, succumbed
to a stroke six years ago."

01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:03.200
"But like many people
in her situation,"

01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.800
she doesnt dwell on the loss.

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:08.660
"In fact, her daily life
is remarkably busy."

01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:12.660
"She takes classes, spends
time with her grandchildren"

01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:15.200
and has a full social schedule.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.660
SCHNEIDER: I miss Jack.

01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:19.660
We did so many things together.

01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:22.760
We were married for 61 years.

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:29.360
"And after Jack passed on,
it was... pretty glum,"

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.760
and gradually it's
become better again.

01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.430
"Theres lots going on,"

01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:38.400
"and he would enjoy a lot of the
things that Im doing, um..."

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.630
"but Im sorry hes not here,"

01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:46.660
but Im just so glad we
had all those years.

01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.360
CARSTENSEN: In some
ways it challenges

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.900
"our most fundamental
assumptions about happiness,"

01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:57.460
because we think that happiness
is derived from youth

01:50:57.460 --> 01:51:01.260
"and power and
attractiveness, health,"

01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:03.930
"all of these things
that decline with age,"

01:51:03.930 --> 01:51:07.730
but yet were finding
that among older people

01:51:07.730 --> 01:51:11.730
"who are clearly suffering
these kinds of losses,"

01:51:11.730 --> 01:51:15.300
are also somehow experiencing
life emotionally

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:17.960
better than ever.

01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:20.730
SCHNEIDER: I feel
very fortunate.

01:51:20.730 --> 01:51:24.100
I often go through all the good
things that have happened--

01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:27.360
what's been good today.

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.600
Its interesting younger
people dont really believe

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:33.530
that you can be optimistic
and feel positive

01:51:33.530 --> 01:51:36.700
"about things that are
happening when youre old,"

01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:39.560
"but believe me, you do."

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:43.230
"And I know I dont have
a long time to live,"

01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:52.830
"but its... its turned out to be
a very, very rewarding time."

01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:54.860
"GILBERT: We start
out in high chairs,"

01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:57.360
"we end up in wheelchairs,"

01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:00.960
"and somewhere between the two,
we all have to figure out"

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.130
where our happiness lies

01:52:02.130 --> 01:52:05.560
and then start marching
in that direction.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:09.160
So who brought the map?

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.560
"Well, everyone did."

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:14.800
"Grandmothers and
uncles, priests and
rabbis, taxi drivers,"

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.800
"bartenders,
motivational speakers--"

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:19.460
"they all have something
to say about happiness,"

01:52:19.460 --> 01:52:21.930
but they don't all
say the same thing.

01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:25.260
And that's where
science comes in.

01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:26.530
By using scientific methods

01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:29.900
"to identify the causes
of human happiness,"

01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.000
were learning that the
secret of happiness

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:33.800
was never very secret.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.160
"Were connected to each other,
we belong to each other,"

01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.700
were made for each other.

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:44.900
"Life is a journey through time,
and happiness is what happens"

01:52:44.900 --> 00:00:03.730
when we make that
journey together.
