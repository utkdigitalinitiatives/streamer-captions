00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:44.000


2
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.700
I here do die.

3
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.630
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,

4
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.900
find we a time for frighted peace to pant

5
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.930
and breathe short-winded accents of new broils

6
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.670
to be commenced in strands afar remote.

7
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.800
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil

8
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.470
shall daub her lips with her own children's blood.

9
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.800
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,

10
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.430
nor bruise her flowerets

11
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.400
with the armed hoofs of hostile paces.

12
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.630
Those opposed eyes,

13
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.430
which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,

14
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.870
all of one nature, of one substance bred,

15
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.570
did lately meet in the intestine shock

16
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.870
and furious close of civil butchery shall now,

17
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.470
in mutual, well-beseeming ranks, march all one way

18
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.000
and be no more opposed

19
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.130
against acquaintance, kindred, and allies.

20
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.970
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,

21
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.970
no more shall cut his master.

22
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:47.400
Therefore, friends, as far as to the sepulchre of Christ,

23
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.170
whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross

24
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.030
we are impressed and engaged to fight,

25
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.430
forthwith a power of English shall we levy,

26
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.370
whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb

27
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.430
to chase these pagans in those holy fields

28
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.730
over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet

29
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.800
which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd for our advantage

30
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.370
on the bitter cross.

31
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.800
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,

32
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.230
and bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.

33
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.000
Therefore, we meet not now.

34
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.100
Then let me hear of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,

35
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.800
what yesternight our council did decree

36
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.070
in forwarding this dear expedience.

37
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.030
My liege, this haste was hot in question,

38
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.500
and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight

39
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.530
when all athwart there came a post from Wales

40
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.470
loaden with heavy news,

41
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.600
whose worst was that the noble Mortimer,

42
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.600
leading the men of Herefordshire to fight

43
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.770
against the irregular and wild Glendower,

44
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.570
was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,

45
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.200
a thousand of his people butchered,

46
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.330
upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,

47
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.070
such shameless, beastly transformation

48
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.830
by those Welshwomen done

49
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.570
as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of.

50
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.370
It seems then that the tidings of this broil

51
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.970
brake off our business for the Holy Land.

52
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.000
This match'd with other did, my gracious lord,

53
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.730
for more uneven and unwelcome news came

54
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.770
from the north and thus it did import.

55
00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.900
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,

56
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.800
Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,

57
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.970
that ever-valiant and approved Scot,

58
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.500
at Holmedon met,

59
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.230
where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,

60
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.770
as by discharge of their artillery

61
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.100
and shape of likelihood, the news was told.

62
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.170
For he that brought them, in the very heat

63
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.700
and pride of their contention did take horse,

64
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.400
uncertain of the issue any way.

65
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.970
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,

66
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.430
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.

67
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.430
Stain'd with the variation of each soil

68
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.630
betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours.

69
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.670
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.

70
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.600
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited.

71
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.170
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,

72
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.370
balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see

73
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.170
on Holmedon's plains.

74
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.400
Of prisoners, Hotspur took Mordake, Earl of Fife,

75
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.370
and eldest son to beaten Douglas,

76
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.930
and the Earl of Athol, of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.

77
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.000
And is not this an honorable spoil?

78
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.230
A gallant prize?

79
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.430
Ha, cousin, is it not?

80
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.770
Indeed, it is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

81
00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.370
Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy

82
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.900
that my Lord Northumberland should be the father

83
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.230
to so blest a son,

84
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.470
a son who is the theme of honor's tongue.

85
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.500
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant,

86
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.130
who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride,

87
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.830
whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,

88
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:25.900
see riot and dishonor stain the brow of my young Harry.

89
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.130
O that it could be proved that some night-tripping fairy

90
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.530
had in cradle-clothes exchanged our children where they lay

91
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.100
and call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!

92
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.330
Then would I have his Harry and he mine.

93
00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.430
But let him from my thoughts.

94
00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.470
What think you, coz, of this young Percy's pride?

95
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.970
The prisoners which he in this adventure hath surprised

96
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:00.370
to his own use, he keeps and sends me word

97
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.000
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

98
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.200
This is his uncle's teaching.

99
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.030
This is Worcester, malevolent to you in all aspects,

100
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.030
which makes him prune himself, and bristle up

101
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.700
the crest of youth against your dignity.

102
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.430
But I have sent for him to answer this.

103
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.900
And for this cause awhile we must neglect

104
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.530
our holy purpose to Jerusalem.

105
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.270
Cousin, on Wednesday next,

106
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.130
our council we will hold at Windsor.

107
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.830
So inform the lords.

108
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.030
But come yourself with speed to us again,

109
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.430
for more is to be said and to be done

110
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.100
than out of anger can be uttered.

111
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.800
How now, Hal.

112
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.970
What time of day is it, lad?

113
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.370
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack

114
00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.730
and unbuttoning thee after supper

115
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.600
and sleeping upon benches after noon,

116
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.630
that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly

117
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.830
which thou wouldst truly know.

118
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.070
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day?

119
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:56.100
Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons

120
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.470
and clocks the tongues of bawds

121
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.470
and dials the signs of leaping-houses

122
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.730
and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench

123
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.930
in flame-colored taffeta,

124
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.330
I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous

125
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:11.700
to demand the time of the day.

126
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.330
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal,

127
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.400
for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars

128
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.930
and not by Phoebus, he,

129
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.370
"that wandering knight so fair."

130
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.170
And I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king,

131
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.970
as, God save Thy Grace-- or "Majesty," I should say,

132
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.430
for grace thou wilt have none--

133
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.670
What, none?

134
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.830
No, no, by my troth, not so much as will serve

135
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.730
to be prologue to an egg and butter.

136
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:41.870
Well, how then?

137
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:43.030
Come, roundly, roundly.

138
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:45.300
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king,

139
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:49.600
let not us that are squires of the night's body

140
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.500
be called thieves of the day's beauty.

141
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.700
Let us be called, oh, Diana's foresters,

142
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.830
gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon.

143
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.600
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too,

144
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.230
for the fortune of us that are the moon's men

145
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.330
doth ebb and flow like the sea,

146
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.330
being governed, as the sea is, by the moon.

147
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.900
As, for proof, now: a purse of gold

148
00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.100
most resolutely snatched on Monday night

149
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:20.770
and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning,

150
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:23.400
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder

151
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.630
and by and by as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

152
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.570
By the Lord, thou sayest true, Hal.

153
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:34.730
But, I prithee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows

154
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:36.930
standing in England when thou art king

155
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.670
and resolution thus fobbed as it is

156
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.370
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law?

157
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.670
Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

158
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.130
No, thou shalt.

159
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.270
Shall I?

160
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.570
O rare!

161
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:53.100
Oh, by the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.

162
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.500
Thou judgest false already.

163
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.870
I mean that thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves

164
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.800
and so become a rare hangman.

165
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.130
Oh, Hal.

166
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.530
Well...

167
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.300
and in some sort, it jumps with my humor

168
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.000
as well as waiting in the court, I can tell you.

169
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.100
For obtaining of suits?

170
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.370
Yea, for obtaining of suits,

171
00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.870
whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe.

172
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:16.400
Oh, 'sblood, I'm as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

173
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400
Or an old lion?

174
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.530
Or a lover's lute?

175
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.970
Or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

176
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.800
What sayest thou to a hare or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?

177
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.100
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes

178
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.930
and art indeed the most comparative,

179
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.230
rascalliest, sweet young prince.

180
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.770
Oh, I prithee, Hal, trouble me no more with vanity.

181
00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:39.630
I would to God thou and I knew

182
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.030
where a commodity of good names were to be bought.

183
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.370
An old lord of the council rated me the other day

184
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.970
in the street about you, sir, but I marked him not;

185
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:54.500
And yet he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not.

186
00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.200
And yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.

187
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.770
Thou didst well, for wisdom cries out

188
00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.600
in the street, and no man regards it.

189
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.530
Ooh, ooh!

190
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.630
Thou hast damnable iteration

191
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.400
and art indeed able to corrupt a saint.

192
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.100
Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal.

193
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.170
God forgive thee for it.

194
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.870
Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing.

195
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.830
And now am I, if a man were to speak truly,

196
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.730
little better than one of the wicked.

197
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:25.600
I must give over this life, and I will give it over.

198
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.330
By the Lord, and I do not, I'm a villain.

199
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.970
I'll be damned for never a king's son in Christendom.

200
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.600
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?

201
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.970
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad.

202
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.130
I'll make one.

203
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.100
An I do not, call me villain and baffle me.

204
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.870
I see a good amendment of life in thee--

205
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.930
from praying to purse-taking.

206
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.870
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation.

207
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.730
'Tis no sin for a man to labor in his vocation.

208
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.570
Poins.

209
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:57.600
Now shall we know if Peto have set a match.

210
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.870
O, if men were to be saved by merit,

211
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.630
what hole in hell were hot enough for him?

212
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.270
Good morrow, Ned.

213
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.770
Good morrow, sweet Hal.

214
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.570
What says Monsieur Remorse?

215
00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.330
What says Sir John Sack and Sugar?

216
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.630
Jack, how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul,

217
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:15.500
that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last

218
00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.930
for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon's leg?

219
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.130
Sir John stands to his word.

220
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.730
He will give the devil his due.

221
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.930
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.

222
00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.670
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.

223
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.330
-My lads, my lads. -Yes.

224
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:32.170
Tomorrow morning, by four o'clock,

225
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:33.670
early at Gadshill.

226
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.930
There are pilgrims going to Canterbury with rich offerings

227
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.630
and traders riding to London with fat purses.

228
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.730
I have vizards for you all.

229
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.570
You have horses for yourselves.

230
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:45.430
Peto lies tonight in Rochester.

231
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.770
I have bespoke supper tomorrow night in Eastcheap.

232
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.070
We shall do it as secure as sleep.

233
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.230
If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns.

234
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.200
If you will not, tarry at home and be hanged.

235
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.570
Hear ye, Edward.

236
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:58.800
If I tarry at home and go not, I'll hang you for going.

237
00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.970
You will, chops?

238
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.200
Hal, wilt thou make one?

239
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.770
Who, I, rob?

240
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.000
I, a thief?

241
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.370
Not I, by my faith.

242
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.830
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship

243
00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.870
in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood royal

244
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.070
if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

245
00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.830
Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone.

246
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.600
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure

247
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.900
that he shall go.

248
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.430
Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion

249
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:23.830
and him the ears of profiting,

250
00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:25.700
that what thou speakest may move

251
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.730
and what he hears may be believed,

252
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.070
that the true prince may, for recreation sake,

253
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:33.030
prove a false thief,

254
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.670
for the poor abuses of the time want countenance.

255
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.670
Farewell!

256
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.000
You shall find me in Eastcheap.

257
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.500
Farewell, thou latter spring!

258
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.130
Farewell, all-hallown summer!

259
00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.730
Now, my good, sweet honey lord,

260
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.800
ride with us tomorrow.

261
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.670
I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone.

262
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.830
Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto

263
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:00.170
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid.

264
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.970
Yourself and I shall not be there.

265
00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.370
And when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them,

266
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.270
then cut this head off from my shoulders.

267
00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.930
How shall we part with them in setting forth?

268
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.130
Why, we will set forth before or after them.

269
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.730
'Tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits,

270
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:19.770
by every other appointment, to be ourselves.

271
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.400
Tut; our horses, they shall not see.

272
00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.970
I'll tie them in the wood.

273
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:25.330
Our vizards, we will change after we leave them.

274
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.600
And, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce

275
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.170
to immask our noted outward garments.

276
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.400
Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.

277
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.200
Well, for two of them, I know them to be

278
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.270
as true-bred cowards as ever turned back.

279
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.270
And as for the third, if he fight longer

280
00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.400
than he sees reason, I'll forswear arms.

281
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.970
The virtue of this jest shall be

282
00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:50.000
the incomprehensible lies this same fat rogue

283
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
will tell,when we meet at supper:

284
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.800
how thirty, at least, he fought with;

285
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.000
what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured.

286
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.330
And in the reproof of this lives the jest.

287
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.430
Well, I will go with thee.

288
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.730
Provide us all things necessary.

289
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:06.470
Meet me tomorrow night in Eastcheap.

290
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:07.700
There, I'll sup.

291
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700
Farewell.

292
00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.700
Farewell, my lord.

293
00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.330
I know you all

294
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.370
and will a while uphold the unyoked humor

295
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.030
of your idleness.

296
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:24.630
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,

297
00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.330
who doth permit the base, contagious clouds

298
00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.230
to smother up his beauty from the world

299
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.500
that, when he please again to be himself,

300
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.270
being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at

301
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:42.300
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapors

302
00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.070
that did seem to strangle him.

303
00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.870
If all the year were playing holidays,

304
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:53.530
to sport would be as tedious as to work.

305
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:57.600
But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,

306
00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.170
and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.

307
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:06.870
So when this loose behavior I throw off

308
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:10.070
and pay the debt I never promised,

309
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:13.830
by how much better than my word I am,

310
00:17:13.830 --> 00:17:17.200
by so much shall I falsify men's hopes.

311
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.900
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,

312
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.300
my reformation, glittering o'er my fault,

313
00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.770
shall show more goodly and attract more eyes

314
00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:29.970
than that which hath no foil to set it off.

315
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.430
I'll so offend to make offense a skill,

316
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.830
redeeming time when men think least I will.

317
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:44.530
My blood hath been too cold and temperate,

318
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.500
unapt to stir at these indignities.

319
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.470
And you have found me,

320
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.600
for, accordingly, you tread upon my patience.

321
00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.670
But be sure I will from henceforth

322
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.870
rather be myself, mighty and to be fear'd,

323
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.600
than my condition,

324
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:09.230
which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,

325
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.330
and therefore lost that title of respect

326
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.430
which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.

327
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.030
Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves

328
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.230
the scourge of greatness to be used on it.

329
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:25.930
And that same greatness too which our own hands

330
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.200
have holp to make so portly.

331
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.200
My lord--

332
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.200
Worcester!

333
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.600
Get thee gone!

334
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.500
For I do see danger and disobedience in thine eye.

335
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.000
Oh, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,

336
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.930
and majesty might never yet endure

337
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:46.000
the moody frontier of a servant brow.

338
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.230
You have good leave to leave us.

339
00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.170
When we need your use and counsel,

340
00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.270
we shall send for you.

341
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.270
You were about to speak.

342
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.970
Yea, my lord.

343
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:07.200
Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,

344
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.030
which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,

345
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.800
were, as he says, not with such strength denied

346
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.670
as is deliver'd to your majesty.

347
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.870
Either envy, therefore, or misprison

348
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:20.530
is guilty of this fault and not my son.

349
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:24.370
My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

350
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.470
But I remember, when the fight was done,

351
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.070
when I was dry with rage and extreme toil,

352
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:34.630
breathless and faint,leaning upon my sword,

353
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.000
came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,

354
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.070
fresh as a bridegroom.

355
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.070
And his chin new reap'd show'd

356
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.830
like a stubble-land at harvest-home.

357
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.530
He was perfumed like a milliner, and 'twixt his finger

358
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.500
and his thumb, he held a pouncet-box,

359
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.070
which ever and anon he gave his nose

360
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.030
and took't away again; who therewith angry,

361
00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.270
when it next came there,,took it in snuff.

362
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.900
And still he smiled and talk'd.

363
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:58.030
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,

364
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.900
he call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,

365
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.670
to bring a slovenly, unhandsome corse

366
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.570
betwixt the wind and his nobility.

367
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:08.970
With many holiday, and lady terms, he question'd me.

368
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.370
Amongst the rest,

369
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.570
demanded my prisoners in your majesty's behalf.

370
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.670
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,

371
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.170
to be so pester'd with a popinjay,

372
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:17.670
out of my grief and my impatience

373
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:22.900
answer'd neglectingly I know not what.

374
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.000
He should or he should not.

375
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.670
For he made me mad to see him shine so brisk

376
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:30.900
and smell so sweet

377
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.670
and talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

378
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.970
of guns and drums and wounds.

379
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.430
God save the mark!

380
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:37.530
And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth

381
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.870
was parmaceti for an inward bruise.

382
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.500
And that it was great pity, so it was,

383
00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.630
this villainous salt-petre should be digg'd out

384
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:46.330
of the bowels of the harmless earth,

385
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:48.800
which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd so cowardly.

386
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.030
And but for these vile guns,

387
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.830
he would himself have been a soldier.

388
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.800
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,

389
00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.930
I answer'd indirectly, as I said.

390
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.870
And I beseech you, let not his report come current

391
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:10.000
for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty.

392
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:14.270
The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,

393
00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.900
whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said

394
00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.930
to such a person and in such a place,

395
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.170
at such a time, and all the rest retold,

396
00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.130
may reasonably die and never rise

397
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:27.470
to do him wrong or any way impeach

398
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.130
what then he said, so he unsay it now.

399
00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:36.030
Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners.

400
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:40.430
But with proviso and exception,

401
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.800
that we at our own charge shall ransom straight

402
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.030
his brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer,

403
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.230
who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd

404
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.170
the lives of those that he did lead to fight

405
00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.770
against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,

406
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.270
whose daughter, as we hear,

407
00:21:57.270 --> 00:22:01.670
that Mortimer hath lately married.

408
00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.830
Shall our coffers, then, be emptied

409
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.530
to redeem a traitor home?

410
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.200
Shall we buy treason and indent with fears,

411
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.200
when they have lost and forfeited themselves?

412
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:18.470
No, on the barren mountains, let him starve,

413
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:22.270
for I shall never hold that man my friend

414
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.870
whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost

415
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:29.530
to ransom home revolted Mortimer.

416
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.400
Revolted Mortimer?

417
00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:38.800
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,

418
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.900
but by the chance of war

419
00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.000
to prove that true needs but one tongue

420
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.970
for all those wounds, those mouthed wounds,

421
00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:46.230
which valiantly he took

422
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.070
when on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,

423
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.700
in single opposition, hand to hand,

424
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.500
he did confound the best part of an hour

425
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.700
in changing hardiment with great Glendower.

426
00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.730
Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,

427
00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.600
upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood,

428
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.230
who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,

429
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.070
ran fearfully among the trembling reeds

430
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.900
and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,

431
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.070
bloodstained with those valiant combatants!

432
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.830
Never did base and rotten policy color her working

433
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.170
with such deadly wounds.

434
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.770
Nor never could the noble Mortimer receive so many,

435
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.000
and all willingly.

436
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.830
Then let not him be slander'd with revolt!

437
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.300
Thou dost belie him, Percy.

438
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.600
Thou dost belie him.

439
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.530
He never did encounter with Glendower.

440
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.070
I tell thee, he durst as well have met the devil alone

441
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.130
as Owen Glendower for an enemy!

442
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.570
Art thou not ashamed?

443
00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.530
But, sirrah, henceforth

444
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:42.330
let me not hear you speak of Mortimer.

445
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:48.300
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,

446
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.900
or you shall hear in such a kind from me

447
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.430
as will displease you.

448
00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.530
My Lord Northumberland,

449
00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:59.530
we license your departure with your son.

450
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:04.200
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.

451
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.870
An if the devil come and roar for them,

452
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.900
I will not send them.

453
00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.170
I will after straight and tell him,

454
00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.630
for I will ease my heart, albeit I make a hazard of my head.

455
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.300
What, drunk with choler?

456
00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.600
Stay and pause awhile.

457
00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.900
Here comes your uncle.

458
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.100
Speak of Mortimer!

459
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.430
'Zounds, I will speak of him

460
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.930
and let my soul want mercy if I do not join with him.

461
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.070
Yea, on his part, I'll empty all these veins

462
00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.770
and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust.

463
00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.270
But I will lift the noble Mortimer

464
00:24:51.270 --> 00:24:53.470
as high in the air as this unthankful king,

465
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.830
as this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.

466
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.630
Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.

467
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.770
Who struck this heat up after I was gone?

468
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.300
He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners.

469
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.830
When I urged the ransom once again of my wife's brother,

470
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.030
then his cheek look'd pale,

471
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.770
and on my face he turn'd an eye of death,

472
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:15.930
trembling even at the name of Mortimer.

473
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.200
I cannot blame him.

474
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.170
Was not he proclaim'd by Richard that dead is

475
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.330
the next of blood?

476
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.900
Peace, cousin. Say no more.

477
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.770
And now I will unclasp a secret book,

478
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.730
and to your quick-conceiving discontents,

479
00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.900
I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,

480
00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.670
as full of peril and adventurous spirit

481
00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.600
as to o'er-walk a current roaring loud

482
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.330
on the unsteadfast footing of a spear.

483
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:39.700
If he fall in, good night!

484
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.870
Or sink or swim.

485
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.300
Send danger from the east unto the west,

486
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.930
so honor cross it from the north to south,

487
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.770
and let them grapple.

488
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.570
O, the blood more stirs

489
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.700
to rouse a lion than to start a hare.

490
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.330
Imagination of some great exploit

491
00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:57.800
drives him beyond the bounds of patience.

492
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.000
By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap

493
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.500
to pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon

494
00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.070
or dive into the bottom of the deep,

495
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.270
where fathom-line could never touch the ground,

496
00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.570
and pluck up drowned honor by the locks

497
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.030
so he that doth redeem her thence

498
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.170
might wear without corrival all her dignities.

499
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.000
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!

500
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.670
He apprehends a world of figures here

501
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.500
but not the form of what he should attend.

502
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.070
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.

503
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.500
Oh, I cry you mercy.

504
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.700
Those same noble Scots That are your prisoners--

505
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.970
I'll keep them all.

506
00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.700
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them.

507
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.800
No, if a Scot should save his soul, he shall not.

508
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.100
I'll keep them, by this hand.

509
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:37.170
You start away and lend no ear unto my purposes.

510
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.900
Those prisoners, you shall keep.

511
00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.130
Nay, I will. That's flat.

512
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.700
He said he would not ransom Mortimer,

513
00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.870
forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer.

514
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.770
But I will find him when he lies asleep,

515
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.930
and in his ear, I'll holla, "Mortimer!"

516
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.200
Nay, I'll have a starling shall be taught

517
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.700
to speak nothing but "Mortimer"

518
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.830
and give it him to keep his anger still in motion.

519
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.000
Hear you, cousin; a word.

520
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.830
All studies here I solemnly defy,

521
00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.670
save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke

522
00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.870
and that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales.

523
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.330
But that his father loves him not

524
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.300
and would be glad he met with some mischance,

525
00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.030
I'd have him poison'd with a pot of ale.

526
00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.600
Fare you well, kinsman.

527
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.000
I'll talk to you when you're better temper'd to attend.

528
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.230
Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool art thou

529
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:15.930
to break into this woman's mood,

530
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:18.070
tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own.

531
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.330
Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,

532
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.430
nettled and stung with pismires

533
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.430
when I hear of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.

534
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.830
In Richard's time-- what do you call the place?

535
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.770
A plague upon it; it is in Gloucestershire.

536
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:35.270
'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept, his uncle York,

537
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.700
where I first bow'd my knee unto this king of smiles,

538
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.500
this Bolingbroke.

539
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.570
'Sblood!

540
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:43.570
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.

541
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:45.600
At Berkley castle.

542
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.370
You say true.

543
00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.870
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy

544
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.130
this fawning greyhound then did proffer me.

545
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.430
Look, "when his infant fortune came to age,"

546
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.630
And "gentle Harry Percy," and "kind cousin."

547
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:00.070
Oh, the devil take such cozeners!

548
00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.870
God forgive me.

549
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.300
Good uncle, tell your tale.

550
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.800
I have done.

551
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.330
Nay, if you have not, to it again.

552
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.370
We will stay your leisure.

553
00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.730
I have done, i' faith!

554
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:22.470
Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.

555
00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.170
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,

556
00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:29.200
and make the Douglas' son your only mean

557
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.600
for powers in Scotland,

558
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.170
which, for divers reasons which I shall send you written,

559
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:35.030
be assured, shall easily be granted.

560
00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.300
You, my lord,

561
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.170
your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,

562
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:39.800
shall secretly into the bosom creep

563
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.770
of that same noble prelate, the archbishop.

564
00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:43.100
Of York, is it not?

565
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.430
True, who bears hard his brother's death at Bristol,

566
00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:47.030
the Lord Scroop.

567
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.630
I speak not this in estimation, as what I think might be,

568
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.500
but what I know is ruminated, plotted, and set down

569
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.130
and only stays but to behold the face

570
00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.900
of that occasion that shall bring it on.

571
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.970
I smell it.

572
00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.270
Upon my life, it will do well.

573
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.530
Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.

574
00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:03.400
Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot.

575
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.370
And then the power of Scotland and of York

576
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.870
to join with Mortimer, ha?

577
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.330
And so they shall.

578
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.770
Upon my life, it is exceedingly well aim'd.

579
00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.530
And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,

580
00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.200
to save our heads by raising of a head,

581
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.430
for, bear ourselves as even as we can,

582
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.200
the king will always think him in our debt

583
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.130
and think we think ourselves unsatisfied,

584
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.870
till he hath found a time to pay us home.

585
00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.370
And see already how he doth begin

586
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:26.200
to make us strangers to his looks of love.

587
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.400
He does. He does.

588
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.300
We'll be revenged upon him.

589
00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.300
Cousin, farewell.

590
00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.600
No further go in this

591
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.430
than I by letters shall direct your course.

592
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:37.330
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,

593
00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.270
I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer,

594
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.230
where you and Douglas and our powers at once,

595
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.000
as I will fashion it, shall happily meet

596
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.670
to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,

597
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.300
which now we hold at much uncertainty.

598
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.370
Farewell, good brother.

599
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.330
We shall thrive, I trust.

600
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.070
Uncle, adieu.

601
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.300
Oh, let the hours be short

602
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:04.630
till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport.

603
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.400
