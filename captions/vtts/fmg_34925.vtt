WEBVTT

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Narrator:
 THEY'RE ROUGH.
 THEY'RE NOISY.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
THEY THRIVE ON ACTION
 AND EXCITEMENT.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
RIGHT HERE,
RIGHT HERE.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Narrator:
 THEY'RE BOYS.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
BUT BEING A BOY
 ISN'T ALL THAT IT SEEMS.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I DID.
WHAT ARE YOU--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Narrator:
 TODAY, NEW FINDINGS
 ON WHAT MAKES BOYS TICK.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
PARENTS TEND TO HOLD THEIR
MALE CHILDREN UPRIGHT.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
IT'S AS THOUGH THEY SAY,
"STIFF UPPER LIP,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
STRAIGHTEN THAT BACK, YOU'VE
GOT TO FIGURE OUT THE WORLD."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
- Narrator: BRAZELTON...
- HE WHACKS ME.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
THAT'S JUST NOT FAIR,
IS IT?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Narrator:
 ...ON PARENTING.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
( theme music playing )

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
AND WHERE DO THOSE
DIFFERENCES COME FROM?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT
HAVE ALWAYS CAPTIVATED

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
SCIENTISTS AND PARENTS ALIKE.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
MY YEARS OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
HAVE CONVINCED ME

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
THAT THERE ARE
REAL DIFFERENCES,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
DIFFERENCES THAT ARE THERE
FROM THE BEGINNING.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
LET'S EXPLORE
THE WORLD OF BOYS.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
IT'S A FASCINATING WORLD

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
WHOSE UNIQUENESS STARTS
BEFORE BIRTH REALLY,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
WHILE THE MALE CHILD IS
STILL IN HIS MOTHER'S WOMB.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Brazelton:
 IT HAPPENS INCREDIBLY EARLY,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
AROUND THE NINTH WEEK
 OF GESTATION.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
HORMONES ARE TRIGGERED

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
THAT BATHE THE DEVELOPING
 BOY FETUS IN TESTOSTERONE,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
CREATING DISTINCT GENITALIA

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
AND MARKING
 THE FETUS FOREVER A BOY.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
FROM THAT POINT ON,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
THE SEXES ARE
 INDELIBLY DIFFERENT.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Woman:
LOOK, THE MOUTH OPENED!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Brazelton:
 AS THESE ULTRASOUND
 IMAGES SHOW,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
SCIENCE HAS FOUND
 THAT BOYS ARE GENERALLY

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
MORE ACTIVE IN THE WOMB.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Woman:
 THE BABY'S MOVING.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Brazelton:
 AND AFTER BIRTH,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
IN MY OWN RESEARCH I'VE FOUND
 THAT EVEN JUST MINUTES OLD,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
BOY NEWBORNS DON'T TRY
 TO HOLD ATTENTION AS LONG.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
HE CATCHES HIS DADDY'S FACE.
HE WON'T LEAVE IT!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
( crying )

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Brazelton:
 AND BOYS ARE JERKIER
 AND MORE ACTIVE THAN GIRLS.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
LOOK AT THOSE LEGS GO NOW.
THAT MAKES ME--

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Brazelton:
 GIRLS REACT IN MUCH SMOOTHER,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
MORE MODULATED PATTERNS.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
BY THREE OR FOUR MONTHS,
 BOY AND GIRL BABIES

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
ARE RESPONDING DIFFERENTLY
 TO THEIR PARENTS.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
IN AN EXPERIMENT
 WE CALL "FACE TO FACE,"

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I ASK PARENTS TO ENGAGE
 THEIR BABIES...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
OH, YOU'RE SO CLOSE.
YOU'RE SO CLOSE.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
...THEN DISENGAGE.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
AFTER TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY
 TO RECAPTURE THEIR PARENTS,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
GIRLS EVENTUALLY
 WITHDRAW QUIETLY,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
BUT NOT BOYS.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
BOYS HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY SEEN
 TO RESPOND WITH ANGER

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
TO WHAT THEY INTERPRET
 AS LOSS OF LOVE.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
PERHAPS THIS WILL
 HELP US UNDERSTAND

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
THE MORE UNIQUELY
 MALE VIOLENCE

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
AS THEY HIT ADOLESCENCE.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
( shouts )

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Brazelton:
 BY AS EARLY AS THE TWOS,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
BOY TODDLERS ARE MORE
 AGGRESSIVE IN PLAY.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
BY THE THREES,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE
 IN GAMES OF COMPETITION...

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
WE'RE SLIDIN' HOME!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
...WHILE GIRLS FAVOR
 GAMES OF COOPERATION.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
BLUE.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Brazelton:
 THEY ALSO BEGIN TO
 EXHIBIT THE PACK BEHAVIOR

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
WE SEE THROUGHOUT
 THE SCHOOL YEARS.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
BUT IS MACHO
 ALL BOYS ARE?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
- ( laughing )
- HARDLY.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
IT'S BEEN SHOWN THAT
 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BOYS

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
ARE AS SENSITIVE

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
AND PERHAPS MORE FRAGILE
 THAN LITTLE GIRLS.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
AND BOYS ARE
 MUCH MORE LIKELY

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
TO EXHIBIT SIGNS OF ATTENTION
 DEFICIT AND HYPERACTIVITY.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
( boys shouting )

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Brazelton:
 WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?
 THAT BIOLOGY IS DESTINY?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
- GET HIM HOME!
- Brazelton: NOT NECESSARILY.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Woman:
I'M GONNA USE
YOU AS HELPERS.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Brazelton:
 IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE UNDERSTAND
 AND RESPOND TO OUR BOYS.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Woman:
LET'S OPEN THE MEETING BY
SAYING THE BOY SCOUT PROMISE.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Brazelton:
 SENSITIVE NURTURING CAN SHAPE
 WHAT NATURE HAS BEGUN,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
HELPING OUR BOYS GROW
 TO BECOME HEALTHY,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
HAPPY AND COMPLETE
 HUMAN BEINGS.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
PERFECT.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
TODAY WE HAVE
CRYSTAL HOLMES,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
OUR INTERNET EXPERT
 FROM IBM.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
CAN PARENTS
FIND INFORMATION

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
- ABOUT BOYS' DEVELOPMENT
  ON THE INTERNET?
- ABSOLUTELY.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
THERE ARE A LOT OF WONDERFUL
SITES FOR PARENTS
ON THE INTERNET,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
AND THE ONE WE'LL LOOK
 AT TODAY IS THE PAMPERS
 PARENTING INSTITUTE.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
HERE, PARENTS CAN
 ENTER IN A SEARCH WORD

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
AND FIND OUT INFORMATION
 SPECIFICALLY ABOUT BOYS.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
THEY CAN ENTER INTO A CHAT ROOM
 AND ENGAGE WITH OTHER PARENTS.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
THEY CAN ACTUALLY GO
 TO A BULLETIN BOARD

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
AND SEE WHAT INFORMATION
 HAS ALREADY BEEN POSTED.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
THEY CAN ALSO ASK
AN EXPERT A QUESTION,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
AND WE HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU TODAY, BERRY.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
IT COMES FROM MARTHA
IN WICHITA, KANSAS.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
HER QUESTION IS,
 "IS IT HEALTHY FOR
  PRE-SCHOOL BOYS

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
TO ENGAGE IN PRETEND
  PLAY WITH TOY WEAPONS,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
FOR EXAMPLE, TOY SWORDS,
  ARMY TANKS AND SO FORTH?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
WILL SUCH PLAY ENCOURAGE
  AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
OR WILL IT HELP CHILDREN
  ACT OUT THEIR AGGRESSION
  IN A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
OR WILL IT HAVE NO
 PARTICULAR EFFECT?"

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
YOUR QUESTION REFLECTS SOMETHING
I THINK WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUT.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
WE LIVE IN A VIOLENT SOCIETY AND
WE WONDER HOW WE CAN KEEP KIDS

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
FROM BEING VIOLENT
LATER ON.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
I THINK ALL LITTLE BOYS
THOUGH, FOUR AND FIVE,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
ARE BOUND TO
BE AGGRESSIVE.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
THIS IS A NORMAL PHASE
IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
AND I THINK THEY ARE LEARNING
HOW TO CONTROL THIS
JUST AT THAT TIME.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
YOU PUT TWO
FOUR-YEAR-OLDS TOGETHER,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
AND THEY LOCK AND ROLL
AROUND ON THE FLOOR.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
TOY GUNS MAY ADD TO THIS,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
BUT I THINK WHETHER
YOU ADD A TOY GUN OR NOT,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
THIS IS THE WAY FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE BOYS COME
IN TO MY OFFICE.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
THEY WANT TO POINT
AT ME AND BANG AT ME,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
AND I KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING:

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
"YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO
 GET OUT OF THIS OFFICE.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T LET ME OUT,
I'M GONNA BANG YOU."

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK
THAT'S VERY HEALTHY.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
THEY ARE LEARNING HOW TO
DEAL WITH THESE FEELINGS.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
PRESENTED BY THE PARENTING
 INSTITUTE AT: pampers.com.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
JOINING ME TODAY
IS DR. KYLE PRUETT,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
AT THE YALE CHILD STUDY CENTER

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
AND THE AUTHOR
OF A NEW BOOK,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
"ME, MYSELF AND I."

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000
KYLE, AS WE'VE SEEN,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
A LOT OF THE THINGS
THAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT BOYS

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
AREN'T
NECESSARILY TRUE.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
THIS IMAGE, BERRY,
THAT WE KIND OF HOLD ON TO

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
OF THIS LITTLE MACHO,
WARRIOR,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
INDEPENDENT
 LITTLE BOY

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
IS JUST ABOUT
180 DEGREES OFF.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
WE KNOW THAT BOYS, FOR EXAMPLE,
ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO DISEASES,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
ESPECIALLY AS PREMATURES
THAT, UH--

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
AND WHEN THEY'RE OLDER,
THEY DON'T LIVE AS LONG

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
AND THEY HAVE DISEASES THAT
CAN SHORTEN THEIR LIFESPAN
MUCH MORE THAN WOMEN.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
DO YOU THINK THIS IS GENETIC,
OR DO YOU THINK IT'S
ENVIRONMENTAL?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
WELL, THERE ARE SOME
INTERESTING DIFFERENCES
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, BERRY.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
THE MALE FETUS IS MORE ACTIVE
IN UTERO THAN IS THE FEMALE.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
WE ALSO KNOW THAT BOYS
MOVE AROUND MORE

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
EVEN IN THE BASINET
WHEN THEY'RE BRAND-NEW.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
THEY MOVE THEIR LIMBS AND
THEIR TORSO AROUND MORE.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
ALSO, PARENTS
FROM VERY EARLY ON

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
ARE HOLDING THEIR MALE BABIES
DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR FEMALES.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
PARENTS TEND TO HOLD
THEIR MALE CHILDREN UPRIGHT

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
SOONER AND MORE OFTEN
THAN THEIR FEMALE CHILDREN.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
IT'S AS THOUGH
THEY SAY,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
"STIFF UPPER LIP,
 STRAIGHTEN THAT BACK.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE
OUT THE WORLD SOONER
THAN SHE DOES,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
AND SO WE'RE
GONNA SHOW IT
TO YOU RIGHT NOW."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
AND YOU KNOW, WE TALK
ABOUT VIOLENCE LATER ON,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
AND I THINK THAT BEGINS
WAY BACK IN LEARNING HOW
TO CONTROL YOUR STATES--

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
YOUR STATES OF AWAKENESS,
OF ALERTNESS, OF CRYING.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
AND WITH THE HOLDING CLOSE,
YOU'RE TEACHING A LITTLE GIRL

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
HOW TO CONTROL HERSELF
WAY BACK THERE,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
AND PUSHING A LITTLE BOY TO
NOT CONTROL HIMSELF, IN A WAY.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
AND WE ARE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB
OF AFFIRMING FOR LITTLE BOYS

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
THAT THEIR NURTURING
AND THEIR LOVING

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
AND THEIR AFFECTIONATE, INTIMATE
SIDES ARE TERRIBLY IMPORTANT,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
NOT ONLY TO
THEIR WELL-BEING,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
BUT TO THE RELATIONSHIPS
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE
DOWN THE ROAD.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
AND WHEN WE TRY
TO KICK THESE BOYS
OUT ON TO THE HIGH WIRE

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
WITHOUT THE SAFETY NET
TOO SOON, THEY GET HURT--

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
EMOTIONALLY AND PHYSICALLY
 THEY GET BANGED UP,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
AND THEY HAVE A SENSE
OF DEPRESSION AND LONGING
WHEN YOU TALK TO THEM.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
THEY DON'T FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE
ABOUT THEIR CONFIDENCE,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
AND THEY HAVE A HARD TIME
SUSTAINING FRIENDSHIPS,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
THEY'RE ENVIOUS
OF THE GIRLS WHO ARE
DOING WELL IN SCHOOL.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
AND A LOT OF THOSE BOYS
LOOK KIND OF LONGINGLY
OVER THEIR SHOULDER

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN
THE DOLL CORNER, BECAUSE
THEY HAVE GREAT IDEAS.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON
IN RELATIONSHIPS AND
THEY WANT TO STAY THERE,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
AND THE BLOCK CORNER
MAY NOT BE THE
PLACE FOR THEM.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
- THEY GRAVITATE TO TRUCKS,
  THEY DON'T GO TO BLOCKS.
- NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
- BUT THEY BANG TRUCKS.
- THEY BANG TRUCKS.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
- YOU WOULDN'T INTERFERE
  WITH THAT, WOULD YOU?
- NO, I WOULDN'T.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
- I LOVE THAT BANGING.
- I DO TOO.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
AND THEY ALL COME
INTO MY OFFICE AND
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
AT THE AGE OF FOUR AND FIVE,
AS IF THEY WERE CARRYING GUNS.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED
TO DO IS NOT SORT OF OVERREACT
TO THAT IN OUR YOUNG CHILDREN,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
BECAUSE IT IS PART
OF THEIR IMAGINATION,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
AND WHEN WE
GET THE WILLIES
ABOUT IT AND SAY,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
"OH, MY GOSH.
 ZERO TOLERANCE
 FOR AGGRESSION,"

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
WE ARE TELLING OUR BOYS,
NONE OF THAT IS ACCEPTABLE.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
BUT IN FACT,
LITTLE GIRLS ALSO LOVE
BEING AGGRESSIVE TOO.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE
AGGRESSIVE SOCIALLY.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
BOYS ARE A LITTLE MORE
AGGRESSIVE PHYSICALLY.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
WE NEED TO LET THESE
 LITTLE BOYS KNOW

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
THAT PLAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT
PART OF WHO THEY ARE,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
AND THEY CAN BE ROBUST
AND POWERFUL AND STRONG
IN THEIR PLAY,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
BUT THERE ARE RULES,
AND YOU CAN'T HURT PEOPLE,
AND YOU'VE GOTTA BE--

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
- IT'S SORT OF A FINE BALANCE,
- YES, IT IS.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
BETWEEN VALUING
WHAT THEY BRING

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
IN THE WAY OF AGGRESSION
AND OUTGOINGNESS,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
AND LETTING 'EM LEARN HOW
TO MANAGE THOSE CONTROLS

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
LONG BEFORE THEY NEED
'EM IN ADOLESCENCE.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME
TALKING TO GIRLS

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
ABOUT THE EFFECT OF
THEIR BEHAVIOR ON OTHER
PEOPLE AROUND THEM.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
WHEN PARENTS
TAKE THE TIME
TO EXPLAIN THAT,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
THAT THEIR BOYS BEGIN
TO MANAGE THEIR OWN
IMPULSES BETTER

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
BECAUSE THEY
UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT
IN WHICH IT OCCURS.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Brazelton:
 NEXT, WE TALK TO PARENTS
 ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Woman:
 WE'VE SOLD OUT.
 WE HAVE OVER 900 PEOPLE...

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Brazelton:
 EACH YEAR WE TRAVEL
 ALL OVER AMERICA...

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Man:
 OUR COMMUNITY IS
 SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Brazelton:
 ...TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
 FROM THOUSANDS OF PARENTS.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Emcee:
 I'D LIKE TO WELCOME
 DR. T. BERRY BRAZELTON.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Brazelton:
 HERE ARE SOME OF THEM.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
- HI.
- HI.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN
 TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
HOW PARENTS CAN
BAN GUNPLAY,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
OR WHAT THEY
SHOULD DO.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I HAVE A SON WHO LIKES
TO PRETEND THAT HE HAS GUNS

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
BY USING STICKS
OR BUILDING LEGOS,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
AND I DON'T ALLOW HIM
 TO PLAY WITH GUNS,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
OR I DON'T
 BUY TOY GUNS

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
FOR HIM TO USE.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
ESPECIALLY
IN TODAY'S SOCIETY

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
WHERE WE HAVE
SO MUCH VIOLENCE,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
I'M REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
HIM USING ANYTHING
AS A GUN,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
- I KNOW.
- AND HOW I CAN KIND OF
  DIVERT THAT ATTENTION.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I THINK THERE ARE
TWO QUESTIONS.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
ONE IS, CAN WE PREVENT
GUNPLAY IN LITTLE BOYS.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
MOSTLY BOYS.
GIRLS, MAYBE SOME DO.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
AND I SUSPECT NOT.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I THINK FOUR AND FIVE THEY'RE
ALMOST BOUND TO MAKE GUNS

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
OUT OF THEIR
 FINGERS OR,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
- YOU KNOW, AS YOU SAY--
- I HAVEN'T SEEN GIRLS DO THAT.
  DO YOU THINK THEY DO?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
- THEY DON'T DO IT.
- I ONLY HAVE BOYS.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
MAYBE THEY WILL,
BUT IT IS MOSTLY
LITTLE BOYS.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
AND IT'S MOSTLY AT A TIME
WHEN THEY'RE LEARNING ABOUT

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
THEIR OWN AGGRESSIVE
FEELINGS AT FOUR AND FIVE.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
THAT'S, YOU KNOW,
 THE NORMAL TIME.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
THE OTHER
 QUESTION IS,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
DOES THAT LEAD
TO VIOLENCE?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANY
RESEARCH THAT SHOWS THAT.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I WOULD SAY NOT,
IN ALL LIKELIHOOD.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
THERE CERTAINLY
WILL BE SOME KIDS

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
THAT WILL GRAVITATE
 TO GUNS LATER ON,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
BUT I THINK ALL BOYS
THAT I KNOW OF

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
GO THROUGH PERIODS WHEN THEY
JUST WANT TO BE AGGRESSIVE

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
AND USE THEIR FINGERS
IF THEY HAVEN'T GOT--

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
SO, YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I SHOULD BE STOPPING
THEM FROM DOING THAT?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
STOPPING THEM NO,
'CAUSE I DON'T
THINK YOU CAN.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
BUT, I GUESS USING OTHER WAYS OF
LETTING 'EM KNOW ABOUT VIOLENCE

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
AND ABOUT WHAT VIOLENCE
MEANS TO OTHER PEOPLE.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
THE TIME I THINK WHEN
KIDS BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND
OTHER PEOPLE, UH,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
CALLED ALTRUISM,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
IS WHEN THEY BEGIN
TO REALIZE WHAT I DO
AFFECTS OTHER PEOPLE,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
TO BEGIN TO REALIZE THAT
 OTHER PEOPLE ARE FRIGHTENED
 OR THAT THEY MIGHT, YOU KNOW--

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
SOME OF THIS GUNPLAY
 IS REALLY MEANINGFUL,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
AND I WOULD LOOK FOR THAT
 ABOUT FIVE OR SIX.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
I WONDER ABOUT

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
IS WHETHER KIDS DON'T NEED
SOME SORT OF DISCIPLINE

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
TO HELP THEM
CONTROL THEMSELVES

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
WHEN THEY BEGIN TO GET
TOO VIOLENT OR TOO AGGRESSIVE.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
AND MAYBE THAT'S A TIME
WHEN THEY'RE FOUR AND FIVE

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
WHEN THEY ARE
GETTING OUT OF HAND

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
THAT YOU NEED TO SIT
DOWN CALMLY WITH THEM

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
- AND JUST SAY,
  "WE CAN'T DO THAT."
- OKAY.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
AND IT'S A TIME WHEN
 PUNISHMENT ISN'T THE
 SAME AS DISCIPLINE.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
DISCIPLINE IS LEARNING,
BUT PUNISHMENT ISN'T.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
- MINE'S A DISCIPLINE QUESTION.
- UH-HUH.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I HAVE A CHILD IN MY CLASS
WHO WILL NOT LISTEN.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
I WAS USING
 A HOT GLUE GUN
 THE OTHER DAY,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
AND I'M TALKING
25 TIMES HE ASKED ME,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
"WHY CAN'T I TOUCH THE GLUE?
 WHY CAN'T I TOUCH IT?"

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
AND EVERY TIME,
"WELL, IT'S HOT.
 IT WILL BURN YOU."

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
"WHY CAN'T I TOUCH IT?"

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
AND SO FINALLY HE JUST STUCK
HIS FINGER UP TO THE KNUCKLE.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T
 REALLY GET A BURN,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
BUT IT HURT
AND HE WAS CRYING,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
THAT HAPPENS ALL DAY LONG.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
- HOW OLD IS HE?
- HE'S FOUR.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
FOUR.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
THE OTHER
 PART OF IT IS,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
WHEN I EXPLAIN HIM TO
COLLEAGUES OR FRIENDS
THAT HE'S LIKE A CAT,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
HOW A CAT JUST STANDS UP
AND BOLTS OUT OF THE ROOM
FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
HE'LL BE SITTING THERE
IN ONE AREA,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
STAND UP, AND
AS FAST AS HE CAN

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
RUN ACROSS THE ROOM
AND HIT ANOTHER KID
THAT HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
THAT THEY'VE HAD NO INTERACTION
FOR THE PAST 20 MINUTES.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
- AND IT'S JUST--
- SO HE'S REALLY
  A DIFFICULT KID, ISN'T HE?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
- YEAH, BUT--
- I WONDER HOW DEEP IT GOES,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
WHETHER HE ISN'T A CHILD
WHO'S REALLY PRETTY UPSET

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
AND WHO NEEDS SOME HELP.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
IT'S JUST,
I DON'T KNOW HOW--

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
ANY WAY OF GETTING TO
HIS PARENTS SO THEY CAN
GET SOME HELP FOR HIM?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
DAD'S NOT IN THE PICTURE
TOO MUCH I GUESS,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
SO MOM AND I ARE CONFERENCING,
AND THEN YOU FEEL BAD FOR HER.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
- SURE.
- THERE ARE A LOT
  OF HITTING ISSUES,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
AND THEN YOU GET TO THE POINT
WHERE EVERY DAY YOU'RE
TALKING TO HIS MOTHER.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
HE'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU,
THOUGH, AS A MALE FIGURE,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
AND FORTUNATELY, A LITTLE BOY
IS MORE LIKELY TO TAKE IT

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
AND HAVE IT BECOME
MEANINGFUL TO HIM
FROM A MALE.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
THAT'S WHY MEN ARE
 SO VALUABLE IN CHILDCARE.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
THEY ALL FOLLOW YOU AROUND.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
VERY REWARDING.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
SEE, I CAN UNDERSTAND
IF HE HITS.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
IF SOMEBODY TAKES A TOY
FROM HIM AND HE HITS HIM,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I DON'T AGREE WITH IT
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
- BUT YOU UNDERSTAND
  THERE'S A MOTIVATION.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
IT'S THE
 UNMOTIVATED ATTACKS.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
SO WE HAVE THIS
HITTING PILLOW THAT,
WHEN HE FELT HE NEEDED TO HIT,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
- HE WENT TO HIS BIN, GOT IT--
- DOES THAT WORK?
 DOES IT HELP?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
HE JUST LOOKED AT ME
AND SAID, "NO."
I SAID, "WELL--"

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
HE WAS LIKE, "NO.
HOW ABOUT I JUST PROMISE
I WON'T HIT ANYMORE?"

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
- AND SINCE HE PROMISED THAT,
  HE HASN'T HAD A HITTING ISSUE.
- SO HE'S TRYING, ISN'T HE?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
- THAT SOUNDS FABULOUS.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I BROKE MY ELBOW PATTING MYSELF
ON THE BACK WITH THAT ONE.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
HE DIDN'T
 CARE FOR IT TOO MUCH!

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
WELL, I'LL PAT YOU
ON THE BACK TOO.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I THINK HE'S VERY BRIGHT,
IF HE CAN SPEAK HIS MIND.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
HE JUST WAS LIKE,
"I DON'T WANT THAT PILLOW."

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Brazelton:
 YEAH.  ONE THING
 I WOULD CERTAINLY SUGGEST

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
AFTER HE'S DONE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS, LOST CONTROL,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
DON'T JUST COMFORT
THE OTHER CHILD

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
BUT PICK HIM UP AND SAY,
"IT'S REALLY TOUGH, ISN'T IT?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
AND I DON'T LIKE
YOU DOING THAT.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
THIS OTHER CHILD
DOESN'T LIKE IT,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
AND I'LL BET YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
AND WE GOTTA WORK ON THIS."

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
AND THEN IF YOU SEE HIM
JUST START TO DART,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
SAY, "WE GOTTA STOP."

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
SIT DOWN WITH HIM AND SAY,
"EVERY TIME YOU GO AFTER A KID,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
IT REALLY MAKES ME
UPSET WITH YOU.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
- "IS THERE A WAY WE CAN STOP
   BEFORE YOU HAVE TO DO IT?"
- OKAY.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
"CAN YOU YELL AT ME

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
OR KICK AT ME OR JUST LET ME
KNOW THAT YOU'RE GETTING UPSET

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000
AND YOU NEED SOME HELP?"

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
AND SEE IF THERE'S
SOMETHING HE CAN SUGGEST

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
THAT YOU COULD DO
TO BREAK THE CYCLE

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
BEFORE HE HAS TO THROW
HIMSELF OUT OF IT.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
- OKAY.
- SEE IF THAT WORKS.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
- THANKS A LOT.
- GREAT.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
GOOD MORNING, DOCTOR.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I HAVE A
THREE-YEAR-OLD SON,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
VERY VIVID IMAGINATION,
VERY OUTGOING.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
HALLOWEEN IS COMING.
WE HAD SELECTED A PIRATE
COSTUME TOGETHER.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
AND HE RECENTLY
CHANGED HIS MIND

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
AND HAS DECIDED THAT
HE WILL BE NOTHING
OTHER THAN A WITCH.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
AND I DON'T HAVE
 A PROBLEM WITH IT.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
MY HUSBAND'S OKAY WITH IT.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I'M JUST, I GUESS,
CONCERNED WITH OTHER
PEOPLE'S REACTIONS

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
TO A BOY
BEING A WITCH.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
I MEAN, IT COULD BE WORSE.
HE COULD WANT TO BE
A PRINCESS, BUT--

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
YOU'RE EXPOSING
YOUR BIASES,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I CAN TELL YOU.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
WHAT IS THIS
BIAS ALL ABOUT?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
NO, I GUESS I'M JUST
CONCERNED WITH, YOU KNOW,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
TAKING HIM TRICK-OR-TREATING
AND OTHER PEOPLE REACTING
IN A NEGATIVE WAY TO HIM.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
HE'S FUNNY,
 YOU KNOW.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
WE GET READY IN THE MORNING,
AND ONE MORNING IT'S--

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
HE WANTS TO PLAY WITH MY MAKEUP
AND OTHER MORNINGS HE'LL BE,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
"DADDY, YOU HAVE
  TO SHAVE ME."

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
AND MY HUSBAND WILL PUT
SHAVING CREAM ON HIM

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
AND PRETEND TO SHAVE HIS FACE,
AND HE THINKS THAT'S GREAT.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
AND IT'S A WHOLE GENDER
IDENTITY THING AT THIS AGE,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
- ALMOST OKAY.
- WELL, NO.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
NOT OKAY.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
I'M MORE CONCERNED
WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S
REACTIONS TO IT

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
AND HOW THAT'S GOING
TO MAKE HIM FEEL.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
I, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I JUST DON'T WANT HIM BEING HURT
BY SOMEONE ELSE'S REACTION TO--

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
WELL, THEN THE FIRST STEP IS TO
GET YOUR OWN REACTIONS STRAIGHT.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
OKAY.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
BECAUSE YOU DO HAVE
 SOME FEELINGS ABOUT IT.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I THINK EVERY MOTHER DOES,
AND WHEN A LITTLE BOY,
THREE OR FOUR,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
BEGINS TO WANT TO WEAR WOMEN'S
CLOTHES OR WOMEN'S MAKEUP,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
EVERY MOTHER IN AMERICA
GOES PANICKY.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
SO DON'T TELL ME
 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY--

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
SO, HOW ABOUT THAT?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I THINK IT'S ON
THE FRINGE OF OUR MINDS,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S,
YOU KNOW, AN ISSUE.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
- I JUST--
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
  I THINK IT IS THERE.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
AND I THINK YOU ALL OUGHT TO
TALK ABOUT IT AND GET IT OUT,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT ALL
THREE- AND FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE BOYS NEED TO DO.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
THEY NEED TO ACT LIKE THEIR
MOMMIES ONE TIME AND GET,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000
YOU KNOW,
 EVEN DRESS LIKE 'EM,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
PUT ON MAKE-UP LIKE 'EM,
BECOME LIKE 'EM.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
AND THEN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO
IT'LL BE THEIR DADDIES,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
LIKE HE'S DOING ALREADY
WITH THE SHAVING.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I REALLY,
I'M OKAY WITH IT.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I DON'T WANT HIM TO GET HURT
BY OTHER PEOPLE'S JUDGMENTS.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I'M NOT SURE HE'LL
BE HURT BY THEM,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
- BUT I THINK HE
  MIGHT BE BY YOURS.
- OKAY.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
HOW ARE MEN GONNA LEARN
 TO BE NURTURING THESE DAYS

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
UNLESS THEY IDENTIFY WITH
A FEMALE PART OF THE FAMILY?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
AND THE OTHER IS HE'LL
LEARN ABOUT HIS DADDY,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
AND HE'LL MAKE
HIS OWN CHOICES.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
- I MEAN, WE ALL KNOW THAT.
- OKAY.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
SO YOU ALL GET IT STRAIGHT,
 AND THAT MEANS YOU
 AND HIS DADDY

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
HAVE TO SIT DOWN
AND TALK ABOUT IT AND
GET COMFORTABLE ABOUT IT,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
AND THEN NOT OVERREACT

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
WHEN HE WANTS TO DO
SOME OF THESE THINGS,
WHICH HE'S GOT TO DO.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
OKAY, THANK YOU.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
YOU FEEL GOOD?

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
