        MAJOR FUNDING 
        FOR THIS PROGRAM PROVIDED BY
      

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.400

        THE FORD FOUNDATION,
       
      

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.700

        A RESOURCE
        FOR INNOVATIVE PEOPLE
      

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.670

        AND INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE,


00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.640

        AND THE CORPORATION
        FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING.

        ADDITIONAL FUNDING
        PROVIDED BY THESE FUNDERS --
      

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.220

        IT IS ALL AROUND US.


00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.890

        IT IS AN ILLUSION,
        AND YET PROFOUNDLY REAL.
      

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.530

        WHAT WE PERCEIVE AS RACE


00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.200

        IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
        WE NOTICE ABOUT EACH OTHER --
      

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.230

        SKIN -- DARKER OR LIGHTER.


00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.070

        EYES -- ROUND OR ALMOND.


00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.840

        BLUE, BLACK, BROWN.


00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.310

        HAIR -- CURLY, STRAIGHT, BLONDE,


00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.510

        OR DARK.


00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.820

        AND ATTACHED
        TO THESE CHARACTERISTICS
      

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420

        IS A MOSAIC OF VALUES,
        ASSUMPTIONS,
      

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.990

        AND HISTORICAL MEANINGS.


00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.190

        EVEN THOSE OF US WHO CLAIM
        WE DON'T BELIEVE THE STEREOTYPES
      

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.960

        CAN EASILY RECITE THEM.


00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.470

        Man: THE AVERAGE PERSON
        ON THE STREET THINKS THAT RACE
      

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.770

        CONSISTS OF DIFFERENCES
        IN PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.
      

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.370

        THEY ALSO THINK


00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.510

        THAT FROM LOOKING AT
        A PERSON'S PHYSICAL APPEARANCE
      

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.950

        THAT THEY CAN FIND OUT OR KNOW


00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.980

        MORE SUBTLE THINGS ABOUT THEM.


00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.890

        RACE IS NOT A LEVEL
        OF BIOLOGICAL DIVISION
      

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.850

        THAT WE FIND
        IN ANATOMICALLY MODERN HUMANS.
      

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.220

        THERE ARE NO SUBSPECIES


00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.960

        IN THE HUMAN BEINGS
        THAT LIVE TODAY.
      

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.560

        AND THAT'S QUITE SHOCKING
        TO A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS.
      

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.630

        WHEN YOU LOOK
        AND YOU THINK YOU SEE RACE,
      

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.270

        TO BE TOLD THAT NO,
        YOU DON'T SEE RACE,
      

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.640

        YOU JUST THINK YOU SEE RACE,


00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.110

        THAT, YEAH, IT'S BASED
        ON YOUR CULTURAL LENS.
      

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.840

        THAT'S EXTREMELY CHALLENGING.


00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.350

        Narrator: JUST BECAUSE RACE
        ISN'T A BIOLOGICAL REALITY,
      

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.520

        DOESN'T MEAN IT ISN'T REAL.


00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.090

        BEING CLASSIFIED AS ASIAN


00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.890

        OR BLACK OR LATINO


00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.860

        HAS NEVER CARRIED THE SAME
        ADVANTAGES IN OUR SOCIETY
      

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.600

        AS BEING WHITE.


00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.700

        Man: RACE IN ITSELF
        MEANS NOTHING.
      

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.710

        THE MARKERS OF RACE --
        SKIN COLOR, HAIR TEXTURE,
      

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.910

        THE THINGS THAT WE IDENTIFY
        AS THE RACIAL MARKERS
      

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.810

        MEAN NOTHING, UNLESS THEY ARE
        GIVEN SOCIAL MEANING,
      

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.950

        AND UNLESS THERE'S PUBLIC POLICY


00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.380

        AND PRIVATE ACTIONS


00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.190

        THAT ACT UPON
        THOSE KINDS OF CHARACTERISTICS.
      

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.360

        THAT CREATES RACE.


00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.760

        Narrator: PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES
        DON'T MAKE RACE.
      

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.000

        WHAT MAKES RACE
        ARE THE LAWS AND PRACTICES
      

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.500

        THAT AFFECT LIFE CHANCES
        AND OPPORTUNITIES
      

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.510

        BASED ON THOSE DIFFERENCES.


00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.880

        IF WE LOOK CAREFULLY,


00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.180

        WE CAN SEE HOW OUR INSTITUTIONS
        AND POLICIES
      

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.520

        HAVE ASSIGNED RACIAL IDENTITIES


00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.390

        AND REINFORCED RACIAL INEQUALITY


00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.720

        THROUGHOUT THE 20th CENTURY.


00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.220

        Woman: AND THIS IS
        SOMETHING I THINK
      

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.720

        THAT ALL IMMIGRANT GROUPS


00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.490

        EXPERIENCE IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
        WHEN THEY COME TO AMERICA,
      

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.530

        NO MATTER
        WHAT POINT IN TIME IT IS.
      

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.300

        BECAUSE THEY COME TO A COUNTRY


00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.770

        THAT HAS HISTORICALLY
        ALWAYS BEEN HIGHLY RACIALIZED.
      

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.370

        IT'S A COUNTRY WHERE RACE
        HAS ITS ORIGINS IN SLAVERY
      

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.810

        AS WELL AS IN THE CONQUEST
        OF NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS.
      

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.680

        SO, ANYBODY COMING FROM
        THE OUTSIDE AFTER THAT POINT
      

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.490

        HAS TO FIT INTO THIS
        RACIALIZED SOCIETY IN SOME WAY.
      

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.660

        AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR


00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:26.470

        HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING
        TO FIT IN RIGHT AWAY.
      

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.970

        Narrator: AT THE START
        OF THE 20th CENTURY,
      

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.540

        AS MILLIONS OF IMMIGRANTS
        ARRIVED FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD,
      

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.710

        LAWMAKERS AND SOCIAL
        SCIENTISTS DEBATED
      

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.080

        HOW ALL OF THEM,


00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.780

        INCLUDING THE NEW
        EUROPEAN ARRIVALS,
      

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:49.590

        WOULD FIT INTO THE HIERARCHY
        OF RACES ALREADY HERE.
      

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.630

        THEY CAME SEEKING
        ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY,
      

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:03.900

        FREEDOM, AND A FUTURE
        FOR THEIR FAMILIES.
      

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.840

        OF THE 23 MILLION NEWCOMERS
        BETWEEN 1880 AND 1920,
      

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:24.620

        THE VAST MAJORITY WERE FROM
        EASTERN AND SOUTHERN EUROPE.
      

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.930

        IMMIGRANTS OFTEN WORK
        THE HARDEST,
      

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.760

        POOREST PAYING,
        AND MOST DANGEROUS JOBS,
      

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.330

        ALONG WITH THE SO-CALLED


00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.400

        "INFERIOR RACES" ALREADY HERE --


00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:45.010

        BLACKS, MEXICANS, AND CHINESE.


00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.710

        Man: CITIES WITH
        ENORMOUS SLUMS DEVELOPED
      

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.850

        AS THE UGLY SIDE


00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.450

        OF INDUSTRIALIZATION.


00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.220

        UGLY BOTH IN TERMS


00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.020

        OF THE AESTHETIC
        OF AMERICAN CITIES,
      

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.690

        BUT ALSO UGLY IN TERMS OF
        THE SOLIDIFYING
      

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.530

        OF CLASS DIFFERENCES
        AND CLASS TENSION.
      

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.730

        AS ALL OF THOSE THINGS
        BECAME APPARENT,
      

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.070

        THE IMMIGRANT BECAME THE SYMBOL


00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.640

        FOR WHAT AMERICA
        MIGHT BE BECOMING.
      

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.410

        Narrator: BY 1910,


00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.840

        58% OF AMERICAN
        MINING AND FACTORY WORKERS
      

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.850

        WERE IMMIGRANTS.


00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.950

        LIKE MEXICANS
        AND AFRICAN AMERICANS,
      

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.620

        ITALIANS, SLAVS,


00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.420

        AND JEWS
        WERE OFTEN DESIRED AS LABORERS,
      

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.820

        BUT ALSO FEARED,


00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.390

        SEEN AS PROMISCUOUS,
        LAZY, OR STUPID.
      

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.670

        SOME SAW IT
        AS A RACIAL INVASION.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:49.040

        EXPRESSED THOSE FEARS IN 1911.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.940

        Ngai:
        AND THIS WAS ALSO A TIME
      

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.980

        WHEN SCIENTIFIC RACE THEORY
        BEGAN TO TAKE OFF,
      

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.450

        AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO


00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.320

        LOOK AT SOCIETY,


00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.080

        AND LOOK AT GROUPS OF PEOPLE


00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.150

        IN MORE RACIALIZED TERMS.


00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.160

        SO, PEOPLE WERE PERCEIVED


00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.930

        AS BEING SEPARATE RACES.


00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.330

        SO YOU HAD KIND OF
        A HIGHER ORDER OF WHITE RACES,
      

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.570

        YOU KNOW,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.470

        AS OPPOSED TO WHAT
        MANY OF THE NATIVISTS CALLED
      

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:01.950

        THE LOWER RACES OF EUROPE.


00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.450

        Jacobson:
        THERE ARE VARIOUS GROUPS
      

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:05.220

        LIKE THE AMERICAN
        BREEDERS ASSOCIATION,
      

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.120

        THE EUGENICS RESEARCH
        ASSOCIATION,
      

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.860

        WHO NOT ONLY ARE DOING RESEARCH
        ON VARIOUS RACIAL TYPES,
      

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.230

        IN THIS CASE HEBREWS, SLAVS,


00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.800

        MEDITERRANEANS.


00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.530

        WHAT WE WOULD CALL NOW
        THE CAUCASIAN RACE.
      

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.970

        I WOULD BREAK IT DOWN


00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:26.810

        TO 35 OR 37
        OR 45 RACES FOR STUDY.
      

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.810

        AND A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE WAS
        BEGINNING TO GET AT THE IDEA
      

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.250

        THAT THOSE DIFFERENCES
        WERE ACTUALLY
      

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.050

        ROOTED IN REPRODUCTION,


00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.080

        THEY WERE ROOTED
        IN INHERITABLE TRAITS,
      

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.850

        THEY WERE HERITABLE,


00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.160

        THEY WERE BIOLOGICAL,
        THEY WERE IMMUTABLE.
      

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.930

        Narrator:
        THE MORE THE NEWCOMERS
      

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.460

        WERE FORCED INTO LOW-PAYING JOBS
        AND DISEASED TENEMENTS,
      

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.200

        THE MORE THESE CONDITIONS
        WERE EXPLAINED
      

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.500

        AS NATURAL CONSEQUENCES OF
        THEIR INNATE RACIAL CHARACTER.
      

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.170

        BIOLOGY WAS DESTINY.


00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.740

        WHICH SIDE OF THE RACIAL DIVIDE
        YOU FOUND YOURSELF ON
      

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.480

        COULD BE A MATTER
        OF LIFE OR DEATH.
      

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.750

        BETWEEN 1890 AND 1920,


00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:18.060

        2,500 AFRICAN AMERICANS
        WERE LYNCHED IN THE SOUTH.
      

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.960

        IN 1915, LEO FRANK,


00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.130

        A JEW LIVING IN ATLANTA,


00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:28.500

        WAS PULLED FROM JAIL
        AND HANGED BY A MOB
      

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.500

        FOR ALLEGEDLY
        KILLING A WHITE GIRL.
      

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.470

        WRITING ABOUT THE LYNCHING,


00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.670

        A BLACK JOURNALIST WONDERED,


00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.650

        IS THE JEW A WHITE MAN?


00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:44.180

        Ngai: SOME HISTORIANS
        HAVE SUGGESTED THAT
      

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.490

        THESE NEW IMMIGRANT GROUPS
        FROM EUROPE
      

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.590

        WERE IN BETWEEN PEOPLES,


00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.760

        THEY WERE IN
        A TRANSITIONAL STAGE.
      

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.830

        WHEN COMPARED TO


00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.500

        ANGLO-SAXON PROTESTANTS,


00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.700

        GROUPS SUCH AS ITALIANS OR JEWS


00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.470

        WERE SEEN AS NOT BEING
        FULLY WHITE PERHAPS.
      

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.740

        BUT WHEN COMPARED
        TO AFRICAN AMERICANS
      

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.970

        OR WHEN COMPARED TO ASIANS,


00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:09.970

        THEIR WHITENESS
        BECAME MORE SALIENT,
      

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.980

        BECAME MORE VISIBLE.


00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.950

        Narrator: COULD EUROPEAN ETHNICS
        BECOME FULLY WHITE,
      

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.280

        AND THUS, FULLY AMERICAN?


00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.290

        BY 1910, A NEW TERM
        WAS ENTERING POPULAR CULTURE
      

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.390

        TO DESCRIBE
        THE TRANSFORMATION OF EUROPEANS.
      

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.030

        THE PHRASE CAME FROM THE TITLE


00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:33.730

        OF A BROADWAY PLAY
        BY ISRAEL ZANGWILL.
      

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.330

        "GOD," SAID ZANGWILL,


00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.400

        "WOULD MELT DOWN
        THE RACES OF EUROPE
      

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.340

        "INTO A SINGLE PURE ESSENCE,


00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.810

        OUT OF WHICH
        HE WOULD MOLD AMERICANS."
      

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.880

        Man: SO, WHEN THE IRISH,
        WHEN GERMANS,
      

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.850

        WHEN ITALIANS WERE COMING


00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.480

        AND THEY DIDN'T
        SPEAK THE LANGUAGE
      

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.050

        AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW
        THE CULTURE,
      

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:57.050

        THE IDEA WAS THEY WILL
        ASSIMILATE INTO AMERICAN-HOOD,
      

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.290

        THEY WILL BECOME AMERICAN,


00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.360

        WHICH IN THE AMERICAN TRADITION
        HAS MEANT
      

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.290

        WHITE AMERICAN.


00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.070

        BUT THAT MELTING POT
        NEVER INCLUDED PEOPLE OF COLOR.
      

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.770

        BLACKS, CHINESE,
        PUERTO RICANS, ET CETERA,
      

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.610

        COULD NOT MELT INTO THE POT.


00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.840

        THEY COULD BE USED AS WOOD


00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.180

        TO PRODUCE THE FIRE FOR THE POT,


00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.950

        BUT THEY COULD NOT BE USED


00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.350

        AS MATERIAL TO BE MELTED
        INTO THE POT.
      

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:30.690

        Narrator: WHITENESS
        WAS KEY TO CITIZENSHIP.
      

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.690

        IN 1790,
        CONGRESS HAD PASSED AN ACT
      

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.700

        DECLARING THAT ONLY
        FREE WHITE IMMIGRANTS
      

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.830

        COULD BECOME
        NATURALIZED CITIZENS.
      

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.370

        AFTER THE CIVIL WAR,


00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.240

        NATURALIZATION WAS EXTENDED


00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:48.240

        TO PERSONS
        OF AFRICAN DESCENT AS WELL.
      

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.410

        BUT IT WAS THE WHITE CITIZEN


00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.880

        WHO HAD CLEAR ACCESS
        TO THE VOTE,
      

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.510

        SAT ON JURIES,
        WAS ELECTED TO PUBLIC OFFICE,
      

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.420

        AND HAD BETTER JOBS.


00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:03.150

        WHITENESS WAS NOT SIMPLY
        A MATTER OF SKIN COLOR.
      

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.130

        TO BE WHITE
        WAS TO GAIN THE FULL REWARDS
      

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.000

        OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP.


00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.500

        Woman: IN ORDER TO BE


00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.430

        A NATURALIZED CITIZEN
        IN THIS COUNTRY,
      

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.940

        YOU HAD TO BE CATEGORIZED
        AS WHITE OR BLACK,
      

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.910

        AND ALMOST EVERYBODY
        WHO TRIED TO NATURALIZE,
      

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.440

        ALL BUT I THINK ONE CASE
        THAT WENT TO THE SUPREME COURT,
      

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.680

        ALL OF THEM WERE PEOPLE TRYING
        TO BE CATEGORIZED AS WHITE.
      

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.110

        SO THE COURT
        HAD TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT
      

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.280

        WHO WAS WHITE AND WHO WAS NOT.


00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.020

        Narrator: COURTS AND LEGISLATORS
        HAD LONG BEEN IN THE BUSINESS
      

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.690

        OF CONFERRING RACIAL IDENTITIES.


00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.030

        IN THE SOUTH, TO ENFORCE
        JIM CROW SEGREGATION
      

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.660

        AND LAWS AGAINST
        MIXED MARRIAGES,
      

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.900

        COURTS HAD TO FIRST DETERMINE


00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.700

        WHO WAS BLACK UNDER LAW.


00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.200

        Man: AND HERE IS WHERE
        IT REALLY GETS INTERESTING.
      

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.640

        YOU GOT SOME PLACES,
        FOR EXAMPLE, VIRGINIA.
      

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.740

        VIRGINIA LAW
        DEFINED A BLACK PERSON
      

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.510

        AS A PERSON
        WITH 1/16th AFRICAN ANCESTRY.
      

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.050

        NOW, FLORIDA DEFINED
        A BLACK PERSON
      

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.420

        AS A PERSON
        WITH 1/8th AFRICAN ANCESTRY.
      

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.660

        ALABAMA SAID YOU'RE BLACK
        IF YOU GOT ANY BLACK ANCESTRY,
      

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.430

        ANY AFRICAN ANCESTRY AT ALL.


00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:15.690

        BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?


00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.830

        YOU CAN WALK ACROSS A STATE LINE


00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.200

        AND LITERALLY,
        LEGALLY, CHANGE RACE.
      

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.670

        NOW, WHAT DOES RACE MEAN
        UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES?
      

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.170

        YOU GIVE ME THE POWER,


00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.510

        I CAN MAKE YOU
        ANY RACE I WANT YOU TO BE,
      

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:35.010

        BECAUSE IT IS
        A SOCIAL POLITICAL CONSTRUCTION.
      

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.350

        Narrator: IN 1909,
        AMERICAN COURTS HAD THAT POWER.
      

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.360

        THAT YEAR, THE U.S. COURT
        OF APPEALS IN MASSACHUSETTS
      

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.160

        RULED THAT ARMENIANS,


00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.830

        OFTEN CLASSIFIED
        AS ASIATIC TURKS,
      

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.030

        WERE LEGALLY WHITE.


00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.800

        IF ARMENIANS
        COULD BE DESIGNATED WHITE,
      

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.800

        WHAT OF THE OTHER
        SO-CALLED ASIATIC RACES?
      

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.040

        FILIPINOS,


00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.510

        SYRIANS,


00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:06.810

        THE JAPANESE?


00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.350

        COULD THEY ALSO
        PETITION SUCCESSFULLY
      

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.480

        TO BE DESIGNATED WHITE
        BY THE COURTS,
      

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:22.330

        AND THUS BECOME AMERICANS?


00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.170

        IN 1922, WHEN JAPANESE
        BUSINESSMAN TAKAO OZAWA
      

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.470

        PETITIONED THE SUPREME COURT
        FOR NATURALIZATION,
      

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:32.670

        MANY IN THE JAPANESE COMMUNITY


00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.510

        BELIEVED HIS
        WAS THE PERFECT TEST CASE.
      

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.150

        Ngai:
        TAKAO OZAWA CAME FROM JAPAN,
      

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.080

        WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY
        OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY
      

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.150

        FOR A FEW YEARS,


00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.420

        THEN MOVED TO HAWAII
        WHERE HE HAD A FAMILY,
      

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.490

        AND HE APPLIED


00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.530

        TO BECOME
        A NATURALIZED CITIZEN IN 1915.
      

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:57.400

        Woman: MY FATHER WROTE
        HIS OWN BRIEF AND EVERYTHING,
      

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.730

        AND HE WAS REALLY DEVOTED,


00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.930

        HE WANTED TO BECOME
        AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.
      

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:08.470

        AND NOTHING WOULD STOP HIM.


00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:12.380

        HE WAS DETERMINED.


00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:14.650

        Narrator:
        JAPANESE GROWERS IN CALIFORNIA
      

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:17.850

        WATCHED OZAWA'S CASE CLOSELY.


00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:21.850

        BY 1920, A SERIES
        OF ALIEN LAND ACTS
      

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.220

        PROHIBITED MANY NON-CITIZENS


00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.030

        FROM OWNING OR LEASING LAND.


00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.830

        WITHOUT A LEGAL DESIGNATION
        OF WHITENESS
      

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.730

        TO MAKE THEM CITIZENS,


00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.600

        JAPANESE IMMIGRANTS
        COULD NOT HAVE
      

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.200

        THE FULL PROTECTION
        OF AMERICAN LAW,
      

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.340

        NO MATTER HOW LONG
        THEY LIVED IN THE COUNTY.
      

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:45.580

        IN HIS BRIEF,
        OZAWA ARGUED THAT HIS SKIN
      

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:48.080

        WAS AS WHITE
        AS ANY SO-CALLED CAUCASIAN,
      

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.980

        IF NOT WHITER.


00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.590

        BUT HE MADE A MUCH MORE
        IMPORTANT SECOND ARGUMENT.
      

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.420

        BUT HIS SECOND ARGUMENT WAS


00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.690

        THAT RACE SHOULDN'T MATTER
        FOR CITIZENSHIP.
      

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.290

        WHAT REALLY MATTERED
        WAS A PERSON'S BELIEFS.
      

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.630

        Narrator:
        "MY HONESTY AND INDUSTRIOUSNESS

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.290

        THE ARTICLES
        WOULD COME OUT IN THE PAPER.
      

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.320

        I THOUGHT, OOH,
        WHAT DID HE DO, YOU KNOW?
      

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.090

        I THOUGHT ONLY BAD THINGS
        CAME OUT IN THE PAPER,
      

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.430

        AND I WAS KIND OF ASHAMED,
        YOU KNOW,
      

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.000

        WHEN I WAS A CHILD.


00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000

        AND IT WAS JUST THE WAY


00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.200

        WE WERE BROUGHT UP.


00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.010

        I DIDN'T HAVE
        ANY ORIENTAL FRIENDS.
      

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.810

        MY NEIGHBORS WERE ALL CAUCASIAN,


00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.650

        AND SO HE WAS SO DETERMINED
        TO GET US --
      

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:03.890

        WELL, WHEN THE TIME CAME,
        TO BE AMERICAN CITIZENS.
      

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:06.190

        Ngai: THE SUPREME COURT


00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.630

        RULED THAT OZAWA
        COULD NOT BE A CITIZEN.
      

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.130

        THEY SAID HE WAS NOT WHITE


00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:12.700

        WITHIN THE MEANING
        OF THE STATUTE,
      

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.100

        AND THEREFORE
        NOT ELIGIBLE TO CITIZENSHIP.
      

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.840

        AND THE COURT SAID,


00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:20.670

        WELL, HE'S NOT WHITE
        BECAUSE HE'S NOT CAUCASIAN,
      

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.540

        AND CAUCASIANS ARE WHITES.


00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.940

        HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.


00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:28.180

        HE LEARNED ENGLISH.


00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.050

        HE HAD A LIFESTYLE
        THAT WAS AMERICAN.
      

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.650

        HE WENT TO
        CHRISTIAN CHURCH ON SUNDAY,
      

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:37.160

        HE DRESSED AS A WESTERNER,


00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.990

        HE BROUGHT UP HIS CHILDREN
        AS AMERICANS.
      

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.860

        HE DID EVERYTHING
        HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO,
      

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.330

        AND YET HE'S TOLD
        THAT HE CAN'T BE A CITIZEN
      

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.170

        BECAUSE HE'S NOT WHITE.


00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.440

        Narrator: THE COURT RULED


00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.970

        THAT ACCORDING TO
        THE BEST KNOWN SCIENCE,
      

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.580

        OZAWA WAS NOT CAUCASIAN,


00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.680

        BUT OF THE MONGOLIAN RACE.


00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.250

        BUT THE COURT WOULD NOT
        BE BOUND BY SCIENCE
      

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:07.050

        IN POLICING
        THE BOUNDARIES OF WHITENESS.
      

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.420

        ONLY THREE MONTHS AFTER OZAWA,


00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.790

        THE COURT TOOK UP THE CASE
        OF BHAGAT SINGH THIND,
      

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.790

        A SOUTH ASIAN IMMIGRANT
        AND U.S. ARMY VETERAN
      

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.360

        WHO PETITIONED FOR CITIZENSHIP
        ON THE GROUNDS
      

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.130

        THAT INDIANS WERE OF
        THE ARYAN OR CAUCASIAN RACE,
      

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.600

        AND THEREFORE WHITE.


00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.310

        AND HE MAKES
        THE SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENT,
      

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:30.410

        HAVING LEARNED SOMETHING,
        ACTUALLY, FROM THE OZAWA CASE,
      

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.010

        THAT HE IS CAUCASIAN.


00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.810

        HE GETS SCIENTIFIC AUTHORITY
        TO SPEAK ON HIS BEHALF,
      

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:39.180

        THAT IN FACT, SOUTH ASIANS ARE
        INCLUDED IN THE CAUCASIAN RACE.
      

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.890

        Ngai: SO HERE THE COURT
        WAS IN A BIND,
      

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.990

        BECAUSE THEY WERE PRESENTED WITH


00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.860

        SO-CALLED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE


00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.490

        THAT INDIANS WERE CAUCASIAN.


00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.030

        AND THE COURT
        SOLVED THIS PROBLEM BY SAYING
      

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.970

        THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT
        SCIENCE SAID, SO-CALLED SCIENCE.
      

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:01.810

        THEY ACTUALLY SAID,


00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.840

        WHITE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN
        BE SCIENTIFICALLY DETERMINED,
      

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.680

        BUT WHITE IS SOMETHING THAT IS
        SUBJECTIVELY UNDERSTOOD
      

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.420

        BY WHO THEY CALLED
        THE COMMON PERSON,
      

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:15.650

        THE COMMON MAN.


00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.190

        Narrator: "IT MAY BE TRUE,"
        REASONED THE COURT,
      

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:21.130

        "THAT THE BLONDE SCANDINAVIAN
        AND THE BROWN HINDU
      

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:25.300

        "HAVE A COMMON ANCESTOR IN
        THE DIM REACHES OF ANTIQUITY,
      

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.200

        "BUT THE AVERAGE MAN
        KNOWS PERFECTLY WELL
      

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.970

        "THAT THERE ARE UNMISTAKABLE
        AND PROFOUND DIFFERENCES
      

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:36.040

        BETWEEN THEM TODAY."


00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.310

        THE SAME COURT THAT USED SCIENCE


00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.310

        TO DETERMINE WHITENESS IN OZAWA
        THREE MONTHS BEFORE,
      

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.150

        NOW REFUTED
        ITS OWN REASONING IN THIND.
      

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.820

        THIND MIGHT WELL BE CAUCASIAN,
        THE HIGH COURT SAID,
      

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.490

        BUT HE WAS NOT WHITE.


00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:56.690

        THE JUSTICES NEVER SAID
        WHAT WHITENESS WAS,
      

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:58.360

        ONLY WHAT IT WASN'T.


00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.230

        THEIR IMPLIED LOGIC
        WAS A CIRCULAR ONE.
      

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.900

        WHITENESS WAS


00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.240

        WHAT THE COMMON WHITE MAN
        SAID IT WAS.
      

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.270

        Ossorio: THE COURT OFTEN DECIDED
        WHO WAS WHITE AND WHO WASN'T
      

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.410

        BASED ON WHETHER THEY FELT
        THAT THE PERSON
      

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.480

        WOULD POLITICALLY FIT WELL
        INTO THE KIND OF SOCIETY
      

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.650

        THAT WE WERE TRYING TO BUILD.


00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:17.620

        AND SOMETIMES IT WAS
        PRETTY EXPLICIT
      

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.250

        THAT THIS IS WHAT
        THE COURT WAS DOING.
      

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.090

        THERE WAS WIDESPREAD
        RACIAL VIEWS
      

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.260

        THAT ASIANS WERE UNDESIRABLE,


00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.860

        THAT THEY THREATENED


00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.730

        TO CONTAMINATE
        THE AMERICAN SOCIETY.
      

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.870

        BASICALLY THAT ASIANS
        ARE TOO DIFFERENT,
      

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:44.340

        THAT THEY CAN'T EVER REALLY
        BECOME LIKE THE REST OF US.
      

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:46.780

        Narrator: THE CONSEQUENCES
        OF THE UNANIMOUS VERDICT
      

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.550

        IN U.S. v THIND


00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.550

        WERE CATASTROPHIC
        FOR THE INDIAN COMMUNITY.
      

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.150

        SOUTH ASIANS WHO HAD NATURALIZED
        BEFORE THE VERDICT
      

00:20:55.150 --> 00:21:01.460

        WERE STRIPPED OF THEIR
        CITIZENSHIP AND PROPERTY.
      

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.490

        VAISHO DAS BAGAI
        WAS A SUCCESSFUL MERCHANT

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.160

        IS A BAD RISK,
        IS A FINANCIAL RISK --
      

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.660

        THAT AN INTEGRATED NEIGHBORHOOD


00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.320

        IS LIKELY TO BE
        AN UNSTABLE NEIGHBORHOOD.
      

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.830

        UNSTABLE SOCIALLY, BUT THEREFORE

        ALSO UNSTABLE ECONOMICALLY.


00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.170

        Narrator:
        WHEN THE WHITE RESIDENTS
      

00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.930

        OF EIGHT MILE ROAD IN DETROIT


00:34:31.930 --> 00:34:34.470

        WERE TOLD THEY WERE TOO CLOSE
        TO A BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD
      

00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:38.010

        TO QUALIFY
        FOR A POSITIVE FHA RATING,
      

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:39.840

        THEY BUILT THIS SIX-FOOT WALL


00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.350

        BETWEEN THEMSELVES
        AND THEIR BLACK NEIGHBORS.
      

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.180

        ONCE THE WALL WENT UP,


00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:50.090

        MORTGAGES ON THE WHITE
        PROPERTIES WERE APPROVED.
      

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.520

        BETWEEN 1934 AND 1962,


00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.190

        THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
        UNDERWROTE
      

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:59.700

        $120 BILLION IN NEW HOUSING.


00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:04.970

        LESS THAN 2% WENT TO NON-WHITES.


00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.140

        Bernice:
        I CAN UNDERSTAND AN INDIVIDUAL
      

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:11.140

        DEPENDING ON HIS ENVIRONMENT
        OR HIS FAMILY OR WHATEVER
      

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.810

        BEING RACIST,


00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:16.810

        BUT FOR YOUR COUNTRY
        TO SANCTION IT,
      

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.320

        GIVE HIM TOOLS TO DO THAT,


00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:27.490

        THERE'S SOMETHING
        DEFINITELY WRONG THERE.
      

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.490

        Herb Kalisman: I THINK WE HAD
        THE GOLDEN CHANCE
      

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.300

        AFTER WORLD WAR II
        AND WE FLUBBED IT.
      

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:38.170

        BECAUSE HERE WE HAD
        A G.I. BILL THAT WAS,
      

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.670

        YOU KNOW,
        THAT WAS AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY,
      

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:45.680

        BUT IN A WAY THEY DIDN'T
        MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY.
      

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.680

        AND THAT WAS
        A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY
      

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.680

        IN THIS COUNTRY
        AND WE MISSED IT,
      

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:54.490

        WE REALLY MISSED IT.


00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.520

        Man: BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL,
        CAN'T YOU?
      

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.550

        A TOWN WITH GOOD
        REAL ESTATE PEOPLE
      

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.490

        IS A MORE
        SUBSTANTIAL COMMUNITY,
      

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:03.630

        BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE
        OWN THEIR OWN HOMES.
      

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.090

        THAT'S RIGHT.


00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:07.530

        Man: AND NOW IT'S
        SORT OF HARD TO BELIEVE
      

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.970

        THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
        NATIONALIZED
      

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:11.770

        AND INTRODUCED RED LINING.


00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:15.610

        IN A FUNNY WAY, IT WASN'T
        JUST GIVING SOMETHING TO WHITES,
      

00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:18.740

        IT WAS CONSTRUCTING WHITENESS.


00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.450

        WHITENESS MEANT, AS IN THE PAST,


00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:24.380

        WHITE HAD MEANT BEING A CITIZEN
        AND BEING A CHRISTIAN.
      

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:25.720

        IT NOW MEANT


00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.990

        LIVING IN THE SUBURBS.


00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.990

        Narrator: ONLY 50 YEARS BEFORE,


00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.430

        EUROPEAN ETHNICS WERE BELIEVED
        TO BE DISTINCT RACES.
      

00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:38.660

        NOW, IN THESE NEW
        SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOODS,
      

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.330

        THEY BLENDED TOGETHER
        AS WHITE AMERICANS.
      

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:48.010

        Doris Kalisman: WE DID HAVE
        DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS GROUPS,
      

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.610

        WE WERE MIXED UP THERE,


00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.510

        BUT WE WERE
        AN ALL-WHITE COMMUNITY,
      

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:57.950

        AND I THINK
        IT'S AN UNREALISTIC WORLD.
      

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.250

        I THINK THERE'S
        SOMETHING STERILE
      

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.890

        ABOUT EVERYONE BEING
        ON THE SAME ECONOMIC LEVEL
      

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:09.890

        AND EVERYONE
        BEING THE SAME COLOR.
      

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.200

        Man:
        IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T PROMOTE
      

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:16.130

        A FEELING OF A WIDER WORLD --


00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:18.840

        WIDER, NOT WHITER --


00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.370

        TO LIVE IN A PLACE


00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:21.970

        WHERE THERE ARE ONLY PEOPLE
        THAT LOOK LIKE YOU.
      

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.470

        Narrator:
        CARTOONIST BILL GRIFFITH
      

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:29.350

        REMEMBERS MOVING FROM BROOKLYN
        TO LEVITTOWN AS A KID.
      

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:32.520

        Griffith: IT'S AN UNTENABLE,
        ARTIFICIAL WORLD.
      

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.020

        YOU'RE CREATING


00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:36.250

        A WEIRD UTOPIA IN A WAY,


00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.020

        A UTOPIA OF,


00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:42.330

        YOU KNOW,
        MIDDLE-CLASS WHITE PEOPLE
      

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.990

        WHO WERE TRYING TO DENY
        THAT THEY WERE LIVING
      

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.660

        IN A MULTI-RACIAL WORLD.


00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.330

        AND HOW LONG
        CAN YOU KEEP THAT UP?
      

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:55.770

        YOU CAN'T KEEP THAT UP FOREVER.


00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.010

        WHETHER THERE WERE


00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.340

        GOING TO BE BLACK PEOPLE
        IN LEVITTOWN, WAS JUST --
      

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.840

        IT WOULD BE
        ALMOST THE EQUIVALENT OF SAYING
      

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.280

        ARE THERE GOING TO BE
        MARTIANS IN LEVITTOWN?
      

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.550

        Powell: THE BASIC IDEA OF
        WHITENESS IS WHO'S INCLUDED,
      

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:10.120

        WHO'S PART OF THE FAMILY,


00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:16.730

        AND IT HAS
        MATERIAL CONSEQUENCES.
      

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.460

        BLACKS WEREN'T COMPLETELY
        LEFT OUT OF THE HOUSING MARKET.
      

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.860

        THE HOUSING MARKET
        THAT THEY WERE EXPOSED TO
      

00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:23.630

        WAS LARGELY PUBLIC HOUSING.


00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:26.400

        AND PUBLIC HOUSING,
        FIRST OF ALL, WAS BUILT
      

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.470

        ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY,
        WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS,
      

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:34.010

        IN THE CENTRAL CITY.


00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:37.150

        AND AFTER WORLD WAR II
        WE STARTED BUILDING
      

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.150

        LARGER AND LARGER
        PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECTS,
      

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:46.090

        WHICH WERE CALLED
        VERTICAL GHETTOS.
      

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.490

        ALL OF A SUDDEN
        YOU WERE CONCENTRATING
      

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:54.500

        LARGE NUMBERS OF POOR PEOPLE
        OF COLOR IN ONE PLACE.
      

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.430

        Narrator:
        ANOTHER FEDERAL PROGRAM,
      

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:59.100

        URBAN RENEWAL,


00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:05.840

        WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE CITIES
        MORE LIVABLE.
      

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:09.280

        90% OF ALL HOUSING
        DESTROYED BY URBAN RENEWAL
      

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.720

        WAS NOT REPLACED.


00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:21.720

        TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE DISPLACED
        WERE BLACK OR LATINO.
      

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.560

        Lyndon Johnson:
        FAIR HOUSING FOR ALL,
      

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.960

        ALL HUMAN BEINGS


00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.800

        WHO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY


00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.670

        IS NOW A PART
        OF THE AMERICAN WAY OF LIFE.
      

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.810

        Narrator:
        IN 1968, PRESIDENT JOHNSON
      

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:40.310

        SIGNED THE FAIR HOUSING ACT.


00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:41.840

        FOR THE FIRST TIME,


00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.850

        RACIAL LANGUAGE WAS REMOVED
        FROM FEDERAL HOUSING POLICY.
      

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.720

        NON-WHITE FAMILIES BEGAN MOVING


00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:57.960

        INTO TRADITIONALLY
        WHITE COMMUNITIES IN NUMBERS.
      

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.660

        Woman: WE LIVED IN AN APARTMENT,


00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.670

        A TWO-FAMILY HOUSE IN QUEENS.


00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.330

        AND WHEN WE CAME HERE


00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.000

        IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
        WE HAD BOUGHT A HOUSE.
      

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.170

        AND I WAS LOOKING FOR EVERYTHING
        IN THE STORYBOOKS.
      

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:12.840

        Narrator:
        THE FRISBYS MOVED FROM QUEENS
      

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.610

        TO SUBURBAN ROOSEVELT,


00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:18.680

        ONLY A FEW MILES
        FROM LEVITTOWN.
      

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.250

        LIKE THE FRISBYS,


00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.520

        MANY NON-WHITE FAMILIES
        WOULD DISCOVER
      

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:28.520

        THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF RACE
        IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET.
      

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:32.030

        THEY WATCHED AS THEIR HOMES
        AND NEIGHBORHOODS IN SUBURBIA
      

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:41.910

        DECLINED PRECISELY BECAUSE
        THEY HAD MOVED INTO THEM.
      

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.740

        Frisby: WHEN I MOVED
        INTO A NEIGHBORHOOD,
      

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:48.710

        I THOUGHT IT WOULD STAY INTACT
        THE WAY IT WAS.
      

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:50.380

        ON THE STREET THAT I MOVED ON


00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.880

        WHEN I MOVED THERE,


00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:57.950

        IT WAS PREDOMINATELY WHITE.


00:40:57.950 --> 00:41:03.690

        WITHIN TWO YEARS
        IT WAS PREDOMINATELY BLACK.
      

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.660

        Narrator:
        IT WAS CALLED BLOCKBUSTING.
      

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.500

        REAL ESTATE AGENTS PREYED


00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.170

        ON THE RACIAL FEARS
        OF WHITE HOMEOWNERS,
      

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.340

        TO GET THEM
        TO SELL THEIR HOMES QUICKLY
      

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.170

        FOR LESS THAN MARKET VALUE.


00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:18.840

        THE HOMES WERE RESOLD
        TO NON-WHITES
      

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.680

        AT INFLATED PRICES.


00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.450

        Woman:
        WELL, THEY WOULD SAY,
      

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:26.180

        YOU KNOW, WE'RE HAVING
        BLACK PEOPLE MOVE IN.
      

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:30.190

        NOW, I WILL GIVE YOU CASH IF
        YOU WANT TO SELL ME YOUR HOUSE.
      

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:33.520

        DO YOU WANT TO STAY WITH
        BLACK PEOPLE NEXT DOOR TO YOU?
      

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.860

        AND THAT'S THE WAY IT WENT ON.


00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.260

        AND AS BUNNY SAID,
        A LOT OF THE PEOPLE
      

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:46.200

        JUST SAID YES,
        I'LL TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.
      

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:54.210

        AND THAT'S THE START
        OF THE WHITE PEOPLE LEAVING.
      

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:55.810

        Narrator: AS MORE
        BLACK AND LATINO FAMILIES
      

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:57.580

        MOVED TO ROOSEVELT,


00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.350

        REAL ESTATE BECAME
        MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED,
      

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.650

        JUST AS THE FHA HAD PREDICTED.


00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.660

        BUT WHY?


00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.320

        Man: I HAVE AN IDEA MY HOUSE
        IS PROBABLY WORTH AROUND
      

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.830

        120 IN THIS TOWN.


00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:16.500

        BUT IT WOULD BE WORTH
        IN MONTOUR
      

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.940

        OR GARDEN CITY
        OR SOME OTHER PLACE...
      

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:24.040

        PROBABLY AROUND
        200,000 OR BETTER.
      

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.680

        NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 80,000.


00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.480

        YOU SAID TO ME ONE TIME


00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.850

        ABOUT WHY DO PEOPLE


00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:37.020

        DISLIKE THE BLACKS?


00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.860

        WELL, MONEY-WISE,
        THERE'S A REASON.
      

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.030

        NOT THAT YOU DISLIKE
        THE BLACKS SO MUCH,
      

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:49.700

        BUT YOU DISLIKE WHAT HAPPENS


00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:54.540

        WHEN A COMMUNITY TURNS
        FROM WHITE TO BLACK.
      

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.210

        Narrator: IT WASN'T
        AFRICAN-AMERICANS MOVING IN
      

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:59.980

        THAT CAUSED HOUSING VALUES
        TO GO DOWN IN ROOSEVELT
      

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.980

        AND OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS,


00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.110

        IT WAS WHITES LEAVING.


00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.580

        Man: WHEN A NEIGHBORHOOD,


00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.120

        A PREVIOUSLY WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD
        STARTS TO INTEGRATE,
      

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.360

        EVEN IF INDIVIDUAL WHITES
        DON'T HAVE PERSONAL
      

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.420

        OR PSYCHOLOGICAL ANIMOSITY
        AND RACIAL HATRED,
      

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:17.290

        THEY STILL HAVE
        AN ECONOMIC INCENTIVE TO LEAVE.
      

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.660

        BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE
        THAT OTHERS
      

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.670

        MIGHT MAKE THE SAME CALCULATION
        AND LEAVE FIRST.
      

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.600

        SO YOU GET A VICIOUS CIRCLE


00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.500

        WHERE WHITES CALCULATE THAT
        OTHER WHITES ARE GOING TO SELL
      

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.940

        WHEN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
        INTEGRATES,
      

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:32.180

        THEREFORE THEY WANT TO
        SELL FIRST TO AVOID LOSSES,
      

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.340

        AND THEY ACTUALLY
        MAKE IT HAPPEN,
      

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:36.880

        THEY MAKE WHITE FLIGHT HAPPEN.


00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.850

        AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT
        AFRICAN AMERICANS,
      

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.280

        IF AFRICAN AMERICANS
        ARE 20% OF THAT MARKET,
      

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.450

        IT MEANS THAT 80% OF THE PEOPLE


00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.520

        ARE NOT LOOKING
        IN THOSE PLACES FOR HOMES.
      

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.190

        SO THE PRICES OF THOSE HOMES
        DECLINES OR STAYS STABLE.
      

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:52.360

        AND BANKS CONTRIBUTE TO THIS


00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.030

        BY CONTINUALLY MAKING LOANS


00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:59.840

        IN REGIONS
        THAT ARE ON THE RISE,
      

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.400

        WHITE COMMUNITIES,


00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.870

        AND MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO
        GET LOANS IN BLACK COMMUNITIES.
      

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:06.810

        SO THERE'S A DIFFERENCE,
        THERE'S A LACK OF SYMMETRY
      

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.480

        THAT'S IMPORTANT
        TO KEEP IN MIND.
      

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:11.980

        SO IT'S NOT THE SAME
        WHEN WHITES ARE BY THEMSELVES.
      

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.480

        BECAUSE WHEN THEY ARE
        BY THEMSELVES,
      

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:16.320

        THEY'RE TAKING
        ALL THE RESOURCES WITH THEM.
      

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.650

        THEY'RE TAKING ALL
        THE AMENITIES WITH THEM.
      

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.520

        BUT WHEN BLACKS
        ARE BY THEMSELVES,
      

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:22.490

        THEY CAN'T GET LOANS,


00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.660

        THEY DON'T HAVE
        A DECENT TAX BASE,
      

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.960

        THERE ARE NO JOBS.


00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:31.500

        AND THEN THAT BECOMES ASSOCIATED
        WITH BLACK SPACE.
      

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.100

        Narrator: IN THE END,


00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.510

        WHAT HAPPENED TO ROOSEVELT
        HAPPENS IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS
      

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:40.510

        WHEN WHITE FAMILIES
        AND BUSINESSES FLEE.
      

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.850

        THE TAX BASE ERODED.


00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:47.180

        SCHOOLS AND SERVICES DECLINED.


00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.690

        THE TOWN WAS SEEN
        BY COUNTY OFFICIALS
      

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:56.690

        AS A LEGITIMATE DUMPING GROUND
        FOR WELFARE FAMILIES.
      

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.800

        Powell: AT ONE POINT
        WE HAD EXPLICIT LAWS
      

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:04.930

        THAT SAYS WHITES ARE ON TOP
        AND BLACKS ARE ON THE BOTTOM.
      

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.140

        TODAY WE HAVE
        MANY OF THE SAME PRACTICES
      

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.510

        WITHOUT THE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE.


00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:14.410

        AND THOSE PRACTICES ARE LARGELY
        INSCRIBED IN GEOGRAPHY.
      

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:19.980

        AND SO GEOGRAPHY DOES THE WORK
        OF JIM CROW LAWS.
      

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.820

        SO, MANY PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED,


00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.990

        AS WHY AFTER 50 YEARS
        OF CIVIL RIGHTS
      

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:25.990

        ARE OUR SCHOOLS
        STILL SEGREGATED,
      

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:27.990

        WHY ARE HOUSING
        MARKETS STILL SEGREGATED,
      

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:29.660

        WHY ARE OUR JOBS
        STILL SEGREGATED?
      

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.430

        AND AGAIN, A LOT OF THIS
        IS A FUNCTION OF
      

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.730

        HOW WE'VE RE-INSCRIBED


00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:37.730

        THE RACIAL GEOGRAPHIC SPACE
        IN THE UNITED STATES.
      

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.070

        THAT STRUCTURE IS STILL


00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:48.610

        WHAT WE'RE LIVING WITH TODAY.


00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:52.050

        Narrator:
        AS HOMES IN WHITE COMMUNITIES
      

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.520

        APPRECIATED IN VALUE,


00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.120

        THE NET WORTH
        OF THESE WHITE FAMILIES GREW.
      

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.960

        FOR MOST NON-WHITE FAMILIES


00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:02.960

        WHO STAYED
        IN URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS,
      

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:06.630

        THE HOUSING MARKET OPEN TO THEM
        IN THE '50s AND '60s
      

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.630

        WAS LARGELY A RENTAL MARKET.


00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:16.200

        YOU DON'T GAIN EQUITY
        BY PAYING RENT.
      

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.740

        Conley: WHERE ONE'S FAMILY
        LIVES IN AMERICA
      

00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:22.240

        IS NOT JUST A MATTER
        OF TASTE AND PREFERENCE.
      

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.980

        YOU HAVE THE ISSUE
        OF HOUSING AND WEALTH.
      

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.480

        THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS


00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.020

        HOLD MOST OF THEIR WEALTH
        IN THE FORM OF HOME EQUITY.
      

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.490

        SO, THAT'S THEIR NEST EGG,


00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.660

        THAT'S HOW THEY CAN FINANCE


00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.990

        THE EDUCATION
        OF THEIR OFFSPRING.
      

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:41.500

        THAT'S HOW THEY CAN
        SORT OF SAVE UP FOR RETIREMENT.
      

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.170

        IT'S THEIR SAVINGS BANK, RIGHT,


00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:46.840

        THEY'RE LIVING
        IN THEIR SAVINGS BANK.
      

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.010

        Powell: MY FAMILY,
        LIKE A LOT OF FAMILIES,
      

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:51.540

        WAS IN DETROIT,
        STRUGGLING TO BUY A HOUSE.
      

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.840

        YOU HAD A DUAL HOUSING MARKET,
        ONE WHITE, ONE BLACK.
      

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.010

        A HOUSING MARKET WITH ONE
        WITH A LOT OF DEMAND,
      

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:00.780

        ANOTHER HOUSING MARKET
        WITH VERY LITTLE DEMAND.
      

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.120

        MY FATHER LIVES IN THE HOUSE
        THAT I GREW UP IN.
      

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:05.960

        THAT HOUSE TODAY,
        FIVE-BEDROOM HOUSE,
      

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.520

        IS WORTH ABOUT $20,000.


00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.960

        THAT SAME HOUSE
        BOUGHT IN THE SUBURBS
      

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.630

        WOULD BE WORTH TODAY
        ABOUT $320,000.
      

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.800

        SO WHITES MOVING TO THE SUBURB


00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.640

        WERE BEING SUBSIDIZED
        IN THE ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH,
      

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.500

        WHILE BLACKS
        WERE BEING DIVESTED.
      

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.640

        AND THESE WERE
        PUBLIC POLICY DECISIONS
      

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.810

        IN WHICH ON ONE HAND


00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:29.150

        PEOPLE WERE GIVEN ACCESS
        TO PROPERTY,
      

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:31.150

        GIVEN TITLE,


00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.320

        AND SUBSEQUENTLY, WEALTH,


00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:34.980

        AND ON ANOTHER HAND,


00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.650

        WHERE PEOPLE WERE
        NOT GIVEN ACCESS TO PROPERTY,
      

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.320

        DID NOT GENERATE WEALTH,


00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.660

        AND DID NOT GENERATE
        THE KIND OF OPPORTUNITY
      

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:43.230

        FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.


00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.830

        SO IF YOU CAN GET
        A GOVERNMENT LOAN
      

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.500

        WITH YOUR G.I. BILL,


00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.830

        YOUR NEWLY EARNED COLLEGE DEGREE


00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.670

        AND BUY A HOUSE
        IN AN ALL-WHITE AREA,
      

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:53.340

        THAT THEN APPRECIATES IN VALUE


00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.000

        THAT THEN YOU CAN
        PASS ON TO YOUR CHILDREN,
      

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.510

        THEN YOU'RE PASSING ON WEALTH


00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.840

        THAT HAS ALL BEEN MADE
        MORE AVAILABLE TO YOU
      

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:01.780

        AS A CONSEQUENCE OF
        RACIST POLICIES AND PRACTICES.
      

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.110

        TO THE CHILD OF THAT PARENT,


00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:06.450

        IT LOOKS LIKE MY FATHER
        WORKED HARD, BOUGHT A HOUSE,
      

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.620

        PASSED HIS WEALTH ON TO ME,


00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.120

        MADE IT POSSIBLE
        FOR ME TO GO TO SCHOOL,
      

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.450

        MORTGAGED THAT HOUSE
        SO I COULD HAVE, YOU KNOW,
      

00:48:12.450 --> 00:48:15.120

        A RELATIVELY
        DEBT-FREE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE
      

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.130

        AND HAS FINANCED
        MY COLLEGE EDUCATION.
      

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.130

        HOW COME
        YOUR FATHER DIDN'T DO THAT?
      

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:20.630

        YOU KNOW, WELL,


00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:22.300

        THERE ARE SOME GOOD REASONS
        WHY MAYBE YOUR FATHER
      

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.630

        HAD A HARDER TIME DOING IT
        IF YOU'RE AFRICAN AMERICAN
      

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:29.440

        OR LATINO OR NATIVE AMERICAN.


00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.470

        Powell:
        AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY
      

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.310

        SLICK ABOUT WHITENESS,
        IF YOU WILL,
      

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.210

        IS THAT MOST OF THE BENEFITS


00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:39.680

        CAN BE OBTAINED WITHOUT
        EVER DOING ANYTHING PERSONALLY.
      

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:43.990

        FOR WHITES, THEY'RE GETTING
        THE SPOILS OF A RACIST SYSTEM,
      

00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:49.490

        EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT
        PERSONALLY RACIST.
      

00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:52.530

        Narrator: TO GLIMPSE ONE OF
        THE FAR-REACHING CONSEQUENCES
      

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.160

        OF RACIAL INEQUALITY,


00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.370

        YOU NEED ONLY CONSIDER
        ONE STATISTIC --
      

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:02.100

        COMPARATIVE NET WORTH OR WEALTH.


00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.740

        IF YOU ADD UP EVERYTHING YOU OWN


00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.110

        AND SUBTRACT ALL YOUR DEBTS,


00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:12.050

        WHAT'S LEFT IS YOUR NET WORTH.


00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.950

        TODAY, THE AVERAGE BLACK FAMILY


00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.620

        HAS ONLY 1/8th THE NET WORTH


00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.950

        OR ASSETS
        OF THE AVERAGE WHITE FAMILY.
      

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.960

        THAT DIFFERENCE HAS
        SEEMINGLY GROWN SINCE THE 1960s,
      

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.630

        SINCE THE CIVIL RIGHTS TRIUMPHS,


00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.130

        AND IT'S NOT EXPLAINED
        BY OTHER FACTORS,
      

00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:31.800

        LIKE EDUCATION,
        EARNINGS RATES, SAVINGS RATES.
      

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:34.470

        IT IS REALLY THE LEGACY


00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:39.140

        OF RACIAL INEQUALITY
        FROM GENERATIONS PAST.
      

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:41.980

        NO OTHER MEASURE
        CAPTURES THE LEGACY,
      

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.450

        THIS SORT OF CUMULATIVE
        DISADVANTAGE OF RACE,
      

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.650

        OR CUMULATIVE ADVANTAGE
        OF RACE FOR WHITES,
      

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:52.990

        THAN NET WORTH OR WEALTH.


00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:54.660

        Narrator:
        EVEN WITH THE SAME INCOME,
      

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.830

        WHITE FAMILIES HAVE ON AVERAGE


00:49:56.830 --> 00:49:59.660

        TWICE THE WEALTH
        OF BLACK FAMILIES.
      

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.230

        MUCH OF THAT DIFFERENCE LIES


00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:06.370

        IN THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES.


00:50:06.370 --> 00:50:08.700

        BUT WHAT HAPPENS
        WHEN WE COMPARE FAMILIES
      

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:15.040

        ALONG THE COLOR LINE
        WHO HAVE SIMILAR WEALTH?
      

00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.610

        Conley: WHEN YOU MAKE
        THE RIGHT COMPARISON,
      

00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:19.180

        WHEN YOU COMPARE
        A BLACK KID FROM A FAMILY
      

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:21.350

        WITH THE SAME INCOME
        AND WEALTH LEVEL
      

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:23.850

        AS THE WHITE KID


00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:26.020

        FROM THE SIMILAR
        ECONOMIC SITUATION,
      

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.690

        RATES OF COLLEGE GRADUATION
        ARE THE SAME.
      

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:31.160

        RATES OF EMPLOYMENT


00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.400

        AND WORK HOURS ARE THE SAME.


00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.530

        RATES OF WELFARE USAGE
        ARE THE SAME.
      

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:39.870

        SO, WHEN WE'RE
        TALKING ABOUT RACE
      

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.370

        IN TERMS OF A CULTURAL
        ACCOUNTING OF THESE DIFFERENCES
      

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.710

        OR A GENETIC ACCOUNTING
        OF THESE DIFFERENCES,
      

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.040

        WE'RE REALLY
        MISSING THE PICTURE,
      

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:56.050

        BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING
        THE WRONG COMPARISON.
      

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.720

        Narrator: WE WANT TO BE
        A COLORBLIND SOCIETY
      

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.820

        THAT VALUES
        THE CONTENT OF CHARACTER
      

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:05.990

        OVER THE COLOR OF SKIN.


00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:08.660

        THE HOPE OF THOUSANDS OF
        NEWCOMERS WHO ARRIVE EACH YEAR
      

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.500

        IS THAT WE ALREADY ARE.


00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.070

        Woman: TO THE FLAG


00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:15.670

        OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA


00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:18.170

        AND TO THE REPUBLIC...


00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:21.510

        Narrator: "I DON'T SEE COLOR,
        I SEE PEOPLE,"
      

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.450

        THE SAYING GOES.


00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:27.820

        Man: THERE ARE PEOPLE
        FROM 100 OTHER NATIONS
      

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.850

        WHO LOOK DIFFERENT FROM YOU.


00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.590

        PEOPLE WHOSE RELIGION,
        HISTORY, SKIN COLOR,
      

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.030

        AND REASON FOR BEING HERE TODAY


00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.330

        MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM YOURS.


00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.700

        Narrator: BUT IN
        POST CIVIL RIGHTS AMERICA,
      

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:46.540

        IS COLORBLINDNESS
        THE SAME AS EQUALITY?
      

00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:48.340

        Bonilla-Silva:
        THE NOTION OF COLORBLINDNESS
      

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:50.010

        CAME TO US FROM THAT FAMOUS


00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.880

        "I HAVE A DREAM" SPEECH
        OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING
      

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:54.480

        WHERE HE SAID THAT PEOPLE


00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:57.050

        SHOULD BE JUDGED BY
        THE CONTENT OF THEIR CHARACTER
      

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:00.010

        AND NOT BY
        THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN.
      

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:02.820

        AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED
        IN THE POST CIVIL RIGHTS ERA
      

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:05.820

        IS THAT WHITES HAVE ASSUMED


00:52:05.820 --> 00:52:08.490

        THAT WE'RE ALREADY THERE,
        THAT WE'RE IN A SOCIETY
      

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:17.070

        WHERE COLOR DOES NOT MATTER.


00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:18.930

        Conley: ON THE ONE HAND,


00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.500

        THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA
        OFFICIALLY ENDED
      

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:25.070

        INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY,


00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.510

        OFFICIALLY ENDED
        DE JURE LEGAL INEQUALITY.
      

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.510

        AT THE SAME TIME,
        THOSE CIVIL RIGHTS TRIUMPHS
      

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:35.180

        DID NOTHING TO ADDRESS
        THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC
      

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.620

        AND SOCIAL INEQUALITIES
        THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN IN PLACE.
      

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.690

        DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THE FACT


00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:42.190

        THAT THE REWARDS, THE HOUSE,


00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:46.030

        THE LEXUS, THE BIG BANK ACCOUNT,


00:52:46.030 --> 00:52:47.860

        THOSE ARE NOT ONLY THE REWARDS,


00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.800

        OR THE POT OF GOLD
        AT THE END OF THE GAME,
      

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.300

        THEY'RE ALSO
        THE STARTING POSITION
      

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:57.040

        FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.


00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.980

        Narrator:
        THE WEALTH GAP GROWS.
      

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.810

        THE ADVANTAGES
        OF BEING WHITE ACCUMULATE
      

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:07.820

        FROM ONE GENERATION TO THE NEXT.


00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.650

        Tatum: WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS
        OR THE ADVANTAGES
      

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:12.690

        TO BEING WHITE IN A SOCIETY
        THAT HAS HISTORICALLY
      

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:14.320

        GIVEN BENEFITS AND ADVANTAGES


00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:16.160

        TO MEMBERS
        OF THE DOMINANT GROUP?
      

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:19.990

        AND IF YOU ARE A PERSON
        WHO HAS THAT PRIVILEGE,
      

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:24.500

        YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NOTICE IT.


00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:27.000

        Conley: SO UNTIL WE RECOGNIZE
        THAT THERE'S REALLY NO WAY
      

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.500

        TO TALK ABOUT
        EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY
      

00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:31.340

        WITHOUT TALKING
        ABOUT EQUALITY OF CONDITION,
      

00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:34.240

        THEN WE'RE STUCK WITH
        THIS PARADOXICAL IDEA
      

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.840

        OF A COLORBLIND SOCIETY


00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:40.080

        IN A SOCIETY
        THAT'S TOTALLY UNEQUAL BY COLOR.
      

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:42.850

        Narrator:
        CLAIMING WE DON'T SEE RACE
      

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.350

        WON'T END RACIAL INEQUALITY.


00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.520

        AS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
        HARRY BLACKMUN SAID,
      

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.190

        "TO GET BEYOND RACISM


00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.200

        "WE MUST FIRST
        TAKE ACCOUNT OF RACE.
      

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:56.500

        THERE IS NO OTHER WAY."


00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.300

        AND JUST AS WE'RE BORN
        INTO THE SYSTEM,
      

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:01.470

        WE DON'T ASK TO BE LOADED UP
        WITH STEREOTYPES
      

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:05.910

        OR OMISSIONS OR DISTORTIONS
        WHEN WE COME INTO THE WORLD.
      

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:10.210

        WE DON'T ASK TO BE
        IN A STRUCTURE WHICH IS UNFAIR,
      

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.950

        BUT THAT'S WHAT
        WE HAVE INHERITED.
      

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.150

        WHETHER YOU IDENTIFY AS
        A PERSON OF COLOR,
      

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:17.750

        WHETHER YOU IDENTIFY
        AS A WHITE PERSON,
      

00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:21.290

        IT DOESN'T MATTER.


00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.290

        I THINK
        WE HAVE TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE
      

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:28.660

        WITH THE PRESENT
        RACIAL ARRANGEMENT.
      

00:54:28.660 --> 00:54:31.000

        IN A SENSE I THINK WE HAVE TO BE
        WILING TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE,
      

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.670

        WILLING TO DEMAND
        MORE OF OURSELVES
      

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:35.170

        AND MORE OF OUR COUNTRY...


00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:40.340

        AND WILLING TO MAKE
        THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE.
      

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:41.810

        Tatum: I THINK WE ALL
        HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
      

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:43.410

        WHAT CAN I INFLUENCE?


00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.010

        I DON'T INFLUENCE EVERYTHING,
        BUT THE THINGS I DO INFLUENCE
      

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:47.520

        I CAN THINK ABOUT


00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:54.320

        HOW AM I MAKING THIS
        A MORE EQUITABLE ENVIRONMENT?
      

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.860

        I CAN ASK MYSELF,


00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:59.360

        WHO'S INCLUDED IN THIS PICTURE
        AND WHO ISN'T?
      

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.460

        WHO'S HAD OPPORTUNITIES
        IN MY ENVIRONMENT
      

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.270

        AND WHO HASN'T?


00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:17.110

        WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT THAT?
