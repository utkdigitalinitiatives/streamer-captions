BETH NAVON: THE FRIENDS
OF ISLAND ACADEMY

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT WAS
STARTED TO WORK AGAINST

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
THE FACT THAT MANY YOUNGSTERS
IN THIS CITY GET CAUGHT UP

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
WITH THE CRIMINAL AND
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
END UP IN JAIL OR DETENTION,
COME OUT AND RETURN.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
SO THIS ORGANIZATION
WAS FOUNDED IN 1990,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
WITH IT'S MISSION AND
IT'S GOAL TO PREVENT

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
THE RE-INCARCERATION
OF YOUNGSTERS.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
AND TO SET THEM ON A PATH
THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
FROM WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
TO PUT THEM IN EDUCATION AND
WORK AND MAKE THEM ULTIMATELY

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
SELF SUFFICIENT WITH
PRODUCTIVE, POSITIVE LIVES.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
SO ONE OF THE THINGS
WE DECIDED VERY EARLY

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
WAS THAT WE REALLY
NEEDED TO HAVE

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
AN IN-HOUSE
EDUCATION PROGRAM.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
THE NUMBER OF YOUNGSTERS
WHO CAN GO BACK

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
TO THEIR HIGH SCHOOLS
IS VIRTUALLY NIL.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
THEY DON'T HAVE
HIGH SCHOOL CREDITS.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
BEFORE THEY WERE PICKED
UP AT 16, FOR YEARS.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
SO WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT
RUNS THE GAMUT FROM YOUNGSTERS

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
READING FROM 1ST GRADE TO
8TH GRADE, 9TH GRADE LEVEL.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
WE HAVE 3 LEVELS.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
WE HAVE LITERACY LEVEL.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
WE HAVE BASIC ED. LEVEL.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
PRE G.E.D. AND G.E.D.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
AND THE G.E.D. IF YOU TAKE IT,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
IS THE EQUIVALENT OF HAVING
A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
AND THEN WE HAVE
A PROGRAM

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
THAT PUTS THOSE
YOUNGSTERS INTO COLLEGE.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
SO TELL ME WHY YOU LIKE
FRIENDS OF ISLAND ACADEMY...

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
DON'T TELL ME LIKE I
LIKE IT, IT'S COOL.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
WHY IS IT COOL?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE AND
IT'S NOT LIKE REGULAR SCHOOL.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
HERE A FEEL LIKE, I LEARN MORE.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
ME, I DON'T KNOW
NOBODY HERE LIKE THAT.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
THAT'S WHY I FEEL
LIKE, IT'S BETTER

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
CAUSE EVERYBODY IN
HIGH SCHOOL...

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I KNEW EVERYBODY.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
EVERYBODY WAS ON A
NEGATIVE ATTITUDE,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
NEVER WANTS TO GO TO SCHOOL.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000
DO BAD THINGS SO..

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
EVERYBODY COMES HERE...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
WE ARE ALL JUST
TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
WE ARE NOT FROM
THE SAME PLACES

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
BUT WE BEEN THROUGH
SIMILAR STUFF SO.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
WE THE FUTURE SO I'M
TRYING TO BE LIKE,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
WHEN THE NEXT
GENERATION GROW UP,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I WANT TO BE LIKE, HAVING MY
OWN BUSINESS OR WHATEVER.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
YOU KNOW LIKE, HELPING OTHER
KIDS TRY TO FOLLOW THEY WAY.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
YOU KNOW LEAD THEM LIKE.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
CAUSE THERE WAS NO
MENTORS FOR ME LIKE.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED LIKE,
I HAD TO THINK OF IT MYSELF

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT IT TWICE.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
ANYBODY THINK LIKE
THIS EDUCATION

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
THAT WE GOT AWAY FROM SO
MUCH FOR WHATEVER REASONS,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
FOR WHATEVER HAPPENED,
WE GOT AWAY FROM IT

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
AND THAT ONE THING, IT
SEEMED LIKE THAT EDUCATION,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
THOSE BOOKS AGAIN
SEEMED TO BE LIKE

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
THIS THING THAT'S
GOING TO SAVE US.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
IT'S GOING TO OPEN UP
A WHOLE LOT..

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
IT'S GOING TO
MAKE US SEE.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I NEED AN
EDUCATION LIKE..

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
IT FEELS LIKE A
MIRACLE GOT US...

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
A HOLY THING
GOING ON RIGHT,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
LIKE A SAVIOUR
FOR REAL LIKE.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
IT HELPS YOU IN HERE LIKE
TO DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO LIKE

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000
MR.P SOMETIMES HE BE TRIPPIN BUT
THAT'S MY DUDE RIGHT THERE.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
HE MAKES ME LIKE THINK
TWICE LIKE GET THIS G.E.D.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
HE PUSHING US TO
GET OUR G.E.D.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
IN ANOTHER SCHOOL I WASN'T
EVEN WORRIED ABOUT THAT.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I WOULD JUST SIT IN THE
HALLWAYS AND DO WHAT I DO,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
AND THEN LEAVE OUT THE FRONT OF
THE BUILDING TO DO WHAT I DO.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
BUT HERE IT'S LIKE YOU FEEL GOOD
TO BE IN SCHOOL LIKE BASICALLY.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
FEELS GOOD TO SAY I
LEARNED SOMETHING TODAY.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000
*

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.000
*

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
LIZ SHAW: WE HAVE A LOT OF
DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
THAT WE TRY TO ENGAGE THE
YOUNG PEOPLE IN AFTER SCHOOL,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
AND FAMILY MEETING
IS ONE OF THEM.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
HAPPENS EVERY THURSDAY AT 4:30
AND IT'S JUST AN OPPORTUNITY

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
FOR THEM TO GET
SOME POSITIVE ENERGY.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE
THINGS THAT GOING ON

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
WITH THEM DURING THE WEEK.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
AND JUST REFLECT AND
GO INTO THE WEEKEND

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
WITH A GOOD SPIRIT.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I THINK THERE IS
SOMETHING VERY STRONG

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
WHEN ANOTHER YOUNG
PERSON CAN TELL SOMEONE

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
THAT LOOKS AND RESEMBLES THEM
ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
AND HOW IT CAN IMPACT THEM.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
AND THEN THE REWARDS
THAT COME ABOUT

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
FROM THEM DOING
JUST THAT.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
IF YOU COULD SUM UP
IN ONE WORD FOR ME,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
SOMETHING THAT HE TRIED
TO CONVEY TO YOU,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
WHAT WOULD IT BE?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
CHANGE.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
CHANGE?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
YEA.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
THAT'S GOOD.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
PEER TO PEER EDUCATION
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE
BECAUSE IF NEGATIVE FORCES

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
CAN INFLUENCE A YOUNG
PERSON, THEN OBVIOUSLY

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO
TURN THE TABLES ON THAT.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
SO I THINK THAT'S WHY THE PEER
EDUCATION IS SUCCESSFUL.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
STUFF IS KINDA RUFF
FOR ME RIGHT NOW

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
BUT I LOVE YOU GUYS SO...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
WE LOVE YOU TOO MAN!

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000
* DO IT, DO IT!

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
DANCE INSTRUCTOR:
THROUGHOUT MY LIFETIME,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I USED TO DO THAT
PROFESSIONALLY,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
WHERE I DANCED
FOR CELEBRITIES

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
AND I DONE TOURS AND
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
SO I THOUGHT THAT THE
NEED THAT SINCE I'M HERE

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
AND I LANDED HERE AT
FRIENDS OF ISLAND ACADEMY,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
IT WAS ONLY RIGHT
FOR ME TO BASICALLY

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
GIVE BACK TO THE KIDS.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
TO SHOW SOME OF THE SKILLS
THAT WE HAVE AS FAR AS OUR

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
CULTURE AND THE THINGS THAT WE
DEVELOP ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
SO I FELT IT WAS POSSIBLE
FOR THE KIDS TO LEARN

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
THOSE STEPS AND MOVES WHICH
WILL PLAY A VITAL ROLE,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I'M SURE, IN THEIR
LIFETIME SOMEDAY.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
BOOM UP BOOM.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
MY NAME IS JESSICA BENNETT.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I WAS WITH THIS
AGENCY FOR ABOUT A YEAR.

I WAS PRETTY MUCH YOU KNOW JUST
GETTING INCARCERATED A LOT.

IN AND OUT OF BOOKINGS,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
JUST HANGING AROUND
WITH THE WRONG CROWD.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT I LIVE IN,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
THE ONLY ACTIVITIES THAT'S
AROUND IS PRETTY MUCH NEGATIVE.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
AS YOU KNOW, THE
SELLING DRUGS,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
HAVING SEX FOR
MONEY AS A FEMALE,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
YOU KNOW TRYING TO STAY SO
CALLED "FLY" SHALL I SAY.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
YOU KNOW MONEY DO RULE THE WORLD
SO THE WAY HOW TO GET MONEY,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME

IN NEW YORK CITY,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
HAVING ACTIVITIES WHERE EVER

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
LIKE YOU SEE WHAT I SAID WITH
THE HIP HOP DANCE CREW.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000

THAT YOU WAS INCARCERATED,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
NOW TO BE DOING AUDITIONS

LIKE DANCING I STILL

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I ACTUALLY DO AS AN
EXERCISE IN HOUSE.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
IT'S PRETTY MUCH MY HOBBY
AND NOW I COULD TAKE IT AS

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
SOMETHING PROFESSIONAL
AND IT FEELS KINDA GOOD.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
IT MAKES IT POSITIVE LIKE I'M
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING THAT

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
COULD TAKE ME THROUGH A
JOURNEY IN LIFE.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:15.000
*

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:22.000
*

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
ANSWER QUESTIONS CLEARLY
AND BE INVOLVED

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
WHEN THEY DO ASKED
A QUESTION.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE
ONES I'VE HIGHLIGHTED

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
AND SOME OF THE ONES
WE ARE GONNA GO OVER

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
AFTER WE COMPLETE THE
APPLICATION PROCESS.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
THE HARDEST THING ABOUT
MY JOB IS GETTING

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
THE YOUTH AND THE MEMBERS HERE
TO BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
HAVE A SUCCESSFUL,
PRODUCTIVE LIFE IN SOCIETY.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
THE REAL SECRET TO
SUCCESS IS MAKING THEM

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
THAT'S THE HARDEST PART, GETTING
OVER A LOT OF BAD BARRIERS

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT
THEY'VE GONE THROUGH

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
PRIOR TO COMING HERE.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
AND BREAKING ALL OF THOSE DOWN,
IT TAKES TIME.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
ALONG WITH TAKING TIME, IT ALSO
INVOLVES GIVING THEM TRAINING

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
SO THAT THEY CAN
BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
THEY CAN COMPETE
WITH EVERYBODY.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
BUT THAT'S LIKE CHIPPING
AWAY AT A LITTLE BRICK

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000
AND IT'S HARD FOR
SOME YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
SOME COME AND THEY'RE ABLE TO
ACCEPT IT AND MOVE FORWARD.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I HAVE A LOT OF
HOPE IN MYSELF.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I DIDN'T REALLY.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
THAT'S WHY I NEVER
WENT TO SCHOOL.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I DIDN'T THINK ALL
OF IT MATTERED.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I WAS LIKE, I'M GONNA
GET A JOB

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
BUT THEN I STARTED
REALIZING OH,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
NOBODY'S GONNA HIRE
A DUMMY.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
I MIGHT AS WELL
FINISH SCHOOL,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
GET THE EDUCATION THAT
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
THEN GO SHOOT FOR
A NICE JOB.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
BERYL DAVID: THE PROCEDURE IS
WHEN YOU COME IN HERE,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
WHETHER YOU HAVE A
RESUME, YOU'VE HELD A JOB,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
OR WHATEVER YOU MUST
GO THROUGH THE PROCESS.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
THE PROCESS CONSISTS
OF APPLICATION WRITING,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
MAKING SURE THAT'S THE
ONE THING YOU CAN DO,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
THEN RESUME, MAKING A RESUME.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
THEN AFTER THAT THEY'RE GIVEN
AN INTERVIEW BY MYSELF AND

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
THEN I COULD WORK WITH THE
YOUNGSTER IN TERMS OF SAYING

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
WELL YOU SAID TOO MUCH OR
YOU DIDN'T SAY ENOUGH

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
OR YOU DIDN'T SIT
UP OR WHATEVER.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
THE LAST AND FINAL PART IS
GETTING CLOTHS AND SENDING

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000
THEM TO THE CONTACTS THAT
WE DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
KRYSTAL: I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO FEEL

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
CAUSE I NEVER HAD A JOB
INTERVIEW BEFORE.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I NEVER HAD A JOB.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I NEVER HAD TO WORK FOR
ANYBODY OR DOING ANYTHING LIKE

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
THAT SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO
EXPECT BESIDES A COUPLE OF THE

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
QUESTIONS MISS B. MIGHT
OF ASKED ME BUT..

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
WOW..

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
ME? A JOB INTERVIEW.
OH MAN.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
IT'S GOING TO BE
LIKE CHRISTMAS.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO
BE ABLE TO SLEEP TONIGHT.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
THE FIRST INTERVIEW AND THE
FIRST TIME THAT THEY GO OUT,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
THAT IS WHAT
REALLY ENGAGES THEM.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
THAT'S WHAT REALLY DOES IT.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
THAT OPENS THE DOOR AND
THEY LET IT ALL COME IN NOW.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
THEY FEEL A
LITTLE MORE CONFIDENT.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
THEY CAN BELIEVE THAT THEY
ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
SO INTERVIEWING, THEY COME
BACK HAPPY WITH THAT.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
BUT THE FIRST JOB..

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I TELL YOU I THINK I'M MORE
HAPPY THEN THEY ARE BECAUSE

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
THEY'RE SO EXCITED.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
AND THE JOY THAT YOU SEE AND
THE THRILL OF THEM KNOWING NOW

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I CAN REALLY DO THIS.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I CAN REALLY MAKE SOME MONEY.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
I MEAN IT'S INDESCRIBABLE.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
IT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW
THAT'S KEPT ME HERE

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
FOR AS LONG AS I'VE
BEEN HERE.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
BECAUSE I ENJOY HEARING
AND FEELING THE HAPPINESS

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
AND THE GRATITUDE THAT THEY SHOW
WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:46.000
*

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:58.000
* BIRDS CHIRPING

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
MY NAME IS XIOMARA GARCIA.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I'M A SOCIAL WORKER AT
THE ADOLESCENT PORTABLE

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
THERAPY PROGRAM.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
ADOLESCENT PORTABLE
THERAPY IS A PROGRAM

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
THAT WAS DEVELOPED 5
YEARS AGO TO HELP KIDS

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
IN THE JUVENAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
IT'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY HOME
BASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
CERTIFIED BY THE OASIS
PROGRAM IN NEW YORK STATE.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
SO IT'S PRETTY UNIQUE BECAUSE
WE DO DO THE FAMILY THERAPY

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
COMPONENT AND THE
SUBSTANCE ABUSE

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
SO IT'S NOT JUST WORKING
WITH THE CHILD.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
IT'S WORKING WITH THE FAMILY
AND THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEM.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
THE HOME IS WHERE
EVERYTHING GOES ON.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
THATS KIND OF LIKE THE EPICENTER
OF EVERYTHING AND THE COMMUNITY.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
AND SO WHAT YOU SEE IS
THEY GO FROM FACILITY

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
BACK TO THE COMMUNITY WHERE
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF STRUCTURE.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
THEY'RE BACK IN
THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
THERE IS SOME SORT OF
MISCOMMUNICATION WITH THE

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
PARENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE
ADOLESCENT POINT OF LIFE.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
YOU KNOW THEY'RE TRYING TO BE
WITH THEIR FRIENDS A LOT AND

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
TRYING TO MAKE THEIR
OWN PERSONALITIES

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
AND TRYING TO DECIDE
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
YOU HAVE YOUR FRIENDS THERE,
YOU HAVE YOUR FAMILY

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
AND THERE IS A LOT
MORE PRESSURE.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
SO IT'S NICE TO HAVE A PROGRAM
THAT FOLLOWS THEM THROUGH

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
THE JUVENAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
AND HELPS THEM TRANSITION

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
FROM FACILITY
BACK TO HOME.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.000
HEY!

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
HI!

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
HOW ARE YOU?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
ALRIGHT, HOW YOU DOING.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I'M GOOD.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
IT'S NOT HOT TODAY AS IT
USUALLY IS WHEN I COME HERE.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
NO, I HAVE THE AC
READY FOR YOU .

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
THANK YOU, YOU
KNOW ME ALREADY.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
YOU KNOW THAT I NEED THE AC.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
HEY DYQUAN.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
HOW YOU DOING?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
MY NAME IS PAULA AND I
GOT INVOLVED WITH A.P.T.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
THROUGH A SOCIAL WORKER
AT MY HEALTH CLINIC.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
I JUST HAD SOME CONCERNS.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
MY SON WAS ALREADY IN CUSTODY.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I NEW THAT HE HAD
USED MARIJUANA.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
XIOMARA: ONCE THE KIDS COME
OUT OF FACILITY,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
YOU WORK WITH
THEM FOR 4 MONTHS.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
AND IN THOSE 4 MONTHS
WE DO INTENSIVE FAMILY

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
AND INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE
ABUSE THERAPY.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
WE ARE SEEING THEM ONCE
MAYBE TWICE A WEEK

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
DEPENDING WHAT THE
NEEDS ARE OF THE FAMILY.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
USUALLY ONCE A WEEK.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
WE DO PHONE CHECK-INS,
PHONE SESSIONS,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
AND FROM THAT POINT ON WE ARE
REALLY WORKING WITH THE FAMILY

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
TO HELP CREATE A
SUPPORTIVE SYSTEM.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
ALRIGHT, ENROLL IN
SCHOOL WHICH WE HAVE TO DO.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
YA SO WE'RE GONNA FIGURE THAT
OUT NOW THAT IT'S JULY SO...

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
THERE IS MEET WITH AFTERCARE
WHICH YOU'VE BEEN DOING

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
CONSISTENTLY THE FEWS
WEEKS THAT YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
WHICH HAS BEEN GOOD.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
MEET WITH A.P.T.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
YOU HAVEN'T STOOD
ME UP YET.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
AND WHEN YOU NEEDED
TO CANCEL YOU CALLED

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
WHICH IS EXCELLENT AND
VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
THE END GOAL OF THE FAMILY..

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
IT'S NICE WHEN ARGUMENTS
START DECREASING

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
AND POSITIVE COMMUNICATION
STARTS INCREASING

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
SO MORE USE OF POSITIVE
REENFORCEMENT.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
WHEN THE KIDS AND THE
PARENTS ARE ABLE TO SEE

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
WHAT THE TRIGGER IS
FOR AN ARGUMENT,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
AND STOP IT BEFORE
IT EVEN STARTS,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
AND EITHER WALK AWAY OR
JUST KNOW WHAT IT IS,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
AND THEN COME BACK AND THE
PARTY WOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED
THE FIRST TIME,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
DID YOU KNOW WHERE HE
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE AT

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
OR DID YOU THINK HE
WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
ACTUALLY YES, HE WAS SOMEWHERE
AND HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I WAS GOING OUT WHEN
I WAS LIKE 13 - 14

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
AND IT'S LIKE AFTER
AWHILE I GUESS SHE..

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
CAUSE I WAS AWAY FOR
TWO YEARS SO IT'S LIKE

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
SHE WASN'T USED TO
ME NO MORE.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
LIKE I WASN'T THERE
SO WE DIDN'T REALLY

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
HAVE THAT CONNECTION
NO MORE.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
THE FIRST DRUG TEST USUALLY
CAN BE REALLY NERVE RACKING.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:07.000
THE TEST SO..

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
SO BASICALLY JUST GO IN
AND PEE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
I MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FILL IT UP OR ANYTHING

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
AND THEN WE'LL TAKE
A LOOK.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
XIOMARA: SO IT'S REALLY AN
ANXIETY THAT FORMS.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
YOU FEEL THE TENSION
IN THE HOUSE

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE PARENT
WHO'S KINDA LOOKING

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
AT THE KID SAYING IT
BETTER BE NEGATIVE.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
NO PRESSURE.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF
SUBSTANCE ABUSE THERAPY

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
IS MOST OF THEM USE IT AS
A COPING MECHANISM.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
THEY USE IT TO ESCAPE
THE PROBLEMS AT HOME,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
THE PROBLEMS IN THE
COMMUNITY, PROBLEMS IN SCHOOL,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
WHATEVER THE CASE IS IT'S AN
ESCAPE AND IT'S REALLY GETTING

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
THEM TO SEE THAT THERE
ARE OTHER WAYS TO COPE.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
THERE ARE
HEALTHIER WAYS TO COPE.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
AND GETTING THEM TO
SEE THEIR STRENGTHS.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OK THAT'S FINE.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
ALRIGHT YOU ARE
GONNA PEEL THIS AWAY.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
IN DYQUAN FOR EXAMPLE HE
USED THE MARIJUANA TO COPE

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
WITH FAMILY LIFE,
WITH THE CHANGES,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
WITH 9/11, WITH EVERYTHING.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
FORTUNATELY FOR HIM HE HAS
A STRONG PASSION FOR MUSIC.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
PRODUCING, WRITING.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
I MEAN HE'S REALLY
TALENTED AND SO

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
HIM BEING ABLE TO USE
MUSIC AS AN OUTLET

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
HAS REALLY HELPED HIM SEE THAT
MARIJUANA ISN'T THE KEY.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
AT FIRST WHEN
I WAS UPSTATE.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
WHEN I WAS LOCKED
UP OR WHATEVER.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE
HARD BUT WHEN I CAME HOME,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
AND THE MIND
FRAME I PUT,

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
THE MINDSET I CREATED
FOR MYSELF IS LIKE..

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I CAN'T SEE MYSELF
GOING BACK DOWN THOSE

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
SAME ROADS LIKE
SMOKING AND DRINKING.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
AND I CAN'T SEE
MYSELF DOING THAT.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I'M TRYING TO
BETTER MYSELF NOW.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I GOT HIGH STANDARD FOR
MYSELF NOW.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I JUST CAN'T SEE MYSELF
GOING THOSE ROUTES AGAIN.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
I THINK YOU SEE THE
TWO LINES WITH EACH ONE?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
THAT MEANS THAT
THEY TESTED NEGATIVE.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
HE TESTED NEGATIVE
FOR MARIJUANA USE,

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000
FOR OPIUM, COCAINE
AND AMPHETAMINES.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
GIVE YOURSELF A
ROUND OF APPLAUSE.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
YOUR DOING SOMETHING
BIG SON.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
IT'S A BIG STEP.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000
HOW IS IT FOR YOU
TO FINALLY SEE IT.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY JUST
THE PROOF OF ME NOT SMOKING.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I DON'T LIKE
THE FEELING,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I DON'T LIKE THE
COOLNESS OF IT.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
IT SEEMS THERE IS
NOTHING COOL ABOUT IT.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I DON'T LIKE IT NO MORE.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
XIOMARA: WHEN YOU SEE THOSE
NEGATIVE DRUG TESTS

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
AND YOU SEE THE EXCITEMENT
IN THEIR FACE,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I MEAN THAT IS JUST
ITS A GOOD FEELING.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
TO SEE THEM BE EXCITED FOR
WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
IT'S PROOF THAT I HAVE
NOT BEEN DOING ANYTHING

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
AND IT FEELS GREAT.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
ONCE THE FIRST ONE IS DONE
AND THEY SEE HOW PROUD AND HOW

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
GOOD IT FEELS TO HAVE THAT
NEGATIVE RESULT AND HOW GOOD

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
IT FEELS FOR A PARENT
TO SAY I'M PROUD OF YOU,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
IT KIND OF SETS IT
UP FOR THE NEXT ONE.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I THINK THAT THE
A.P.T. MODEL WORKS,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I REALLY DO BELIEVE IN IT.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH
A FAMILY IN THE HOME,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, TO
REALLY SEE WHAT THEY SEE

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
HELPS US KINDA BUILD GOALS
AND NOT BE UNREALISTIC

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
AND IT HELPS THE FAMILY
TRANSITION AND HELPS THE KIDS

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
TRANSITION FROM FACILITY BACK
HOME AND IT'S ONE LESS THING

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
THAT THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO
AND WE GO TO THEM SO IT'S NICE

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE THERAPY
TO THE PARK ON A NICE DAY OR

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000
STAY IN AN APARTMENT OR
TAKE THEM OUT TO EAT.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
I MEAN THE FLEXIBILITY
HELPS SO MUCH,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
AND JUST HAVING
A PROGRAM

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
THAT HELPS THEM TRANSITION
INTO THE COMMUNITY.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I THINK IT'S A
WONDERFUL THING.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
*YEAH, UH

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
* AHUH UH

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
* SOMETIMES I FEEL TRAPPED
IN THIS WORLD OF CRIME *

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
* WHEN I BOUGHT MYSELF A
MAC AND MY GIRL AND I*

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
* NOT PROMISED TO ANOTHER DAY,
MOTHER SAID A BROTHERS FACE *

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000
* FIRST SON DIED NOW
MOTHERS AT ANOTHER WAKE. *

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000
* MONEY WHO KILLS YOU
SMELLIN IN YOUR MOTHERS FACE. *

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
* WAS YOU RIGHT HAND MAN
TOLD YOU NEVER TRUST A SNAKE. *

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
* WHAT'S THE WHITE MAN'S PLAN
LOCK US IN OUR LONELY GATES. *

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
* FIRST TRIP IS TO BOOK US TO
AL AND THEN YOU GO UPSTATE. *

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.000
* C.E.O. IS MORE RACISTS
THAN CLAN MEMBERS. *

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
* (UNINTELLIGIBLE)
CRAZY THEY HAND SLIT UP. *

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
* THOUGH YOU IN A BOX SO SMALL
THAT YOU CAN'T GET UP. *

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000
* SLIDE YOUR FOOD UNDER
THE DOOR, THIS MEANS WAR. *

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
* TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT....
