00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.130


2
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.170
Help, Grandsire, help!

3
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.830
My aunt Lavinia follows meeverywhere.

4
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.570
I know not why.

5
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.530
Good uncle Marcus, see howswift she comes.

6
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.730
Alas, sweet aunt, I knownot what you mean.

7
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.830
Stand by me, Lucius.

8
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.070
Do not fear thine aunt.

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.970
She loves thee, boy, toowell to do thee harm.

10
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.800
Ay, when my father was inRome, she did.

11
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.830
What means my nieceLavinia by these signs?

12
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.500
Fear her not, Lucius;somewhat does she mean.

13
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.270
See, Lucius, see how muchshe makes of thee.

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.070
Somewhither would she havethee go with her.

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.300
Ah, boy, Cornelia neverwith more care

16
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.730
read to her sons than shehath read to thee

17
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.270
sweet poetry and Tully'sorator.

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.200
Canst thou not guesswherefore she plies theethus?

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.030
My lord, I know not, I,nor can I guess,

20
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.170
unless some fit or frenzydo possess her.

21
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.870
For I have heard mygrandsire say full oft

22
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.330
extremities of grief wouldmake men mad.

23
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.270
And I have read thatHecuba of Troy ran madfor sorrow.

24
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.130
That made me to fear.

25
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.330
Although, my lord, I knowmy noble aunt

26
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.230
loves me as dear as e'ermy mother did

27
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.930
and would not but in furyfright my youth,

28
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.500
which made me down tothrow my books and fly

29
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900
causeless, perhaps.

30
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.800
But pardon me, sweet aunt.

31
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.030
And, madam, if my uncleMarcus go,

32
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.200
I will most willinglyattend your ladyship.

33
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.300
Lucius, I will.

34
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.770
How now, Lavinia.

35
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.230
Marcus, what means this?

36
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.630
Some book there is thatshe desires to see.

37
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.530
Which is it, girl, ofthese?

38
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.700
Open them, boy.

39
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.700
But thou art deeper readand better skilled.

40
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.030
Come and take choice ofall my library,

41
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.570
and so beguile thy sorrow,till the heavens reveal

42
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.030
the damned contriver ofthis deed.

43
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.970
Why lifts she up her armsin sequence thus?

44
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.700
I think she means thatthere were

45
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.730
more than one confederatein the fact.

46
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.000
Ay, more there was;

47
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
or else to heaven sheheaves them for revenge.

48
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.070
Lucius, what book is thatshe tosseth so?

49
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.670
Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's"Metamorphoses."

50
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.970
My mother gave it me.

51
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.070
For love of her that'sgone,

52
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.730
perhaps she culled it fromamong the rest.

53
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.970
Soft.

54
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.500
So busily she turns theleaves.

55
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.270
What would she find?

56
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.330
Help her.

57
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.700
Lavinia, shall I read?

58
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.370
This is the tragic tale ofPhilomel

59
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.630
and treats of Tereus'treason and his rape.

60
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.600
And rape, I fear, was rootof thy annoy.

61
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.100
See, brother, see.

62
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.870
Note how she quotes theleaves.

63
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.830
Lavinia, were thou thussurprised, sweet girl,

64
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.430
ravished and wronged asPhilomela was,

65
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.030
forced in the vast andruthless, gloomy woods?

66
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.570
Ay, see, see.

67
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.870
Such a place there iswhere we did hunt

68
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.330
O, had we never, neverhunted there!

69
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.400
patterned by this the poethere describes,

70
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.870
by nature made for murdersand for rapes.

71
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.130
O, why should nature buildso foul a den,

72
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.600
unless the gods delight intragedies?

73
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.630
Give signs, sweet girl, forhere are none but friends,

74
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.500
what Roman lord it wasdurst do the deed.

75
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.670
Or slunk not Saturnine, asTarquin erst,

76
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.070
that left the camp to sinin Lucrece' bed?

77
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.330
Sit down, sweet niece.

78
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.500
Brother, sit down with me.

79
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.070
Apollo, Pallas, Jove, andMercury,

80
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.570
inspire me, that I maythis treason find.

81
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.530
My lord, look here.

82
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.700
Look here, Lavinia.

83
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.570
This sandy plot is plain.

84
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.030
Guide, if thou canst, thisafter me.

85
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.170
I have writ my name

86
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.830
without the help of anyhand at all.

87
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.800
Cursed be the heart thatforced us to this shift.

88
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.030
Write thou, good niece,and here display at last

89
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.770
what God will havediscovered for revenge.

90
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.530
Heaven guide thy pen toprint thy sorrows plain,

91
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.670
that we may know thetraitors and the truth.

92
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.630
Do you read, my lord, whatshe hath writ?

93
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.530
"Rape."

94
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.030
"Chiron."

95
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.130
"Demetrius."

96
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:41.200
Magni Dominator poli, Tamlentus audis scelera?

97
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.100
Tam lentus vides?

98
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.570
O, calm thee, gentle lord,

99
00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.700
although I know there isenough written upon this earth

100
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.030
to stir a mutiny in themildest thoughts

101
00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.300
and arm the minds ofinfants to exclaims.

102
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.300
Kneel down with me.

103
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.870
Lavinia, kneel.

104
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.100
And kneel, sweet boy, theRoman Hector's hope

105
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.730
and swear with me  as withthe woeful fere

106
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.630
and father of that chaste,dishonored dame,

107
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.170
Lord Junius Brutus swarefor Lucrece's rape

108
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.330
that we will prosecute bygood advice

109
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.670
mortal revenge upon thesetraitorous Goths

110
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.630
and see their blood or diewith this reproach.

111
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:29.000
'Tis sure enough, and youknew how.

112
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.600
But if you hunt thesebear-whelps, then beware.

113
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.870
The dam will wake; and ifshe wind ye once,

114
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.800
she's with the lion deeplystill in league

115
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.000
and lulls him while sheplayeth on her back.

116
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.570
And when he sleeps willshe do what she list.

117
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.030
You are a young huntsman,Marcus; let alone.

118
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.370
Come.

119
00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.870
I will go get a leaf of brassand with a gad of steel

120
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.900
will write these words andlay it by.

121
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.770
The angry northern windwill blow these sands

122
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.370
like Sibyl's leavesabroad.

123
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.700
And where's our lessonthen?

124
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.100
Boy, what say you?

125
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.600
I say, my lord, that if Iwere a man,

126
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.630
their mother's bedchambershould not be safe

127
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.230
for these base bondmen tothe yoke of Rome.

128
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.430
Ay, there's my boy.

129
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.800
Thy father hath full oft

130
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.700
for his ungrateful countrydone the like.

131
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.270
And, uncle, so will I, andif I live.

132
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.930
Come, go with me into minearmory.

133
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.430
Lucius, I'll fit thee, andmy boy withal

134
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.000
shall carry from me to theempress' sons

135
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.230
presents that I intend tosend them both.

136
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:41.630
Come, come; thou'lt do mymessage, wilt thou not?

137
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.200
Ay, and with my dagger intheir bosoms, Grandsire.

138
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.200
No, boy, not so.

139
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.830
I'll teach thee anothercourse.

140
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.470
Lavinia, come.

141
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.430
Marcus, look to my house.

142
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:59.100
Lucius and I'll go braveit at the court.

143
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.300
Ay, marry, will we, sir,and we'll be waited on.

144
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.230
O, heavens, can you hear agood man groan

145
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.730
and not relent and notcompassion him?

146
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.400
Marcus, attend him in hisecstasy

147
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.000
that hath more scars ofsorrow in his heart

148
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.470
than foemen's marks uponhis battered shield,

149
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.630
and yet so just that hewill not revenge.

150
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.970
Revenge the heavens forold Andronicus.

151
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:55.070
Demetrius, here's the sonof Lucius.

152
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.800
He hath some message todeliver us.

153
00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.530
Ay, some mad message fromhis mad grandfather.

154
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.800
My lords, with all thehumbleness I may,

155
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.770
I greet your honors fromAndronicus

156
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.830
and pray the Roman godsconfound you both.

157
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.300
Gramercy, lovely Lucius.

158
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.930
What's the news?

159
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.070
That you are bothdeciphered that's the news

160
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.370
for villains marked withrape.

161
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.370
May it please you, mygrandsire,

the goodliest weapons ofhis armory

164
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.870
to gratify your honorableyouth,

165
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.500
the hope of Rome, for sohe bid me say.

166
00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.030
And so I do, and with hisgifts present

167
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.870
Your Lordships, thatwhenever you have need,

168

169
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.430
And so I leave you both...

170
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.800
like bloody villains.

171
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.370
What's here?

172
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.430
A scroll, and writtenround about.

173
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.570
Let's see.

174
00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:53.670
"Integer vitae,scelerisque purus,

175
00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:02.470
non eget Mauri iaculis,nec arcu."

176
00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.630
O, 'tis a verse in Horace.

177
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.830
I know it well.

178
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.830
I read it in the grammarlong ago.

179
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.900
Ay, just  A verse inHorace.

180
00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.600
Right, you have it.

181
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.830
Now, what a thing it is tobe an ass.

182
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.400
Here's no sound jest.

183
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.600
The old man hath foundtheir guilt

184
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.370
and sends them weaponswrapped about with lines

185
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.230
that wound, beyond theirfeeling, to the quick.

186
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.970
But were our witty empresswell afoot,

187
00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:34.170
she would applaudAndronicus' conceit.

188
00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:38.230
But let her rest in herunrest awhile.

189
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:43.400
And now, young lords,was't not a happy star

190
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.370
led us to Rome, strangers,

191
00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:47.130
and more than so captives

192
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.870
to be advanced to thisheight?

193
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.470
It doth me good to see sogreat a lord

194
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.730
basely insinuate and sendus gifts.

195
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.300
Had he not reason, LordDemetrius?

196
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.330
Did you not use hisdaughter very friendly?

197
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.100
I would we had a thousandRoman dames

198
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.730
at such a bay, by turn toserve our lust.

199
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.430
A charitable wish, andfull of love.

200
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.870
Here lacks but your motherfor to say amen.

201
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.700
And would she for twentythousand more.

202
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.430
Come, let us go and prayto all the gods

203
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.630
for our beloved mother inher pains.

204
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.400
Pray to the devils; thegods have given us over.

205
00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.670
Why do the emperor'strumpets flourish thus?

206
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.630
Belike, for joy theemperor hath a son.

207
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.230
Soft. Who comes here?

208
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.100
O, tell me, did you seeAaron the Moor?

209
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.630
Well, more or less, orne'er a whit at all,

210
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.330
here Aaron is; and whatwith Aaron now?

211
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.770
O, gentle Aaron, we areall undone.

212
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.000
Now help, or woe betidethee evermore.

213
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.800
Why, what a caterwaulingdost thou keep.

214
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.830
What dost thou wrap andfumble in thy arms?

215
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.770
O, that which I would hidefrom heaven's eye.

216
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:59.530
Our empress' shame andstately Rome's disgrace.

217
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.400
She is delivered, lords;she is delivered.

218
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.730
To whom?

219
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.730
I mean she is broughtabed.

220
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:06.930
Well, God give her goodrest.

221
00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.030
What hath he sent her?

222
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.130
A devil.

223
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.730
Why, then she is thedevil's dam;

224
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.070
a joyful issue.

225
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.800
A joyless, dismal, black,and sorrowful issue.

226
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.800
Here is the babe, asloathsome as a toad

227
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.800
amongst the fair-facedbreeders of our clime.

228
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.400
The empress sends it thee thy stamp, thy seal

229
00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.530
and bids thee christen itwith thy dagger's point.

230
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.900
Zounds, ye whore!

231
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.970
Is black so base a hue?

232
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.600
Sweet blowse,

233
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.700
you are a beauteousblossom sure.

234
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.270
Villain, what hast thoudone?

235
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.430
That which thou canst notundo.

236
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.470
Thou hast undone ourmother.

237
00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.630
Villain, I have done thymother.

238
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.100
And therein, hellish dog,hast thou undone her.

239
00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:09.100
Woe to her chance,

240
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.470
Damned her loathed choice.

241
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.870
Accursed the offspring ofso foul a fiend.

242
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.030
It shall not live.

243
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:17.130
It shall not die.

244
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.330
Aaron, it must; the motherwills it so.

245
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:21.870
What, must it, nurse?

246
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.900
Then let no man but I doexecution

247
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.200
on my flesh and blood.

248
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.370
I'll broach the tadpole onmy rapier's point.

249
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.500
Nurse, give it to me!

250
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.300
My sword shall soondispatch it.

251
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.600
Sooner this sword shallplough thy bowels up!

252
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:39.830
Stay, murderous villains;will you kill your brother!

253
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.100
Now, by the burning tapersof the sky

254
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.000
that shone so brightlywhen this boy was got,

255
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.870
he dies upon my scimitar'ssharp point

256
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.400
that touches this, myfirst-born son and heir.

257
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.670
I tell you, younglings,not Enceladus,

258
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.470
with all his threateningband of Typhon's brood,

259
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:02.000
nor great Alcides, nor thegod of war,

260
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.930
shall seize this prey outof his father's hands.

261
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:17.000
What, what, ye sanguine,shallow-hearted boys

262
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.870
ye white-limed walls, yealehouse painted signs!

263
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.570
Coal-black is better thananother hue

264
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.300
in that it scorns to bearanother hue.

265
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.900
For all the water in theocean

266
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.970
can never turn the swan'sblack legs to white,

267
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.630
although she lave themhourly in the flood.

268
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:46.870
Tell the empress from me, Iam of age to keep mine own;

269
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:48.730
excuse it how she can.

270
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.900
Wilt thou betray thy noblemistress thus?

271
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:58.000
My mistress is mymistress, this my self

272
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.430
the vigor and the pictureof my youth.

273
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:06.000
This before all the worlddo I prefer.

274
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.600
This maugre all the worldwill I keep safe,

275
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.400
or some of you shall smokefor it in Rome.

276
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.670
By this our mother is forever shamed.

277
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.670
Rome will despise her forthis foul escape.

278
00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.430
The emperor in his ragewill doom her death.

279
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:25.930
I blush to think upon thisignomy.

280
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.230
Why, there's the privilegeyour beauty bears.

281
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.330
Fie, treacherous hue, thatwill betray with blushing

282
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.400
the close enacts andcounsels of thy heart.

283
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.270
Here's a young lad framedof another leer.

284
00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:43.530
Look how the black slavesmiles upon the father,

285
00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.000
as who should say, "Oldlad, I am thine own."

286
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.570
He is your brother, lords,sensibly fed

287
00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.300
of that self-blood thatfirst gave life to you;

288
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.800
and from your womb whereyou imprisoned were,

289
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.100
he is enfranchised andbrought to light.

290
00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.400
Nay, he is your brother bythe surer side,

291
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.670
although my seal bestamped in his face.

292
00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.730
Aaron, what shall I sayunto the empress?

293
00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:18.170
Advise thee, Aaron, whatis to be done,

294
00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:21.270
and we will all subscribeto thy advice.

295
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.600
Save thou the child, so wemay all be safe.

296
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.330
Then sit we down and letus all consult.

297
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.170
My son and I will have thewind of you.

298
00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.170
Keep there.

299
00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.970
Now talk at pleasure ofyour safety.

300
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.630
How many women saw thischild of his?

301
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.230
Why, so, brave lords

302
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.670
When we join in league, Iam a lamb.

303
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.700
But if you brave the Moor,

304
00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.470
the chafed boar, themountain lioness,

305
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:05.470
the ocean swells not so asAaron storms.

306
00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:09.670
But say again, how manysaw the child?

307
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.730
Cornelia the midwife andmyself,

308
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.000
and no one else but thedelivered empress.

309
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.370
The empress, the midwife,and yourself.

310
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:21.400
Two may keep counsel whenthe third's away.

311
00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.570
Go to the empress; tellher this I said.

312
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:34.570
Weeke, weeke!

313
00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:37.000
So cries a pig prepared tothe spit.

314
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.270
What mean'st thou, Aaron?Wherefore didst thou this?

315
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.370
O, Lord, sir, 'tis a deedof policy.

316
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.030
Shall she live to betraythis guilt of ours,

317
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:46.800
a long-tongued babblinggossip?

318
00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.200
No, lords, no.

319
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.030
And now be it known to youmy full intent.

320
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.130
Not far, one Muliteus, mycountryman.

321
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:55.230
His wife but yesternightwas brought to bed.

322
00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.230
His child is like to her,fair as you are.

323
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.830
Go pack with him, give themother gold

324
00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.000
and tell them both thecircumstance of all,

325
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.530
and how by this theirchild shall be advanced

326
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.300
and be received for theemperor's heir

327
00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.270
and substituted in theplace of mine

328
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.970
to calm this tempestwhirling in the court;

329
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:14.630
and let the emperor dandlehim for his own.

330
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.630
Hark ye, lords.

331
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:21.730
You see I have given herphysic.

332
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:24.200
And you must needs bestowher funeral.

333
00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.530
The fields are near, andyou are gallant grooms.

334
00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:29.300
This done, see that youtake no longer days,

335
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.800
but send the midwife to mepresently.

336
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.970
The midwife and the nursewell made away,

337
00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.670
then let the ladies tattlewhat they please.

338
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:45.070
Aaron, I see thou wilt nottrust the air with secrets.

339
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.100
For this care of Tamora,

340
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.670
herself and hers arehighly bound to thee.

341
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.670
Now to the Goths, as swiftas swallow flies,

342
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.570
there to dispose thistreasure in mine arms

343
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.000
and secretly to greet theempress' friends.

344
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.930
Come on, you thick-lippedslave.

345
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.430
I'll bear you hence;

346
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.530
for it is you that puts usto our shifts.

347
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.800
I'll make you feed onberries and on roots

348
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.800
and feed on curds and wheyand suck the goat

349
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.370
and cabin in a cave andbring you up

350
00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.830
to be a warrior andcommand a camp.

351
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:01.300
Come, Marcus, come.

352
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.030
Kinsmen, this is the way.

353
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.830
Sir boy, let me see yourarchery.

354
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.330
Look you draw home enough,and 'tis there straight.

355
00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:30.170
The goddess of justice hasleft the earth.

356
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:33.270
Be you remembered, Marcus:she's gone, she's fled.

357
00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.970
Sirs, take you to yourtools.

358
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.000
You, cousins,

359
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.170
shall so sound the ocean,cast your nets.

360
00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.630
Happily you may catch herin the sea.

361
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.530
Well, there's as littlejustice as at land.

362
00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:56.300
No; Publius and Sempronius,you must do it.

363
00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.070
'Tis you must dig; withmattock and with spade,

364
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.300
pierce the inmost centreof the earth.

365
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.830
Then, when you come toPluto's region,

366
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:04.730
I pray you, deliver himthis petition.

367
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:08.700
Tell him it is for justiceand for aid

368
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.930
and that it comes from oldAndronicus,

369
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.070
shaken with sorrows inungrateful Rome.

370
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.100
O, Rome.

371
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.730
Well, well, I made theemiserable

372
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.070
that time I threw thepeople's suffrages

373
00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:30.270
on him that now dothtyrannize o'er me.

374
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.200
Go get you gone, and praybe careful all.

375
00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.600
Leave you not oneman-of-war unsearched.

376
00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.670
This wicked emperor mayhave shipped her hence;

377
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.500
then kinsmen, we may gopipe for justice.

378
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:53.130
Publius, is not this aheavy case,

379
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.170
to see thy noble unclethus distract?

380
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.470
Therefore, my lords, ithighly us concerns

381
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.900
by day and night to attendhim carefully

382
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.870
and feed his humor kindlyas we may

383
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.870
till time beget somecareful remedy.

384
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.730
My son, his sorrows arepast remedy.

385
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:09.000
Join with the Goths, andwith revengeful war

386
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.870
take wreak on Rome forthis ingratitude,

387
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.900
and vengeance on thetraitor Saturnine.

388
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.000
Publius, how now?

389
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.100
How now, my masters?

390
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.030
What, have you met withher?

391
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.470
No, my good lord. butPluto sends you word,

392
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.800
if you will have Revengein hell, you shall.

393
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.400
Marry, for Justice, she isso employed, he thinks,

394
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.270
with Jove in heaven, orsomewhere else,

395
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.470
so that perforce you mustneeds stay a time.

396
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:33.570
He doth me wrong to feedme with delays.

397
00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:35.930
I'll dive into the burninglake below

398
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.170
and pull her out ofAcheron by the heels.

399
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:52.770
Marcus, we are but shrubs,no cedars we,

400
00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:57.170
no big-boned men framed ofthe cyclops' size.

401
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:04.900
But metal, Marcus, steelto the very back,

402
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:08.370
yet wrung with wrongs morethan our backs can bear.

403
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:13.630
And, sith there is nojustice in earth or hell,

404
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:18.500
we will solicit heaven,move the gods

405
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.130
to send down justice forto wreak our wrongs.

406
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.970
Come, to this gear.

407
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.530
You are a good archer,Marcus.

408
00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.100
"Ad Jovem " that's foryou.

409
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.230
Here "Ad Apollinem."

410
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.770
"Ad Martem " that's formyself.

411
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.730
Here, boy, "To Pallas."

412
00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.700
Here "To Mercury."

413
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.070
"To Saturn," Caius  not toSaturnine.

414
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.000
You were as good to shootagainst the wind.

415
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:52.770
Come to it, boy.

416
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.530
Marcus, loose when I bid.

417
00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:02.330
Of my word, I have writtento effect.

418
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.470
There's not a god leftunsolicited.

419
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.230
Kinsmen, shoot all yourshafts into the court.

420
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.570
We will afflict theemperor in his pride.

421
00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.270
Now, masters,

422
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.330
draw.

423
00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.200
Well done, Lucius!

424
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.830
My lord, I aimed a milebeyond the moon.

425
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.430
Your letter is withJupiter by this.

426
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.900
Why, there it goes.

427
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.000
God give his lordship joy.

428
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:53.930
News, news from heaven.

429
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:55.600
Marcus, the post is come.

430
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.730
Sirrah, what tidings?

431
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.900
Have you any letters?

432
00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.000
Shall I have justice?

433
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.530
What says Jupiter?

434
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.070
Oh, the gibbet-maker?

435
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.170
He says that he hath takenthem down again,

436
00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.800
for the man must not behanged till the next week.

437
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.730
But what says Jupiter, Iask thee?

438
00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:16.800
Alas, sir, I know notJupiter.

439
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.100
I never drank with him inall my life.

440
00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.530
Why, villain, art not thouthe carrier?

441
00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:26.000
Ay, of my pigeons, sir;nothing else.

442
00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:32.770
Why, didst thou not comefrom heaven?

443
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.530
From heaven?

444
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.370
Alas, sir, no, I nevercame there.

445
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.230
God forbid I should be sobold

446
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.570
to press to heaven in myyoung days.

447
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:44.470
Why, I am going with mypigeons

448
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.130
to the Tribunal Plebs, totake up a matter

449
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:50.830
of brawl betwixt my uncle andone of the imperial's men.

450
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.800
Why, sir, this is as fitas can be

451
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.200
to serve you for youroration.

452
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.700
Let him deliver the pigeons tothe emperor from you.

453
00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.470
Can you deliver an orationto the emperor with a grace?

454
00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.200
Nay, truly, sir.

455
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.730
I could never say grace inall my life.

456
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.200
Come hither, sirrah.

457
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.630
Make no more ado, but giveyour pigeons to the emperor.

458
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.870
By me thou shalt havejustice at his hands.

459
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:19.730
Hold, hold.

460
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.730
Here is money for yourcharges.

461
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.530
Sirrah, can you with a gracedeliver up a supplication?

462
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.100
Ay, sir.

463
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.130
Then here is asupplication for you.

464
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.370
And when you come to him,

465
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.930
at the first approach, youmust kneel,

466
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.130
and then kiss his foot,

467
00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.500
and then deliver up yourpigeons,

468
00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.330
and then look for yourreward.

469
00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.470
I'll be at hand, sir; seeyou do it bravely.

470
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.870
I warrant you, sir, Iwill.

471
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.470
Sirrah, hast thou a knife?

472
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:53.400
Ay, sir.

473
00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.200
Well, let me see it.

474
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.370
Here, Marcus, fold it inthe oration;

475
00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.600
for thou hast made it likean humble suppliant.

476
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.400
And when you have given itto the emperor,

477
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.870
knock at my door; tell mewhat he says.

478
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.270
God be with you, sir; Iwill.

479
00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.330
Come, Marcus, come.

480
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.330
Publius, follow me.

481
00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.800
Why, lords, what wrongsare these!

482
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:51.100
Was ever seen an emperorin Rome

483
00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:55.400
thus overborne, troubled,confronted thus and,

484
00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:00.500
for the extent of egal justice,used in such contempt?

485
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.070
My lords, you know, asknow the mightful gods,

486
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.670
however these disturbersof our peace

487
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.800
buzz in the people's ears,there nought hath passed

488
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:10.730
but even with law againstthe wilful sons

489
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.400
of old Andronicus.

490
00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.930
And what and if hissorrows have sooverwhelmed his wits?

491
00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.370
Shall we be thus afflictedin his wreaks,

492
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.300
his fits, his frenzy, andhis bitterness?

493
00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:27.070
And now he writes toheaven for his redress.

494
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:31.200
See, here's "To Jove,"

495
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.330
and this "To Mercury."

496
00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.230
This "To Apollo,"

497
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:40.330
this "To the God of War."

498
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:44.630
Sweet scrolls to fly aboutthe streets of Rome!

499
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.830
What's this but libellingagainst the Senate

500
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.770
and blazoning ourinjustice everywhere?

501
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:53.130
A goodly humor, is it not,my lords,

502
00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.100
as who would say in Romeno justice were?

503
00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:00.470
But if I live, his feignedecstasies

504
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.830
shall be no shelter tothese outrages;

505
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:05.770
but he and his shall knowthat justice lives

506
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:08.970
in Saturninus' health,whom, if she sleep,

507
00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.400
he'll so awake as he infury

508
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.630
shall cut off the proudestconspirator that lives.

509
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:27.700
My gracious lord, mylovely Saturnine,

510
00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.400
lord of my life, commanderof my thoughts,

511
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.970
calm thee, and bear thefaults of Titus' age,

512
00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.670
the effects of sorrow forhis valiant sons

513
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.000
whose loss hath pierced himdeep and scarred his heart;

514
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.430
and rather comfort hisdistressed plight

515
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:47.700
than prosecute the meanest orthe best for these contempts.

516
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.970
Why, thus it shall becomehigh-witted Tamora

517
00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:59.770
to gloze with all.

518
00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:02.330
But Titus, I have touchedthee to the quick,

519
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.400
thy life-blood out.

520
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.130
If Aaron now be wise, thenall is safe,

521
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.800
the anchor in the port.

522
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.900
How now, good fellow.

523
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.270
Wouldst thou speak withus?

524
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:18.200
Yea, forsooth, and yourmistership be imperial.

525
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.300
Empress I am, but yondersits the emperor.

526
00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.130
'Tis he.

527
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.600
God and Saint Stephen giveyou godden.

528
00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.530
I have brought you aletter and a couple ofpigeons here.

529
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.530
Go take him away, and hanghim presently.

530
00:31:42.530 --> 00:31:46.130
How much money must Ihave?

531
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.170
Come, sirrah; you must behanged.

532
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.000
Hanged by our lady?

533
00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.100
Then I have brought up aneck to a fair end.

534
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.430
Despiteful and intolerablewrongs!

535
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:04.930
Shall I endure thismonstrous villainy?

536
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:08.030
I know from whence thissame device proceeds.

537
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.600
May this be borne  as ifhis traitorous sons

538
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.970
that died by law formurder of our brother

539
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:16.100
have by my means beenbutchered wrongfully?

540
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.400
Go drag the villain hitherby the hair.

541
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.400
Nor age nor honor shallshape privilege.

542
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.970
For this proud mock, I'llbe thy slaughterman,

543
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:29.530
sly frantic wretch, thatholp'st to make me great,

544
00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:32.770
in hope thyself shouldgovern Rome and me.

545
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.800
What news with thee,Aemilius?

546
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.600
Arm, my lords!

547
00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.770
Rome never had more cause.

548
00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:40.770
The Goths have gatheredhead,

549
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.470
and with a power of highresolved men bent to the spoil,

550
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.870
they hither march amain,under conduct of Lucius,

551
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:49.870
son to old Andronicus, whothreats in course of hisrevenge

552
00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:52.630
to do as much as everCoriolanus did.

553
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:58.330
Is warlike Lucius generalof the Goths?

554
00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:02.270
These tidings nip me, andI hang the head

555
00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:09.300
as flowers with frost, orgrass beat down withstorms.

556
00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:16.770
Ay, now begins our sorrowsto approach.

557
00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:21.170
'Tis he the common peoplelove so much.

558
00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:22.770
Myself hath often heardthem say

559
00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:24.370
when I have walked like aprivate man

560
00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:26.030
that Lucius' banishmentwas wrongfully,

561
00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.270
and they have wished thatLucius were their emperor.

562
00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:29.370
Why should you fear?

563
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.830
Is not your city strong?

564
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.530
Ay, but the citizens favorLucius

565
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.300
and will revolt from me tosuccor him.

566
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.530
King, be thy thoughtsimperious like thy name.

567
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:43.400
Is the sun dimmed, thatgnats do fly in it?

568
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.830
The eagle suffers littlebirds to sing

569
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.970
and is not careful whatthey mean thereby,

570
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.800
knowing that with theshadow of his wings

571
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.270
he can at pleasure stinttheir melody.

572
00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:58.130
Even so mayest thou thegiddy men of Rome.

573
00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:02.130
Then cheer thy spirit; forknow thou, Emperor,

574
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.770
I will enchant the oldAndronicus

575
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.400
with words more sweet andyet more dangerous

576
00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.800
than baits to fish orhoney-stalks to sheep,

577
00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.700
when as the one is woundedwith the bait,

578
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.570
the other rotted withdelicious feed.

579
00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:17.100
But he will not entreathis son for us.

580
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.070
If Tamora entreat him,then he will;

581
00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:22.430
for I can smooth and fillhis aged ears

582
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:25.730
with golden promises,that, were his heart

583
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.070
almost impregnable, hisold ears deaf,

584
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.630
yet should both ear andheart obey my tongue.

585
00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.370
Go thou before.

586
00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:35.000
Be our ambassador.

587
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.130
Say that the emperorrequests a parley

588
00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.330
of warlike Lucius, andappoint the meeting

589
00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:44.900
even at his father'shouse, the old Andronicus.

590
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.970
Aemilius, do this messagehonorably.

591
00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:50.470
And if he stand on hostagefor his safety,

592
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:52.930
bid him demand what pledgewill please him best.

593
00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:56.530
Your bidding shall I doeffectually.

594
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.830
Now will I to that oldAndronicus,

595
00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:01.600
and temper him with allthe art I have

596
00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.070
to pluck proud Lucius fromthe warlike Goths.

597
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:09.530
And now, sweet emperor, beblithe again

598
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.930
and bury all thy fears inmy devices.

599
00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.230
Then go incessantly, andplead to him.

600
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:29.930
