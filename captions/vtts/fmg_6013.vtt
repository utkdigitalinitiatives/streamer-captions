00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.960
ONE OF THE MAJOR
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HUMANS

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.060
AND OTHER ANIMALS IS
OUR GREATER ABILITY

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.030
TO MAKE USE OF
SENSORY INFORMATION

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.860
THAT WE TAKE IN FROM
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.160
NEWBORN BABIES DON'T
APPEAR TO BE VERY AWARE

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.700
OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.800
THEY SPEND UP TO 20
HOURS A DAY SLEEPING,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.430
AND WHEN THEY'RE
NOT SLEEPING

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.200
THEY'RE EATING OR
HAVING ONE OF THEIR

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.230
OTHER BODILY
NEEDS ATTENDED TO.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.200
THE COMMUNICATION CONSISTS
ALMOST ENTIRELY OF CRYING

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.400
AND GURGLING AND THEY'RE
TOTALLY DEPENDENT ON

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.500
ANOTHER PERSON FOR
THEIR SURVIVAL.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.460
HOWEVER, IF WE LOOK MORE
CLOSELY WE FIND THAT

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.060
NEONATES, AS NEWBORNS
ARE SOMETIMES CALLED,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.060
HAVE VERY
STRONG REFLEXES.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.160
YOU CAN TEST SOME OF
THESE FOR YOURSELF.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.730
ANYTHING PUT IN THEIR HAND
WILL BE FIRMLY GRASPED,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.000
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.300
IT'S SAID THE GRASPING
REFLEX IS SO STRONG

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.660
THAT A NEWBORN CAN BE
HUNG FROM A WASHING LINE.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.100
I DON'T THINK WE'LL PUT
THAT TO THE TEST RIGHT NOW.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.230
THE SAME REFLEX CAN BE
SEEN IN THE TOES AND FEET

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.330
AT BIRTH.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.330
THE INNATE ROOTING
REFLEX OCCURS IN

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.330
THE NEONATE'S CHEEK
IF IT'S TOUCHED.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.130
THIS ALLOWS THE BABY TO
FIND THE NIPPLE OR BOTTLE

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.400
AND THERE'S A VERY
STRONG SUCKING REFLEX

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.960
PRESENT AT BIRTH.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.060
THESE REFLEXES DON'T LAST
FOREVER, OF COURSE, AND

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.960
START TO BECOME VOLUNTARY
DURING CHILDHOOD.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.630
BABIES ARE ALSO BORN
WITH SENSORY REFLEXES.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.360
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY
CAN FIX THEIR GAZE...

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.960
AND THEY'LL FOLLOW
A MOVING OBJECT.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.200
OTHER SENSES SUCH AS TASTE
AND HEARING HAVE RECENTLY

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.060
BEEN SHOWN TO BE NOT ONLY
PRESENT AT BIRTH BUT ALSO

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.700
DEVELOP VERY RAPIDLY IN
THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF LIFE.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.960
ANN, FOR EXAMPLE, AT THREE
WEEKS WILL BE ABLE TO

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.860
DISCRIMINATE HER MOTHER BY
HER VOICE AND BY HER LOOKS.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.160
<i>CAN'T YOU?</i>

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.830
<i>YES.</i>

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.600
ALL THE PHYSICAL AND
MENTAL EXPERIENCES

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.130
YOUNG BABIES HAVE ARE USED
TO DEVELOP MORE COMPLEX

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.560
WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING
THE WORLD AROUND THEM.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.400
THIS IS COGNITIVE
DEVELOPMENT.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.630
HOW THIS DEVELOPMENT
OF UNDERSTANDING OCCURS

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.500
HAS BEEN AND
CONTINUES TO BE

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.160
THE SOURCE OF
MUCH RESEARCH.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.160
JEAN PIAGET WAS BY FAR THE
MOST INFLUENTIAL FIGURE

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.260
IN THIS AREA OF PSYCHOLOGY
AND HIS THEORY HAS SHAPED

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.330
THE CHILD-REARING AND
EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.930
OF THE WESTERN WORLD.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.900
PIAGET WAS BORN IN
SWITZERLAND IN 1896

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.930
AND DIED IN 1980.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.900
FOR MANY YEARS HIS WORK
WAS VERY UNFASHIONABLE

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.100
IN PSYCHOLOGY.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.400
THE BEHAVIORIST APPROACH
DOMINATED PSYCHOLOGICAL

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.260
RESEARCH WELL INTO THE
1950'S AND THIS RULED OUT

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.630
MUCH INTEREST IN THE STUDY
OF THINKING, COGNITION,

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.400
OR THE MIND.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.830
HE PUBLISHED PROLIFICALLY,
BUT HE WROTE IN FRENCH

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.730
WHICH LIMITED
HIS READERSHIP

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.430
IN THE EARLY DAYS.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.600
PIAGET LEFT US WITH
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.960
LITERATURE AS WELL AS
AN ENORMOUS THEORY.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.130
THE THEORY HAS BEEN TESTED,
ANALYZED, CRITICIZED,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.430
AND MODIFICATIONS
HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.260
BUT IT'S STILL
WIDELY ACCEPTED

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.200
AS<i> THE</i> THEORY OF
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.660
WE WILL TRY TO UNDERSTAND
THE THEORY BEFORE

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.500
GOING ON LATER TO A
CRITICAL ANALYSIS.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.030
I SAY "TRY" BECAUSE IT
IS A THEORY WHICH USES

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.630
UNFAMILIAR WORDS AND
COMMON SENSE IDEAS

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.400
IN RATHER
INDIGESTIBLE FORM.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.430
BASICALLY WHAT PIAGET'S
SAYING IS THAT BABIES HAVE

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.030
INNATE, INBORN, ABILITIES
- FAIRLY PRIMITIVE ONES,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.260
BUT ONES WHICH ARE USEFUL
AS A STARTING POINT

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.500
TO LEARNING
ABOUT THE WORLD.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.260
THE BABY, THEN,
EXPERIENCES THE WORLD

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.000
AND BUILDS ON
HIS ABILITIES

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.400
TO LEARN MORE AND MORE
PIECES OF BEHAVIOR.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.960
PIAGET'S STUDIES CONVINCED
HIM THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.160
JUST LITTLE ADULTS,
BUT THEY THINK IN A

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.630
QUALITIVELY DIFFERENT
WAY TO ADULTS.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.100
IT MAY SEEM OBVIOUS TO US
NOW THAT THIS IS THE CASE,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.560
BUT IT WAS A REVOLUTIONARY
IDEA 50 YEARS AGO.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.100
DURING CHILDHOOD WE
CONSTRUCT AN UNDERSTANDING

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.060
OF REALITY BY INTERACTING
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.060
WE'RE NOT BORN
WITH FULL ADULT

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.860
POWERS OF THOUGHT,
OBVIOUSLY.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.930
THOUGHT, DEDUCTION,
PROBLEM-SOLVING,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.300
CREATIVITY, ETC. ALL COME
LATER, BUT MUST ACTIVELY

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.230
DISCOVER THESE
COGNITIVE SKILLS.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.600
PIAGET'S THEORY ATTEMPTS
TO EXPLAIN HOW WE BUILD ON

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.560
INNATE MUSCULAR AND
SENSORY REFLEXES

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.560
TO ACHIEVE FULL
ADULT THINKING.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.500
IT ASSUMES THAT WE HAVE AN
INBORN DRIVE TO ORGANIZE

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.900
AND MAKE SENSE OF
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.330
IT ALSO ASSUMES THAT WE
HAVE AN INNATE ABILITY

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.430
TO LEARN FROM
PAST EXPERIENCES

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.060
AND ADAPT OUR
BEHAVIOR ACCORDINGLY.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.360
THE BASIC UNIT OF
INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.900
PIAGET CALLED A "SCHEMA".

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.630
SCHEMAS ARE WAYS IN WHICH
WE TRY TO ORGANIZE AND

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.000
UNDERSTAND EXPERIENCES
AND IN THE EARLY DAYS

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.230
ARE IN THE SIMPLE FORM
OF INNATE REFLEXES.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.560
GRADUALLY AS THE BABY
DEVELOPS A SCHEMA

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.030
THEY BECOME MORE INTERNAL
AND THE BABY STARTS TO

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.100
MAKE MENTAL REPRESENTATIONS
OF THE WORLD -

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.400
THAT IS, IT
STARTS TO THINK.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.230
SCHEMAS DEVELOP AS A
RESULT OF EXPERIENCE

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.700
AND ARE USED AS A NET
BASIS FOR ACTION.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.930
FOR EXAMPLE, A BABY MAY
HAVE DEVELOPED A SCHEMA

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.430
FOR SHAKING A RATTLE.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.630
PAST EXPERIENCE OF
PICKING UP RATTLES

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.930
HAS SHOWN THAT THEY
MAKE A SOUND WHEN MOVED.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.860
THEREFORE THE
BABY NOW UNDERSTANDS,

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.160
OR HAS A SCHEMA, WHICH
GUIDES HIS ACTIONS

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.430
WHEN HE NEXT
GRASPS SOMETHING.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.330
NEW SCHEMAS ARE FORMED AND
EXISTING SCHEMAS DEVELOPED

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.530
BY THE PROCESSES
OF ASSIMILATION

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.630
AND ACCOMMODATION.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.660
ASSIMILATION IS TAKING
IN PIECES OF INFORMATION

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.500
FROM THE ENVIRONMENT
AND REACTING TO THEM.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.600
IN THE SAME WAY, FOR
EXAMPLE, ALWAYS SUCKING

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.830
SOMETHING PUT IN THEIR
MOUTH WHATEVER IT IS.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.960
HOWEVER, IF WE JUST
CONTINUE TO USE OUR

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.700
ALREADY EXISTING SCHEMAS
THERE WOULD BE NO MENTAL

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.660
GROWTH AND WE WOULD AS
ADULTS STILL, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.800
SUCK EVERYTHING THAT
WAS PUT IN OUR MOUTHS

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.100
INDISCRIMINATELY
AND GRASP EVERYTHING

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.630
USING A WHOLE HAND
RATHER THAN OUR FINGERS,

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.430
OR WE'D SHAKE EVERYTHING
THAT CAME TO US.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.930
THIS IS WHERE
ACCOMMODATION COMES IN.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.560
IN ORDER TO TAKE A COUNT
OF DIFFERENT PROPERTIES

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.430
SUCH AS WHETHER IT'S A
BOTTLE WHICH PRODUCES FOOD

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.000
OR WHETHER IT'S A BLANKET
WHICH DOESN'T WHEN THE

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.930
BABY SUCKS IT, HE MODIFIES
THE SHAPE OF HIS LIPS

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.630
TO ACCOMMODATE
DIFFERENT STIMULI.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.760
WHEN SOMETHING HAS
BEEN ACCOMMODATED,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.200
A BALANCE EXISTS
WHICH PIAGET CALLS

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.560
"EQUILIBRATION"
OR "EQUILIBRIUM".

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.930
THAT IS, UNTIL SOMETHING
NEW IS EXPERIENCED,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.800
AND THEN AN UNCOMFORTABLE
STATE OF IMBALANCE OCCURS.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800
FOR EXAMPLE, FOOD MAY
START TO BE PRESENTED

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.800
IN A DRINKING CUP
OR ON A SPOON.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800
THE BABY HAS TO
ADAPT ITS BEHAVIOR

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.160
IN ORDER TO COPE WITH
THIS NEW STIMULI.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.000
NOW IT'S THE ANXIETY
CAUSED BY THE IMBALANCE

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.500
THAT PIAGET SAYS
ENCOURAGES THE CHILD

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.130
TO CONTINUE TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND THE WORLD.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.360
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
PIAGET'S THEORY IS NOT

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.300
HELPED BY THE USE OF THIS
VERY UNIQUE VOCABULARY.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.000
ANYWAY, LET'S LOOK
AT A DIAGRAM

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.960
SHOWING WHERE
WE'VE GOT SO FAR.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.560
WE HAVE INNATE
STRATEGIES

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.160
WHICH MAKE
DEVELOPMENT POSSIBLE.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.460
WE ARE ALSO BORN WITH
SIMPLE REFLEXES WHICH WE

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:02.030
CAN SAY ARE ASSIMILATED
INTO OUR BEHAVIOR PATTERN

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.700
IN THE FORM OF "SCHEMA".

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.130
AS WE MEET NEW STIMULI
WE ARE THROWN INTO

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:08.300
AN ANXIOUS STATE
OF DISEQUILIBRIUM.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.060
THIS ANXIETY IS REDUCED
THROUGH THE PROCESSES

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:13.460
OF ASSIMILATION AND
ACCOMMODATING OUR BEHAVIOR

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.760
TO CREATE NEW SCHEMA.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.260
THIS REDUCES THE TENSION
AND RESTORES A STATE OF

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.960
EQUILIBRIUM AND IT'S
THIS STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.430
THAT PIAGET SAYS
PROVIDES THE MOTIVATION

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:26.600
TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND
MORE ABOUT OUR WORLD.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.130
IF WE FIT AN EXAMPLE TO
THE DIAGRAM, BABIES HAVE

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.930
ASSIMILATED GRASPING
USING THEIR WHOLE HAND,

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.960
BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'LL
FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.630
TO ASSIMILATE SMALL
OBJECTS AND WILL ADAPT BY

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.330
ACCOMMODATING TO THEM IN
DEVELOPING A NEW SCHEMA

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.100
FOR PICKING THEM UP WITH
A THUMB AND OPPOSED FINGER

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.630
WHICH OF COURSE
IS MUCH EASIER.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.800
WE HAVEN'T FINISHED
EXPLAINING PIAGET'S THEORY

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.530
BY ANY MEANS, BUT YOU
PROBABLY NEED A CHANGE NOW

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.060
SO HERE'S A LITTLE MENTAL
EXERCISE TO KEEP YOU AWAKE.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.130
WE HAVE BEEN APPLYING
PIAGET'S THEORY

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.060
OF COGNITIVE
DEVELOPMENT TO BABIES,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.900
BUT COGNITIVE
GROWTH CONTINUES

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.330
THROUGHOUT CHILDHOOD
AND INTO LATER LIFE.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.930
EVEN NOW WE'RE ADAPTING
TO OUR ENVIRONMENT,

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.530
ACCOMMODATING OUR
BEHAVIOR, AND DEVELOPING

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.660
NEW SCHEMA -
PERHAPS ONE FOR

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.630
UNDERSTANDING
PIAGET'S THEORY.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.300
STOP THE VIDEO FOR A FEW
MINUTES AND SEE IF YOU CAN

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.600
EXPLAIN HOW YOU MIGHT
DEVELOP, OR HAVE ALREADY

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.200
DEVELOPED, A SCHEMA
FOR DRIVING A CAR.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.800
YOU COULD EXPLAIN IT
IN EVERYDAY TERMS FIRST

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.330
AND THEN TRY USING
PIAGET'S VOCABULARY.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.530
IF YOU
FOUND THAT EASY,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.030
THE REST OF PIAGET'S
THEORY WILL BE NO PROBLEM.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.830
YOUR ANSWER IN ORDINARY
TERMS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.160
YOU BUILD ON PAST
EXPERIENCES AND SKILLS

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.430
RELATED TO THE TASK OF
DRIVING, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.430
STEERING AND CONTROLLING
TOYS, BICYCLES,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.800
SHOPPING TROLLEYS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.000
FROM EVERYDAY TASKS YOU
KNOW WHAT THE WORDS

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
"PUSH", "PULL",
"TURN" MEAN

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.830
AND YOU ENCOUNTER
LEVERS AND DIALS.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.700
IF YOU'RE THEN FACED
WITH THESE IN A CAR,

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.760
YOU ADAPT WHAT YOU
ALREADY KNOW TO FIT IN

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.030
WITH THE BEHAVIOR
REQUIRED TO DRIVE A CAR.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.700
HAVING LEARNED ONE ASPECT
SUCH AS HOW TO START

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.630
THE ENGINE, YOU'RE THEN
MOTIVATED TO LEARN MORE,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:23.000
AND THUS LEARN EVERYTHING
REQUIRED TO DRIVE A CAR.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.760
YOU CAN ADAPT THIS IDEA
BY THINKING ABOUT HOW

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.000
YOU WOULD DEVELOP A SCHEMA
FOR DRIVING A TRACTOR

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.100
OR AN AIRPLANE - EXACTLY
THE SAME APPLIES.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.730
YOU MEET A NEW SITUATION
AND ASSIMILATE IT

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.060
AND EXPERIENCE A SENSE
OF DISEQUILIBRIUM

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.760
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
DEVELOPED A SCHEMA

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.700
TO COPE WITH THAT
PARTICULAR THING,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.130
AND THEREFORE YOU
ACCOMMODATE YOUR BEHAVIOR

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.160
AND DEVELOP A
SCHEMA FOR IT.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.960
THUS, YOU'RE NOW IN A
STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM AGAIN

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.530
AND READY TO DEAL WITH MORE
AND MORE NEW EXPERIENCES.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.930
WE CAN SEE THAT THE
LIMITED NUMBER OF SCHEMA

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.830
IN THE YOUNG BABY GROW
RAPIDLY AS MORE AND MORE

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.560
ARE ASSIMILATED AND THEY
BECOME MORE COMPLEX

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.460
AS ACCOMMODATION
TAKES PLACE

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.000
AND THEY FORM THE
BASIS OF THINKING.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.100
BECAUSE ASSIMILATION,
ACCOMMODATION,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.000
AND EQUILIBRIUM OPERATE
CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
CHILDHOOD AND
IN LATER LIFE,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.100
THEY'RE KNOWN AS THE
"INVARIANT FUNCTIONS".

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.500
IT IS THESE THAT PRODUCE
THE MOTIVATION TO DEVELOP.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.160
PIAGET IDENTIFIED
FOUR DISTINCT STAGES

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.100
OF COGNITIVE
DEVELOPMENT.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.130
THE SENSORI-MOTOR STAGE
WHICH OCCURS BETWEEN

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.530
BIRTH AND TWO YEARS.

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.330
THE PRE-OPERATIONAL STAGE
BETWEEN TWO AND SEVEN YEARS,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.160
THE CONCRETE OPERATIONAL
STAGE BETWEEN

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.560
SEVEN AND TWELVE YEARS,
AND THE FORMAL OPERATIONAL

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:55.100
STAGE FROM ELEVEN TO
TWELVE YEARS ONWARDS.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.500
PIAGET CLAIMED THAT ALL
CHILDREN PASSED THROUGH

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.730
THESE STAGES IN
THE SAME ORDER

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.430
BUT AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.660
HIS CONCLUSIONS WERE
MAINLY THE RESULT OF

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.800
TESTING AND OBSERVING
HIS OWN THREE CHILDREN

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.800
WHO HAD THE SURPRISINGLY
NORMAL NAMES OF

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.000
JACQUELINE, LUCIENNE,
AND LAURENT.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.800
LET US LOOK AT EACH
STAGE MORE CLOSELY.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.230
THE SENSORI-MOTOR STAGE
WHICH LASTS UNTIL THE

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.460
BABY IS ROUGHLY TWO YEARS
OLD IS THE ACTION STAGE.

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.230
THE BABY THINKS THROUGH
ACTING ON OBJECTS,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.300
THAT IS, GRASPING,
SUCKING, TOUCHING,

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.230
SHAKING, ETC., AND
THROUGH THE SENSES.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.330
THROUGH APPLYING ACTION
SCHEMA THE BABY BUILDS UP

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.460
A MENTAL PICTURE OR FINDS
OUT ABOUT THE OBJECTS AND

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.330
THE PEOPLE AROUND THEM.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.800
WHAT OBJECTS CAN BE
GRASPED, WHAT CAN BE

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.760
SUCKED, WHAT NOISE
WILL THEY MAKE,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.100
WHAT THEY FEEL
LIKE TO THE TOUCH.

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:58.330
IN THIS STAGE THE CHILD
IS PROFOUNDLY EGOCENTRIC.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.060
THAT IS, IT IS UNABLE TO
MAKE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.100
WHAT IS ITSELF AND WHAT
IS THE REST OF THE WORLD.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.600
NOTHING THEREFORE HAS AN
INDEPENDENT EXISTENCE

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.960
UNTIL THE BABY FINDS
OUT WHAT IS ITSELF

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.700
AND WHAT IS NOT.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.860
WHEN BABIES REALIZE
THE DISTINCTION,

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.330
THEY LEARN THAT OBJECTS
CONTINUE TO EXIST

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.830
EVEN WHEN THEY'RE
OUT OF SIGHT.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.030
UNTIL THE BABY
HAS THIS NOTION

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.030
KNOWN AS "OBJECT
PERMANENCE",

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.360
OUT OF SIGHT MEANS
OUT OF EXISTENCE.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.600
IT IS THUS AN
IMPORTANT MILESTONE

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:33.530
IN COGNITIVE
DEVELOPMENT.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.000
PIAGET SUGGESTS
THAT ALTHOUGH A

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.300
THREE-MONTH-OLD BABY
MAY LOOK WITH INTEREST

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.630
AT AN OBJECT WHEN IT'S
WAVED WITHIN RANGE,

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.660
PERHAPS EVEN REACH OUT
FOR IT OR FOLLOW IT

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.060
WITH ITS EYES, ONCE
IT IS OUT OF SIGHT

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.330
IT APPEARS TO
BE FORGOTTEN.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.060
IT IS NECESSARY
AT THIS STAGE

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:51.000
THAT THE WHOLE
OBJECT IS VISIBLE

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.100
FOR THE BABY TO
RESPOND TO IT AT ALL.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:55.230
IT IS NOT UNTIL ABOUT
EIGHT MONTHS THAT THE BABY

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.000
WILL REACH FOR A
COMPLETELY HIDDEN OBJECT.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.860
USUALLY AT ABOUT TEN
MONTHS THE BABY WILL

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.030
SEARCH FOR AN OBJECT
WHICH HAS BEEN HIDDEN,

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.260
BUT IF HE SEES IT MOVED
TO ANOTHER HIDING PLACE

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.730
HE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK
IN THE ORIGINAL PLACE.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.200
IT'S ONLY BY ABOUT 12
MONTHS THAT THE CHILD HAS

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.860
COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF
THE EXISTENCE OF OBJECTS

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.900
WHICH ARE OUT OF SIGHT.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.630
WE CAN RELATE THIS TO
THE STUDY OF ATTACHMENT.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.030
IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE
THAT SEPARATION ANXIETY

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.200
- WHERE THE BABY GETS
EXTREMELY DISTRESSED WHEN

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.300
THEIR ATTACHMENT FIGURE
LEAVES THEIR SIGHT -

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.130
OCCURS AT AROUND SIX TO
SEVEN MONTHS WHEN THE BABY

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.630
HAS FORMED ATTACHMENTS
BUT NOT YET ACQUIRED

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:31.930
THE IDEA OF PERMANENCE
OF OBJECTS OR PEOPLE.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.600
CHILDREN DEVELOP THE
ABILITY TO USE SYMBOLS

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.330
TO REPRESENT THINGS TOWARDS
THE END OF THIS STAGE.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.130
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY
UNDERSTAND THAT A DOLL

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:41.560
REPRESENTS OR STANDS
FOR A BABY OR A PERSON.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.700
THIS IS KNOWN AS THE
"GENERAL SYMBOLIC FUNCTION".

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.030
IT IS FASCINATING TO
WATCH A CHILD MOVE FROM

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.160
DEALING WITH A DOLL AS
JUST ANOTHER OBJECT TO BE

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.830
CHEWED, SHAKEN, OR THROWN,
AND INSTEAD DEAL WITH IT

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.260
AS A SYMBOLIC OBJECT WHICH
REPRESENTS SOMETHING

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.260
- FOR EXAMPLE, TALKING
TO OR FEEDING A DOG.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.900
THE CHILD MAKES
HUGE STRIDES

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.200
IN DEVELOPING ITS ABILITY
TO USE SPOKEN LANGUAGE

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.530
DURING THIS STAGE.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.700
UNLIKE SYMBOLS, SIGNS LIKE
LANGUAGE DON'T LOOK LIKE

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.500
THE THINGS
THEY REPRESENT

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.900
SO ARE INEVITABLY
HARDER TO LEARN.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.160
PIAGET, HOWEVER, SEES
LANGUAGE AS A<i> RESULT</i>

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.230
OF THOUGHT, NOT
AS A SOURCE OF IT,

00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.400
SO IT IS NOT A KEY
FEATURE IN THIS THEORY.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.400
TO SUMMARIZE THE
KEY FEATURES OF THE

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.200
SENSORI-MOTOR CHILD:

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.160
THOUGHT PROCESSES DEVELOP
USING SENSES AND ACTIONS.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.260
UNDERSTANDING OF OBJECT
PERMANENCE DEVELOPS.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.460
THE IDEA THAT SYMBOLS
CAN BE USED TO REPRESENT

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.230
OBJECTS DEVELOPS TOWARDS
THE END OF THIS STAGE.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.860
THIS SYMBOLIC THINKING,
AS WELL AS LANGUAGE,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.730
CONTINUE TO
DEVELOP IMPRESSIVELY

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.030
IN THE NEXT STAGE
- THE PRE-OPERATIONAL.

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:41.600
IN THIS STAGE THE CHILD'S
THINKING IS DOMINATED

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.560
BY WHAT IT SEES RATHER
THAN BY LOGICAL PRINCIPLES.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.960
THE KEY FEATURE
IS EGOCENTRISM.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.260
PIAGET CONSIDERS
PRE-OPERATIONAL CHILDREN

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.500
TO BE IRREDEEMABLY
EGOCENTRIC IN THAT

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.430
ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOW
WELL AWARE OF SELF

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.400
AS SEPARATE FROM THE
REST OF THE WORLD,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.360
THEY'RE QUITE UNABLE
TO TAKE ANYONE ELSE'S

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.460
POINT OF VIEW INTO
CONSIDERATION.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.930
PIAGET CLAIMS THAT THE
CHILD CANNOT SEE THE

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.300
POINT OF VIEW OF ANOTHER
IN THE LITERAL SENSE

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.460
IN THAT THE CHILD
WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.530
THAT AN OBJECT WILL BE
SEEN DIFFERENTLY FROM

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:10.900
ANOTHER ANGLE OF VIEW,
AND IN THE SENSE OF BEING

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.000
UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ANOTHER PERSON

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.360
MIGHT FEEL OR THINK
DIFFERENTLY TO ITSELF.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.630
A WELL-KNOWN DEMONSTRATION
OF EGOCENTRISM

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.530
BY PIAGET AND INHELDER
REPORTED IN 1956 MADE USE

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.830
OF THE TABLETOP MODEL
OF A SWISS MOUNTAIN SCENE.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.000
AFTER AN OPPORTUNITY TO
BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.500
MODEL, CHILDREN ARE ASKED
TO CHOOSE A PHOTOGRAPH

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.530
FROM A SELECTION WHICH
SHOWED THE VIEW OF THE

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:33.630
SCENE FROM THE POINT OF
VIEW OF A DOLL WHICH WAS

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:36.200
PLACED AT A DIFFERENT
ANGLE FROM THE CHILD.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.300
TO GET THE TASK RIGHT,
THE CHILD WOULD

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.400
HAVE TO TAKE THE DOLL'S
PERSPECTIVE INTO ACCOUNT.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.930
EACH MOUNTAIN WAS PAINTED
IN DIFFERENT COLOR

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.300
AND TOPPED WITH EITHER
A HOUSE, A RED CROSS,

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.830
OR SNOW FOR CLARITY.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.860
ONLY CHILDREN OF EIGHT
YEARS OR OVER WERE ABLE TO

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.460
CONSISTENTLY SUCCEED
AT THIS TASK.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.800
SIX-YEAR-OLDS
ACHIEVED SOME SUCCESS,

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.600
AND 4-YEAR-OLDS TYPICALLY
CHOSE THEIR OWN VIEW.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.100
THIS WOULD BE A SIMPLE
PRACTICAL TO RUN YOURSELF

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.400
IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO
CHILDREN OF THE RIGHT AGE

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.500
AND CAN
BUILD MOUNTAINS.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:09.100
ALTERNATIVELY, YOU COULD
USE THE MODERN-DAY VERSION

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.460
WHICH WE'LL
DEMONSTRATE LATER.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.900
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
PRE-OPERATIONAL STAGE,

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.600
THE CHILD ALSO
HAS DIFFICULTY

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.700
IN DEALING WITH
TASKS LOGICALLY.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.400
FOR EXAMPLE, CLASSIFYING
THINGS, PUTTING THINGS

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.130
INTO A LOGICAL SEQUENCE OR
SERIES, AND UNDERSTANDING

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.460
RELATIONS BETWEEN
CATEGORIES, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.400
APPLES, AND
SUB-CATEGORIES,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.960
FOR EXAMPLE, RED APPLES
AND GREEN APPLES.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.700
A FOUR-YEAR-OLD MAY
BE ABLE TO SEPARATE

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.960
COLORED PENCILS INTO YELLOW
ONES AND GREEN ONES,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.960
OR INTO BIG ONES
AND LITTLE ONES,

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.200
BUT IT'S LIKELY TO FIND
IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TAKE

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.800
TWO DIMENSIONS INTO
ACCOUNT SO AS TO PICK OUT

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.830
ALL THE BIG YELLOW ONES OR
ALL THE SMALL GREEN ONES.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.630
<i>LIE THEM DOWN
IF YOU WANT TO.</i>

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.330
<i>ARE THERE ANY MORE
BIG GREEN PENCILS?</i>

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.060
<i>YOU'VE FOUND
ANOTHER ONE.</i>

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.330
<i>THAT'S A GOOD BOY, YOU
DID THAT VERY WELL.</i>

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.030
<i>THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</i>

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.400
SIMILARLY, A CHILD AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.760
PRE-OPERATIONAL STAGE,
SAY THREE OR FOUR,

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.160
WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY
ARRANGING ITEMS IN ORDER

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.700
SUCH AS LONGEST TO SHORTEST
OR TALLEST TO SMALLEST.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.500
A CHILD UP TO FIVE,
IF SHOWN A GARAGE WITH

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.530
YELLOW CARS AND BLUE CARS
IS LIKELY TO AGREE WITH YOU

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.160
THAT THE YELLOW ONES ARE
CARS AND THE BLUE ONES

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.260
ARE CARS, HOWEVER, IF
THEN ASKED "IF ALL THE

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.100
YELLOW CARS DRIVE AWAY,
WILL THERE BE ANY LEFT?"

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:44.730
THE CHILD IS QUITE
LIKELY TO SAY

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:49.630
THAT THERE WON'T
BE ANY LEFT.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.230
PIAGET BELIEVES THAT AN
INCORRECT ANSWER REFLECTS

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.130
NOT MERELY CONFUSION
OVER VERBAL LABELS

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.460
BUT A DEEPER
INABILITY TO CONSIDER

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.160
MORE THAN ONE
FEATURE AT A TIME.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:05.260
THIS CONCENTRATION PIAGET
CALLED "CENTRATION".

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.560
UNTIL A CHILD
CAN DE-CENTER,

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.260
HE WILL BE UNABLE TO
CLASSIFY IN ANY LOGICAL WAY

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.430
AND WILL STILL BE
UNABLE TO, SAY,

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:15.200
TELL THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN CATS AND DOGS.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.400
WHY?

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.730
BECAUSE HE ONLY TAKES INTO
ACCOUNT ONE ATTRIBUTE;

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.000
THAT IS, PERHAPS THAT
THEY HAVE FOUR LEGS,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.100
AND IGNORES THE
OTHER DIFFERENCES.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.160
HAVING ACQUIRED
THIS COGNITIVE SKILL

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.960
BY FOUR TO
FIVE YEARS OLD,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.300
THE OLDER PRE-OPERATIONAL
THINKER STILL APPEARS

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.400
TO HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH CLASSIFICATION.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.300
YOU CAN TRY THIS
EXAMPLE YOURSELF.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.830
ARE THEY ALL CARS?

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:40.960
ARE THERE MORE BLUE
CARS OR MORE RED CARS?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.860
ARE THERE MORE BLUE
CARS OR MORE CARS?

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.730
<i>BLUE CARS.</i>

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.200
YOU MAY HAVE HAD TO THINK
A SECOND OR TWO BEFORE

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.700
ANSWERING THAT QUESTION,
BUT ACCORDING TO PIAGET,

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.500
SIX AND SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS
FIND IT VERY HARD.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.960
HE SAYS THE CHILD IS
FAILING TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.760
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
WHOLE CLASS - THAT'S CARS,

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.930
AND THE SUB-CLASSES - THE
DIFFERENTLY COLORED CARS.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:10.860
THE CHILD IS STILL
INFLUENCED BY WHAT IT SEES.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.830
IT'S EASIER TO
PERCEIVE BLUE CARS

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.760
THAN PERCEIVE
ALL CARS.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.760
HOWEVER, YOU MAY WANT TO
ARGUE, AS MANY OTHERS HAVE,

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.730
THAT THE QUESTION IN
THESE WHAT WE CALL

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.300
"CLASS INCLUSION TASKS" IS
TOO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.900
WE'LL COME BACK
TO THIS LATER.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.430
ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS
PRE-OPERATIONAL STAGE

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.660
IS WHEN CHILDREN REFER
TO INANIMATE OBJECTS

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.730
AS IF THEY'RE REALLY
ANIMATE OR ALIVE.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.930
PIAGET CALLS THIS "ANIMISM",
THUS ALL KINDS OF OBJECTS

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.560
HAVE EMOTIONS, MOTIVES,
INTENTIONS, THOUGHTS,

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.030
DESIRES ATTRIBUTED
TO THEM WHOLESALE.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.000
I EXPECT MOST OF US
AS CHILDREN USED OUR

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.800
TEDDY BEAR AS A SCAPEGOAT
FOR OUR BAD BEHAVIOR.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.230
THIS CAN BE SEEN AS A
PRODUCT OF EGOCENTRISM,

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.130
AS THE CHILD
IMAGINES EVERYTHING,

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.160
AND ESPECIALLY EVERYONE,
TO BE LIKE ITSELF.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.500
<i>IT DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE IT, IT IS SICK.</i>

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.130
<i>YOU HAVE TO GIVE
IT SOME MEDICINE.</i>

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:03.900
CONSERVATION IS PROBABLY THE
MOST WIDELY INVESTIGATED

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.860
AREA OF THE PRE-OPERATIONAL
CHILD'S THINKING.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.030
BY "CONSERVATION" PIAGET
MEANS THE ABILITY TO

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.330
UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING
REMAINS THE SAME

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.100
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN
TRANSFORMED IN APPEARANCE.

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.300
A CLASSIC EXAMPLE IS
THAT OF A GLASS OF WATER

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.560
REMAINING THE SAME
QUANTITY WHEN POURED FROM

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.260
A SHORT FAT GLASS INTO
A TALL THIN GLASS.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.700
A PRE-OPERATIONAL CHILD
IS LIKELY TO FOCUS ON THE

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.530
HEIGHT OF THE WATER IN THE
TALL THIN GLASS AND IS

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.360
LIKELY TO JUDGE THAT THERE
IS NOW MORE WATER BECAUSE

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.100
THE LEVEL IS HIGHER THAN
IN THE SHORTER GLASS.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.830
<i>NOW THEN, HAVE THEY STILL
GOT THE SAME AMOUNT</i>

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.330
<i>OR HAS ONE GOT MORE
THAN THE OTHER?</i>

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.730
<i>THAT ONE'S GOT
MORE THAN THAT ONE.</i>

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.800
<i>SO IF I HAD THAT ONE
AND YOU HAD THAT ONE,</i>

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.800
<i>IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR
'CUZ I'D HAVE MORE.</i>

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.860
<i>RIGHT. VERY
GOOD. OKAY.</i>

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.860
THIS FALSE
JUDGMENT IS LIKELY

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.630
IN SPITE OF THE CHILD
ACTUALLY SEEING

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.500
THE TRANSFORMATION
TAKING PLACE.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.600
THAT IS, SEEING THE
WATER BEING POURED,

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.230
OR EVEN IF YOU ALLOW THEM
TO POUR IT THEMSELVES.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.330
IT OCCURS BECAUSE
OF THE CHILD'S

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.060
LACK OF REVERSIBILITY.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.060
THAT IS, THEY'RE UNABLE
TO HOLD ALL THE FEATURES

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.900
OF THE SITUATION
IN THEIR HEADS

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.760
AND THEY CAN'T THINK
ABOUT THEM BEING REVERSED.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.000
BUT LOGIC DOES TRIUMPH
OVER APPEARANCE EVENTUALLY.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
<i>BUT THEY'VE STILL
GOT THE SAME NOW?</i>

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.430
<i>YES.</i>

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.300
<i>WHY HAVE THEY
STILL GOT THE SAME?</i>

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.160
<i>BECAUSE YOU POURED...</i>

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.500
<i>BECAUSE YOU SWAPPED
GLASSES AND YOU POURED ALL</i>

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.300
<i>THAT IN, BUT THEY'RE NOT
THE SAME BECAUSE THAT ONE</i>

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.560
<i>IS WIDER THAN THAT ONE, SO
THAT ONE GOES TO THERE.</i>

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.600
<i>VERY GOOD.</i>

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.260
<i>WELL DONE, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.</i>

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.530
TO SUMMARIZE THE
KEY FEATURES OF THE

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:41.700
PRE-OPERATIONAL STAGE:

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.030
THE CHILD TENDS TO BE
EGOCENTRIC, THAT IS,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.330
THEY SEE THE WORLD FROM
THEIR OWN VIEWPOINT.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.530
THEY ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS
WITH CLASSIFICATION

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.300
AND TEND TO CENTER
ON ONE FEATURE

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.130
AT THE EXPENSE
OF OTHERS.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.160
THEY TEND TO ATTRIBUTE
HUMAN FEELINGS

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.800
TO INANIMATE OBJECTS.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.400
AND, ACCORDING
TO PIAGET,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.160
THEY'RE AS YET
UNABLE TO CONSERVE.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.060
THE THIRD STAGE IDENTIFIED
BY PIAGET IS THE

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.260
CONCRETE OPERATIONAL,
WHICH OCCURS FROM

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.560
THE AGES OF SEVEN TO
ELEVEN APPROXIMATELY.

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:12.500
EGOCENTRISM DECLINES
RAPIDLY DURING THIS STAGE,

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.300
PROBABLY DUE TO MATURATION
IN SOME PART, BUT ALSO

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.730
DUE TO PLAYING AND
COOPERATING WITH OTHERS.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.400
THEY CAN UNDERSTAND
CLASSIFICATIONS OF CLASSES

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.230
AND SUB-CLASSES AND CAN
INCREASINGLY CARRY OUT

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.460
REVERSALS AS SHOWN
BY THEIR ABILITY

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:29.900
NOT ONLY TO DO ADDITION
BUT ALSO TO SUBTRACT.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.060
THE CHILD IS NOW
INCREASINGLY ABLE TO TAKE

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.560
MORE THAN ONE ATTRIBUTE
INTO ACCOUNT SO THEY CAN

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.000
EASILY, FOR EXAMPLE,
DIFFERENTIATE ANIMALS.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.130
OPERATIONAL THINKING
IS CONSOLIDATED,

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:44.500
AND CONSERVATION AND MOST
CONSERVATION OPERATIONS

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.760
ARE UNDERSTOOD BY THE
END OF THIS STAGE.

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.830
OTHER TYPES OF
CONSERVATION SUCH AS

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:51.860
VOLUME WHICH REQUIRE AN
UNDERSTANDING OF SHAPE,

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.630
SIZE, AND MASS, MAY NOT BE
CONSERVED UNTIL ELEVEN

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.730
OR TWELVE - ACCORDING
TO PIAGET THAT IS.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.730
THIS STEP BY STEP
ACQUISITION OF NEW

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.900
OPERATIONS WAS CALLED
"DECALAGE" BY PIAGET.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.460
HOWEVER, THE CHILD CAN
STILL ONLY PERFORM

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.700
THE OPERATIONS IF
THE CONCRETE OBJECTS

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:10.300
ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.130
FOR EXAMPLE, IF GIVEN AN
ABSTRACT PROBLEM SUCH AS

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.400
"JOE IS TALLER
THAN LUCY;

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.900
LUCY IS SHORTER
THAN MARIA;

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.800
WHO IS THE
SHORTEST?"

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.600
THE CHILD AT THIS STAGE
WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.860
<i>PAUL IS BIGGER
THAN GEORGE,</i>

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:31.160
<i>BUT HENRY IS
SMALLER THAN GEORGE.</i>

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.660
<i>PAUL IS BIGGER
THAN GEORGE,</i>

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.460
<i>BUT HENRY IS SMALLER
THAN GEORGE.</i>

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:40.330
<i>WHO'S THE BIGGEST?</i>

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:43.200
<i>I'D SAY HENRY.</i>

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.330
IF, THOUGH, THE THREE
PEOPLE WERE PHYSICALLY

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.200
PRESENT THEY WOULD
FIND IT VERY EASY

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.900
TO ORDER THE HEIGHT.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.600
THIS TYPE OF TASK IS
CALLED "TRANSITIVITY"

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.160
AND MANY ADULTS INCLUDING
MYSELF FIND THIS KIND

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.560
OF MENTAL GYMNASTICS
VERY DIFFICULT.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.660
TRY THIS ONE.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.360
SUSAN LIKES BANANAS
MORE THAN KEN;

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.300
KEN LIKES BANANAS
LESS THAN MARK;

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.630
WHO LIKES BANANAS
THE LEAST?

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.130
THIS REQUIRES SEVERAL
SKILLS SUCH AS

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:13.030
UNDERSTANDING OF
COMPARATIVE WORDS SUCH AS

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:16.960
"MORE", "BIGGER", "LESS",
"LONGER" WHICH WE KNOW

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.960
APPEAR RELATIVELY LATE IN
THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.560
OF SPOKEN LANGUAGE.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.330
IT ALSO REQUIRES
GOOD VISUAL MEMORY.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.730
CHILDRENS' MEMORIES HAVE
BEEN SHOWN BY FLAVELL

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.060
TO DEVELOP RAPIDLY
DURING THIS PERIOD,

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:33.960
WITH REHEARSAL AND MNEMONICS
INCREASINGLY BEING USED.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.800
BELOW SIX YEARS OLD,
CHILDREN DON'T REHEARSE

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.000
OR USE MNEMONICS, BUT
BY SIX OR SEVEN YEARS

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.930
THEY REHEARSE
SPONTANEOUSLY,

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.430
OFTEN ALOUD AND
MOVING THEIR LIPS.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:49.200
BY NINE, REHEARSAL IS
SPONTANEOUS AND SILENT.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.160
TO SUMMARIZE THE
CONCRETE THINKER:

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.900
CONSERVATION IS ATTAINED
DURING THIS STAGE.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.030
CLASSIFICATION
IS NO PROBLEM,

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:58.860
BUT TRANSITIVITY TASKS
STILL CAUSE DIFFICULTY

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.400
UNLESS THE CONCRETE OBJECTS
ARE PHYSICALLY PRESENT.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.960
THE FOURTH AND FINAL STAGE
IDENTIFIED BY PIAGET

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.860
IS THE FORMAL
OPERATIONAL STAGE

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.730
WHICH STARTS AT ELEVEN
AND, PIAGET THOUGHT,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.760
WOULD BE COMPLETE
BY 15 OR 16 YEARS.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.830
HE CLAIMED THAT THIS
IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.500
OF THINKING AND THAT AFTER
DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS STAGE

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.860
HAVE TAKEN PLACE THERE'S
VERY LITTLE CHANGE

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.330
TO COGNITIVE
ABILITIES AFTER THAT.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.160
THE KEY FEATURE
IS THE DEVELOPMENT

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.660
OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.900
IT WAS INTERESTING TO
NOTE FLAVELL'S FINDING

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.130
THAT COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT
SEEMS TO TAKE PLACE

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.460
IN LINE WITH DEVELOPMENT
OF MEMORY SKILLS

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.330
AND THEY MUST PLAY A PART,
OR A MAJOR PART INDEED,

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.200
IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.560
WHICH RELIES ON STORAGE
AND MANIPULATION

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.430
OF VAST QUANTITIES
OF INFORMATION.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:45.160
ADOLESCENTS CAN NOW
CONSIDER SUCH CONCEPTS AS

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.600
JUSTICE, MORALITY, AND
DEATH AND BECOME CONCERNED

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.600
ABOUT THE FUTURE AND
IDEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.560
HYPOTHESES ABOUT THINGS
NOT ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.500
CAN NOW BEGIN
TO BE GENERATED

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.760
AND TESTED
SYSTEMATICALLY.

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.900
DEDUCTIVE REASONING ALLOWS
MASTERY OF SUCH COMPLEX

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:06.160
SYSTEMS AS SCIENCE,
RELIGION, AND MATHEMATICS.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.560
ALRIGHT, BEFORE WE GO ANY
FURTHER YOU MIGHT LIKE TO

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.430
STOP THE VIDEO
AND PLAY A GAME.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.800
WELL, WHY NOT?

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.660
ONE PERSON THINKS OF
AN OBJECT IN THE ROOM

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.500
- YOU MIGHT HAVE
PLAYED THIS BEFORE -

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.260
THE OTHERS HAVE TO
GUESS WHAT IT IS.

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.430
THEY HAVE 20 QUESTIONS
AND YOU CAN ONLY ANSWER

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.000
YES OR NO.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.860
HAVE A GO NOW.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.660
NOW, THINK OF THE TYPE OF
QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.660
A CONCRETE OPERATION
THINKER WOULD TEND TO

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.700
STAB AT THINGS SUCH AS,
IS IT THAT BOOK?

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.130
IS IT THIS PENCIL?

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.460
IS IT THAT TABLE?

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.100
IT WOULD BE HOPED
THAT YOUR QUESTIONS

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.800
WERE MORE ADVANCED
AND TRIED TO

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.430
ELIMINATE LARGE
NUMBERS OF OBJECTS.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.400
FOR EXAMPLE, IS IT
THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM?

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.730
IS IT MADE OF WOOD?

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:56.400
ALTHOUGH AS THE
POSSIBILITIES ARE

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.100
NARROWED DOWN, YOUR
LATER QUESTIONS

00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.860
WILL OBVIOUSLY
BE MORE SPECIFIC.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.830
THIS COULD FORM THE
BASIS OF A PRACTICAL

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.700
DEMONSTRATION OF THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.260
CONCRETE AND FORMAL
OPERATIONAL THOUGHT.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.230
YOU COULD PLAY THE GAME,
SAY, WITH SEVEN TO TEN

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.200
YEAR OLDS AND
COMPARE THEIR METHODS

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.230
WITH SUBJECTS
YOUR OWN AGE.

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.360
YOU COULD DEVISE SOME
SIMPLE SCORING SYSTEM

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.760
FOR DIFFERENT
CATEGORIES OF QUESTIONS.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.560
PIAGET AND HIS COLLEAGUE,
INHELDER, DEVISED THE

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.060
WELL-KNOWN PENDULUM
TASK WHICH REQUIRES

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.200
ABSTRACT THOUGHT,
DEDUCTIVE REASONING,

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.300
AND HYPOTHESIS TESTING.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.060
GIVEN THREE PIECES OF
STRING OF DIFFERENT LENGTH,

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.630
A SET OF THREE WEIGHTS,
AND THREE DEGREES

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.760
OF PUSH ON THE WEIGHT
- SOFT, MEDIUM, OR HARD -

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.300
WHICH FACTOR AFFECTS THE
SPEED OF THE PENDULUM SWING?

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.230
IS IT THE LENGTH
OF THE STRING?

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:42.000
IS IT THE
WEIGHT ATTACHED?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.900
OR IS IT THE
FORCE OF THE PUSH?

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.000
THE ANSWER, IN FACT,
TO PUT YOU OUT OF

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
YOUR MISERY, IS THE
LENGTH OF STRING

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.660
WHICH ALONE DETERMINES
THE SPEED OF THE PENDULUM.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.830
BUT THE IMPORTANT FACT
IS THE METHOD USED

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.460
TO PRODUCE THE ANSWER.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.700
AGAIN, YOU'D EXPECT
CONCRETE OPERATIONAL

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.800
THINKERS TO USE FAIRLY
TRIAL AND ERROR METHODS,

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.030
PERHAPS RANDOM
COMBINATIONS RATHER THAN

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.430
SOME SYSTEMATIC
ELIMINATION.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.160
TO SUMMARIZE THE KEY
FEATURES OF PIAGET'S

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.730
FINAL STAGE, THE
FORMAL OPERATIONAL:

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.630
THE CHILD CAN NOW USE
FULL ADULT REASONING

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:22.260
AND IS CAPABLE OF ALL
FORMS OF ABSTRACT THOUGHT.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.860
SO NOW THAT WE HAVE
BRIEFLY COVERED THE BASICS

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.530
OF PIAGET'S THEORY, LET'S
JUST SUMMARIZE QUICKLY:

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.030
WE DEVELOP UNITS OF
INTELLIGENT BEHAVIOR,

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.660
SCHEMATA - THAT'S THE
PLURAL FOR SCHEMA -

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.830
BY ASSIMILATING
NEW EXPERIENCES

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.660
FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.760
A FEELING OF
DISEQUILIBRIUM OCCURS

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.500
CAUSING US TO ACCOMMODATE
OUR BEHAVIOR BY DEVELOPING

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.760
SCHEMA TO RETURN TO A
STATE OF EQUILIBRIUM.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.260
THIS EQUILIBRIUM
MOTIVATES US

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.030
TO SEEK OUT
NEW EXPERIENCES

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.130
WHICH STARTS THE
PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:55.660
WE MOVE THROUGH FOUR
STAGES DURING THIS

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.960
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT UNTIL
WE ATTAIN ADULT THOUGHT.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.630
THIS IS PIAGET'S VIEW, BUT
MOST PARTS OF HIS RESEARCH

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.500
HAVE BEEN EXAMINED,
CRITICIZED,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.560
AND CHEWED OVER AND
THIS HAS LED TO

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.900
A REFORMULATION
OF HIS THEORY.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.430
PIAGET'S METHODS HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN CRITICIZED

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.130
BY THE PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO
FAVOR MORE STRINGENT

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:19.660
SCIENTIFIC METHODS.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.960
MOST OF HIS THEORY IS
BASED ON THE RESULTS OF

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.060
THE METHOD KNOWN AS
"CLINICAL INTERVIEW"

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.430
WHEREBY THE ANSWER TO A
QUESTION FORMS THE BASIS

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.230
OF THE NEXT
QUESTION ASKED

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.400
AND THIS MAKES THE
WHOLE PROCEDURE

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.300
RATHER SUBJECTIVE
AND UNQUANTIFIABLE.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.400
SUBJECTIVE BECAUSE
EACH PARTICIPANT HAS A

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.960
DIFFERENT SET OF QUESTIONS
AND UNQUANTIFIABLE BECAUSE

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.160
THE TYPE OF DATA
RECEIVED CAN'T READILY

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.360
BE ANALYZED
STATISTICALLY.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.260
HE IS ALSO CRITICIZED
FOR LEADING CHILDREN

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.700
IN THE USE OF QUESTIONS
AND OF SELECTIVELY

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.430
TAKING THEIR VERBAL
RESPONSES AS EXAMPLES

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.800
TO ILLUSTRATE A THEORY
THAT HE'S ALREADY CREATED.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.800
THE ARGUMENT IS THAT
THE PROCESS BY WHICH

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.060
HIS THEORY WAS ARRIVED
AT IS NOT REPLICABLE

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.560
WHICH MAKES
IT UNTESTABLE.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.960
A COUNTER-ARGUMENT
YOU COULD PUT FORWARD

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.360
IS THAT IF PIAGET HAD
USED MORE RIGOROUS

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.530
SCIENTIFIC METHODS
HE MIGHT NEVER HAVE

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:09.160
PRODUCED SUCH A
COMPREHENSIVE THEORY.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.300
MANY OF THE LESS FORMAL
METHODS WHICH YOU MAY HAVE

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.860
USED YOURSELVES,
SUCH AS THE CASE STUDY,

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.160
PRODUCE VERY RICH DETAILED
INFORMATION ABOUT A SMALL

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.660
NUMBER OF CHILDREN
RATHER THAN VERY LITTLE

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.060
INFORMATION ABOUT A VERY
LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:26.660
WHICH WE FIND IN
SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.530
RECENTLY QUALITATIVE
METHODS SUCH AS THE CASE

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.160
STUDY AND OBSERVATIONAL
STUDIES, RATHER THAN

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.100
QUANTITATIVE METHODS SUCH
AS EXPERIMENTS USING

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.130
SOPHISTICATED STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS, HAVE ATTRACTED

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.030
ATTENTION AS GRADUALLY
THE LIMITATIONS OF THE

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:48.030
SCIENTIFIC APPROACH
HAVE BECOME APPARENT.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:51.760
RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS
THAT PIAGET UNDERESTIMATED

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.360
THE ABILITIES OF THE CHILD
IN THE FIRST TWO STAGES

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.400
AND OVERESTIMATED
THE ABILITIES

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.730
OF THE FORMAL
OPERATIONAL CHILD.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:32:00.800
OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT
HIS THEORY NEGLECTS THE

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.530
IMPORTANCE OF LANGUAGE AND
OF SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.760
WHICH ARE SO
CENTRAL IN CHILDHOOD

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.800
MUST PLAY A PART IN
OUR MENTAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:18.460
(BABY BABBLING)

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.900
TO PIAGET'S CREDIT,
HE HAS BEEN FLEXIBLE

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.960
IN HIS WILLINGNESS
TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.160
IN THE LIGHT OF OTHER
PEOPLES' RESEARCH.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.000
THERE ARE HUGE NUMBERS
OF RESEARCH FINDINGS

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.260
WHICH DISAGREE
WITH PIAGET'S.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.160
WE'LL JUST LOOK
AT A FEW OF THESE

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.530
MORE SIGNIFICANT ONES
AND THE MORE RECENT ONES,

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.660
STARTING WITH THE
SENSORI-MOTOR STAGE.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.200
EXPERIMENTS BY BAUER
SUGGEST THAT BABIES MAY

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.630
ACQUIRE OBJECT PERMANENCE
AS EARLY AS ONE MONTH OLD

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.030
- MUCH EARLIER THAN
PIAGET SUGGESTED.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.130
FOR EXAMPLE, IN ONE
EXPERIMENT WITH ONE

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:50.460
TO FOUR MONTH OLDS, HE
MADE AN OBJECT DISAPPEAR

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.830
BY BRINGING A SCREEN
DOWN IN FRONT OF IT.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.300
WHEN THE SCREEN LIFTED
THE OBJECT WAS NOT THERE

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.460
AND BAUER LOOKED FOR
EVIDENCE OF SURPRISE

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.730
IN THE BABY SUCH
AS A RAISED PULSE.

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:02.330
IF THE BABY SHOWED
SURPRISE WHEN THE OBJECT

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.300
IS MISSING RATHER THAN
WHEN IT'S PRESENT,

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.000
THEN THIS SUGGESTS
AN UNDERSTANDING

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.200
OF OBJECT PERMANENCE.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.700
BAUER ALSO SHOWED THREE
TO FOUR MONTH OLDS

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.600
AN INTERESTING OBJECT
WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.900
REACHED OUT FOR.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:16.130
WHEN THEY START TO REACH
FOR IT THE LIGHTS WERE

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:18.500
SWITCHED OFF AND INFRARED
LIGHTS ENABLED BAUER

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.460
TO SEE THAT THE BABIES
STILL CONTINUED

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.600
TO TRY AND REACH
THE OBJECT.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.300
THIS SUGGESTS THAT
ALTHOUGH THEY COULDN'T

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.730
SEE THE OBJECT

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.560
THEY STILL BELIEVED
IT CONTINUED TO EXIST.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.730
PIAGET DIDN'T HAVE
SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.130
TO HELP HIM AT THAT TIME
AND BAUER SUGGESTS THAT

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.230
IN THE TYPICAL
PIAGET TEST

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:38.200
THE BABY IS JUST SHOWING
IMMATURE MOTOR ABILITIES.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.260
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY CAN'T
CONTROL THEIR HEAD

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.630
OR DIRECT THEIR
EYES FOR VERY LONG.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.930
A GREAT DEAL OF
RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.100
THE PRE-OPERATIONAL
STAGE.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.060
PIAGET THOUGHT THAT
CHILDREN AT THIS AGE

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.860
WERE EGOCENTRIC
AND NOT ABLE TO

00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.330
TAKE ANOTHER'S
VIEWPOINT INTO ACCOUNT.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.060
THEIR INABILITY AT THE
THREE MOUNTAINS TASKS

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.130
DEMONSTRATES THIS.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:01.630
HOWEVER, MARTIN HUGHES
DEVISED A STUDY IN WHICH

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.300
A CHILD HAS TO HIDE A DOLL
AROUND A CROSS-SHAPED

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.260
ARRANGEMENT OF WALLS FROM
A POLICEMAN-SHAPED DOLL.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.660
TO DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY,
THE CHILD HAS TO TAKE

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.400
THE POLICEMAN'S POINT
OF VIEW INTO ACCOUNT.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.200
THE TEST WAS REPEATED
WITH TWO POLICEMEN,

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.500
REQUIRING THE CHILD TO
COORDINATE TWO VIEWPOINTS.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.730
THE CHILDREN WERE
TRAINED BEFOREHAND

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.030
AND IF THEY MADE A MISTAKE
IT WAS CAREFULLY EXPLAINED

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.330
TO ENSURE THAT
THEY UNDERSTOOD.

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:27.160
THE RESULTS
WERE DRAMATIC.

00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.100
NINETY PERCENT OF CHILDREN
BETWEEN THREE AND A HALF

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.130
AND FIVE GAVE THE
CORRECT ANSWER,

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:33.000
WHEREAS PIAGET
CLAIMED THAT CHILDREN

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.960
UNDER EIGHT
COULDN'T DE-CENTER.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.760
PERNER ARGUES THAT CHILDREN
ARE NOT EGOCENTRIC

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:42.630
BUT INTELLECTUAL
REALISTS.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.800
HE BASED THIS
ASSUMPTION ON RESEARCH

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:46.600
WHICH SHOWS THAT
CHILDREN SEEM TO

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.300
INTERPRET THE THREE
MOUNTAINS TASK

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.060
AS REQUIRING THEM TO
PICK OUT THE PICTURE

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.360
WHICH BEST SHOWS
REALITY AS THEY KNOW IT.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.430
THIS TENDENCY TO REPRESENT
WHAT THEY KNOW HAS REALLY

00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:58.000
BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN
CHILDRENS' DRAWINGS.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.830
FOR EXAMPLE, IF
CHILDREN KNOW THAT

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.030
A CAR HAS FOUR WHEELS
THEY DRAW FOUR WHEELS

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:04.360
EVEN IF THEY
CAN ONLY SEE TWO.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.230
STOP THE VIDEO
NOW AND CONSIDER

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.460
WHAT OTHER EXPLANATIONS
THERE MIGHT BE

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.460
WHY THE THREE
MOUNTAINS TASK AND

00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.300
THE POLICEMAN/CHILD
EXPERIMENTS

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.730
FOUND SUCH STRIKINGLY
DIFFERENT RESULTS.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:16.700
THESE COULD BE
METHODOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.230
AS WELL AS BASED ON
THE TASK REQUIRED.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.760
WELL, THERE ARE MANY
POSSIBLE REASONS AND IT'S

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.460
PROBABLY A COMBINATION
OF SEVERAL.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.600
FIRST OF ALL, HUGHES MADE
SURE THAT THE CHILDREN

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.460
HAD A RUN THROUGH
WHAT THEY HAD TO DO,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.700
AS WELL AS MAKING SURE
THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.160
THE LANGUAGE INVOLVED.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.960
THE SCENARIO OF HIDING FROM
PEOPLE WAS A FAMILIAR ONE.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.660
AS MARGARET
DONALDSON SAYS

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.060
"IT MAKES HUMAN
SENSE TO THE CHILD".

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.430
THE FAMILIARITY OF THE
POLICEMAN AND THE WALLS

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:55.360
MAKE IT EVEN
MORE RELEVANT.

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.460
MANY CHILDREN HAVE NEVER
EVEN EXPERIENCED MOUNTAINS.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.830
THERE WERE ALSO NO RIGHT
OR LEFT REVERSALS REQUIRED

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:04.560
IN THE POLICEMAN TASK AND
THERE WERE DIRECT HANDS-ON

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.760
EXPERIENCE RATHER THAN JUST
PHOTOGRAPHS TO LOOK AT.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.160
THIS PRACTICAL CAN
BE EASILY CARRIED OUT

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.060
USING LEGO OR MAKING
CARDBOARD WALLS.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.000
WE ADAPTED THE
MATERIALS TO CARRY OUT

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
A DEMONSTRATION
OURSELVES SIMILAR TO

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.430
THE THREE MOUNTAINS TASK
IN THAT IT REQUIRED

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:21.760
LEFT-RIGHT REVERSALS
AND USED PHOTOGRAPHS,

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.160
BUT WITH THE DIFFERENCE
OF USING TRAINING

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.500
AND FAMILIAR OBJECTS.

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.430
A SET OF PHOTOS
WERE PRODUCED

00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.700
SHOWING EACH OF
FOUR VIEWPOINTS.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.300
AFTER TRAINING, THE CHILD
WAS ASKED TO SELECT

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.100
THEIR OWN VIEWPOINT
AND THEN THAT OF

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.000
PINK PANTHER FROM
WHERE HE WAS SITTING.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.300
<i>...CAN SEE THAT ONE.</i>

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.960
<i>VERY GOOD.</i>

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.160
<i>THANK YOU VERY
MUCH INDEED,</i>

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.160
<i>THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.</i>

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.060
AS WOULD BE EXPECTED,
WE DIDN'T GET

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.000
QUITE SUCH IMPRESSIVE
RESULTS AS HUGHES

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.760
BUT WE CERTAINLY
FOUND FIVE-YEAR-OLDS

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.860
WHO COULD PICK PINK
PANTHER'S CORRECT VIEW.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.600
PIAGET'S METHODS OF
RESEARCH INTO CONSERVATION

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.200
MAY ALSO HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.160
CHILDRENS' ABILITIES.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.460
IN HIS ORIGINAL
CONSERVATION OF NUMBERS,

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.060
FOR EXAMPLE, TWO ROWS OF
EQUALLY SPACED COUNTERS,

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.160
WHICH THE CHILD
AGREES ARE IDENTICAL,

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.360
ARE THEN TRANSFORMED
BY THE ADULT.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.830
TYPICALLY, PRE-OPERATIONAL
CHILDREN SAY THAT

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.730
THERE ARE LESS WHEN THE
SHAPE OF THE ROW CHANGES.

00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:22.600
HOWEVER, IN MCGARRIGLE
AND DONALDSON'S STUDY

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.160
THEY USED AN ACCIDENTAL
TRANSFORMATION CONDITION

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.460
IN WHICH A NAUGHTY TEDDY
IS PRODUCED BY THE

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:30.600
EXPERIMENTER WHICH THEN
MESSES UP ONE ROW.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.300
COMPARED WITH THE ADULT
DELIBERATELY CHANGING

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.600
THE ROWS, MANY MORE
FOUR TO FIVE YEAR OLDS

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.660
APPEARED ABLE
TO CONSERVE

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.960
IF IT APPEARED
TO BE AN ACCIDENT.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.960
NEILSON REPLICATED THE
RESULTS OF MCGARRIGLE

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.300
AND DONALDSON, BUT WHEN
THEY ASKED THE CHILDREN

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.030
TO EXPLAIN WHY THE TWO ROWS
STILL HAD THE SAME NUMBER,

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.230
THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE
IN THE NUMBERS WHO GAVE

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:52.800
A LOGICAL REASON
BETWEEN THE INTENTIONAL

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.760
ADULT CONDITION AND THE
NAUGHTY TEDDY CONDITION.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.160
IT SEEMS POSSIBLE, THEN,
THAT CHILDREN SIMPLY

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.000
DISREGARD THE TRANSFORMATION
MADE BY NAUGHTY TEDDY

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.500
AS IRRELEVANT OR
AS PART OF A GAME

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.000
WHILE TAKING THAT PERFORMED
BY THE EXPERIMENTER

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.430
VERY SERIOUSLY.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.900
THUS, THEY'RE
LIKELY TO GIVE

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.660
A SUPERFICIALLY
CORRECT ANSWER

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:17.230
WHICH OVERESTIMATES
THEIR ABILITY TO CONSERVE.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.500
WE CAN SEE FROM THESE
STUDIES JUST HOW DIFFICULT

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.800
IT CAN BE TO GET RELIABLE
ANSWERS OUT OF CHILDREN

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.230
WHEN TESTING THEM WITH
THEIR VERY LIMITED ABILITY

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:26.430
TO EXPRESS
THEIR THOUGHTS.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:29.230
THE TYPE OF LANGUAGE USED
IN EXPERIMENTS IS CENTRAL

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.560
TO THE INTERPRETATION
OF THE RESULTS.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.560
CHILDRENS' UNDERSTANDING
OF ADULT LANGUAGE

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.930
IS LIMITED, AND QUESTIONS
NEED TO BE DEVISED

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.060
THAT MATCH THE LEVEL
OF LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:39.800
OF THE CHILD.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.960
THERE ARE ALSO MANY
OTHER WAYS IN WHICH

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.400
THE QUESTION OR TASK
CAN BE MISUNDERSTOOD

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.660
DUE TO SOCIAL
EXPECTATIONS.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.430
THE CHILD HAS A
CERTAIN SET OF BELIEFS

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.730
ABOUT ADULTS WHICH MAY
AFFECT THEIR RESPONSE,

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.160
SUCH AS "ADULTS ALWAYS
TELL THE TRUTH" OR

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:56.500
"NO ONE ASKS A QUESTION
TWICE WITHOUT A GOOD REASON".

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.260
TAKE A TYPICAL CONSERVATION
OF LENGTH STUDY.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.230
THE ADULT ASKS, "ARE THEY
BOTH THE SAME LENGTH?

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:06.060
THEN TRANSFORMS THE STICKS,
STRAWS, PENCILS, OR WHATEVER,

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.530
AND THEN ASKS THE VERY
SAME QUESTION AGAIN.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.530
OBVIOUSLY THE CHILD
MAY THINK THAT

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:12.560
THE ADULT EXPECTS
A DIFFERENT ANSWER

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.630
OR THEY WOULDN'T
REPEAT THE QUESTION.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:17.130
THESE SORT OF QUESTIONS
ALSO ASSUME THAT THE CHILD

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:20.430
KNOWS THE MEANING OF THE
WORDS "LENGTH" OR "LONGER".

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.230
PAUL LIGHT HAS SUGGESTED
THAT ALL TESTING CONDITIONS

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.800
INTRODUCE VERY SUBTLE
BIASES AND, IN THE CASE

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:27.900
OF CONSERVATION
EXPERIMENTS, IT MAY BE

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.900
THE NEED TO GIVE WHAT
THEY SEE AS A SOCIALLY

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.700
ACCEPTABLE ANSWER WHICH
WILL PLEASE THE ADULT.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.500
THE PHRASING OF
THE QUESTION,

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.060
NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION,
AND EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:41.830
CAN ALL AFFECT THE
CHILD'S RESPONSE.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.760
<i>YES, THEY ARE!</i>

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.900
<i>NO, BECAUSE THAT
ONE'S LIKE THAT...</i>

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.800
<i>IF YOU MOVE THEM
BACK LIKE THAT</i>

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.160
<i>THEY'RE BOTH
THE SAME SIZE.</i>

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.030
<i>IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE MOVING THEM.</i>

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.500
THESE BIASES HAVE
IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.530
AND THE METHODS TEACHERS
USE TO QUESTION PUPILS

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:04.830
IN THE CLASSROOM.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.600
LIGHT DESIGNED A CONDITION
OF THE CONSERVATION OF

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.100
LIQUID EXPERIMENT WHEREBY
INSTEAD OF LIQUID BEING

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.160
DELIBERATELY TRANSFERRED
TO A DIFFERENTLY SHAPED

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.330
GLASS FOR APPARENTLY
NO GOOD REASON,

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.130
HE "DISCOVERED" THAT
ONE GLASS WAS CHIPPED

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.300
AND HE CASUALLY
REPLACED IT.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.460
THE CUES PICKED UP BY
THE CHILD FROM THE ADULT

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.730
IN THIS INCIDENTAL
CONDITION MAY BE THAT

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.800
THIS TRANSFORMATION
MAKES NO DIFFERENCE;

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.260
JUST IGNORE IT.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.030
AND THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT CHILDREN DO

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:33.530
WHEN THEY CONSERVE.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.930
THERE ARE MANY SOUND,
LOGICAL REASONS THAT WE

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.930
MIGHT GIVE IN THE
CONSERVATION OF LIQUID

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:40.360
- FOR EXAMPLE, WHY THE
LIQUID IS THE SAME.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.430
WE MIGHT NOTE THAT THE
HEIGHT IN THE GLASS

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:45.030
IS COMPENSATED FOR BY THE
WIDTH OF THE FAT GLASS,

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.400
OR THAT IF THE
TRANSFORMATION WAS REVERSED

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.800
THAT THE QUANTITIES WOULD
SEEM TO BE THE SAME, AND

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.660
OF COURSE THAT NOTHING'S
BEEN ADDED OR TAKEN AWAY.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.030
HOWEVER, IT'S PROBABLY
UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.400
A JUST CONSERVING CHILD
TO BE ABLE TO TELL YOU

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:59.860
ONE OF THESE REASONS
EVEN IF THEY KNEW THEM

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:01.860
AND THIS MAKES IT
DIFFICULT TO KNOW IF

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:05.160
THE CHILD IS A CONSERVER
OR IS JUST GUESSING RIGHT.

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.800
FLAVELL POINTED OUT THAT
BOTH FALSE POSITIVES

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.930
AND FALSE NEGATIVES
ARE POSSIBLE

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.400
IN THIS KIND OF TASK.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.100
THAT'S TO SAY THAT A CHILD
CAN GIVE A CORRECT ANSWER

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.860
WITHOUT HAVING THE COGNITIVE
SKILL WE'RE INVESTIGATING,

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.000
OR IT CAN FAIL TO
GIVE A CORRECT ANSWER

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.360
WHEN IT ACTUALLY
POSSESSES THE SKILL.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.430
COWAN MADE THE VALID
OBSERVATION THAT

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.730
MOST CONSERVATIONS ARE
APPROXIMATIONS ANYWAY.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.460
IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT PHYSICS, YOU MAY

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.900
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE
DIFFERENTIAL EVAPORATION

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:35.430
FROM THE SURFACE OF THE
LIQUID IN THE TWO GLASSES

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.830
OR THE RESIDUE OF DROPS
LEFT IN THE FIRST GLASS

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.860
AFTER TRANSFER.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.400
IF A CHILD SEES A DROP OF
WATER LEFT IN THE GLASS,

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.100
DOES HE OR SHE
SEE IT AS EMPTY?

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.200
MOVING ON TO RESEARCH
FINDINGS RELATED TO

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.230
THE FINAL STAGE, THE
FORMAL OPERATIONAL,

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.860
PIAGET THOUGHT
THAT MOST PEOPLE

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.500
REACH FORMAL OPERATIONS

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.430
AND APPLY IT GENERALLY
TO EVERYTHING.

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:57.660
BUT IT SEEMS THAT HE
WAS WRONG ABOUT THIS.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.760
YOU MAY LIKE TO TEST
YOURSELF BY PAUSING

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.600
THE VIDEO FOR A MINUTE AND
ANSWERING THIS QUESTION.

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.930
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF NO
MORE BABIES WERE BORN?

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.500
THE CONCRETE OPERATION
THINKER WOULD RESPOND BY

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:24.130
LOOKING PUZZLED, SAYING
IT WAS SILLY, OR REFER TO

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:25.860
SOMETHING CONCRETE
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.900
AFFECT WHAT THEY
WOULD SEE SUCH AS

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.400
THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY MORE
BABIES IN THE STREET.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:33.030
A FORMAL OPERATIONS
THINKER WOULD BE ABLE

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.300
TO DEAL WITH SUCH A
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.830
WITH IDEAS SUCH AS THE
EFFECT ON THE FUTURE

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:41.760
OF MANKIND, THE IMPORTANCE
OF EXISTING SPERM BANKS,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.800
OR THE CRIPPLING
EFFECT ON

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:46.000
THE BABY CARE
PRODUCTS INDUSTRY.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.860
BUT DON'T PANIC IF
YOU DIDN'T THINK

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.930
FORMAL OPERATIONALLY
ON THIS OCCASION,

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:52.060
THOUGH YOU UNDOUBTEDLY
NEED TO IN STUDYING

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.230
SOMETHING AS ABSTRACT
AS PSYCHOLOGY.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.730
RESEARCH CARRIED OUT BY
NEIMARK FOUND THAT ONLY

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:01.130
30% OF ADULTS USE FORMAL
OPERATION THOUGHT AT ALL.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:03.030
THE USUAL WAY TO
TEST THIS IS TO GIVE

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:04.960
A BATTERY OF FORMAL
OPERATIONAL TASKS

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.730
INVOLVING ABSTRACT THOUGHT,
PROBLEM SOLVING, ETC.,

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.960
TO SUBJECTS OF
11 YEARS UPWARDS.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.500
AN EXPERIMENT BY
MARTORANO, FOR EXAMPLE,

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.030
GAVE TEN DIFFERENT TASKS
TO 80 DIFFERENT SUBJECTS

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.630
IN GROUPS AGED 11,
13, 15, AND 17 YEARS.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.330
IT WAS FOUND THAT THE OLDER
STUDENTS DID MUCH BETTER,

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:25.330
THAT THERE WAS A MAJOR
SPURT IN FORMAL OPERATION

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.300
THINKING BETWEEN 13 AND
15, AND THAT ALL TASKS

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.930
WERE NOT FOUND TO BE
EQUALLY DIFFICULT.

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.530
IN FACT, IT WAS FOUND THAT
ONLY TWO 17-YEAR-OLDS

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.660
SHOWED FORMAL OPERATIONAL
THOUGHT ON ALL TASKS.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.200
CONCRETE THOUGHT IS, AFTER
ALL, QUITE SUFFICIENT

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.560
FOR EVERYDAY USE, AND IF
YOUR LIFE DOESN'T DEMAND IT,

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.730
YOU MAY HAVE VERY
LITTLE PRACTICE

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.130
AT USING FORMAL
OPERATION THOUGHT.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.660
SO THESE FINDINGS, AND
MANY OTHERS BESIDES,

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.400
SUGGEST THAT PIAGET'S
STAGES EXIST BUT THAT

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.830
THE AGES HE SUGGESTED WERE
NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.830
THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE
FACT THAT HE TESTED

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:59.660
SMALL SAMPLES, USED HIS
OWN CHILDREN WHO HAD

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:02.300
PROFESSIONAL PARENTS, AND
THAT MANY OF HIS TASKS

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.230
AND THE LANGUAGE
HE USED IN THEM

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.000
WERE NOT RELEVANT
TO TODAY'S CHILDREN.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.500
THERE'S BEEN MUCH DEBATE
ABOUT THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.230
IN DEVELOPING THOUGHT.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.900
JEROME BRUNER AGREES WITH
PIAGET ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.460
OF INNATE STRUCTURES IN
HELPING US TO ORGANIZE

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.800
OUR WORLD AND TO DEVELOP
THOUGHT AND THE IMPORTANCE

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.030
OF THE CHILD'S
ACTIVE INTERACTION

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.000
WITH THE ENVIRONMENT;
HOWEVER, FOR BRUNER,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.200
LANGUAGE AND LOGICAL
THINKING ARE INSEPARABLE.

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.430
LANGUAGE DOESN'T
REFLECT WHAT THE CHILD

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:32.800
IS THINKING, BUT
ACTUALLY SHAPES THOUGHT.

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.500
LANGUAGE PROVIDES THE
MEANS OF TRANSFORMING

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:38.230
EXPERIENCE AND CAN
DIRECTLY HELP THE CHILD

00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:40.500
TO THINK - FOR EXAMPLE,
BY FOCUSING ATTENTION

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.530
ON FEATURES IN
THE ENVIRONMENT,

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:44.960
BY ENCOURAGING
CATEGORIZATION,

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:47.760
PROBLEM SOLVING,
ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE,

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.560
AND ALLOWING
HYPOTHETICAL THOUGHT.

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.200
HOWEVER, FOR PIAGET,
LANGUAGE IS MERELY A TOOL

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:56.800
TO BE USED IN
OPERATIONAL THINKING.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.900
CHILDREN
EXPERIENCE FIRST,

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.060
AND THEN USE LANGUAGE
TO REPRESENT THEIR THOUGHT.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.460
RESEARCH TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
THE TWO POINTS OF VIEW

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.830
HAS BEEN BASED ON
SUGGESTIONS THAT TRAINING

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:09.460
SPEEDS UP CHILDRENS'
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.260
BUT THE RESULTS
ARE MIXED.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.600
IN GENERAL, THE DEBATE
TENDS TO FAVOR PIAGET'S

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.200
POSITION AND WE MAY ACCEPT
THAT WHILE LANGUAGE MAY BE

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.430
NECESSARY FOR OPERATIONAL
THINKING OR SYMBOLIC

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:21.860
THOUGHT TO DEVELOP, IT IS
NOT A SUFFICIENT CAUSE.

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.860
OVERALL, PIAGET'S THEORY
HAS BEEN OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.800
IN BEING THE FIRST TO
SHOW US THAT CHILDREN

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.300
ARE NOT JUST MINI ADULTS,
THAT CHILDREN ARE NOT

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.460
JUST LESS KNOWLEDGEABLE,
BUT THEIR THINKING

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:33.860
IS QUALITIVELY
DIFFERENT FROM ADULTS.

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.000
THAT A CHILD MUST GO
THROUGH THE ACTIONS

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.200
HIMSELF RATHER THAN
LEARN FROM ADULTS.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.360
THAT CHILDREN GO THROUGH
THE SAME STAGES

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.400
OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT
IN THE SAME ORDER

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.460
BUT AT DIFFERENT RATES.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.400
THAT CHILDREN ARE
VERY LIMITED TO

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.460
THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE
OF THE WORLD.

00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:50.130
AND THERE'S NO POINT
IN ARGUING LOGICALLY

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.860
WITH YOUNG CHILDREN

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.030
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE ADULT LOGIC.

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:55.960
ONLY MATURITY AND
EXPERIENCE CAN HELP

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.130
A CHILD TO
DEVELOP THOUGHT,

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.560
AND THE EXPERIENCE SHOULD
BE IN THE FORM OF DOING.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.730
THESE IDEAS HAVE HELPED TO
SHAPE THE WAY WE BRING OUR

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:05.830
CHILDREN UP AND THE WAY WE
EDUCATE THEM IN SCHOOLS.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.700
WE NOW KNOW THAT PARENTS
AND TEACHERS NEED TO

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.360
PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH THE
FREEDOM AND OPPORTUNITY

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.060
TO HAVE A WIDE RANGE
OF ACTIVE EXPERIENCES

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.900
WHICH THEY CAN ASSIMILATE
AND ACCOMMODATE TO.

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.460
STRICTLY SPEAKING, A
CHILD CAN'T BE TAUGHT,

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:22.560
BUT HIS COGNITIVE GROWTH
CAN BE FACILITATED.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.130
SCHOOLING PROVIDES THE
CHILD WITH OPPORTUNITIES

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:27.260
TO USE THEIR
NATURAL CURIOSITY

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.730
TO ACTIVELY EXPLORE
THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.260
PLAY IS VERY IMPORTANT
AS AN ACTIVE PROCESS

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:34.560
IN WHICH CHILDREN DIRECTLY
ACT ON THEIR WORLD

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.200
AND MAKE SENSE OF IT.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.400
PLAY IS A MAJOR WAY
IN WHICH THE CHILD

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.160
LEARNS IN PRE-SCHOOL

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.800
AND OFFERS A MODEL FOR
LEARNING BEYOND THAT.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.100
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT
NURSERY AND PRIMARY SCHOOL

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.560
PRACTICE NOW HAS A MUCH
GREATER EMPHASIS ON

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:50.200
DISCOVERY LEARNING AND
ACTIVITY BASED WORK

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.600
WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT
THE LIKELY READINESS

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:55.730
OF THE CHILD IN
COGNITIVE TERMS.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.000
IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT
CONCRETE OBJECTS

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.530
MUST BE USED TO
INTRODUCE NEW CONCEPTS

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:02.930
AND THAT WHAT CHILDREN
LEARN MUST BE LINKED

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:06.360
TO IDEAS THAT THEY HAVE
ALREADY EXPERIENCED.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:08.760
THE TEACHER'S TASK, THEN,
IS TO PROMOTE COGNITIVE

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.230
GROWTH BY PROVIDING
A CHALLENGING AND

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.930
STIMULATING PROGRAM OF
ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.000
APPROPRIATE TO A CHILD'S
DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.600
WITH OLDER CHILDREN,
SCIENCE AND MATH

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.730
TEACHING PROGRAMS
ARE NOW DESIGNED

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:23.800
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
THE JUMPS INTO

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.830
OPERATIONAL THOUGHT
AND INTO FORMAL THOUGHT

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.860
AND OFFER APPROPRIATE
HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.060
HOWEVER MUCH VALIDITY
PIAGET'S IDEAS

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.660
WOULD SEEM TO HAVE, IT
IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.930
IF THEY WORK
IN PRACTICE.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.660
THE NUFFIELD SCIENCE
PROGRAMS NOW BEING USED

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.300
RELATE WELL TO
PIAGET'S IDEAS,

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.230
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT
THEY'RE EFFECTIVE,

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.400
THEY CAN BE SEEN TO
VALIDATE HIS THEORY.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:49.730
IN PRESCHOOL EDUCATION,
PIAGET'S IDEAS

00:47:49.730 --> 00:47:52.500
HAVE NOW BECOME
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.530
EVIDENCE FOR
EFFECTIVENESS, THOUGH,

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:56.560
IS DOGGED BY
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.830
WHAT EFFECTIVENESS IS, LET
ALONE HOW TO MEASURE IT.

00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.100
IS EDUCATION TO
ACQUIRE SKILLS?

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.100
IS IT TO LEARN
KNOWLEDGE?

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.960
IS IT TO DEVELOP
AS A HUMAN BEING

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.230
AND TAKE YOUR
PLACE IN SOCIETY?

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:10.500
THE LACK OF AGREEMENT
ON WHERE THE EMPHASIS

00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.100
SHOULD FALL IS REFLECTED
IN DEBATES ON THE VALUE OF

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.700
EDUCATIONAL TESTING, AND
IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT

00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.600
TO SAY THAT PIAGET
IS RIGHT OR WRONG.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.030
IN GENERAL, THOUGH,
PIAGET'S WORK CAN BE

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:23.600
CONSIDERED TO HAVE HAD
A LIBERATING AND HIGHLY

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.530
BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON
CONVENTIONAL EDUCATION.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:29.800
JEROME BRUNER WHOM
WE MENTIONED EARLIER

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:32.430
WAS GREATLY INFLUENCED
BY PIAGET'S WORK AND

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:34.760
DEVELOPED HIS OWN THEORY
OF COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.000
WHICH HAS MANY
SIMILARITIES.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.730
HE AGREES THAT WE'RE BORN
WITH AN ABILITY TO ORGANIZE

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:42.600
OUR WORLD AND THAT
MATURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.600
INTERACT TO PRODUCE
COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.360
BUT BRUNER SEES
DEVELOPMENT NOT IN TERMS

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.700
OF STAGES BUT IN
DIFFERENT MODES

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.030
OF REPRESENTING
THE WORLD.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.930
HE SPECIFIED THREE WAYS
IN WHICH WE CAN GAIN

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:56.830
KNOWLEDGE AND
UNDERSTANDING.

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.400
THE FIRST OF THESE
IS THE ENACTIVE MODE.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.630
THE CHILD REPRESENTS
OBJECTS AND ACTIONS

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:04.130
THROUGH THE MOTOR BEHAVIORS
THAT GO WITH THEM.

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:06.700
JUST AS ADULTS MAY
STILL BEST REPRESENT

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.360
SOME ROUTINE BEHAVIORS
IN TERMS OF ACTIONS

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.900
SUCH AS PUTTING ON
MAKEUP OR SHAVING.

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.860
THE SECOND MODE OF
REPRESENTATION TO EMERGE

00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:19.160
IS THE ICONIC, FROM THE
GREEK WORD "IMAGE".

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.900
THE CHILD OF ROUGHLY THE
SAME AGE AS THOSE IN

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:25.030
PIAGET'S PRE-OPERATION
STAGE DEALS WITH THE WORLD

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.730
IN TERMS OF IMAGES, THAT
IS, WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.960
THIS CAN BE SEEN IN
THE CHILD'S FAILURE

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.330
AT CONSERVATION TASKS.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:36.160
BOTH BRUNER AND PIAGET
AGREE THAT A CHANGE

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.360
OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE
OCCURS AT THE AGE OF

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.700
AROUND SIX
TO SEVEN YEARS.

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.860
FOR PIAGET IT'S A SHIFT
INTO OPERATIONAL THINKING,

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.460
BUT FOR BRUNER IT'S
THE ABILITY TO USE

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.730
THE SYMBOLIC MODE
OF REPRESENTATION,

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:51.160
HIS THIRD MODE.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.800
MOVEMENT INTO THIS
SYMBOLIC MODE OCCURS,

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.360
BRUNER BELIEVES, AS
A RESULT OF LANGUAGE.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.000
THE POWER OF SYMBOLIC
REASONING IS NEATLY

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.700
DEMONSTRATED BY BRUNER AND
KENNY'S WELL KNOWN STUDY

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:05.760
REQUIRING CHILDREN TO
RE-ORDER A DISTURBED ARRAY

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.860
OF GLASSES OF DIFFERENT
HEIGHTS AND WIDTHS.

00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.600
YOU CAN RE-CREATE THIS
EXPERIMENT EASILY USING

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.300
ANY ORDERED GROUPS OF
OBJECTS OR MATERIALS.

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:16.400
WE USED SOME TYPE
OF PLASTICINE.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.200
THE CHILDREN ARE SHOWN THE
LOGIC OF THE ARRANGEMENT

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.530
AND THEN ASKED INITIALLY
TO REARRANGE THE ORDER

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:23.230
OF THE PIECES.

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:25.430
THEY ARE THEN ASKED
TO RE-CREATE THE ARRAY

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.260
IN MIRROR IMAGE ORDER.

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.100
TYPICALLY, SIX-YEAR-OLDS
CAN RE-CREATE THE DISPLAY,

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.760
BUT HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY
WITH THE MIRROR IMAGE BIT.

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.900
<i>...AND YOU FILL
IN THE REST.</i>

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.060
HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO
BRUNER, SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.260
AND ABOVE WHO ARE NOW ABLE
TO THINK SYMBOLICALLY

00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.930
AND ARE NO LONGER TIED TO
THE IMAGE, COULD DO THIS.

00:50:46.930 --> 00:50:49.560
THEY RELIED UPON VERBAL
CUES TO GUIDE THEM

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:52.260
SUCH AS "GETS FATTER
GOING ONE WAY",

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:54.560
"GETS TALLER GOING
THE OTHER WAY".

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.800
THE CHILD USING IMAGES
CAN ONLY REPRODUCE.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.760
THE CHILD USING SYMBOLS
CAN RECONSTRUCT.

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.530
THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN PIAGET'S AND

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.460
BRUNER'S THEORIES IS
THE ROLE OF LANGUAGE.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:10.400
PIAGET BELIEVES THE MOVE
TO LOGICAL THOUGHT IS

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.830
THROUGH THE ACQUISITION
OF OPERATIONS.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:15.260
BRUNER SAYS THE LEAP
FROM ICONIC TO SYMBOLIC

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.330
IS DUE TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF LANGUAGE.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.760
WITHOUT LANGUAGE, BRUNER
SAYS, HUMAN THOUGHT

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:22.460
WOULD BE LIMITED TO
WHAT COULD BE LEARNED

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.560
THROUGH ACTIONS
AND IMAGES.

00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.630
THAT IS, THERE WOULD
BE NO SYMBOLIC THOUGHT

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:28.400
OR ABSTRACT THOUGHT.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:31.200
NOW WHAT OF FUTURE RESEARCH
IN COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT?

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.000
GRAND THEORIES ARE NOW OUT
OF FASHION, BUT DETAILED

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.860
AND PAINSTAKING RESEARCH
CONTINUES APACE.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.360
MAJOR AREAS OF RECENT
RESEARCH INTEREST

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.860
ARE META-COGNITION AND
THE THEORY OF MIND.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.100
I'LL TELL YOU A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT EACH.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.530
META-COGNITION MEANS
DEVELOPING A GREATER

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:50.030
AWARENESS OF OUR
COGNITIVE ACTIVITY.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.330
IT'S BEING AWARE
OF OUR OWN MEMORY,

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.630
OUR OWN COMPREHENSION,
OUR OWN LANGUAGE,

00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:56.400
AND OUR OWN IDEAS.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:59.330
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW.

00:51:59.330 --> 00:52:01.860
AS ONE RESEARCHER,
ROBINSON, POINTS OUT,

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:03.960
BEING AWARE OF HAVING
HEARD SOMETHING

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:06.500
BUT NOT HAVING TAKEN IT IN
- POSSIBLY THIS VIDEO -

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:08.230
BECAUSE YOU'RE
DISTRACTED

00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.400
OR THINKING ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE,

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.700
IS AN EXAMPLE
OF A META-COGNITIVE EXPERIENCE.

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.230
YOU'RE AWARE OF YOUR OWN
COGNITIVE PROCESSES,

00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:16.960
AT LEAST TO
SOME DEGREE.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.760
CHILDREN BECOME
INCREASINGLY ABLE

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.730
TO DO THIS AND ARE
THEREFORE ABLE TO CONTROL

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.630
THEIR OWN LEARNING
THROUGH USE OF

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.760
GOOD LEARNING AND
MEMORY STRATEGIES.

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:26.960
ANOTHER RESEARCHER,
MARKMAN, SHOWED THAT

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.060
CHILDREN OF FIVE WERE
LESS AWARE OF THEIR OWN

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.260
COGNITIVE PROCESSES
THAN SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:32.830
YOU CAN SHOW
THIS YOURSELF

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.430
BY FOLLOWING
HIS PROCEDURE.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.200
YOU'LL NEED SOME
FIVE-YEAR-OLD

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:37.660
AND SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
SUBJECTS.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.660
THE CHILDREN ARE GIVEN
INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.530
ABOUT HOW TO DO A MAGIC
TRICK OR HOW TO PLAY A GAME

00:52:42.530 --> 00:52:44.530
AND NOTE
THEIR REACTION.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:46.530
THE FIVE-YEAR-OLDS
WILL TEND TO CARRY ON,

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.900
DOING THE TASK, AND
THEY AREN'T SUCCESSFUL,

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:51.530
WHEREBY THE SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS
WILL REALIZE EARLY

00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:53.160
THAT THEY WON'T
BE ABLE TO DO IT

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.130
BECAUSE THEY HAD
INCOMPLETE INSTRUCTION.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.830
THEY'LL ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT
THE TASK AND MAY POINT OUT

00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:59.900
THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS
WERE INADEQUATE.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.100
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY MORE
ABLE TO RUN THROUGH

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.230
THE TASK MENTALLY
BEFORE ATTEMPTING IT

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:06.430
AND TO DISCOVER WHAT
THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:09.360
THIS CONTROL OVER YOUR
OWN MENTAL PROCESSES

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.430
IS OBVIOUSLY VERY IMPORTANT
FOR SUCCESSFUL LEARNING.

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:14.860
POOR STUDENTS COULD BE
SAID TO BE THOSE WHO ARE

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:17.130
UNAWARE OF WHAT THEY KNOW
AND WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW.

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:19.630
THAT IS, THOSE WITH
POOR META-COGNITION.

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:22.630
IN THEORY OF MIND STUDIES,
RESEARCHERS ARE INTERESTED

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.960
IN FINDING OUT AT WHAT
POINT CHILDREN START TO

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.730
BECOME AWARE
OF THEIR OWN

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:29.030
AND OF OTHERS'
COGNITIVE PROCESSES.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:31.330
WHEN DO THEY DEVELOP AN
UNDERSTANDING THAT OTHERS

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:33.330
HAVE INDEPENDENT
MINDS OF THEIR OWN,

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:35.260
AND WHEN DO THEY DEVELOP
THEIR OWN THEORY

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:37.000
OF HOW THE MIND WORKS?

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.060
IT'S EARLY DAYS YET
TO HAVE MANY FINDINGS,

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:41.060
BUT THERE ARE
SOME RECENT ONES;

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.300
FOR EXAMPLE, SOME
RESEARCH BY LESLIE.

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:46.060
A CHILD IS TOLD THAT SALLY
HIDES A SWEET IN A BOX

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:48.660
AND THEN GOES OUT, AND
THAT ANN THEN COMES IN

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.960
AND FINDS THE SWEET AND
MOVES IT TO A BASKET.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.230
THE CHILD IS THEN ASKED
TO SAY WHERE SALLY WILL

00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.530
LOOK FOR THE SWEET
WHEN SHE COMES BACK.

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.660
WILL THE CHILD
SAY WHAT SHE KNOWS

00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.060
OR WILL SHE UNDERSTAND
THAT SALLY WILL

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.430
STILL THINK HER SWEET
WILL BE IN THE BOX?

00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:04.400
THREE-YEAR-OLDS GENERALLY
GET THIS WRONG,

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.330
BUT FOUR-YEAR-OLDS
GET IT RIGHT.

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.700
IN OUR ADAPTATION OF
LESLIE'S EXPERIMENT,

00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.160
THE CHILD SEES PINK PANTHER
HIDE TWO SWEETS UNDER

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.500
A POLICEMAN'S HELMET AND
THEN GO OUT SHOPPING.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.430
WHILE HE'S OUT OF
SIGHT, NAUGHTY TEDDY

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:17.300
MOVES THE SWEETS
TO ANOTHER HELMET

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.400
AND THEN PINK PANTHER
RETURNS FROM THE SHOPS.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:24.000
<i>WHERE IS PINK PANTHER GOING
TO LOOK FOR HIS SWEETS?</i>

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.300
<i>UNDER THERE!</i>

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.260
<i>BUT THEY'RE NOT
THERE, ARE THEY?</i>

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.060
<i>AND THEN HE'LL
LOOK UNDER THERE!</i>

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:31.200
<i>AND WHERE WILL
HE FIND THEM?</i>

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.860
<i>UNDER THERE.
WELL DONE!</i>

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.830
THIS IS ILLUSTRATED BY
ANOTHER RECENT STUDY,

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.660
THIS TIME BY
PERNER ET AL.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:38.530
THEY SHOWED THE
FIVE-YEAR-OLDS

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:40.400
A SMARTIES TUBE AND ASKED
THEM WHAT WAS IN IT.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.600
NATURALLY ENOUGH, THEY ALL
THOUGHT IT WAS SMARTIES.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.560
IT WAS THEN REVEALED
THAT IT ONLY CONTAINED

00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.730
A PENCIL.

00:54:45.730 --> 00:54:47.930
SOME CHILDREN RECOGNIZED
THEIR FALSE BELIEF,

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.660
WHILE OTHERS SAID
THEY THOUGHT

00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:51.760
IT CONTAINED A
PENCIL ALL ALONG.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.660
THE INTERESTING POINT
HERE IS THAT WHEN ASKED

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.900
WHAT ANOTHER CHILD WOULD
THINK WAS IN THE TUBE,

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.900
THEY ALL ANSWERED
"PENCIL".

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.130
SO, ALTHOUGH ABLE TO ADMIT
THEIR OWN FALSE BELIEF,

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:04.500
THE CHILDREN ARE NOT ABLE
TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THEIR

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.800
FALSE BELIEF CAME FROM
AND SO CANNOT CORRECTLY

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.100
PREDICT HOW ANOTHER
CHILD WOULD ANSWER.

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.560
IN FACT, THE MAJORITY
OF CHILDREN UNDER FOUR

00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.160
CANNOT ADMIT THEIR
OWN FALSE BELIEF.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.400
RESEARCH IN THIS
AREA IS CONTINUING

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.660
AND INTERESTING
SPIN-OFFS SHEDDING LIGHT

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:21.330
ON COGNITION AND
AUTISM, FOR EXAMPLE.

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.760
RECENT RESEARCH WITH
AUTISTIC CHILDREN SUGGESTS

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:26.800
THAT THEY HAVE FAILED TO
DEVELOP A THEORY OF MIND.

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.260
HARRIS HAS SHOWN THAT
AUTISTIC CHILDREN ARE

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.530
UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
OTHER PEOPLE ARE LIKELY

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:34.360
TO BELIEVE AND WHAT OTHER
PEOPLES' WISHES MAY BE,

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.430
THUS PREVENTING THEM FROM
RELATING NORMALLY TO OTHERS.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:40.430
HE CALLED THIS A "SOCIAL
COGNITIVE DEFICIT".

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:42.800
THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH
HIGHLIGHTS THE CLOSE

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.900
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE
SOCIAL AND THE COGNITIVE

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.700
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD.

00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.700
AS WE SAID EARLIER,
PIAGET TENDS TO

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.760
PORTRAY THE COGNITIVE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILD

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.930
AS SEPARATE FROM
HIS SOCIAL WORLD.

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:55.760
RESEARCH NOW IS TRYING
TO REDRESS THE BALANCE.

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.260
WE NOW KNOW VASTLY
MORE ABOUT COGNITIVE

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.660
DEVELOPMENT THAN WE DID
EVEN TEN YEARS AGO.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.630
WE COULD THINK OF
THIS AS A PAINTING IN

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.830
OF PIAGET'S ALREADY
DRAWN SKETCH.

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.460
DETAIL IS ADDED

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.800
AND SOMETIMES THE
COMPOSITION IS CHANGED,

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:11.800
BUT THE BASIC PICTURE
IS RECOGNIZABLY THE SAME.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:14.560
WE GAIN ENORMOUSLY IN
RICHNESS AND DETAIL,

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:18.300
BUT SOMETIMES THE OUTLINES
GET A LITTLE HAZY.
