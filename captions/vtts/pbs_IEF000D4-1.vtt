00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.500
KINGSLEY:
In Cairo, a muezzin calls
faithful Muslims to prayer.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.660
It's the same call that sounds
five times a day, every day

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.830
in cities across the world.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:02.000
(<i> muezzin continues calling</i> )

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.160
Nearly a quarter of the people
on Earth respond to it

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.900
bound together by the enduring
spirit of Islam.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:20.200
(<i> muezzin continues calling</i> )

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.560
"God is most great,"
the muezzin calls.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.700
"I testify there is
no other god but God."

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.030
"I testify Muhammad is
the messenger of God."

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.900
"Come and pray...

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.060
"come and flourish.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.760
"God is most great.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.700
There is no god but God."

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.000
(<i> muezzin finishes prayer</i> )

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.860
In the unfolding of history,
Islamic civilization

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.300
has been one of humanity's
grandest achievements...

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.100
a worldwide power founded
simply on faith;

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.800
a spiritual revolution

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.500
that would shape the nations
of three continents

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.160
and launch an empire.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.560
For the West, much
of the history of Islam

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.160
has been obscured behind a veil
of fear and misunderstanding.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
Yet Islam's hidden history

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.930
is deeply and
surprisingly interwoven

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.360
with Western civilization.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.660
It was Muslim scholars

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.360
who reclaimed the ancient wisdom
of the Greeks

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.430
while Europe languished
in the Dark Ages.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.800
It was they who sowed the seeds
of the Renaissance

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000
600 years before the birth
of Leonardo da Vinci.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.130
From the way we heal the sick

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.100
to the numerals
we use for counting

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.060
cultures across the globe

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.100
have been shaped
by Islamic civilization.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.860
But all this began with the life
of a single ordinary man.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.400
And the profound message
he proclaimed

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.430
would change the world forever.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.960
His name was Muhammad.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:11.100

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.600
KINGSLEY:
To Muslims, the life of Muhammad
is a story revered.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.000
In its mysteries as much
as its certainties

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.430
there are beliefs held sacred.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.730
MAN:
Whatever we can tell about
the Prophet, of course

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.060
is screened through the filter

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.060
of what has been preserved
over the centuries

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.100
and what people
have wanted to preserve.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.030
And it's very difficult
to pull out

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.430
from all of these different
sources that are very adoring

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.360
the ordinary human being that...
the... the person that he was.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.360
KINGSLEY:
We do know that Muhammad
was born in or around 570 AD

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.630
in the sun-blasted
Arabian peninsula...

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.160
a land of savage scarcity
whose Bedouin tribes

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.730
were locked in a constant state
of tribal war.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.100
While still an infant

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.560
Muhammad's parents gave him
his first taste

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.400
of life in the desert.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.400
MAN:
Muhammad was from a town, Mecca

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.700
but he was sent off to live
with the Bedouin

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.000
because the people even
in the town of Mecca

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
felt that the Bedouin
were the holders

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.200
of the... the deeper
cultural Arab values.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.200
And the Bedouin view
the townspeople

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.760
as having lost their really
authentic roots in Arab culture

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.700
and the poetry and...
and animal husbandry

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.130
and all the things that they...
they do so well.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.630
(<i> goat bleating</i> )

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.830
KINGSLEY:
By the time Muhammad was six,
both of his parents had died

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.800
and he was taken under
the protection of his uncle

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.200
chief of his clan.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.560
Being an outsider gave him
a singular perspective.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.730
He'd been orphaned early
and developed very early on

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.130
a passionate sense of concern

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.200
for those who are
left out of society.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.030
To be orphaned
in a tribal society

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.900
where clan and
family relationships

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.900
are your keys to everything--

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.160
success, status,
honor, dignity--

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.600
is... is to face what it really
feels like to be marginalized.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.400
And that obviously had a...
a very deep impression on him

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.430
as a young man.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.100
WOMAN:
In some ways it was
detrimental, of course

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.800
to grow up without parents

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.400
but in other ways
he was so adaptable.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.860
He had many parents--

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.630
he had many fathers,
he had many mothers

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.100
so it made him a child
of everybody.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.400
(<i> bells tinkling</i> )

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.860
KINGSLEY:
Muhammad's clan, like Arabs
all across the Arabian peninsula

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.400
would share the stories

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.400
that had been told and retold
for generations.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.460
(<i> man speaking Arabic</i> )

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.730
MAN:
Pre-Islamic Arabian civilization
was largely an oral culture

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:21.900
and there was tremendous respect
for and admiration for people

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.230
who could express
themselves orally

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.200
and especially those
who could recite poetry

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.630
almost at the drop of a hat.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.960
Some of the most important
people in a tribe were the poets

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.660
because they sang
of the glory of the tribe;

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.130
they... they told
the story of the tribe.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.130
KINGSLEY:
To the Bedouin, the word
had a mystical importance.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.300
Poets linked the tribe
to its ancestors

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.900
and celebrated values
older than memory.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.030
Poetry was the sinew
that bound the Bedouin together

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.100
celebrating their victories,
lamenting their defeats.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.760
SELLS:
The poems themselves

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.900
like the poems of Homer
both celebrate this heroic ethos

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.200
and yet intimate,
in the deepest way

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.730
the tragedy that this war--

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.860
this ethos of constant tribal
warfare brings to people.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.460
KINGSLEY:
Warfare and conflict
were the grim realities

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.860
of a dangerous time.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.330
Muhammad's uncle taught him
the skills he'd need to survive

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.900
in a world where even a prophet
would wield a bow and arrow.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:46.630
In a wilderness punished by
the elements and bereft of water

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.500
rivalry over a single well

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.960
could provoke a blood feud
for generations.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.100
ATIL:
A real rivalry, real battle

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.530
would have been sometimes
quite bloody

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.660
so the allegiance of individuals
was to the family, immediately

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.230
and, at a larger extent,
to the tribe.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.730
KINGSLEY:
Without the tribe's protection,
no one could endure.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.430
Scattered across the peninsula
were countless factions

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.700
all embroiled
in bitter struggles

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.930
each defending its precious
grazing lands, trade routes

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.730
and, most importantly,
its wells.

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.600
BLOOM:
Well, you have to understand

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.630
I mean, most
of the lands are dry

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.200
and so water is...
is something that's...

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.400
everyone always
considers precious.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.000
SELLS:
For those of us in climates
that are more heavily watered

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.030
it's difficult to understand

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:50.260
the depth and the centrality
of the symbol of water

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.800
in societies that are desert

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.030
and in which it only rains
once or twice a year

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.730
and in which a little water

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.460
makes the difference
between life and death.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.060
(<i> drums beating,
 metal clanking</i> )

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.330
KINGSLEY:
Each clan had its own separate
gods and totems...

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:16.530
to water and wind,
fire and night.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.900
They were kept in
the caravan town of Mecca

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.830
in a shrine of wood,
stone and cloth.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:27.200
It was called the<i> "Ka'bah,"</i>
the Arabic word for cube.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.230
RENARD:
Pre-Islamic Arabs worshipped
a number of spirits

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.900
and they were generally
nature-oriented spirits

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.200
sometimes associated
with natural... natural features

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.800
like trees or rocks or springs.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.660
And the<i> Ka'bah</i> in Mecca was one
of a number of these sanctuaries

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.330
centered around a particular
cluster of deities.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:53.530
KINGSLEY:
It was said the Hebrew patriarch
Abraham, himself

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.460
built the<i> Ka'bah</i>
centuries before

00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.630
and that a sacred black stone
it held within

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.300
had fallen from the sky.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.660
In these turbulent times

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.760
the<i> Ka'bah</i> provided
a rare place of peace.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.600
Only here would the Bedouins
submit to a temporary truce

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.330
before returning to their
conflicts of the open sands.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.900
There was this one place
in the middle, around the<i> Ka'bah</i>

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.860
which was, from
even pre-Islamic times...

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.860
was a place of...
a sacred enclosure

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.900
where all people had
to put down their arms.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.700
And this, of course,
facilitated trading

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.200
because it meant that you
couldn't carry on your feuds

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.060
when you were doing
your buying and selling.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.260
The spiritual
and economic importance

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.930
of the<i> Ka'bah</i> in Mecca
are pretty hard to separate

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.730
in... as far as the pre-Islamic
Arabs are concerned.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:58.900
KINGSLEY:
The<i> Ka'bah</i> made Mecca
a vibrant center for trade.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.960
Here were found Arabian incense

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.060
exotic perfumes
and Indian spices

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.430
Chinese silks
and Egyptian linens.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.060
But perhaps the greatest
treasure to be found in Mecca

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.630
was the rich mixture
of cultures.

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.230
MAN:
There were people
who came through town

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.800
who had all kinds
of interesting experiences

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.500
to relate of faraway places.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.930
The local religion was mixed.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.060
There were Christians.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.330
There were Jews.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.530
And there were also
the Arabs of the desert

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.260
who followed an animist
type of religion.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.400
KINGSLEY:
Muhammad's world
was a center of trade

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.800
connecting the Mediterranean Sea
to the Indian Ocean

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.000
linking the aging empires
of Byzantium and Persia

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.860
to the great bazaars
of India and China.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.160
Muhammad became a merchant.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:12.200
In fact, he had
a great flair for trade.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.700
At the age of 25, while leading
a caravan northward to Syria

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.460
his talents caught the eye
of the shipment's owner

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.700
a wealthy widow named Khadijah.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:29.960
She was so taken with Muhammad,
she proposed marriage.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.460
ATIL:
Ah, Khadijah.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.300
Well, I think she was a mentor,
as well as a wife.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.660
A very strong lady,
who had her own business

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:40.600
and Muhammad was
helping her out.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.530
So it was a wonderful
partnership

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.830
and I'm sure he learned
a lot from her.

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.130
He had a tremendous
amount of contact

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:53.100
with merchants coming from
different parts of the world

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.060
passing through
the Arabian Peninsula.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.460
I think he was

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.960
a very intelligent man,
very open-minded

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.630
and he was able to communicate
with a great variety of peoples.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.700
He must have had
great charisma as well.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.160
KINGSLEY:
Muhammad had a way with people

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.730
and with resolving
their disputes.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.400
Once, when the Ka'bah
fell into disrepair

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:26.160
the clan chieftains quarreled
over who would have the honor

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.830
of putting the sacred black
stone back where it belonged.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.160
Before violence could erupt

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.330
Muhammad proposed
an equitable solution.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.560
United in the effort

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.430
the four leaders shared
the weight and the honor.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.030
In gratitude

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:59.600
they invited Muhammad himself
to replace the sacred stone.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.530
He became known as
"al-Ameen, the Trusted One."

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:06.330
DENNY:
There are all kinds
of indications

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.930
that he was
tremendously interested

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.430
in religious questions.

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.060
This is obviously not something

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.930
that an ordinary person
probably was interested in

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.230
in those days.

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:21.160
He talked to sages...
Arab sages.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.660
He talked to Jewish
and Christian sages

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.260
who lived in the area.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.130
He used to go up into
the rock hills around Mecca

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.730
and meditate,
think about things.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.200
And at some point,
had this extraordinary vision

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.700
which is spoken about
very evocatively and elusively.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.200
KINGSLEY:
In a cave above Mecca,
Muhammad had

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:56.830
an experience that would be
the defining moment of his life.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.730
An angel was said to appear
before him in the form of a man

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.260
instructing him to recite

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:07.500
in the name of God,
the Almighty.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.900
For Muhammad,
it was an encounter

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.600
as profound as it
was deeply disturbing.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.560
SELLS:
You get a sense

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.830
of what it would be like to be
a normal person in society

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:24.100
perhaps unusual in the sense
of your intensity for things

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:29.000
like social justice, and finding
out what the meaning of life is

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.160
but not being endowed

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.000
with anything that would seem
miraculous by your friends

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.100
and all of a sudden

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:42.260
having this voice come to you
and then come out of you

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:45.330
as you speak it and
recite it to other people.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.700
And that is the beginning

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.130
of the prophetic career
of Muhammad.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:05.660
KINGSLEY:
The months to come
would bring more revelations--

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.100
powerful words
of a lyrical quality

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.460
more beautiful than the most
exquisite Arabic poetry.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.500
Above all, Muhammad was to bear
one message to his people:

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.630
a simple yet
radical proclamation

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:28.900
that there is only one God.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.600
DENNY:
The central tenet of Islam

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.400
is the oneness,
the indivisible unity of God;

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.530
not something that is simply...
that one pays lip service to

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.730
but something that is absolutely
the most important concept.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.630
Divine unity is more than saying

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.330
God is... there's only one God
and there are no other deities.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.360
It's only thinking
about one thing.

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.560
So to be thinking
about possessions

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:58.130
to be thinking about status,
to be thinking about power

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.430
are all intellectual idols.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.060
KINGSLEY:
The implications
were staggering.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:12.700
One god meant one people.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:15.830
No more tribal divisions.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:20.730
To the poor and unprotected,
the prospect was revolutionary.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.260
RENARD:
It seems to me

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.930
that one of the most important
things in his early teaching

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.700
that isn't often talked about

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.160
is the strong social justice
message that he delivered.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.900
In the Mecca of the time, there
was an increasing separation

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:38.560
between the haves and have-nots.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.060
He insisted that it...

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.600
this was not to be, and
that we should share the wealth

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.260
and it was this social justice
message that I think

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.130
that really got him a hearing
among many of the folks.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:52.730
So coming with Islam, it was
a new order, a new way of life.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.330
And it was a beautiful
way of life

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:56.360
because everybody was equal--

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.760
black, white, men,
women, children.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.700
So it had that type
of universal appeal

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.260
which I think was the reason
why Islam spread so rapidly.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.730
KINGSLEY:
Many were moved
by Muhammad's message

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:14.560
as he began to speak out
in the community.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.230
SELLS:
It had

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.200
the suppleness
and symbolic depth

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.100
of the great Pre-Islamic poems

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.330
that had been created
by this people

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.960
and that had given
this people in Arabia

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.230
such an extraordinary ear
for verbal expression

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:38.100
where verbal expression was
<i> the</i> commanding cultural force.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.360
Some people called him a poet

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:45.400
and there's a Qur'anic surah,
basically saying

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.830
Muhammad is not a poet.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:50.830
Poets speak through desire.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.700
This is not the voice of desire,
this is the voice of God.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.000
KINGSLEY:
Muhammad's following
began to grow.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.100
They called themselves Muslims

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.830
for "those who
surrender to God."

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.700
They set out to preserve the
message Muhammad had brought.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:17.860
This was the beginning
of the Qur'an.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.860
BLOOM:
The Qur'an was revealed orally,
but very soon people realized

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.460
that it had to be written down

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.900
in order to make sure
that it wasn't corrupted

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.300
and that the original message
was maintained.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:34.460
And from a very early date--

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.200
and it's very unclear
when that date was

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.700
because no early manuscripts
of the Qur'an survive--

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.960
people began copying it down.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.760
KINGSLEY:
The Qur'an is a revelation
of the spiritual teaching

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.500
of both ethical
and social guidance.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.330
It was revealed
and remains in Arabic.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.330
SELLS:
What's so extraordinary about
the Qur'an is its naturalness

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.460
so that it can say the most
powerful cosmic things

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.500
with a sense of intimacy

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:15.930
so that power and tenderness
come together constantly

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.260
in the Qur'anic language.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.630
With words alone

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:24.660
the Qur'an delivers
its vision to the faithful.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.560
Its imagery conjures a picture
of the afterlife that resonates

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.830
with all the power of
traditional Bedouin poetry.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.560
SELLS:
Imagine yourself in the desert

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:43.630
surrounded by dust
and by the glare of the sun.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.360
You wear cloaks
to cover your body

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:51.030
because the wind will just sear
your skin right off your face.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:56.260
And you walk into an oasis.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.300
The temperature drops
dramatically.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.330
There's a quiet there.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.730
The wind is no longer howling.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.300
Everywhere you look you see
green and color.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:12.560
The world of water and paradise

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.530
are symbolically
tied to one another.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.530
And the Qur'an conjured that up

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.160
with just a few
briefly chosen words.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.260
KINGSLEY:
Yet for all the imagery
of Paradise in the Qur'an

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.660
there was no easy
description of God.

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:41.530
The mystery would remain.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.960
SELLS:
It's very difficult to talk
about God without reifying God--

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.330
"reifying"-- to make God
into a thing;

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.200
or anthropomorphizing God--

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.760
to make God into a projection
of our own human self.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.400
And that's why Muslims
don't like sculpture

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:59.030
for example, traditionally

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.930
because they believe
that there's that danger.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.000
And the Qur'an avoids that by
constantly shifting the pronouns

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.900
so we can't really reify God

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.130
and get it... an image,
a physical image of God.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.200
KINGSLEY:
Rather than a physical image
of God, or of Muhammad

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.630
it is the beauty
of the Qur'an itself

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.830
that is celebrated in Islam.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:30.800
BLOOM:
Islam developed in this context
where pictures were not favored.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.030
The Qur'an, as it was revealed

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:35.600
was God's
representation on earth

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.330
and Muslims felt,
from a very early time

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.630
that the only
just representation

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.300
of God... God's word

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.060
was the Qur'an itself

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:47.760
not any picture of...
of God, certainly not

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.500
because you couldn't
represent God

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.530
and certainly not
a picture of Muhammad

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:52.800
because he wasn't divine.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.200
At certain times and places

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.800
people did make images
of the prophet Muhammad.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.030
But these are not
religious images.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.900
These are not images
meant to be worshipped.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.000
They're not images
of a saint or of God.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.500
They're images of Muhammad
as a historical figure.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.100
He's sort of given honor

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:23.660
by having a very bright
blue background

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.630
or a white cloud near him.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.230
But he's not otherwise
distinguished

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.400
from the other characters
in the story.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.830
At other times, people did
represent the prophet

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.000
but he was always represented
with a white cloth over his face

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.630
to hide his face

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:41.400
so that there were different
approaches to doing this.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.930
But in all of these,
these are not devotional images.

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:48.900
You're not supposed to look
at them and pray towards them.

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.060
You're to learn more about
the history of your religion

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.260
with the emphasis on history
from them.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:03.760
KINGSLEY:
As Muhammad's community grew,
so did the opposition.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.830
SELLS:
People, of course,
were skeptical and said

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.900
"Look, if you're a prophet,
where's your miracle?"

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.560
And the prophets in the Qur'an--

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.460
Moses had miracles,
Jesus had miracles.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.200
"Where's your miracle?"

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.100
The Qur'anic answer
to that challenge

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:27.300
is "This is the miracle,
this Qur'an."

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.630
KINGSLEY:
But that wasn't miracle enough

00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:34.330
for the people
who defined themselves

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:39.400
by the gods of their ancestors
and the totems of their tribe.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.660
Their doubts increased.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.960
The idea of life after death
appalled them.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.900
SELLS:
So the Qur'an presents people
as really being skeptical:

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.900
"You mean to tell me
that after I die

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.300
"and my body has gone
back to the elements

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.400
"and I've been putrefied

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.400
"that I'm going to be put
back together again

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.200
and brought back to life?"

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.860
That... of any of
the messages in the Qur'an

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.900
that struck the people of Arabia

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.030
as being the most
hard to believe.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:19.360
KINGSLEY:
Muhammad also spoke of eternal
damnation for the unjust.

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.100
RENARD:
He used the language
of apocalyptic imagery

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.530
talking about the signs
of the ends of time;

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:27.330
When the mountains crumble;

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.530
When the skies are rolled up
like scrolls, then you will know

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.700
what responsibility you bear
for your actions.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.860
There are references

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.600
to those who are unjust
going to the fire.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:48.930
KINGSLEY:
To the nonbelievers, the divine
reckoning Muhammad invoked

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.860
was an outrage, his dismantling
of their heritage and customs

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.200
deeply unsettling.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:26:58.960
DENNY:
It was a threat

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.460
a threat in several ways:

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.200
to their social order,
to their age-old traditions

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.830
and an economic threat
because of the importance

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:08.500
of the pilgrimage shrine
of the Ka'bah in Mecca.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.100
KINGSLEY:
As Muhammad's following
increased

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.960
the social fabric of the
caravan city began to unravel.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.700
Business suffered

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.600
as pilgrims and traders, worried
for their safety, left town.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.100
The tribal leaders decided

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:36.560
Muhammad and his message
must be removed permanently.

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.300
RENARD:
They didn't want him
taking over.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:40.960
They didn't want him horning in
on their control of the city.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.930
They made things
very difficult for him

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.900
perhaps even plotted
his assassination.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.130
They tried to keep him
away from the Ka'bah.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:49.900
They did everything they could
to try to run him out of town.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.000
KINGSLEY:
They demanded
that Muhammad's uncle remove

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.160
his clan's protection
from the prophet

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:01.330
which would clear the way
for his murder

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.030
without the threat
of retribution.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:10.660
But his uncle refused.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.760
The battle lines were drawn.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:19.660
Nothing short of tribal war
would settle the conflict now.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:24.260
SELLS:
Muhammad is clearly asked
to do extraordinary things:

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.630
to tell the Bedouin

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.700
to give up many of their notions
of multiple gods;

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.860
to give up their attachment
to their ancestors

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.330
and their tribal warfare
in the way they had--

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:40.730
things that would...
could and did make him

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:45.560
the object of scorn,
persecution and an attack.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.860
KINGSLEY:
Muhammad's followers

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.730
were forced from
the marketplace and starved.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:02.560
Those without clan protection
were tortured and killed.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.800
In 619 AD, Muhammad's wife,
Khadijah, died

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.860
and his uncle as well.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:22.800
Gone were his first great love
and his only protector.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.260
Here at last

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:31.530
was the opportunity his enemies
had been waiting for.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:36.430
But in the lush oasis town
of Yathrib, north of Mecca

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:40.300
a refuge opens
to Muhammad and his people.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.960
Clan rivalries had become
deadly in the town

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.400
and they desperately needed
a peacemaker.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.200
RENARD:
They had heard that Muhammad was
a very trustworthy man.

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.460
They'd heard that he had
great arbitration skills.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.000
And they thought

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.830
"We'll see if we can't get him
up here and help us out."

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:59.300
So they invited him.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.730
KINGSLEY:
Muhammad agreed
to travel to Yathrib

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:09.200
and settle their disputes

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.760
in exchange for a safe refuge
for his people.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.300
For Muhammad's followers,
leaving the place

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.330
of their ancestors,
their families and tribes

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:25.400
was the ultimate test
of devotion.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:37.030
In doing so, they began
a new community, a new tribe.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.630
For the first time, they were
bound together not by blood

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.030
but by faith.

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:53.200
In the course of
a single caravan journey

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:58.760
Islam marks its true beginnings.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.800
Their journey is known
as the<i> hijrah.</i>

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.730
622 in the Christian calendar
marks the Muslim year one.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.460
Muhammad's goal among
the people of Yathrib

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.060
was the same
as his larger mission:

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.200
to bring unity and peace
with his message.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.830
SELLS:
He was asked to be
a Solomonic figure--

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:36.400
to mediate tensions between
tribes that seemed intractable.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.600
KINGSLEY:
As his work succeeded,
the town would become known

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.560
as "the city of
the Prophet," Medina.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.230
RENARD:
Muhammad's great task in Medina

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.860
was to try and bring together
these various groups

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:54.000
and to try and forge
a community of believers

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.860
in a way that would bring people
together in a sort a harmony.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.400
KINGSLEY:
To the divided clans of Medina

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.360
Muhammad offered
a vision of solidarity.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.000
But even as he spread
the word of Islam

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.760
he didn't challenge
the beliefs of other faiths.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.230
BLOOM:
Islam sees itself
in relationship

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.630
to the earlier
revealed religions

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.730
of Judaism and Christianity

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:28.130
and treats them
as "people of the Book."

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:33.300
It believes that God had
revealed himself, his word

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.800
to mankind, many times--

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.730
to Moses, to Jesus,
for example-- and...

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:41.300
but each time,
people went astray.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.900
SELLS:
Throughout the Qur'an

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.860
we have a sense of
the humanity of Muhammad

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.730
his humbleness as a person

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:56.100
and the extraordinary challenge
of the mission he was given

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.230
by this divine revelation.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.260
KINGSLEY:
As the Muslim community grew
in Medina

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:11.560
a life of simple devotion
and ritual developed.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:16.530
A freed Abyssinian slave,
named Bilal

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:20.700
was the first to call believers
to prayer at Muhammad's house.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:26.130
(<i> muezzin making
 call to prayer</i> )

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.030
KINGSLEY:
It was the first mosque.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:43.400
SELLS:
The call to prayer has within it
the first Islamic pillar

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.530
which is the affirmation
of God's unity:

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.830
<i>"La ilaha illa Allah"</i>

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:51.730
that beautiful phrase,
which many Muslims chant

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:54.060
over and over in their mind
or vocally

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.960
to constantly remind themselves
of the unity of God

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.700
and the unity of what
we should focus on in our life.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.160
<i>La ilaha illa Allah!</i>

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.900
<i>Ashhadu inna</i>

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.630
<i>La ilaha illa Allah!</i>

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.760
<i>Ashhadu inna</i>

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.460
<i>Muhammad rasul Allah!</i>

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:18.600
DENNY:
Praying together
is a good thing.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.260
It cements the idea of belonging
to a movement or a religion

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.400
to an organization,
to a community.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.360
MUEZZIN:
<i> Hayyu 'ala al-sala!</i>

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.430
DENNY:
The result is

00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:33.100
something very,
very powerful even... to watch

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.430
even for a nonbeliever or
someone from another religion.

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:41.460
We carry out physical gestures
of prayer in worship

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:45.900
that unify our body and our mind
and our soul

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.460
all at the same moment of bowing

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.230
and touching
our head to the ground

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.660
toward that exact center.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.330
What could be
a more powerful symbol of unity?

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:02.300
KINGSLEY:
It's said that
while he was in Medina

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:07.230
Muhammad received a revelation
instructing those in prayer

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:12.400
to face in the direction
of the Ka'bah, in Mecca.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.760
Though filled with pagan idols

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.430
it was still
the shrine of Abraham

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.760
the first believer
in the one true God.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.300
But even as the Muslims
were praying toward Mecca

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.360
their enemies there
were rallying in force.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.660
Their goal:
to wipe out the Muslims.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.000
Muhammad's people
began to gather arms.

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.560
Though the Muslims prepared
as best they could

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.660
they were outnumbered
and outmatched.

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:03.560
They mustered a force
of only 313

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:07.760
mostly old men and boys,
with few weapons...

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.400
while the approaching Meccans
were heavily armed

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.530
and a thousand strong.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.800
For years, Muhammad had tried
to bring Islam

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.960
to the people of Mecca
peacefully.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.030
Now it was time to fight.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.400
The Muslims faced
their own tribes--

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.730
brother fighting brother,
son against father.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.930
Yet they came armed
with a powerful weapon:

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:04.030
a passionate belief
in their faith.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.100
Muhammad's troops fought

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:11.630
with every confidence that
God's will was guiding them.

00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:20.060
They fought three
very, very bloody battles.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:23.460
At one point, the entire
young Muslim community

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.430
was right on the edge
of annihilation.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.000
KINGSLEY:
For three years

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.530
the Muslim army held out
against staggering odds.

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.130
As word of the fighting spread

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:57.160
other Bedouin tribes saw God's
hand in Muhammad's victories.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.700
One by one

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.430
the peoples of the desert
began to join in his struggle.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:07.100
The Muslim army grew,
and the tide began to turn.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.960
The Muslim forces advanced
to the outskirts of Mecca.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.600
It was a furious siege that
lasted for nearly a month...

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.560
Until finally,
the city fell to Muhammad.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.360
In 630 AD

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.760
the terrified people of Mecca
braced for the onslaught.

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:54.200
Muhammad's army was returning
home, now 10,000 strong.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.230
The vanquished knew the terrible
fate that awaited them.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.730
SELLS:
According to the modes
of tribal warfare

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:15.800
the Meccans could expect
a big revenge.

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:18.300
The men are usually killed.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:24.460
Women and children
are sold into slavery.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.600
There's little pity for
the loser in a tribal war.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.560
Of course, that's standard
around the world.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:44.760
KINGSLEY:
But Muhammad had a surprise
in store for the fallen city.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.830
When Muhammad came into Mecca

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.160
and not only did not carry out
a bloody revenge

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.530
but actually embraced

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:54.730
the very Meccans who had
fought him for three years

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.760
and attempted to annihilate him

00:39:56.760 --> 00:40:05.030
it was very shocking
to the people in his milieu.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:09.430
So within the very founding
of the religion

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:14.400
one finds episodes
of great generosity

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.830
often extraordinary acts
of kindness and mercy.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.100
KINGSLEY:
But not all of Mecca
escaped Muhammad's wrath.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:28.460
(<i> crowd ululating</i> )

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:34.730
Flush with victory, his troops
marched straight to the Ka'bah.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.730
Seven times
they circled the shrine

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.730
as those who had come
to seek its protection

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.560
appealed to their idols.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.460
But it was not the pagan people
Muhammad had come to destroy.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.530
It was their gods.

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:54.700
He raised his staff

00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:00.060
and the tribal gods of his
ancestors smashed into dust.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:05.100
SELLS:
When Muhammad entered Mecca
and entered the shrine

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:08.430
and destroyed the idols
of the shrine

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:14.960
this is of great cultural and
symbolic importance in Islam.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.660
By breaking the idols

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:22.730
he was breaking apart
the tribal system

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:29.860
in which each tribe really had
its own independent deity.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.960
This was shocking
to the Bedouin.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.400
This was saying

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.400
"The gods of our fathers
are being destroyed.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.800
"In some sense you're saying

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.600
"that our fathers themselves
were deluded.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.000
"How can you say this
in a tradition

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.200
in which relationships to one's
father and tribe are primary?"

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.600
So this act of iconoclasm,
then, is seen

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.700
as an act of prophetic violence

00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:01.000
that has just as much importance
in Islamic tradition

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.500
as Moses' breaking
of the tablets

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.730
when he saw the idolatry
of Mount Sinai

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:13.160
or Jesus' casting the
money-sellers out of the temple.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.830
KINGSLEY:
The destruction of the idols
was a new beginning

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:24.430
a breaking from the past

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:28.760
and the creation
of a powerful new force.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.230
Mecca was just the beginning.

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:33.830
One after another

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:38.360
the tribes of a nation were
summoned to the fold

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.830
and united
under the banner of Islam.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.960
A worldwide community
of faith was begun

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.560
borne in an extraordinary
alignment

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.060
of history, personality
and conviction.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.730
ATIL:
What Muhammad did was to bring

00:42:56.730 --> 00:43:00.230
a sense of solidarity,
a sense of mission

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.060
and he united all these
separate segments

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.630
within the peninsula

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:08.700
from then on, moved eastward,
westward, northward, southward.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.460
KINGSLEY:
The Muslims turned to the north

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.560
swept into present-day Lebanon
and Syria.

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:30.060
They continued west into Egypt
and quickly across North Africa

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.460
fortifying the coastline
of the Mediterranean.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.030
Only the seas stopped them.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.700
Its growth was so explosive

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:47.430
from 622, the year one
of the Islamic calendar.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:51.330
Um, within 50 years

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:55.700
people whose father had been
camel herders

00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:00.130
were now governing one of the
major empires in world history.

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:05.460
Within 200 years, it extended
from Spain to China.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.700
KINGSLEY:
The Muslims absorbed
the Sasanian Empire of Iran

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.900
and two-thirds of the Christian
Byzantine Empire.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.630
By now, the empire was larger
than Rome.

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:25.430
It stretched from Morocco
in the west

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.860
to the Indus River in the East

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.560
where the border
of India is today.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.830
How had it happened
that so small an army

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.930
could conquer an area so large
so fast, so easily?

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.230
RENARD:
Islam's success in expanding

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:55.330
into the central Middle East
and across North Africa

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.030
was due in large part

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:59.930
because people were fed up
with previous regimes.

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:04.760
Well, the idea that Muslims
were going across the world

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:10.000
saying, "Convert or die," is
really not accurate, not at all.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.300
But it didn't have a heavy hand;

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.760
they didn't rule
with a heavy hand.

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.130
They allowed
the conquered peoples

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.260
to maintain
their administrative structures.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.800
They allowed the Christians
and the Jews

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.560
to maintain their religious law
and to be governed by them.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.900
And so in many cases,
conquered peoples did not feel

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.700
the presence of the new regime
very heavily.

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.900
Certainly for individuals

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.760
who felt themselves
exploited or downtrodden

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:42.000
by an oppressive and even
sometimes parasitic priesthood

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.430
the idea of Islam being

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.800
a religion essentially free
from clergy

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.830
must have seemed
very attractive.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.130
ATIL:
It's the times
that creates the movement

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:55.900
and sometimes the men.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.900
The Roman Empire had collapsed;

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.700
the Byzantine Empire
wasn't strong enough.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.500
There was a need
for a new vision

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.730
a new way of looking to life.

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:09.300
And I think what
happened at that time:

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.700
Muhammad's mission filled the
void that the societies wanted.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.930
They really wanted some sort
of solidarity in their lives.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.400
KINGSLEY:
The lessons of the Koran

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.500
so successful for the Muslims
in Medina and Mecca

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.560
were playing out
on a global scale.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.400
As the conquest swept
through Syria

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.400
the Muslims held
their Friday prayers

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.530
in the Church of St. John
the Baptist in Damascus

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.900
allowing its Christian
congregation

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:47.430
to continue their services
on Sunday.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.130
Side by side

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:58.700
the two faiths shared
the same building in peace.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.130
As the Muslim community grew

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:09.760
they bought the old church
from the Christian congregation

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:12.660
and built a huge mosque
on the site.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:22.760
With Byzantine artisans

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.300
they decorated it with golden
mosaics of an Islamic paradise.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.460
The great mosque of Damascus
would become a model

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.030
for new mosques to come,
all across the empire.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:50.030
The Arabs transformed
their conquered lands

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:53.730
maintaining, improving or
expanding the infrastructure.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.930
In Tunisia, building
on Roman ruins

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:04.100
they devised an ingenious system
of water purification

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:08.130
using gravity to separate
freshwater from sediments.

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:13.800
BLOOM:
Part of this system were
these two enormous basins

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.800
that they built
outside the city walls

00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:24.330
The clean freshwater would flow
over into the larger basin

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.700
where it would then be
distributed by pipes

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:28.900
to the city.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.160
This is, you know,
hundreds of years

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.500
before anyone in Europe
ever thought

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:35.130
of having running water.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:49.030
All over, you find schemes
for bringing water

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:51.930
from the mountains
where there was more water

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.900
to the plains
where there might be less water.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.230
KINGSLEY:
They resurrected
elaborate irrigation systems

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.600
filling the old stone aqueducts
with precious water.

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.900
Agriculture flourished, as
life-giving staples like wheat

00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:15.560
were introduced
to the Mediterranean region.

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.100
But Muslims saved
their most monumental feat

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.760
for the holy city of Jerusalem.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.860
BLOOM:
Islam's first great work of art
is the Dome of the Rock.

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:39.300
It was built in a city that was
holy to Christians and Jews

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:40.530
and it's spectacular.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.030
KINGSLEY:
Like Mecca and the Ka'bah

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.900
the significance of this holy
site goes back to Abraham

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.230
for the rock within
is said to be

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.260
the place he nearly
sacrificed his son.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:03.100
It was built to rival the nearby
Church of the Holy Sepulcher

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:07.760
where Jesus was said
to have been buried.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.500
BLOOM:
What's extraordinary
about the Dome of the Rock

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.430
is how perfect it is.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.130
People revered this site

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.830
as someplace that was holy
to Abraham and to Isaac.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:27.760
Imagine, if you will,
these new guys coming in

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.830
and taking over this piece
of prime real estate.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.400
And building a new building
for a new religion

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.330
that sits on top of a mountain

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:43.730
and sparkles and glitters in the
sunlight for everyone to see.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:48.030
This is not something
fly-by-night.

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:52.660
This is something big
and important.

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.530
Islam has come to stay.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.830
KINGSLEY:
In just a hundred years

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:01.060
Muhammad's vision
had transformed

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:04.330
the spiritual and political map
of the world.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:06.230
And his followers
had established

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:09.100
an empire larger than Rome.

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:15.030
But Muhammad never lived
to see it.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:23.630
In the 11th year of the Islamic
calendar-- 632 AD--

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:29.330
only two years after the taking
of Mecca, Muhammad died.

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:34.330
(<i> men shouting,
 women ululating</i> )

00:51:34.330 --> 00:51:37.400
KINGSLEY:
Medina fell into despair

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:39.800
(<i> women ululating,
 men shouting</i> )

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:45.160
KINGSLEY:
For days, the city was consumed
with sorrow and ceremony.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:48.830
BLOOM:
He's known to have said that he
wanted to be buried very simply

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:50.600
with no marker over his grave.

00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:53.100
He didn't want people
to worship his grave.

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:56.530
That would interfere
with their worship of God.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:01.330
KINGSLEY:
God had spoken to them
only through Muhammad.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.300
Now that the prophet
had left them

00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.630
perhaps God would as well.

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:11.230
RENARD:
Muhammad's death set up a crisis
in the young Islamic community.

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.760
The question of succession
was the first thing

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.360
that really occupied
people's concerns.

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.530
At this point, there was
a divergence of opinion

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:22.000
as to how the community should
go about choosing a new leader.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:26.100
According to the Shiites,
the faction-- the Shi'a-- of Ali

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.560
Muhammad had indeed
designated Ali

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.700
his son-in-law and cousin,
as his successor.

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:35.000
The opinion that came to be
the majority opinion

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.400
or the Sunni opinion

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:39.560
held that Muhammad had not
appointed a successor

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.130
during his life

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:45.030
but had said, "After I'm gone,
choose one from among your peers

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:46.660
from among the elders."

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.160
And from the house
there came out

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:54.360
the man who would be
his successor, Abu Bakr.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.100
And he addressed the people
and said

00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.230
"If you worship Muhammad,
know that he is dead.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:03.400
If you worship God,
know that he lives forever."

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:12.030
KINGSLEY:
Here was the secret to Islam's
strength and profound influence:

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:17.030
the unifying power of one God--
merciful and compassionate--

00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:21.160
the power of one people
bound by a common faith.

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:26.360
Muhammad did not lead
the conquest

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:29.060
or create the empire to come;

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.900
the transforming power
of his message did.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:40.460
Out of that message would spring
a font of knowledge

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.930
that would transform humanity

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:48.030
as Islam continued to spread
its reach far and wide.

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.160
Awaiting the Muslims
would be a new age.

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.560
They would be destined
for enlightenment

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.500
for new horizons,
and a clash of great powers

00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:04.330
the like of which
the world had never seen.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:17.000
a powerful new faith was about
oto change the world--

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.160
the faith of Islam.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.860
Its followers launched a
conquest not only by the sword

00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.830
but with the power of ideas.

00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:31.360
200 years after the death
of Muhammad

00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:35.630
his message and the new Arab
Empire were transforming

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:37.030
three continents.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:42.300
MAN:
Now comes a new empire

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.760
a politically new configuration

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.600
and driven by a religious,
newly defined civilization...

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:55.330
this new civilization expanding
beyond its own dreams

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:58.260
within a period
of very short time...

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:04.700
literally the largest empire
civilization had ever known.

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:14.460
[Captioning sponsored

00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:22.530
KINGSLEY:
The Arabic word for conquest,
<i> fath</i>

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.160
literally means "openings."

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.860
Islam sowed the seeds
of its faith to the four winds

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.160
and a world of opportunities
opened before it.

00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:39.030
But the vast empire's spiritual
core remained at its birthplace

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.900
the holy city of Mecca.

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:49.000
From every corner
of the Muslim world

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.100
the faithful embarked on the
traditional journey to Mecca

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:58.160
a sacred pilgrimage
known as the hajj.

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.630
RENARD:
The pilgrimage became a central
devotional and ritual feature

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:04.930
in Islamic life.

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:07.330
In fact, since the life
of Muhammad himself

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:09.030
the pilgrimage has symbolized

00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:12.000
probably more than any other
Islamic ritual activity

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.660
unity among all people,
and equality.

00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:26.330
KINGSLEY:
The hajj set humanity in motion.

00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:30.460
For the first time since
the reign of Alexander the Great

00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:33.400
cultures and caravans
now flowed freely.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:38.030
Borders, closed for
a thousand years, opened.

00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:41.400
WOMAN:
Both ideas and goods
went back and forth

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.360
over incredible distances.

00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:47.130
Since every Muslim is enjoined
once in his life to visit Mecca

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:51.200
it means that there were
caravans carrying goods

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.060
and pilgrims and ideas
and people.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.430
And they all met together
in Mecca once a year

00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:58.500
and then things would radiate
back home.

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.730
So if there was an invention
that was discovered in Samarkand

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:04.960
it could be within the year that
it would be known in Cordova.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:12.530
KINGSLEY:
Where pilgrims trod,
traders soon followed.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:15.160
Muhammad himself had been a man
of commerce

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.230
and now the spread of his
message brought with it

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:22.130
the spread of trade
and the Islamic way of life.

00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:26.260
Trade was incredibly important
in the Islamic world

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.500
simply because of its
geographical position.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.500
It was, and still is, between
west... what we call the West

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.500
and what people always called
the East.

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:38.400
So it was a natural land bridge
connecting China to Europe.

00:57:42.700 --> 00:57:47.130
KINGSLEY:
In only two centuries,
Islam had extended its reach

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.360
from Spain all the way
to the edge of India.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:54.860
It took nearly a year to travel

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:58.200
from one end of the Arab Empire
to the other.

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:05.130
At its heart was a fabled city
of wealth.

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:07.630
It was called Baghdad.

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:21.860
The palaces of ancient Baghdad
have been lost

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.500
over the centuries

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:28.360
but in its glory it rivaled
ancient Athens or Rome.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:34.330
It was a magnificent
architectural achievement

00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.360
the pride of Islam in a new age.

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:43.060
One visitor left this account...

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:49.760
"All the exquisite neighborhoods
covered with parks

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.200
"gardens, villas
and beautiful promenades

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:58.330
"are filled with bazaars and
finely built mosques and baths.

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:03.300
They stretch for miles on both
sides of the glittering river."

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.460
But what made this
the greatest city of its time

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.100
was more than just
what met the eye;

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.130
it was the company it kept.

00:59:15.130 --> 00:59:18.430
Scholars made Baghdad the jewel
of the world.

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:21.530
BLAIR:
Certainly from
the eighth century on

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:23.630
Baghdad was the center
of learning

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:25.060
in the Islamic world.

00:59:25.060 --> 00:59:28.160
And all major innovations
either came from Baghdad

00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.830
or quickly came to Baghdad

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:32.300
because the best people came
to Baghdad:

00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.530
the best thinkers, the best
philosophers, the best artists.

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:46.430
KINGSLEY:
They came in search of answers
to pragmatic questions.

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:49.200
The empire's meteoric growth

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:52.760
had left its new leaders
overwhelmed.

00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:57.230
They had staggering engineering
and logistical problems

00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:58.760
to contend with.

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:03.530
Solving them would take
the greatest minds of the day.

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:05.200
SALIBA:
Under the new empire now

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.200
you are responsible
for public hygiene;

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.300
you are responsible
for the marketplace;

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:11.800
you are responsible
for goods being sold

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.200
in the marketplace.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.600
All of those require some basic
elementary sciences.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.200
This new civilization,
having a need for science

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.830
really stemmed from the need
to run that empire.

01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:29.700
KINGSLEY:
The best minds rose to the call.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:34.600
The finest were welcomed
at a center of scholarship

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.960
Baghdad's renowned
House of Wisdom.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.530
It was a magnet for scholars
and intellectuals

01:00:40.530 --> 01:00:42.560
who came and worked
in the academies.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:47.060
There were public libraries
associated with the palace

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.960
and scholars came
from all over the empire.

01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.030
And there were scholars
from Iran.

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:54.960
There were scholars
from Byzantium who came.

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.630
Some were Christian, some were
Muslim, some were Jews.

01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:04.130
And all of these different sort
of threads of human knowledge

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:07.430
came together
in the city of Baghdad.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.760
So the net effect of this is

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.460
that you've got
human individuals

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:16.060
from radically different
cultural traditions

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:19.000
being thrown into the same
crucible.

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:26.100
KINGSLEY:
The challenge that greeted
these scholars was daunting.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:29.800
The great works of the ancients
had to be transformed

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.300
into a wholly new body
of knowledge.

01:01:36.530 --> 01:01:42.600
Competition for jobs developed
within a new intellectual elite.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.330
SALIBA:
And from there on

01:01:44.330 --> 01:01:47.830
every single scientist is
competing for that job

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:50.160
and they were competing
among themselves

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.130
almost just in the same way
that modern bureaucrats

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:56.100
and modern academicians
will fight among themselves.

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:02.360
KINGSLEY:
Scholars were dispatched
across the empire

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.800
to locate as many ancient texts
as possible--

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:09.600
the first international
scientific venture in history.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.200
Unlike their Christian
counterparts

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:17.960
Muslim thinkers saw no
insurmountable contradiction

01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.500
between their faith and the laws
governing the natural world.

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:25.260
So they embraced Aristotle
and Plato--

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:29.130
writers the Christian Church
considered blasphemous.

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:30.960
SALIBA:
So this is the time

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.100
when we begin to see scientists,
bureaucrats, what have you

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:36.630
going and seeking

01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:40.030
from whatever civilization
that had any sciences before:

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:42.530
be it the Greek, be it
the Indian, be it the Persian

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:44.130
and so on.

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:48.030
KINGSLEY:
From the Hindus came
mathematical concepts

01:02:48.030 --> 01:02:49.600
that guide us today.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.330
It was the scholars
of the House of Wisdom

01:02:52.330 --> 01:02:56.200
who developed the system of
Arabic numerals, still in use.

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:04.130
It is they who translated
and transformed

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:06.400
the writings of the Greeks

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.900
and made a gift of them
to the modern Western world.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.860
The Renaissance had its
beginnings in Baghdad.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:18.230
KARAMUSTAFA:
They managed to assimilate
quite a lot

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:22.600
of the rich legacy
of the Hellenistic world

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.960
translated into Arabic,
initially

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.030
which was then made available

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:35.060
to all other participants
in the new Islamic civilization.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.430
Arabic emerges as the language
of learning

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:41.760
throughout the region.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.660
This is a very significant
development

01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:47.060
in human intellectual history.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.900
KINGSLEY:
Having amassed the knowledge

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.660
the Muslims now began
to challenge it.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:59.800
This was perhaps their most
important contribution.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.160
The scientific process was born.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.400
SALIBA:
They wanted to know why a very
intelligent Greek scientist--

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.500
whose text they
were just admiring

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.330
and they were verifying it--

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:13.700
why would he make a mistake
in the first place?

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.360
So they began to dig.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.060
Was it because he didn't have
the right instruments?

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:22.860
Or is it because he didn't have
the right methodology

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:24.460
to use the instruments

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.100
for the verifications
of observation?

01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:30.130
It is this spirit, you see,
this spirit of questioning

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:33.700
this spirit of saying that we
have to build science constantly

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.760
on a systematic,
consistent basis

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.060
where we make
a physical proposition

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.260
of how the universe
ought to be run

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:42.500
and the mathematical
representation

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.130
of that physical universe
ought to match.

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.030
Now you begin to have

01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:53.960
what I call the birth
of the new Islamic science.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:58.630
KINGSLEY:
Algebra and trigonometry,
engineering and astronomy.

01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:02.460
Countless disciplines
integral to our lives today

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.460
trace their roots
to Islamic scientists.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:12.960
More surprising, perhaps, were
their innovations in medicine.

01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:19.800
At a time when Europeans
were praying

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:23.500
to the bones of their saints
to cure their illnesses

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.030
Muslim physicians developed
an innovative theory:

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:29.560
that disease was transmitted

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.430
through tiny
airborne organisms--

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:35.630
the precursor to the study
of germs.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:41.360
They determined that sick
patients should be quarantined

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.800
and then treated.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.700
This is the basis
of the institution

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.760
most fundamental to medicine
today-- the hospital.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.600
Funded mainly
through religious endowments

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.060
Muslim hospitals
had separate wards

01:05:57.060 --> 01:06:01.060
for patients suffering
from different kinds of disease.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:03.600
Even mental illness was treated.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.600
Their studies of anatomy
were so sophisticated

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.600
that they remained in use

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.360
by Muslim and European
physicians for 600 years.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.030
Muslim scientists were
especially intrigued

01:06:28.030 --> 01:06:33.200
by light, lenses and the
physiology of the human eye.

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:38.560
The father of optics was
a Muslim named Ibn Al-Haitham.

01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.700
His work with lenses
eventually led

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:45.160
to the invention
of the modern camera.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.160
He produced the first treatise

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.560
that ventured to explain
how the eye actually sees.

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:59.500
A thousand years before the West
dared to take up the practice

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:03.760
Muslim doctors were removing
cataracts surgically

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.160
clearing them from the eye
with a hollow needle.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.760
But for all this knowledge

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.830
to transform
and illuminate an empire

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:17.360
it had to be copied and shared

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:21.930
across a hundred different
cities in the Islamic world.

01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:24.800
For this there was
a new invention

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:30.960
one that is still fundamental to
learning and knowledge today...

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.830
paper.

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:35.330
BLOOM:
Around the year 700, 750

01:07:35.330 --> 01:07:38.500
when Muslim armies reached
central Asia

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.860
they encountered paper
for the first time

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:51.000
and very quickly the Muslim
bureaucracy started using paper.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.330
You find that, you know,
within 50 years, it's in Syria

01:07:54.330 --> 01:07:57.160
and then a few years after that,
it's in Egypt.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.960
And then it's in North Africa

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:02.160
and then it's in Sicily
and then it's in Spain.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.360
And that's where Europe learned
to make paper from;

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:07.700
they learned to make it
from the Arabs.

01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:13.860
KARAMUSTAFA:
We begin to have people with
family names like "Papermaker"

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.830
so, in other words, not only
that paper was available

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:21.130
it must have become a very,
very widespread industry.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.200
And, hence,
the acquisition of books

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.100
must have also become very easy.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.700
KINGSLEY:
With the wide use
of books and paper

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:33.730
hundreds of scribes,
some of whom were women

01:08:33.730 --> 01:08:36.860
were kept busy transcribing
the translations

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.830
and new writings
of the Baghdad scholars.

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.860
BLOOM:
All of this knowledge that's
being acquired from the Greeks

01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.360
and from the Indians and
from Central Asia and such

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.800
is all being written down,
<i> in</i> books,<i> on</i> paper

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:53.400
and that these books
are being copied

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.500
and recopied and sent around.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.330
We know, for example, that there
was a street of booksellers

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:01.000
with more than 100 shops

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.230
each one with paper
and books for sale.

01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:08.760
And this is a time when,
you know, in Europe

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:13.230
a monastery would be lucky
if it had five or ten books.

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:17.860
KINGSLEY:
While the monks of the West

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:20.730
were hoarding their wisdom on
scraps of expensive parchment

01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:23.030
paper enabled
Islamic civilization

01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:26.130
to spread its newfound
knowledge far and wide

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:29.960
creating a single community
linking three continents.

01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.200
KARAMUSTAFA:
So, the chief distinction,
therefore

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.130
of Islamic civilization

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:42.260
in addition to the fact that it
made new leaps of originality

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.460
new transformations
in traditions of learning

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.530
and... and everything
else possible

01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:51.100
is the fact that it
enabled human beings

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:53.600
to consider the possibility

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:57.760
of thinking about the globe
as a single unit--

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.930
humanity.

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.500
KINGSLEY:
In all the broad empire

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.960
there was one place
the Christian world

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:13.260
could experience the lifestyle
Muslims now took for granted--

01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.200
southern Spain.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.760
Here, on the European
continent itself

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.100
Islamic culture would begin
to have an effect

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.030
on the European civilization
around it.

01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:35.300
A thousand years ago,
the Spanish city of Córdoba

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:39.330
was a center of learning and
culture that rivaled Baghdad.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:49.560
Today, Córdoba's narrow lanes
hearken to its medieval past.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.160
During the Dark Ages

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.000
this was the most prosperous
and sophisticated metropolis

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.900
on the continent.

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.430
It had streetlights
and paved roads;

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:04.530
libraries, hospitals
and palaces.

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:09.760
This was a city of light,
a Muslim city.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.630
BLAIR:
The city of Córdoba in the ninth
and tenth centuries

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:17.160
was one of the biggest
and most exciting in Europe.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.730
We have descriptions of it
by people coming and saying

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:21.200
"All these flowers everywhere.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.500
"This... this open streets.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.530
This... this wonderful light
coming down."

01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:28.030
Northern cities were dark.

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:30.600
Córdoba had running water.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.730
People lived in big houses.

01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:34.130
In contrast, in Paris

01:11:34.130 --> 01:11:36.900
people lived in shacks
by the side of the river.

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:44.160
KINGSLEY:
The glory of medieval Córdoba
is here

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.100
in what is now the great
Roman Catholic cathedral

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.000
in the middle of town.

01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:57.900
But the Córdoba cathedral of
today began its life as a mosque

01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.560
one of the grandest
of the Islamic empire.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.800
BLAIR:
The Great Mosque in Córdoba
was simply the biggest mosque

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.900
in the biggest city
in southern Europe.

01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.860
RENARD:
When you climb up
into the church tower

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:12.100
which used to be a minaret

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.900
and you look out
over this expanse of roof

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:17.600
it's quite amazing
to see this cathedral

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:20.000
complete with flying buttresses

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.500
popping up out of this... the
middle of this massive mosque.

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.830
WOMAN:
Many, many people
came to visit it

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:35.600
to view the wonders of the
mosque, which had rib-vaulting--

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.430
the kind of vaulting
which is like this

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.560
and which, 100 years later--

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.360
by a mere coincidence,
you might think

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.630
but not at all a coincidence--

01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:49.330
appears in the Gothic cathedrals
of northern Europe;

01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.760
in Lincoln Cathedral,
in Chartres Cathedral in France.

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.460
Where does that come from?

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:58.400
Obviously, influenced by
the Great Mosque of Córdoba

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.160
in the south of Spain.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.360
KINGSLEY:
For the occasional
European Christian traveler

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.400
Córdoba was their
one opportunity

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.800
to glimpse the Islamic world.

01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:15.000
What they saw was shocking.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.700
Most of Europe at that time

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.800
languished in poverty
and squalor.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.900
Córdoba was a pageant of
prosperity and enlightenment.

01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.360
HILLENBRAND:
In the tenth century

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.060
there was a Saxon nun

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:31.430
with the unpronounceable
name of Hroswitha

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:35.260
who called medieval Córdoba
"the ornament of the world."

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.900
She was very, very taken
with the place

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:40.860
and there you are,
she's a Christian nun.

01:13:47.530 --> 01:13:49.460
KINGSLEY:
As Europeans made their way

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:51.860
from the cold stone
of their northern castles

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.460
into the glorious Muslim cities
of southern Spain

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:57.330
they couldn't help
but be impressed.

01:13:59.430 --> 01:14:01.600
In the green hills above Granada

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.900
was a palace
of startling elegance--

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.260
a shining example of the
richness and sophistication

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.500
Islam brought
to medieval Europe.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:12.600
It is called the Alhambra.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:20.000
BLOOM:
The Alhambra is perhaps
the most famous example

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.130
of Islamic architecture
to... to most Westerners.

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.300
It is the... the best
remaining example

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.660
of what a medieval Muslim palace
would have looked like.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.800
KINGSLEY:
Echoed in the finely carved
geometric plasterwork

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:48.060
and marble pillars

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.500
is a vanished lifestyle
of extraordinary luxury.

01:15:03.130 --> 01:15:06.300
The Alhambra reveals
the pinnacle of Islamic culture

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.800
and urbanity.

01:15:10.130 --> 01:15:11.930
BLOOM:
The beauty of the Alhambra

01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:14.230
is not so much in
the individual details.

01:15:14.230 --> 01:15:18.160
No, it's more the combination
of everything.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.960
That is, this wonderful,
sort of orchestrated interplay

01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:24.360
of different textures
and surfaces;

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.860
of light and space

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:30.060
and water playing inside
and outside the building.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.800
It's almost like a symphony
of different elements

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.000
that are very carefully
brought together

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.800
to provide exquisite enjoyment.

01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:00.300
KINGSLEY:
Here, the Muslim elite
relished the good life.

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:04.260
Reposing on lush carpets,
surrounded by perfume and music

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:07.330
the privileged few
debated the nature of God

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:09.700
the subtleties
of Greek philosophy

01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:13.660
or the most recent mathematical
revelations from India

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:16.360
while they dined
on spiced delicacies

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.560
served on Chinese porcelains.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.630
They strolled the grounds
through gardens

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:28.830
irrigated by complex
gravity-fed water systems.

01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:39.030
How far Muhammad's
followers had come

01:16:39.030 --> 01:16:40.860
from the life of desert nomads.

01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:44.330
How distant they felt

01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:47.760
from the rest of the European
continent they now shared.

01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.860
Christian Europe, due north

01:16:49.860 --> 01:16:52.930
was struggling on
through the Dark Ages.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.600
But at the dawn
of the 11th century

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.960
a tragedy in Jerusalem would put
Muslims and European Christians

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:06.500
on a collision course.

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:13.030
Jerusalem was ruled
by an Egyptian caliph

01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:16.330
an infamous man named al-Hakim.

01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:21.330
DENNY:
Al-Hakim was certainly
a deviation from the norm.

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.200
Clinically speaking,
I suppose today

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.730
we'd regard him as a madman--

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:26.460
as someone who
was simply insane.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:32.230
KINGSLEY:
For 200 years, Christian
holy places in Jerusalem

01:17:32.230 --> 01:17:35.200
had been respected and protected
by Muslim rulers.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.960
In 1009, the Egyptian ruler,
al-Hakim

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:46.300
broke with that tradition.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:52.000
He ordered the holiest church
in Christendom destroyed.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.530
HILLENBRAND:
And, horror of horrors

01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:59.030
he burned down the Church of
the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

01:17:59.030 --> 01:18:01.860
Now, nobody knows
quite why he did it

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:05.100
and you can have your own
theories about it

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:07.760
but the fact of the matter

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.600
was that that sent shivers
of terror and anxiety

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:15.100
through Christendom.

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:19.560
In a way, of course,
al-Hakim was the one exception

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.630
that proved the rule
for Christians

01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:27.030
that Christians had been
speaking of for centuries

01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:31.360
of Muslims as intolerant,
mad, slavering heretics

01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:35.330
who simply could not be expected
to abide by the rules

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:37.300
of<i> civilized</i> human beings.

01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:46.930
HILLENBRAND:
The fact that
al-Hakim's successor

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:50.000
rebuilt the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre--

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.060
it was done by 1048
with Byzantine help--

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:56.600
didn't cut any ice.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.460
There was this perception now

01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.630
that things were not going well
in the Holy Land.

01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:10.000
KINGSLEY:
In Europe, anti-Muslim
sentiment simmered.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.800
By 1095, it reached
the boiling point.

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.000
Pope Urban II spent most of that
year traveling through France

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.830
imploring his feudal lords

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:24.930
to unite in a campaign
of bloodshed.

01:19:24.930 --> 01:19:27.360
"Hasten to exterminate
this vile race

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:31.400
from the lands of your Eastern
brethren," the Pope demanded.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.600
"Jerusalem is the navel
of the world.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.400
"She cries out to be liberated.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.060
Christ himself commands it."

01:19:41.060 --> 01:19:44.230
HILLENBRAND:
So we've got a merging
or a coming together

01:19:44.230 --> 01:19:47.830
of military service and religion

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:52.000
which served the purposes,
if you like

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:58.200
of a Pope who, in 1095,
made his famous call to crusade;

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:03.530
to rescue the endangered
holy places in the East

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:05.960
and, in particular, Jerusalem.

01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:16.760
KINGSLEY:
In 1097, Muslim shepherds in
Syria caught their first glimpse

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.330
of a sight that would
soon strike terror

01:20:19.330 --> 01:20:20.700
throughout the Holy Land.

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.130
When the crusaders struck,
by sheer chance

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:31.060
the Arab Empire was
at its most vulnerable

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:35.530
broken into feuding kingdoms
and petty dynasties.

01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:43.960
HILLENBRAND:
They couldn't have chosen
a better moment

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:48.900
because the Muslim world was
in a very fragmented state.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:53.030
The... the great rulers
of the time had died

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:55.560
and into that power vacuum

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.600
there came this most
unexpected enemy--

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.830
the crusaders
from Western Europe.

01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:05.830
Who would have thought
that a new enemy

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:09.360
would come to the Islamic world
from that unexpected quarter?

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:12.360
It was completely unprecedented.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.530
It was a real surprise.

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.200
The Muslims didn't really know
who they were.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.700
They thought they were just
another lot of Byzantines

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.500
who were coming, as usual,
to be a nuisance

01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:27.200
and fight on the borders.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:30.700
They had no idea that there was
this extraordinary surge

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.830
of religious fervor
and fanaticism

01:21:32.830 --> 01:21:34.500
coming from Western Europe

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:38.660
and that the aim of this group
was Jerusalem.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:43.200
(<i> screaming</i> )

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.200
KINGSLEY:
History is haunted by days
of incomprehensible horror.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:53.560
Few are darker
than July 15, 1099

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.160
when the crusaders
entered Jerusalem.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.460
HILLENBRAND:
The massacre
must have been terrible.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:08.800
The... the, the fear...

01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:13.830
The fleeing of the population...

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:19.860
It must have been horrendous.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.100
KINGSLEY:
From a letter to the Pope
from the crusaders:

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.500
"If you want to know
what was done

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.900
"to the enemies
we found in the city, know this:

01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.930
"Our men rode
in the blood of the Saracens

01:22:37.930 --> 01:22:40.300
up to the knees
of their horses."

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:44.630
HILLENBRAND:
They saw the holy city

01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:47.700
and they were in a state
of exultation.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.300
And perhaps that's why

01:22:50.300 --> 01:22:54.030
when they flooded through
the gates of the city

01:22:54.030 --> 01:22:58.960
that they were fired up
with fanaticism and zeal

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.960
and that's why there was
this terrible massacre

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.800
in the name of Christendom.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.600
It was a blot on the name of
Christendom in the Muslim view

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:13.160
and justifiably so.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.760
KINGSLEY:
Even Christians weren't spared.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:22.260
At the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre

01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:26.160
dozens of worshipers from
Eastern sects were massacred.

01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:31.700
To the crusaders, they were
nothing more than foreigners.

01:23:34.330 --> 01:23:39.130
The Christian chronicles
record the carnage.

01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:41.560
"The Saracens
who were still alive

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:45.630
dragged the dead ones out
and made huge piles of them."

01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:52.000
"Such a slaughter of pagans no
one has ever seen or heard of.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.130
The pyres they made
were like pyramids."

01:23:57.530 --> 01:24:04.000
HILLENBRAND:
They shocked the Muslim world
when they came.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:10.900
There are a number of extremely
moving lamentations in poetry

01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:13.400
which date from that period.

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:16.060
And the Arab poets of the time

01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:20.030
talk about the feelings
of anguish and terror

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:24.060
which the crusaders-- or
the Franks, as they're called

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.460
in the Arab sources--
caused the local people

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.800
the old women, the young girls

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.230
those who are cloistered away
in their houses

01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:35.100
are trembling with fear.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.360
The whole imagery

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:40.160
is that of the rape
of their land

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.060
and the, um...
terrible impurities

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:45.960
caused by
these barbarian infidels

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.800
coming into their sacred space.

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.630
KINGSLEY:
"We have mingled blood
with flowing tears

01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:57.730
"and there is no room
left in us for pity.

01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:00.460
"To shed tears
is man's worst weapon

01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:03.560
"when the swords stir up
the embers of war

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:07.960
"when blood has been spilt,
when sweet girls must hide

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:11.630
their lovely faces in their
hands for shame."

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.660
The First Crusade was over.

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:24.700
Of the 100,000 men
who began the campaign

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.530
most would eventually
return to Europe

01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:30.860
having had only a glimpse
of Muslim life.

01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:38.930
The job of occupying Jerusalem
and the surrounding countryside

01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:42.500
fell to the 20,000
who remained... indefinitely.

01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:53.860
To secure their occupation,
the intruders did here

01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:57.560
what they had done in Europe,
they built castles.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.500
HILLENBRAND:
The crusaders built

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:04.300
the finest castles
that the Near East has ever seen

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:07.200
and the proof of that
is that they're still there.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.700
When everything else
may have faded away

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:16.530
the crusader castles
remain a living testimony

01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:19.100
to their presence.

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:21.760
And Krak des Chevaliers
in Syria

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.730
is<i> the</i> crusader castle
of them all.

01:26:25.730 --> 01:26:27.760
It's very, very big.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:31.030
It's strong...
it's impenetrable.

01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:32.530
It's a living example

01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:35.900
of the way that a number
of the crusader castles

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.860
couldn't be taken by siege.

01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:42.560
BLOOM:
You can see for miles and miles
from it

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.960
and see the other castles
that would have been, you know

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:48.130
in visual distance
for communication

01:26:48.130 --> 01:26:49.760
by fire and smoke signals.

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.160
It's got, you know

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.630
all the accoutrements
of a good medieval castle

01:26:56.630 --> 01:26:58.800
with battlements and turrets

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.200
and places for pouring
boiling oil and other liquids

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.760
down onto the enemy.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:12.000
HILLENBRAND:
But inside that castle,
what was life really like?

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.930
It wasn't merriment
and festivity;

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:17.360
it was constant fear.

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.060
You had to be on the lookout

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:21.730
in case someone
was trying to mine the castle

01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:24.600
or to climb over the walls
with scaling ladders.

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.300
The people outside--

01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:29.500
the population,
the local peasantry--

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:33.030
they were not, uh, friendly

01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:35.860
so you had to watch
their movements all the time.

01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:40.200
It was a... a terrifying place.

01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:47.760
KINGSLEY:
The crusaders made treaties
and broke them.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:52.030
They harassed the traders
who passed by their castles.

01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:54.100
As they raided caravans

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:57.500
the crusaders learned
of a luxurious lifestyle

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:59.130
unheard of in Europe.

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:04.160
Well, materially the crusaders
were just blown away

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:06.160
by what they found
in the Middle East

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.330
and they took a lot of it
back with them.

01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:10.260
Inlaid metalwork,
uh, textiles, silks

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:12.400
things like that
they had just never seen

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.600
in such quantities before--
the good life.

01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:17.900
These things they brought back
to Europe, some as souvenirs...

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:19.860
And, in fact,
there was a whole industry

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.500
that developed
in the Middle East

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:24.200
of providing souvenirs
for the crusaders to take back.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.200
KINGSLEY:
It is, perhaps, a Western bias

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.360
to imagine the crusaders were
a decisive force in world events

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:41.700
devastating to the Islamic
culture and trade.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.530
The truth is, while
the knights of the crusades

01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:52.860
were bunkering down
in their castles

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.900
Islam was spreading its
influence and flourishing.

01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.830
Muhammad's message rang out
as clear and strong

01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:01.930
as it ever had.

01:29:01.930 --> 01:29:11.630
(<i> calling people to prayer</i> )

01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:15.160
KINGSLEY:
Mosques were now
on every horizon.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:18.400
They welcomed traders.

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.130
They housed schools
and hospitals.

01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:25.700
Through Islamic architecture.
literature and music

01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:27.900
a vibrant culture was emerging

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:30.360
in celebration
of a singular faith.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.900
(<i> man singing Islamic prayer</i> )

01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:08.100
KINGSLEY:
Faith had launched an empire.

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:12.530
Culture was now enlightening it.

01:30:12.530 --> 01:30:16.660
But ultimately what united it
was trade.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:24.900
For the Muslims, trade, like
science, brought innovation.

01:30:26.900 --> 01:30:30.230
Business was expedited
by a revolutionary concept

01:30:30.230 --> 01:30:34.160
called the<i> akk,</i> a check
that could be written in Spain

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:36.330
and cashed in India.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.060
Writing a check assumes that
someone's going to honor it

01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.330
and cash it at the other end

01:30:43.330 --> 01:30:44.660
and that if you give the money

01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.230
or you have the money
in one place

01:30:46.230 --> 01:30:48.960
that someone will say, "I have
access to that somewhere else."

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.660
So this implies that you have
some kind of central bank

01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.600
or central loan organization

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.100
who's going to be
good for the money.

01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:59.400
So it frees up your ability
to travel.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.900
It frees up commerce

01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:03.860
because, again, the money
doesn't have to be moved

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:05.600
from Samarkand back to Córdoba

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.330
in order to go back the other
way the next year.

01:31:08.330 --> 01:31:11.000
So that you can base it all
on trust and faith.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.760
And Muslims became
some of the greatest merchants

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.360
of the Middle Ages.

01:31:19.330 --> 01:31:22.430
KINGSLEY:
And the greatest craftsmen
as well.

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:28.700
From the Persians,
Muslim blacksmiths learned

01:31:28.700 --> 01:31:33.330
how to fold steel to give it
strength and flexibility.

01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:36.000
The swords made
in Toledo and Damascus

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.960
had no equal in the world.

01:31:43.730 --> 01:31:47.230
But the economic backbone
of Islam's expanding wealth

01:31:47.230 --> 01:31:49.360
was textiles.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:53.530
The demand for the products
of Muslim looms was enormous--

01:31:53.530 --> 01:31:55.930
for cashmere, cotton and silk.

01:31:55.930 --> 01:31:59.900
BLAIR:
Textiles were simply
the gas and steel industry

01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:02.160
of medieval times

01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.160
because you have
to think of textiles

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.130
not only as growing the plants,
but making all the dyes

01:32:07.130 --> 01:32:09.930
and it was the dyes that
were particularly expensive

01:32:09.930 --> 01:32:11.400
and imported the farthest.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:13.960
And then you need all
the fixtures and mordants

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.800
and, uh, equipment for looms.

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.400
And then you need
to transport these textiles.

01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:20.360
So, collectively

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:23.260
the industry of making
and transporting textiles

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:25.260
was the mainstay of the economy.

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:37.130
KINGSLEY:
While Europeans settled for
coarse woolen and linen garments

01:32:37.130 --> 01:32:41.530
Muslims wore brocaded fabrics
of organdy, damask and taffeta--

01:32:41.530 --> 01:32:44.160
words that came into
the English language

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.430
from Arabic and Persian.

01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:49.630
The fabrics that were produced
in the Islamic world

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.130
were among
the finest ever produced

01:32:51.130 --> 01:32:55.230
and they were made of not only
plain linen or cotton

01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:57.760
but also very,
very fancy silks...

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:02.630
um, cloth of gold where silk
thread is wrapped with gold

01:33:02.630 --> 01:33:06.530
and with very,
very complicated patterns.

01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.160
KINGSLEY:
These complex patterns were
coveted by wealthy Europeans

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.800
and the church as well.

01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:21.430
When the Christians
needed a cloth

01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:24.760
worthy of wrapping
the bones of their saints

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:28.460
the choice was obvious;
they looked to a Muslim loom.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.730
But sometimes the fabrics
were trimmed

01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:38.230
with decorative Arabic texts
from the holy Qur'an.

01:33:39.730 --> 01:33:43.930
And so the words of the prophet
sometimes appeared

01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:48.400
in shocking proximity
to Christendom's holiest icons.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.360
It is not unusual to find

01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:53.830
in Italian Renaissance
paintings, for example

01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:57.360
to find paintings of the Virgin
wearing a robe

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:01.160
of very fancy patterned cloth
and precious silks

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:05.030
embroidered with gold,
or woven with gold designs.

01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:08.530
Sometimes they would say things
with an Arabic inscription on it

01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:10.460
which says,
"There is no God but God;

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.430
Muhammad is his prophet,"
in Arabic.

01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:23.100
KINGSLEY:
After almost 100 years of broken
treaties and sporadic fighting

01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.060
the Muslims reached
a turning point

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.430
in their struggles
against the crusaders.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.130
It came in the person

01:34:33.130 --> 01:34:37.300
of one of Islam's most
celebrated figures.

01:34:37.300 --> 01:34:39.430
His name was Salah Ad-din.

01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:44.000
But the West would remember him
and come to revere him

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.330
as Saladin.

01:34:46.330 --> 01:34:49.500
DENNY:
There is certainly one thing

01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.230
that we must recognize
about Saladin

01:34:51.230 --> 01:34:52.900
and that is
that he was successful

01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:55.800
where many others of his faith
and of his part of the world

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.430
had not been;

01:34:57.430 --> 01:35:00.430
that he possessed
one unusual feature:

01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:05.430
In addition to his intelligence
and his robust physical strength

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:08.800
he certainly seems to have been
a great inspirer

01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.700
of his military followers.

01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:18.960
KINGSLEY:
In 1187, Saladin amassed an army
of 12,000 mounted warriors

01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:21.930
and lured the crusaders
out of Jerusalem

01:35:21.930 --> 01:35:26.130
onto a plain between two hills
called the "Horns of Hattin."

01:35:31.130 --> 01:35:35.160
On the evening of July 3,
after a long march

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.860
the crusaders camped
on a barren hillside.

01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:42.230
There was nothing
but a waterless terrain

01:35:42.230 --> 01:35:44.900
and we're talking about July...

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:46.930
We're talking
about the Middle East.

01:35:46.930 --> 01:35:50.200
We're talking about
incredible heat and no water.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:58.400
KINGSLEY:
As dawn approached, Saladin's
men set fire to the tall grass

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.900
and a strong wind carried
the flames

01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:03.960
into the Christian encampment.

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.460
And very soon, they found
themselves surrounded--

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:11.660
as in the Muslim tactic--
by their enemy

01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:14.030
and panic set in.

01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:22.560
KINGSLEY:
"The flames bore down on them,
and the heat became intense"

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.500
Saladin's secretary wrote.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:29.660
"The people of the Trinity were
consumed by the fire of flames

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.900
the fire of thirst,
and the fire of arrows."

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:38.660
The army of the crusaders
was totally decimated

01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:46.060
and the victory at Hattin was a
real turning point for Saladin.

01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:49.160
It meant
that he could then proceed

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.500
to take Jerusalem
later on that year.

01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:59.530
KINGSLEY:
Three months later,
Saladin entered Jerusalem.

01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:05.260
For the first time
in almost a century

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:09.960
the call to prayer floated
over the Holy City once again.

01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.100
(<i> muezzin calling
 people to prayer</i> )

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.830
And yet, remarkably,
Saladin levels no retaliation

01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:31.400
against Christians
or their holy places.

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:34.460
In the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre

01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:37.130
mass was celebrated as usual.

01:37:37.130 --> 01:37:40.560
Saladin also decreed
that Christians who wished to

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:43.400
could leave the city
with their property.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.400
Those who chose to stay would
be allowed to worship freely.

01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.000
HILLENBRAND:
When his reputation reached
Western Europe--

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000
of the way he had behaved
in Jerusalem over the conquest--

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.800
he gradually became the most
famous Muslim of all time.

01:38:06.930 --> 01:38:10.260
KINGSLEY:
Saladin's victory
did not put an end

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:13.260
to Western aspirations
in the Near East.

01:38:13.260 --> 01:38:15.000
Other crusades would follow

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.860
though, as with the first,
they would hardly have an impact

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:20.830
on the larger Islamic culture.

01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:26.200
The crusaders would
eventually be driven

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.200
from their citadels
along the coast

01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.630
and return to Europe

01:38:29.630 --> 01:38:34.000
their only lasting legacy
a few abandoned castles.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.500
But the returning crusaders
found themselves changed

01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:41.030
by their contact
with Islamic culture.

01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:47.000
The long-term impact on European
life would be profound.

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.230
BLOOM:
They were just amazed

01:38:48.230 --> 01:38:50.330
by the material culture
that they found there.

01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:52.130
I mean, the quality
of the merchandise

01:38:52.130 --> 01:38:54.060
the quality of the goods,
was far better

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:56.360
than anything
they could find at home.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.060
And they brought it home
with them.

01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:00.100
HILLENBRAND:
They came back, for example

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.900
with a taste
for highly spiced food.

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.760
They imported pepper
and cinnamon

01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:07.800
and other oriental spices

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:11.060
because their taste buds
had been whetted

01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:14.130
by a different cuisine.

01:39:14.130 --> 01:39:19.860
We know that they found out
the delights of using soap

01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:22.660
when they were
in the Middle East

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:27.600
and it would appear that
that caught on back in Europe.

01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:29.000
After the crusades

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.560
many Europeans
were far more open to the ideas

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:35.100
of what was going on to the East

01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:37.830
what was happening
in other parts of the world.

01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:40.500
They simply couldn't be
as insular as before.

01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:43.700
Lots of people were open to...
well, what's out there?

01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:45.960
Let's explore this,
let's see this...

01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.760
new intellectual thoughts...

01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:50.100
Let's see what these people
are writing.

01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.430
Let's learn languages.

01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:54.630
This is when people start
to learn Arabic...

01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:56.130
slowly, in the West.

01:39:56.130 --> 01:39:59.300
KINGSLEY:
As the barrier
of language dissolved

01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.230
ideas born
in the great Muslim cities

01:40:02.230 --> 01:40:04.460
began to filter into Europe

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:08.230
ideas that would forever
change Western thought.

01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:13.460
The great Italian theologian
Thomas Aquinas

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:17.130
used the writings of
the Muslim philosopher Averroes

01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:21.400
to justify the clear separation
of faith and reason

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:26.230
a Muslim ideal that formed the
basis of all scientific inquiry

01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:29.030
and led
to the European Renaissance.

01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:32.060
Averroes himself appears

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.830
in Raphael's
classic Renaissance painting

01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:38.060
of great Western thinkers.

01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:41.460
Here, alongside Plato
and Aristotle

01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:46.600
stands a vivid reminder of
the debt the world owes Islam.

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.330
The scope
of Islamic civilization

01:40:54.330 --> 01:40:56.860
has now reached levels

01:40:56.860 --> 01:41:01.000
which certainly
were not accomplished

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
by any other civilization,
known civilization of the world.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:08.600
It actually unified parts
of our globe

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:13.830
in ways that had not
been witnessed before.

01:41:13.830 --> 01:41:18.200
KINGSLEY:
But this golden age
of Islam was not to last.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.360
After shrugging off the crusades

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:33.900
and bringing the precious gift
of knowledge to Europe

01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:37.830
the great cities of the Islamic
Empire would be brought to ruin

01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:39.360
by a force more terrible

01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.060
than anything the Europeans
could muster.

01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:49.300
Their libraries destroyed,
the wealth plundered

01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:51.800
the empty cities stood mute
in the aftermath

01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:53.930
of a devastation
that descended upon them

01:41:53.930 --> 01:41:57.200
not from the West,
but from the East.

01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.030
It's known
as the Mongol catastrophe.

01:42:09.230 --> 01:42:12.160
The Mongols
were Turko-Mongolian nomads

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.530
from the steppes
of central Asia.

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:21.460
In the 13th century, they
rampaged across much of Eurasia

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.460
between the Ukraine and China.

01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:31.360
It wasn't long before
they entered Islamic Persia.

01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.860
BLAIR:
To the cultured, urban Muslims

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:41.800
these guys were
a bunch of savages.

01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.260
When you entered the Mongol army

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:48.200
you came with yourself
and three horses

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.660
and you lived off the horses.

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.100
First, you drank their blood

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.100
and then,
when you moved far enough away

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:54.930
you killed them,
you slaughtered them

01:42:54.930 --> 01:42:55.930
and you ate their meat.

01:42:58.430 --> 01:43:01.860
And that's why they could go
so far and survive so long.

01:43:03.660 --> 01:43:07.530
KINGSLEY:
Terror was
the Mongols' principal tactic.

01:43:09.130 --> 01:43:12.460
BLAIR:
One of the local Iranian leaders
foolishly decides

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:15.560
to kill off the emissary
that the Mongols have sent

01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:19.360
and in doing that, he evokes
the anger of the Mongols

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:21.330
who want to use him
as an example.

01:43:21.330 --> 01:43:25.000
And they use this
retaliatory technique often

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:29.730
of killing off entire towns,
wiping them out as examples.

01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:32.960
And so they build
these fantastic towers of skulls

01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.900
where they pile up all the dead
bodies as an example

01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:39.430
and then all the other towns
around immediately give way.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.930
KINGSLEY:
City after city fell
before them.

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.000
It was only a matter of time

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.960
before they reached
the center of Islamic power.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:03.400
On February 10, 1258,
the Mongols took Baghdad.

01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:11.260
According
to the Arab chroniclers

01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:13.860
the Mongols put Baghdad
to the torch

01:44:13.860 --> 01:44:17.130
and killed 10,000 inhabitants.

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.000
Mosques and libraries

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.860
the collected knowledge
of centuries

01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.530
were all set ablaze.

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.460
Within less than 50 years

01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:39.260
the Mongols seized
the heart of the Islamic empire

01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:40.430
from the Arabs.

01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:48.960
Islamic civilization seemed
poised for destruction

01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:51.000
lost to posterity.

01:44:52.930 --> 01:44:55.500
But then
something remarkable happened.

01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:59.200
While the consensus of opinion

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.630
is that Mongols
were a devastating force

01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:03.900
I personally feel

01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:06.830
that they also had
a very positive effect

01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:09.660
on western Asia
and the world of Islam.

01:45:09.660 --> 01:45:12.400
They opened
the world tremendously.

01:45:15.230 --> 01:45:17.360
(<i> muezzin calling
 people to prayer</i> )

01:45:25.730 --> 01:45:27.260
And historically

01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:30.360
the most significant thing
about the Mongols, for us

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.160
would be that they became
Muslims, most of them

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.360
in the end--

01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.530
converted to Islam
and then became--

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:39.630
after being these tremendously
destructive forces--

01:45:39.630 --> 01:45:42.160
some of the greatest patrons
of the arts and letters

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.430
in all of Islamic history.

01:45:48.460 --> 01:45:53.730
KINGSLEY:
The conversion, and its lasting
effect, was extraordinary.

01:45:55.860 --> 01:45:58.400
Within a decade,
the Mongols had gone

01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:01.060
from building towers
of human heads

01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:04.000
to building mosques
glorifying God.

01:46:14.230 --> 01:46:16.960
ATIL:
It is not surprising to me

01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:21.160
that the land conquered
the conquerors.

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:23.930
The Mongols themselves
became Muslims

01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:27.200
or Islamic leaders
par excellence.

01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:33.060
KINGSLEY:
The Mongols transformed Islam.

01:46:34.330 --> 01:46:37.830
Now Islamic power
could be held by anyone

01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:40.300
not just the Arabs
who had created it.

01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.600
The Mongols threw open the door

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:46.430
for the great
gunpowder empire to follow...

01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:55.930
the empire of the Ottoman Turks.

01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:06.400
Islam was now set
on a new course of expansion

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:10.230
to both the east and the west...

01:47:10.230 --> 01:47:13.700
marching to the beat
of Turkish drums.

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:16.100
(<i> shouts, gunfire</i> )

01:47:22.330 --> 01:47:26.460
<i>In the conclusion
 of</i> Islam: Empire of Faith

01:47:26.460 --> 01:47:31.460
<i>an extraordinary power
 rises out of Turkey--</i>

01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:37.430
<i>the Ottomans, whose dreams of
 conquest would not be denied.</i>

01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:42.000
<i>Thus begins a centuries-long
 campaign of expansion</i>

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.860
<i>driving the Ottomans
 deep into the heart of Europe.</i>
