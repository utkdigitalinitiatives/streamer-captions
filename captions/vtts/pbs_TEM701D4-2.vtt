00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.100
DAN GILBERT: Its a
desire we all share.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.930
"To lead a rich,
fulfilling, happy life."

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.260
But you cant always
get what you want.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.930
ELIZABETH GILBERT: Why are we so
fickle? Why is it that one day

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.800
the things that make us happy
the next day bring us misery?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.330
DAN GILBERT: This emotional
life is a roller coaster...

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.760
taking us from the
heights of ecstasy

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.000
to the depths of despair
and every place between.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.660
KATIE COURIC: All
emotions have a role

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.160
in a healthy life;
were not automatons.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.000
"Im Dan Gilbert,
and in this series,"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.400
Im going to introduce you

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.600
"to everyday people who are
searching for happiness,"

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.930
as well as to the scientists

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.160
and clinicians who are
trying to help them find it.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.460
BARBARA ROTHBAUM:
What Ive taken away

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.560
is the resilience
of the human spirit.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.960
It is just amazing what we
can go through and be okay.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.730
WARREN KING: At first I
thought I was going crazy--

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.660
"the dreams, the nightmares--
but Im not letting it beat me."

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.530
What more can I say?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.160
Im a happy camper.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.230
GILBERT: Well see how our
greatest source of happiness

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.730
lies in the people around us.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.330
SETH POLLAK: The lesson weve
learned is that a basic need

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.160
"for human beings is
love, is companionship."

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.230
GILBERT: Well see
what happiness is...

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.400
what causes it...

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.530
and why we look for it
in all the wrong places.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.900
WOMAN: I used to think that
things would make me happy.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.460
"Or money, success."

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.500
Im realizing now that
thats not the fact.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.260
Happiness comes from within.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.660
"GILBERT: But next, well explore
the obstacles to happiness."

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.600
"Emotions such as fear,
sadness and anger."

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.000
JOHN McENROE: Have I lost it

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.100
to the point where I did
feel like Ive lost it? Yeah.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.630
I went through like six or
seven years of real depression.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.660
I just was never quite
given the right pill.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.560
"GILBERT: Asking why we have
them, why we need them"

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.230
and how we can all keep
them under control.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.060
"WOMAN: I remember
Caitlin screaming,"

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.230
"""You dont understand
how horrible it is to be"

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.900

GILBERT: Coney Island
is an amusement park.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.430
Imagine that.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.500
An entire park dedicated to
nothing more than a feeling.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.460
And theres a whole lot of
feeling going on around here.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.660
"People are happy and relaxed,"

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.400
"excited and frightened,"

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.360
"exhausted and relieved,"

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.700
"and yes, sometimes
even amused."

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700
"Human emotions are
a rollercoaster,"

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.130
taking each of us from delight
to despair and back again.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.860
We like the ups much
more than the downs.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.230
"But the fact is that emotions
like anger, fear and sadness"

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.860
have a critical role
to play in our lives.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.200
Negative emotions are
both our best friend

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.960
"and our worst enemy, and
science is beginning"

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.260
to help us understand how
that paradox is possible.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.800
McENROE: In the 80s
there was a poll done in
one of the newspapers.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.660
"The most heinous, you know,"

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.530
"people in the 20th
century, you know."

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.200
It was like Jack the
Ripper was one...

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.260
"I was two, Charles
Manson was three."

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.030
"You know, I mean it was like,"

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.430
"""Wait a second, okay, I
yelled at an umpire, okay?"

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.860
"I didnt mutilate 40
people or whatever."""

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.600
ALANIS MORISSETTE:
Anger feels hot.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.260
"Even talking about anger,
my whole rib cage is warm."

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.930
My legs are mobilized.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.430
Its the fight.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.160
I feel my jaw getting clenched.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.160
I want to punch something.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.130
"You know, I-I used to be the
kind of guy who, I would,"

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.030
I would scream on the street.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.700
I was screaming
on street corners.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.160
"When, when I asked somebody the
time and they go, (mutters)"

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:52.960
"You know, I would scream,
Id get in fights, you know?"

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.660
MARY MOLINA: I was in a bar.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.730
And I was with my girlfriend.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.930
"Across the way, there
were three huge dudes"

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.000
and they were there chilling
and sort of saying things

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.600
amongst themselves about her.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.860
"And um, so, you know, that
really got to me to the point"

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.360
"where I got up off my chair
and I walked over to them,"

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.900
"and then in a sort of
methodical sort of way,"

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.760
"you know, sort of
start picking at them."

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.130
"""Youre a fat piece of lardass,
you rich (bleep) mamas boy."

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.130
"Youre being a real (bleeps)."""

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:38.100
Do you understand that?

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.600
"When I want to hurt somebody,"

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.330
Im not thinking about
how could they hurt me.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.700
Im thinking about
how angry I am.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.330
It just... it just drives you.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.430
GILBERT: Mary is
a Los Angeles-based
writer and filmmaker

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.030
who knows what its like to
be in the grip of anger.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.630
Para que es esto?

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.130
"I was born in
Barenquia, Colombia,"

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.230
which is on the northern
coast of South America.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.200
My family moved here
when I was ten years old.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.800
My father was very frustrated.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.460
He would do things
like punch walls

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.360
and kick doors down
and things like that.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.200
He was really tense.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.930
He was really angry.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.930
"By the time that
I was like 14, 15,"

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.660
I was really reacting.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.500
I was so angry at him
that I wanted to...

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.760
"uh... I almost kind of
wanted to fight him,"

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.100
to see who would win.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.700
"Eventually it sort
of progressed, uh,"

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.230
"just sort of like a general
anger towards people,"

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.700
"towards things, towards, uh,"

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:58.230
a world that didnt
understand me.

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.530
"MAN: You could follow
through a little more, too."

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.200
On the right or on
the left or on both?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.600
Yeah. On the right. On
the right. On the right?

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.100
"Yeah, especially. Okay."

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.560
"When I get into arguments,
get into fights,"

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.830
I only see that person

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.760
or that thing in front of
me that I want to attack.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.130
"And then Im acutely
assessing the situation,"

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.060
"but only for one purpose,
and thats to win."

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.230
GILBERT: When animals are
threatened they experience
a surge of hormones

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.100
that make them ready to
attack or to retreat.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.100
Human animals are no exception.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.260
Our fight-or-flight response
is crucial for our survival.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.500
ROBERT ALLAN: Anger
can feel exhilarating

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:46.600
because what we do is trigger
the fight-or-flight response.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.430
We secrete lots of adrenaline
to power our large muscles

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.760
in the event that we have to
fight or flee from the predator.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.760
"We secrete cortisol,"

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.100
which heightens our auditory
and visual sensitivities.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.160
"We stop digesting lunch,"

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.830
because who needs
to digest lunch

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.800
if youre about to become lunch?

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.230
"Now, that response
is very appropriate"

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.730
when were dealing with
life-threatening danger.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.560
"However, the Yellow Cab driver
that cut you off in traffic"

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.560
comes to supplant the
saber-toothed tiger

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:25.500
"that our ancestors, millennia
ago, were dealing with."

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.300
"And when we look at what
happens physiologically,"

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.330
we stay in this heightened state
for quite some period of time.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.930
"And, because were dealing
with fight or flight,"

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.130
were dealing with impulses
that are very strong.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.300
(people cheering)

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.660

"emotions like anger and fear,"

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.130
are triggered deep
inside our brain.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:57.530

oldest and newest parts.

"(cheering, applause)"

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.560
While ancient structures
like the amygdala

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.560
"respond to threats by trying
to turn our anger or fear on,"

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.060
"its newer structures, such
as the prefrontal cortex--"

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.530
the thinking part of our brain--
that try to turn them off.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.560
Its the tug-of-war

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.160
between these two systems that
gives rise to our emotions.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.830
"At New York University,"

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.500
neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux
has studied how the amygdala

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.000
and the cortex shape our
emotional responses.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
"You know more about the
amygdala than anybody alive,"

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.560
and you still cant
control yours.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.930
No. Why?

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.930
"Now, theres an
interesting thing again"

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.030
that has to do with the
wiring of the brain.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.660
"So, if we could
look at it here..."

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.700
"So, this is the human brain,"

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.700
"inside a skull,"

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.030
"and the prefrontal cortex
is here in the front,"

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:54.060
right behind your forehead.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.230
And that is the newest
part of the brain.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.230
"This is where we
make our decisions,"

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.930
"this is where we
plan for the future,"

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.430
"um, and strategize."

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.330
The lateral prefrontal
cortex has no connectivity

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.700
with the amygdala.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.700
The amygdala has super highways
to talk to the cortex.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.060
But the prefrontal cortex
has only back roads

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.100
and side streets to
get to the amygdala.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.900
"And therefore, it is unable
to tell the amygdala,"

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:20.130
"""Cool it."""

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.230
But why are there
no connections?

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.560
"Were in the process of
evolving as we speak,"

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.400
and those connections
have not been put in yet.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.400
This thing was built

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.400
"to do fancy things
cognitively,"

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.360
not necessarily to
control our emotions.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.260
(thunder rumbling)

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.760
GILBERT: The fact that
we are not designed

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.760
to have complete control
over our emotions

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.830
can have some unfortunate
consequences.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.860
"MOLINA: I was in such
a deep, dark place"

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:53.730
that I couldnt even
really see myself.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.730
"Like, I had become
this, like..."

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:02.400
muddled thing of a person.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.830
I was so sad.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.830
I was so angry.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.330
I couldnt get beyond it.

00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.000
I realized I had to do something

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.100
when I hit rock bottom.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.500
(indistinct chattering)

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.260
One of my friends
invited me to a party.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.600
"And I was having a great time,"

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.100
"but, uh, because
Im a control freak,"

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.460
I decided that I wanted
to change the song.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:38.260
I wanted to go over to the
iPod and change the song.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.530
"So, the guy whose party it was"

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.200
"came over to me, and hes
like, ""What are you doing?"""

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.500
And I... boom.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.430
"I just went off. Im like, ""Who
are you?"" And he was like,"

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.000
"""Its my party, and Im
gonna play what I want."""

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.260
"Im like, ""Youre a (bleep)
selfish (bleep)."""

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.930
"And I just slapped
him across the face,"

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.000
and his glasses went
flying across the room.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.660
"Um, and so, at that moment,"

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.130
it was like everything
sort of fell away.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.330
You know what I mean?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.330
"Like, there were at
least another 20,"

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.500
"30 people in the room, and
I could see none of them."

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.500
"They just turned
into like this blur,"

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.130
and all I could
see was this guy.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.430
"He grabbed a chunk of my hair,"

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:29.160
"and he hung onto
it really tight,"

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.400
so I just started kicking him.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.300
"I was just, like,
laying on him."

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.160
"I was like, ""Let
go, let go, let go."""

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.760
"I kept on saying,
""Let go, let go."""

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.530
I just kept on kicking him.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.860
"Just kicking him and kicking
him and kicking him,"

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.030
"um, until he finally let go."

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:48.460
And at that point...

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.030
(sighs)

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:57.760
I just started crying.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.530
You know?

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.360
"And, uh, it was like
everything became real again."

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.400
"And all the people,"

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.900
"um, were there, and
they were looking at me"

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.830
"with such, like,
shock and awe."

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.700
And I...

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.560
I felt horrible...

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.560
...that I... that I did it.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.530
Thats what hurts me.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.130
"And that I shouldnt, you know?"

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.630
That it goes against my values.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.000
"It goes against
who I am, you know?"

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.430
Um...

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:48.800
Thats... thats...
thats what hurts me.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.530
ALLAN: Think about what
happens after an argument

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.600
that was really intense.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.200
People feel terrible.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.630
"Oftentimes, they feel
depressed afterwards."

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.030
Its not a good
long-term solution.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.630
"ADAM GOPNIK: Anger, uh...
its not a helpful emotion."

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.760
Its not always an
appropriate emotion.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.130
"And, in the cases
in my own life"

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.630
when Ive allowed it free range--

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.260
Ive allowed it action--

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.900
Ive always regretted it after.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.260
I dont... I cant think of a time

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.830
when Ive seen my own anger

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.900
as something that was
constructive for me

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.430
"or, uh, useful in the world."

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.360
But Ive noticed where
my anger comes out

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.900
in subtle or not so
subtle ways and how its...

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.630
"its wrought a lot of havoc in
my personal life, so, um..."

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.200
including the... the anger
that Ive turned toward me.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.530
McENROE: Have I lost it

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.200
to the point where I did feel

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.560
like Ive lost it? Yeah.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.900
Its not easy to feel
like you made an ass

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.130
"out of yourself, perhaps,
and get through that."

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:47.430
But people do...

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:56.860
I think people make mistakes
every day of their life.

GILBERT: Can we
outsmart our own brains?

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.600
Can we learn to
control our emotions?

Stanford psychologist
James Gross

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.660

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.600
"what scientists call
""emotion regulation."""

"GROSS: For me,
emotion regulation"

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.030
is really the science
of understanding

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:19.500
"how we can modify
our emotions,"

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.200
"harness their energy, so
that we can direct them"

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.560
in ways that we wish to go.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.800
"So, for me, emotion regulation"

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.260
"isnt turning down or
turning off all emotions,"

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.160
"because emotions, I think,
are often incredibly helpful"

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.500
and are what make us who we are.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.130
"But I think, at times,
its great to have"

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.100
a set of tools that we
can avail ourselves of

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.160
so that we can change the course

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.530
of the emotions
that were having.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:50.460
"GILBERT: To test his theory,
Gross asked about 100 women"

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.500
to take part in an experiment.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.500

up to a machine

"is that I have to stop myself
and just take a breath,"

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.100
and then also think about the...
the person in front of me.

"To, like, really see them as
someone who makes mistakes,"

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.460
"Youre in the middle
of an argument,"

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.400
"and youre so riled
up, and youre so ready"

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.630
to fight for something
incredibly stupid.

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.060
"Uh, that feels,
like, primordial."

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.830
Its hard to think about
the people around you

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.930
and how its
affecting them. Um...

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.000
Have you tried to put any
of this into practice--

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.230
"like, taking it out for a
test drive, this advice?"

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.130
Yeah. Yeah. And...?

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.660
Did it work?

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.460
"Its hard, hard work,"

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.660
but it works.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.860
You practice.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.230
"You know, its like anything."

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:49.660
"Its like learning an
instrument-- you practice,"

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.600
"and you learn some basic
tools, and you always go back"

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.430
to those tools when
all things fail.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:00.960
"Back in the day, you know,
I had to go to therapy,"

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.230
"and I found it... it
saved me cause I was very,"

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.630
"you know, kind of
self-destructive."

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.060
I was always acting out.

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.960
Four years of that twice a
week made a huge difference.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.700
ELIZABETH GILBERT:
Its a wonderful thing

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:14.530
to... to be able to go
to somebody who you...

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.960
"who didnt raise you, who
youre not married to,"

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.660
"who you dont have a 15-year
friendship relationship with,"

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.130
and... and be able to tell them

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.060
what you secretly are
longing for and needing

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.700
without feeling that
youre going to be judged

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.930
"or, um... or that youre going"

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:28.760
to hurt their feelings
if this comes out.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.800
"So, by being able to unload
these feelings to this doctor--"

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.000
"and I did, I told
her everything that was
making me feel crummy,"

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.960
"uh, and we discussed it--"

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.800
"when I walked out
of there, you know,"

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.860
maybe between the
time I left her office

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:47.330
"and into my car, I
was floating on air."

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:51.760
GILBERT: Psychotherapy has been
with us for more than a century.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.900
Sigmund Freud was the first to
suggest that emotional problems

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.100
"may be the symptoms of
something much deeper,"

00:19:57.100 --> 00:19:58.360
"something more significant,"

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.130
"something the mind is
hiding from itself,"

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.360
such as a traumatic
childhood experience

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.500
or a forbidden sexual impulse.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.460
So he had people
lie on his couch

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.030
and talk about their
dreams and their childhood

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.300
in the hope that they
might say something

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.230
that would reveal the true cause
of their emotional distress.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:20.030
"This kind of therapy
was intense, complex,"

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.960
and went on for
a very long time.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.360
"WOODY ALLEN: Uh,
yes, eight years,"

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.360
"I was on a couch, and, um,"

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.160
"five years, I was allowed to
sit up and face him and..."

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.800
"GILBERT: In a 1970s interview,"

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.560
comedian Woody Allen
poked fun at the process.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.560
"I dont know. DICK CAVETT:
How do you know, really?"

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.200
Thats what is always
the big question mark

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.330
"for me, is when do you
decide, ""Im done""?"

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:39.600
"Ah, thats a good point."

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.360
I dont know if youre
ever really done.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.060
I know that certain
characteristics about me

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.360
are different now than they
were when I started analysis.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.600
"Im... I started when I
was, uh, 22, and Im 35."

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.600
"So, I have aged."

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.360
"Thats something. (Cavett,
audience laughing)"

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.830
"Uh... That is progress,
cause its upward."

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.460
"Yes. Yes. Um, yeah."

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.600
"Uh, and I can... when I have
sexual relations with someone,"

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.660
I can now think of that person.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.160
"Rather than...? Rather
than somebody else,"

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.560
which is an enormous
step forward to me.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.330
How many years did that take?

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.730
"Where did that
come in, roughly?"

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.700
That just came in last week. Oh.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.860
"GILBERT: In recent years,
Freuds therapy has evolved"

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.960
"into a more streamlined
form of the treatment,"

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.530
known as psychodynamic therapy.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:22.630
The television
series The Sopranos

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:25.200
introduced the therapy
to a new generation.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.730
So youre carrying all this guilt

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.160
when your mother is clearly
someone who has great difficulty

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.160
in maintaining a
relationship with anyone.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.160
But shes my mother.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.900
RICHARD FRIEDMAN:
Psychodynamic psychotherapy
focuses on the role

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.130
of unconscious conflict

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.460
"in causing your problems
in relationships,"

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.100
"in your love life,
in your work life,"

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.560
"so that these are things that
are largely hidden from you,"

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.360
but they are making
you miserable.

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.460
And the role of
psychodynamic psychotherapy

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.600
"is to uncover them, to
make them conscious,"

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.230
to make you aware of that.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.200
The focus is on helping the
patient develop insight

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.360
into how things they feel today
or expectations they have

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.160
"about life and about people
come from their past,"

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.260
and that the insight
itself helps them to...

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.560
to change their behavior
and their ways of thinking

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.000
and... and helps
with the symptoms

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.830
they might be experiencing.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.400
GILBERT: Psychodynamic
therapy is based on the fact

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.260
that people dont always know

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.830
why they feel and think
and act as they do.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.330
"But in recent years,"

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.860
some psychologists
have suggested

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.330
that rather than searching

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.660
"for the hidden causes
of emotional problems,"

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.300
therapists might
just help people

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.760
develop the skills they
need to deal with them.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.930
"This idea is the basis of a
different kind of therapy,"

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.830
one thats helping
people learn to control

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:58.960
one of the most primitive
human emotions: fear.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.060
Christina Kelley is a
freshman at Harvard.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.360
"Shes a great student
and a terrific athlete,"

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.860
but shes deathly
afraid to do something

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.300
that millions of
Americans find easy.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.560
KELLEY: I am afraid of flying.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.160
Its not rational-- I know that--

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.730
"but at the same time,"

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.360
thats definitely just
what makes it a phobia.

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.230
"I just cant... I
know its irrational,"

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:26.830
and I cant do anything about it.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:28.730
Its not that Im...

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:30.800
afraid that theyre going to
go crashing to the ground

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.230
"or that someones
going to, you know,"

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.760
"try to take it
over or anything,"

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.330
but... theres not
really anything

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.760
"that I can, like, pinpoint
as to why Im afraid,"

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.460
and so I think that kind of adds

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.830
"to the whole, like,
overarching fear."

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:48.160
GILBERT: Is fear of
flying really irrational?

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.530
Do we have nothing to
fear but fear itself?

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.060
I am... I am scared
to death of dogs.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:56.660
"I mean, dogs are scary things."

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:59.730
"Theyre... theyre these sort of
strange, failed human beings"

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.460
"who have all these emotions,"

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.000
and yet they have these enormous
teeth at the same time.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I always have that
weird sensation

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.300
when Im out on a balcony
or in a high place

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:14.730
"that... where the
bottom is accessible,"

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.100
that Im going to climb
over the railing.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.730
That doesnt mean youre going to

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.500
"or youre even
contemplating it,"

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.600
but the fact that
youre in a situation

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.930
"where its possible, it
completely unnerves me."

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.530
Does anyone else have that?

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:30.530
(laughs) Yeah.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.560
I think our bodies are
beautifully equipped.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.130
Our reptilian brains and
our animal tendencies

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.800
are generous and
smart and helpful.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.230
"And you know, if
my house is shaking"

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.500
"in the middle of
an earthquake,"

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.800
"I-I hope my body will
kick into high adrenaline,"

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.660
grab my dogs and my turtle and
grab everything and leave.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:57.730
(rumbling)

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:02.000
RANDOLPH NESSE: There
are certain situations
that have recurred

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.430
over evolutionary time over and
over again that cause fear.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:10.660
"For instance, some nasty animal
running toward you very fast"

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.300
and baring its fangs.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.000
"Thats the kind of situation
thats happened not too often,"

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.800
but often enough
so that individuals

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.100
who have what we call a
fight-flight response

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.530
have a lot of advantages

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:23.300
"over those who say,
""Oh, hello, kitty."""

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.160
"Uh, its just not a good
thing to be, you know,"

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.530
laid-back and mellow

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.700
when theres a lion coming
towards you very quickly.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.800
"So, in the clinic, of course,
we call this a panic attack."

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.730
A panic attack is just identical

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.200
"to a fight-flight response,"

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.530
"and its perfectly
normal lots of the time,"

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.000
but not usually in
a grocery store.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.630
GILBERT: Many of the fears

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.630
that weve inherited
from our ancestors

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.900
are perfectly rational.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.100
It makes sense to be wary

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.100
"of small spaces
and thunderstorms,"

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.230
"and even snakes,"

00:25:55.230 --> 00:26:00.530
like this fairly large python
thats crawling on me now.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:02.530
But sometimes our
fear is irrational.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:04.600
"Its more intense
than it ought to be,"

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.960
or its in reaction to things
that cant really hurt us.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.960
"These fears are
called phobias,"

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.100
"and for some people,
theyre so debilitating"

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.230
that they need help
overcoming them.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.760
"In some cases, anti-anxiety
medication can be helpful."

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.900
"If someone flies a
few times a year,"

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.360
and they... and they get anxious

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.060
"every time it
starts to lift off,"

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.860
"or-or typically
when it lands, um,"

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.230
theres nothing wrong with
taking a pill for that.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.900
"If, on the other
hand, youre somebody"

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:29.800
"who has to fly
several times a week,"

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.860
"or, you know, a couple
of times a month,"

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.200
"and its part of your life,"

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.030
then that may not be
the best treatment.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.930
Then what you want to do is to
actually change your behavior.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:44.460
GILBERT: Medications havent
worked for Christina Kelley.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.430
"With emotions, its often
a paradox, you know?"

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.630
"That the more we dont
want an emotional state,"

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.100
the more that we experience it.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.530
"Right? And as soon as we
allow the emotion to come,"

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:56.200
"a lot of times,
it kind of starts to
diminish more quickly."

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.700
"GILBERT: Today,
Christina Kelley will
attempt to board a plane"

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.630
"with Todd Farchione,"

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.160
the therapist who is helping
her conquer the phobia

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.460
thats kept her from traveling
to visit friends and family.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.760
Just the way it is.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.630
"Whether you feel things,
or you dont feel things,"

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.900
"whether its bumpy,"

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.960
"or not bumpy, that you can
handle that situation."

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.560
Thats the most important thing.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.300
"GILBERT: Dr. Farchione uses
cognitive behavioral therapy,"

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.830
"or CBT, which is
extremely effective"

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.000
for people with
specific phobias.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.100
About 85% of those who try it
show significant improvement.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.300
"FRIEDMAN: Cognitive
behavioral therapy has
got a different focus,"

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.130
which is on identifying

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:37.060
and correcting dysfunctional
thoughts and feelings

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.930
that make you miserable.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.060
"So, a cognitive behavior
therapist is not so interested"

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.500
in why you have those
thoughts or feelings.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.500
"Hes interested, or
shes interested,"

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.400
in basically getting
you to identify them

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.800
and challenge them.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.060
We say you have a little machine

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:55.230
"down, buried in your
emotional brain."

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.460
"And its spitting
out, you know,"

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.960
all of these really
scary kinds of thoughts.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.500
"But because youre the one
thinking those thoughts,"

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.300
you tend to believe it.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.930
So we have a saying
in cognitive therapy--

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.100
"""Dont believe
everything you think."""

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.260
"GILBERT: Christinas therapy
started two days earlier,"

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.800
when she met Dr.
Farchione at his office.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.660
Most people sign up for a
dozen or more treatments

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.260
"over a period of weeks,"

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.130
but Christina opted
for a marathon session

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.260
lasting three days.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.300
"Well, let me just start"

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:34.230
"by asking you how you, uh,
how you did last night."

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:36.030
Good. Um...

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.630
I tried to explain
it all to my family.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.000
Right.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.500
"So I think that helps me
kind of, like, go over it."

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.730
"So at this point,"

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.360
how are you feeling
about taking that flight?

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.700
Im very nervous.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.200
"And, uh, it-it-it switches
back and forth between,"

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.760
"like, I can do this, and
then, suddenly, Ill feel like"

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.000
"this is really overwhelming,
and, like, all at once,"

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.360
and I cant believe
Im doing this. Um...

00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.660
"With panic,"

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.460
what often happens is that
it becomes this cycle.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.730
"Um, that theres a recognition
of the physical symptoms,"

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:08.560
"and as a result of that,
theres then an increase"

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.900
"in the actual physical
response, right?"

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.000
"An increase in those
symptoms, right?"

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.360
"So as you are approaching
the plane, for instance,"

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.260
"if you start having
physical feelings,"

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.330
"and you say to yourself, like,
""Well, theyre not going"

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.600
"to go away,"" or ""This is
going to be really bad;"

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.430
"this is going to
be an awful trip,"""

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.500
"this type of thing,
um, its likely"

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:28.000
that that... physiological
changes are going

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.460
"to increase, right?"

00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.660
"So one of the things that we
want to do is, we want to see"

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.330
"if we cant elicit some
of these symptoms,"

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.030
"um, in part so
that you can see"

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:38.260
that this is just your body
doing what your body should do.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.130
"GILBERT: Early in the session,"

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:44.100
Dr. Farchione asked Christina
to do a series of exercises

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.730
that bring about some of
the physical sensations

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:47.930
"associated with fear,"

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.560
such as dizziness...

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.900
shortness of breath...

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.630
and a racing heart.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.030
(exhales)

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.400
The idea is that once Christina
becomes more familiar

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.830
"with these sensations,"

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.660
she will become
less afraid of them.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.230
And how similar is that

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.360
to what you experience
prior to flying?

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.560
"Uh, pretty similar."

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.130
"Like, a six or a seven."

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:11.760
"Okay, a six or a seven."

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.930
"Were going to go into
this, um... this flight"

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.800
"with no safeties,
no avoidance,"

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.530
"and essentially,"

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.660
confront what it is
that youre afraid of.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.900
And if that means
experiencing those sensations

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.000
"in that situation, again,
thats not a problem."

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.530
"Then its a matter of
allowing them to come,"

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:31.160
and allowing them to
diminish of their own accord.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.630
"You know, if somethings
terrorizing you,"

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:35.060
"terrorizing you
and bothering you,"

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.160
"like, lets not...
lets not run away."

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.230
"Lets go find it, you know?"

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:51.100
(crying)

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:57.300
(sniffles)

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.660
(sniffles) This is overwhelming.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.860
"Um, if you had to rate it on
a zero-to-eight-point scale,"

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:09.030
where would you put your
anticipatory distress right now?

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.200
Eight.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.430
Eight. Okay.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.160
So its pretty...
its pretty high.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.130
GILBERT: Dr. Farchione
encouraged Christina

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.330
"not to push the frightening
thoughts aside,"

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.060
"but instead, to let
them come to mind"

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:24.360
so that they can be
examined or reappraised.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:28.000
"So, what can we come up with
as a good alternative here?"

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.560
"Its going to be hard,
but its going to be okay."

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.030
Okay.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.260
So wait a minute.

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.660
Its going to be hard.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.730
Im going to feel...?

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:38.200
Scared and panicky.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.660
Yup? Good.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.760
GILBERT: One of the key
principles behind CBT

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.760
is that we can
change our feelings

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.360
by changing the thoughts
that produce them.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.500
BARLOW: Were not trying to
stamp out all bad thoughts.

00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.900
"In fact, that might
be counterproductive."

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.800
"Were just trying to say, ""Lets
look at the alternative."

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.500
"""Lets put this
in perspective."

00:31:57.500 --> 00:31:59.860
"Lets reappraise this."""

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.460
"And, oh, yeah, youll continue
to have scary thoughts."

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.860
But you know what?

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.460
You can live with them.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.800
"And when they do that,"

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.030
it actually changes
brain function.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.360
"There are changes in
the prefrontal cortex,"

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.200
"working down into
the emotional brain,"

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.200
just by this really working
hard on reappraising.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.160
Allowing it to unfold
is actually going to be

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.130
"the fastest way for it to...
for it to diminish, all right?"

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.530
Yeah. But youre still...

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.030
"youre still scared, and
you still need to do this."

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.200
Okay. Okay.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.600
"All right, Todd,"

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.100
your return boarding pass is
stapled right on the back.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.160
GILBERT: Now comes
the decisive moment.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:38.260
Christina will attempt
to board a plane.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.760
Cognitive behavioral
therapy has a cognitive

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.300
"or thinking component,"

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:45.560
but it also has a
behavioral component.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.730
We must go out and do
the things were afraid of

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.600
so that we can learn
from experience

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.400
not to be afraid of them.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.730
BARLOW: The important
thing is that reappraisal--

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:59.630
it has to be paired with
what we call exposure.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:01.000
Ticket. Ah.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.900
BARLOW: Where people will
begin to put themselves

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.800
in the feared situation--

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.330
"under therapeutic guidance,"

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:11.860
and with the appropriate
coping mechanisms--

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.260
where their emotional brain

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.400
can really begin to learn
and become convinced

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.360
that these terrible things

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.430
will not happen.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.160
Whats wrong with the way that
youre feeling right now?

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.730
It sucks.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:27.130
What sucks about it?

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:29.130
Its not comfortable.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.360
Whats the most
uncomfortable part of it?

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.060
Is it the heart?

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:34.930
The heart rate?

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.730
Its feeling like
Im going to cry.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.160
"And have been, for the
last, like, three days."

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.600
Thats not fun.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.160
"Okay, so its-its feeling..."

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.000
its feeling as
though you might cry.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.130
And what... what is the
implications of that?

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.500
What if you did cry?

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.360
I dont want... Im
not going to cry.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.830
What if you did?

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.500
"Well, that just
makes it worse."

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.200
It does? Yeah.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.730
WOMAN (over P.A.): Take
a moment to review the
safety information card

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:02.060
in your seat back pocket.

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:04.630
Passengers seated in rows
nine and ten are also asked

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.330
to review exit row
seating requirements...

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.060
BARLOW: What were trying
to end up with is somebody

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.360
who can totally
accept the full range

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.960
of their emotional experience--

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.860
"be aware of what their
emotions are doing,"

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.800
"in the way theyre
making you feel,"

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.900
"the way theyre
making you think,"

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.600
"the way theyre
making you behave,"

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.400
and accept that.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.130
"And sort of be with it, and
distance yourself from it."

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:46.560
"And in so doing, put the
emotion in its place."

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.400
I sort of like this idea
of you moving around

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.360
"a little bit, so if you can..."

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.800
"Like, get up, or just...?"

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.100
"Um, yeah, maybe get up,
maybe see if theres anything"

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.960
"in the overheads, uh,
that you might need."

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:01.200
"Um, if you want, you can put
my coat up in the overhead,"

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.430
or something along those lines.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:04.830
Its okay.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.230
Do it quickly. What?

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.160
I dont want there to
be that hesitation.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.460
I want... (snaps his fingers)

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.630
There it is.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.960
Ta-da!

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.130
"No, no, no. Go ahead
and put my coat"

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:15.860
"in the overhead
for me, please."

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:19.260
FARCHIONE: The one
moment that really stuck
out for me was the moment

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.860
at which she was
willing to get up.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.960
"She didnt want to do
it, but she did it."

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.330
"You know, I mean,
she really..."

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:27.330
"She knew it was the
right thing to do,"

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.330
and she committed to it.

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.930
Excellent.

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:34.260
That was the point
at which I felt

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:37.360
very good about her ability
to overcome this problem.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.530
Youre getting there.
Youre getting there.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.760
Slowly but surely.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.430
I... I dont know.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:46.000
"Im going to say, actually, um,"

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.360
"I dont think its as
slowly as you, uh,"

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.900
you might imagine.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.060
Youre doing... youre
doing a fantastic job.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.860
Absolutely fantastic.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.300
Thank you very much. Excuse me.

00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.860
I might see you again soon.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.560
Thank you.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.760
See you guys.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.030
All right.

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.200
I like them.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.230
"Its like the, uh..."

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.630
"Yeah, they were
nice, right? Right."

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.730
"Its, uh... I wish we had,
like, some triumphant music."

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.660
Now this is where we
pull out the iPod...

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.160
"Yeah. ""Chariots of Fire."""

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:16.030
"...and you put on, maybe,
like, the Rocky theme."

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:17.360
"Yeah, yeah. Or
something like that."

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.900
KELLEY: I flew.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.660
"Its exciting, and not as bad as
I thought it was going to be."

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.630
"But I did it, and
thats the first time"

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.600
"Ive gone in a real plane
in two and a half years,"

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.360
"and just the fact that...
that I did is, is empowering."

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.130
"And Im glad that it was
successful, and I..."

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:37.360
"In the middle, I felt
better, so, it was good."

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.330
GILBERT: Fear is an emotion
shared by many other animals.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.160
(sinister laughter)

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.600
But human fear is unique
in one important way:

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.430
Its not limited to clear
and present danger.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:54.660
Sometimes our greatest fears
are about things to come.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.160
"I mean, an air conditioner
can drop off a building."

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:00.660
"You know, this is...
this is not irrational."

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.130
When Im walking down the
street and I think about

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.530
"air conditioners dropping
off of, you know,"

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.160
"the edges of buildings
onto my head,"

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.600
"even if somebody
says, ""Well, its only"

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.800
"a one-in-a-million chance
its going to happen,"""

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.760
"I mean, theres eight million
people in this city."

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.630
"And so thats actually, like,
a lot of air conditioners."

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:20.600
"Sometimes when Im really happy
and things are going well,"

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.560
"that makes me anxious,
because I think,"

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.660
"""Oh, God, you know, life
is so tenuous and fragile."

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.630
"(snaps fingers) In an instant,
it could all change."""

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:31.260
I have friends that sit there

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.700
and the glass is half full.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.630
"My glass, somebody said
to me the other day,"

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:41.000
"is not only half empty, whats
in it is filled with poison."

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.230
"So, I am always anxious."

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:46.900
If anxiety prevented me from
doing what I wanted to do

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:48.260
"I wouldnt be sitting here, no."

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.360
I think it spurns me on.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.660
Anxiety isnt something
if youre born with it

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.660
"that you can hope
to eliminate,"

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.600
its something that
you learn to use.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.600
And to the degree
that you can use it--

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.500
and its a useful
emotion in that way.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.630
"Its like having your own
little pump of caffeine,"

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:04.700
"uh, running
through your veins,"

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:07.760
"and you, you turn
it on, you order up,"

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.700
"you know, a triple-anxiety
cappuccino."

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:17.360
GILBERT: Anxiety is an
inevitable part of modern life.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.130
"We worry about our
jobs, we worry about"

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.230
our children and our health.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.230
We worry about money.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:24.030
Our ability to
think about things

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:26.860
"that havent happened,
but might, can make life"

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:30.160
a stressful experience.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.260
Stanford University
neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:37.100
is the author of a book called
Why Zebras Dont Get Ulcers.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.660
Hes spent his career
trying to understand stress

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:43.460
and the toll it takes on
our bodies and brains.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.700
"According to Sapolsky, the
problem is that our minds"

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:51.560
dont turn the stress response
off once a danger has passed.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.800
"Well, the basic problem is
that were so damn smart."

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.400
"Um, I mean, you take
a zebra, you know?"

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.660
"Im sure there are some very
insightful zebra out there,"

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.300
"but theyre not
one of the more,"

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.660
"sort of, nuanced species."

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.460
"As far as I can tell,"

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.530
"a zebra is sitting
there eating grass,"

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:08.500
and what its thinking
about is eating grass

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.600
or maybe somebody it
would like to mate with.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:15.060
"A lion shows up, all
hell breaks loose."

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.200
"The zebra survives,
and five seconds later,"

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.760
its back to eating that grass.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.160
Theres no anxiety.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.130
Theres no close calls.

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.660
"Theres no existential pangs
of ""What does it all mean?"""

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.730
And its not till
when you get to us

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.760
that we are smart enough
to imagine our own deaths

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:36.530
or be moved by Beethoven
or read about kids

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.930
in a refugee camp on the
other side of the planet

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:40.430
and have a stress response.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.430
Were dealing with a
very different species.

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:45.900
And what that mostly
gets you is the ability

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.700
to turn on the stress
response chronically

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.930
for purely
psychological reasons.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.560
We turn on the exact
same stress responses

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.500
as the zebra running
for its life.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:57.330
And we turn it for
hours and days and weeks

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.830
"and career-long periods,"

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.360
and thats not what
it evolved for.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.830
(projector humming)

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:11.000
GILBERT: Just as our brains
can imagine the future...

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.500
"...so, too, can they
remember the past."

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.500
"Memory is one of
natures greatest gifts,"

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.330
but it comes at a cost.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.260
"Because we can
re-experience past events,"

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.000
we can be terrorized today

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.260
by things that
happened long ago.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.030
"And thats what happens to
people who suffer from PTSD,"

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.330
or post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.860
(flames crackling)

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:51.830
(propellers whirring)

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:54.000
KING: You cant afford

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.660
to have feelings
when youre in a war.

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.500
You kill or be killed.

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.230
Thats your main objective:

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:07.900
Live and come home.

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:17.160
"After you see a war zone, yes,
your minds going to change."

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.330
GILBERT: Warren King
was a 19-year-old

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.160
former high school
football player

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.500
when he joined the Marines
and went to Vietnam.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.330
He would return a different man.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.430
"KING: The first couple weeks
when I came back home,"

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:32.330
"it was kind of rough, because
thats when the dreams--"

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:34.860
"the nightmares, started--
you know what I mean?"

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.800
"But at first, I laughed
about it, you know?"

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.330
"You know, you
know, its dreams."

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.900
You know what I mean? But...

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.000
It started getting
more deeper into me.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.500
"GILBERT: Although Warren was in
Vietnam for less than a year,"

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.030
he relived the war
every day for the next

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:54.830
three decades.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.000
"KING: I knew
something was wrong,"

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.560
but I didnt pay no
attention to it.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.900
(woman speaking Vietnamese)

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.860
GILBERT: So how did you
know that you had PTSD?

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:10.100
"KING: Well, at first I
didnt know I had PTSD."

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.500
Whatd you think it was?

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.200
"Um, at first, I thought I was"

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.560
going crazy.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.730
"You know, like I
was losing my mind."

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:21.530
"You know? And
then, eventually,"

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.600
I started remembering
these dreams.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.830
"And I started remembering
where they took place,"

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.030
the people within these dreams.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:35.160
"And then, um, it
started getting worse."

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:38.560
"I started doing,
drinking more..."

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.830
"Doing drugs, dont
want to go to sleep."

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.560
You know?

00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:47.900
"Eventually, I was
killing myself."

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.900
"GILBERT: For more
than 30 years,"

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.400
Warren couldnt keep a job

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.400
or even stand to be
around other people.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.660
"Eventually, he stopped
leaving his house."

00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.400
KING: I was possessed.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.700
My life ended.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.900
I didnt have nothing.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.730
Sometimes I didnt want to live.

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:11.430
But I was too scared
to kill myself.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:14.300
GILBERT: Doctors at the
Veterans Administration

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.000
gave Warren a range
of medications:

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.430
"sleeping pills,
antidepressants,"

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.160
anti-anxiety drugs...

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.830
but nothing helped.

00:43:24.830 --> 00:43:31.500
"Every night, the war
in his head raged on."

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.500
"Although any kind of
trauma can lead to PTSD,"

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:39.600
combat soldiers run an
unusually high risk.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.500
"Because traditional
treatments fall short,"

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:45.100
tens of thousands of
soldiers and their families

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.560
are struggling
with the disorder.

00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:49.660
"Yeah, he did, he got
a rope on that one."

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.930
"You got a little piece of
that one, didnt you? Huh?"

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.660
"Come on, Sis. Just throw it."

00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.760
GILBERT: Bob is devoted
to his wife and their
two young children.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.930
But his mind keeps returning

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:02.030
to something that
happened in Iraq.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:03.800
Uniform stuff.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.560
"Flashlights are
still dirty, see?"

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:11.400
"My letters are all
here, from my wife."

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.600
And I got more stuff
down in the bottom.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.100
"I kept my uniforms and boots,"

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:22.660
just for keepsakes.

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:24.060
Smell that smell?

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.660
I cant get it out.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:31.000
Cant get it out.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.830
"GILBERT: In 2003,
Bob crossed into Iraq"

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:38.730
as part of the first
invasion forces.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:41.830
"Within days, he found
himself on the outskirts"

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.500
of An Nasiriya in one
of the bloodiest battles

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.800
of the conflict.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.860
The horrors of war

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:54.500
"were all around him, but
one image in particular"

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:57.160
is burned into his memory:

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:02.400
the face of the Iraqi soldier
who died in Bobs arms.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.800
"BOB: Our column
was moving and, um,"

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:10.130
there was a bus and it
was... it was on fire.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.430
And there were people
screaming and yelling.

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:17.760
(indistinct chatter)
(sirens blare)

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.430
"As we went by, you know,
trying to assess quickly"

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.000
what was going on...

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.430
and there were two
guys laying there.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.500
And one of them was
missing his leg.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.900
And the guy next to him had
a big hole in his chest.

00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:33.000
"So we knelt down and I just
looked in the guys face,"

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.800
"and I just looked
at him, you know."

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.430
And I took my helmet off
and I just looked at him.

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:41.160
"And, uh, he died
looking at me."

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.500
He literally breathed
out his last breath

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.000
and did his little rattle and
stuff looking in my face.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.160
And I watched his eyes go gray.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.130
"And, uh, right now as
I tell you about that,"

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.330
I can see his face as clearly
as if Im looking at...

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:59.830
the floor-- just that clearly.

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:03.560
Its not some hazy memory.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:06.700
"Its very clear, very clear."

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.700
"The voices, the
words exchanged,"

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:11.730
"the, the feeling--"

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:14.100
and-and thats the
part I hate the most--

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:19.030
I can feel what I felt as
clearly as I felt it then.

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:22.160
"Nightly, he would wake
up from a nightmare."

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.660
"Or hed be talking in
his sleep, waking up."

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:28.060
"Uh, hed be walking through
the house, on patrol."

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:29.500
I didnt have that
problem before.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.160
"I mean, anybody who sits
up in their sleep and talks"

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.930
"and stuff like that,
thats... it is what it is."

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.330
But not getting up
and going on patrol

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:41.100
"or getting up and, you know,"

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.000
reliving a trauma scene again

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.630
or getting up and
shouting orders.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:46.560
"You know, ""Get me some
cover fire over here!"

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.900
"I got problems,""
this and that..."

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.130
(clears throat)
Thats not normal.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.330
GILBERT: Medication
and psychotherapy

00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.060
"havent helped Bob much,"

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.730
and the tragedy in his past
continues to wreak havoc

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:00.760
in every aspect of his life.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.760
(backup signal beeps)

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.230
"Three weeks ago,
Bob lost his job"

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.400
as a news director of
a TV station in Reno.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.700
BOB: Were moving.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:13.730
Were leaving Reno.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.560
Were going back to the Bay Area

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.160
to start over.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:23.660
"Um, and do what? I dont know."

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.160
I do think that the
symptoms of PTSD

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.730
"that I deal with every day,"

00:47:27.730 --> 00:47:30.500
"and the fact that I
dont get a lot of rest,"

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.530
because I cant sleep...

00:47:31.530 --> 00:47:35.360
so... yeah.

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.430
It contributed to me
losing my job here

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:44.000
"and, probably, my career."

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.830
LORI: I worry about the
stress of everything.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.530
I cant tell you how many times

00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:50.530
"in the last couple months,"

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.100
"Ive just, like, rolled over
in the middle of the night,"

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.600
just to make sure he
was still breathing.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:58.060
Cause Im just-- I just dont know

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:04.860
how much more he can handle.

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.660
"BOB: Ill tell you whats
embarrassing to me, is having"

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.900
to go back to my mother-in-laws
house and regroup.

00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:13.560
Ive never had to fall
back like that before.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.560
"It makes me feel
like, you know,"

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.830
Ive done all these things in
my life and I-I just cant...

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:22.300
How the hell did I
get in this position?

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:26.000
I feel like I failed

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000
and I let my family down.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.260
"GILBERT: So, what causes PTSD?"

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.560
Why do our brains
sometimes remember

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.030
the very things wed most
like them to forget?

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:46.100
Emotional events leave
long-lasting traces in memory.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.360
Thats why we all know
just where we were

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:54.360
"at 8:30 a.m. on September
11, but not on September 10."

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.530
What gives these memories
such staying power?

00:48:58.530 --> 00:49:00.830
"When people experience
intense emotions,"

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:02.760
their bodies release
stress hormones

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.600
"such as cortisol
and adrenaline,"

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.200
and some scientists now
believe that these hormones

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.700
help burn in memories
of the events

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.060
that caused the emotions
in the first place.

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.660
"For nearly a decade,"

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.060

has been studying the connection

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.560
between stress
hormones and memory.

"GILBERT: To investigate
the connection,"

Cahill and his colleagues
designed an experiment

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.060
in which two groups
of students reported

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.960
to their laboratory and watched

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.930
a slideshow of
disturbing images.

00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:45.160
"After the slideshow, the
students in one group"

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.530
were asked to hold their hands
in a bucket of ice water

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:50.160
for as long as they
could-- an experience

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:54.860
that caused their bodies to
release stress hormones.

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:57.700
The students in a second group
were asked to hold their hands

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.800
in a bucket of lukewarm water--

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.530
with no release of
stress hormones.

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.300
MAN: Thanks for coming again.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.900
"And, uh, I should explain"

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.260
that we did mislead you
a little bit last week.

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.930
"So, last week, we said..."

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.660
"GILBERT: A week later,
the students returned
to the laboratory"

00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.530
and were surprised
with a memory test.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.160
What were actually
going to do this week

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:17.800
is Im going to ask you to try

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.300
and remember some
of the images...

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.960
GILBERT: The results were not
what most scientists expected.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.000
CAHILL: Some of my
colleagues-- because they come

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.600
"from a slightly different
perspective-- they thought,"

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.360
"well, you know, if you
learn something new"

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:29.800
and then do something
as... as distracting

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.230
"as dropping your
arm in ice water,"

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:32.960
that should be really
bad for memory.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.260
It should be really bad

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.060
for the memory of
what you just learned.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:38.600
You should forget it.
Memory should be worse.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.260
"And I can understand that,
but thats not what we found."

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.000
GILBERT: The results of
Cahills experiment showed

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.760
that the students who had
put their arms in ice water

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.800
immediately after
viewing the slideshow

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.660
had much better
recall of the images.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.130
The stress hormones coursing
through their veins

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:57.200
somehow burned the
experience they were having

00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.430
into their memories.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.100
CAHILL: A good memory
is exactly that--

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:02.530
a balance between keeping
what you ought to keep

00:51:02.530 --> 00:51:04.960
and getting rid
of or abstracting

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.030
what you can get
rid of or abstract.

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:08.500
What we think we have here

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.630
with this whole business
of stress hormones

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:12.630
is a beautiful system

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.460
built in for doing just that.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.330
GILBERT: Does the
kind of research

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:19.260
that you and others have done

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:23.430
give us any insights into
disorders like PTSD?

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.860
When someone experiences
something too traumatic--

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:28.360
"uh, a rape, a
horrible car crash,"

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.160
"uh, being in a battle--"

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.260
it could be that this
normally very helpful

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.930
memory boost system that
weve been talking about

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.500
somehow-- and for reasons
we dont fully understand--

00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:42.460
"gets stuck in the
""on"" position, right,"

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.960
"and in the period during
and after the trauma,"

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.830
"repeatedly
strengthens a memory,"

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:49.030
"strengthens a memory,
strengthens a memory."

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.800
"The retrieval of the memory
causes the stress hormones,"

00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:53.900
"and the stress hormones keep
strengthening the memory,"

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:56.300
and you can imagine a
positive feedback cycle.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:02.760
(siren wailing)

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.230
"GILBERT: For Bob,
moving to California"

00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:12.030
to live with his mother-in-law
has left him demoralized.

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.660
You guys going to
go outside and play?

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.000
GILBERT: Lori and the
kids are trying to adjust

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.300
"to a new routine
and a new school,"

00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:26.660
but Bobs PTSD holds each
of them in its orbit.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.060
WOMAN: Welcome to California.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:30.660
Welcome back. LORI: Thank you.

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.930
Welcome back.

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:33.160
Here we go.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.360
"Okay, so were going to..."

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.900
"today, were going to
talk about Gabriel"

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.200
"and how hes doing
in first grade,"

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.560
"and... hes only been here
for a little bit of time,"

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:42.660
"but hes transitioned well,"

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:44.060
so...

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.360
Hes showing

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.830
"some good leadership skills,
uh, with his peers--"

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:51.000
with both the boys and
the girls-- and he seems

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.560
"to be happy, uh, and
if he needs help,"

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:55.800
he has no problem asking
me. (toys clattering)

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:57.400
"Hey, try to do it
quietly, please."

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.030
"LORI: Sarah, dont
throw those, please."

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.060
"TEACHER: Sarah, can you
make a happy face with that?"

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:03.530
Can you be... With the yellow?

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:04.960
How about being quiet?

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.130
That would be something new.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:07.830
"TEACHER: Well, theres
just so much to do."

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:09.160
(loud clattering) Okay.

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.600
No more... no more
dumping it in.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.100
Just... okay.
LORI: There you go.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.060
"Perfect, Gabriel. Sarah."

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:16.430
TEACHER: Okay. Well
clean those up later.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.300
Okay? Sorry about that.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.430
Its okay.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.030
I have 20 of them in here.

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:24.530
BOB: I cannot stand loud.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.000
I cant.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.930
Noise sends my temper
and my blood pressure up.

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:31.030
"Hes doing really well,
and his writing--"

00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:33.160
Ill show you a little
bit of his writing.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.430
LORI: The hardest part
about post-traumatic stress

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:37.400
for a married woman...

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.460
(sniffles) is the
focus is on him.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:44.330
A part of me feels like...

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:47.000
(sighs)

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:54.160
its not okay for me...

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.530
"...to break down,"

00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:02.100
because the focus
is on helping him...

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.560
...and lifting him up

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.700
and getting him
through this time.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:11.030
Hes so fragile right now.

00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:14.730
This time has to be about
getting him through

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:17.430
and getting him to a
place where he feels

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.260
like hes on solid ground again.

00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.660
(sniffles)

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:24.030
Then Ill have my time.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:25.660
"I love you, baby.
Love you, too."

GILBERT: PTSD threatens
to destroy everything
Bob cares about.

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.660
"As he looks for a new
job in California,"

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:39.500
the obstacles seem
almost insurmountable.

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:41.430
BOB: I was mobilized twice

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:44.730
and I did the invasion.

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.430
"And, uh, we just moved
back to California."

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:48.060
We were gone out of
state for 20 months

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.200
and weve been back
about a month. Okay.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.830
Age limit? 37.

00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.530
No matter what? No matter what.

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:55.700
Im too old.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:54:57.660
"Only looking for
officers, huh?"

00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.960
Yeah and entry-level. Yeah?

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.560
"Some retail management,"

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.930
a lot of management in
the news business...

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:07.030
The market is running
tough right now. Yeah.

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:08.460
I appreciate it.
Thanks for your time.

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.800
"MAN: Thank you, sir."

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.560
"GILBERT: Before he left Reno,"

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:17.660
Bob learned about a new form of
cognitive behavioral therapy

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.830
to treat PTSD.

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:22.600
"But the treatment,"

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.000
"a variation of the one
used to treat phobias,"

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.660
would require Bob to confront
the memories that haunt him.

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.360
BOB: The counselor up in Reno

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:34.830
made me promise him

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:38.330
I would look into this
program that they have.

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:45.660
"Um, but you know what?
Im just not there yet."

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:46.900
Im not scared of it.

00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.660
I just dont want to.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.830
Its not... Im not afraid of it.

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:54.100
I just... I relive a lot of
them all the time anyway.

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.400
"Why do I want to go relive
them again, you know?"

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.260
"I just aint, I just
aint there yet."

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:04.030
"It might be a good program,
but I just... Im..."

00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:07.400
"Look, Im all for doing
something that might help me,"

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.000
but I just aint...

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.830
Im just not there yet.

going to get me there,"

GILBERT: The treatment that Bob
just cant bring himself to try

began to get easier."

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.100
ROTHBAUM: We think that whats
happening in exposure therapy

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:08.430
is new learning.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:11.260
"A lot of times, people
years ago used to think"

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.100
"that in our work with anxiety,"

00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:15.260
that we were erasing
a fear memory.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.300
And we know that thats not true.

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:19.800
Were not erasing the memory;

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:22.330
were teaching the
person new things.

00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:23.660
"Were teaching
them, for example,"

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.560
"""I dont need to be
scared of this memory."

00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.560
"""Yes, this was a terrible
thing that happened,"

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.560
"""but I dont need
to be scared of it."

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.500
"""I can go there, I
can think about it,"

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.530
"I can talk about
it, and Im okay."""

00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:36.360
And thats new learning.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.360
"What, seven years?
Yeah, well..."

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:42.260
"GILBERT:
After 18 sessions, Warrens
progress is unmistakable."

00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.300
CAPALDI: What I wanted to ask
you to do today was to...

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:47.800
"go through the story, again."

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.800
"Um, to do the
imaginal exposure."

00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.800
"Um, and you remember
how we do that."

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.300
We have you talk
about what happened

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.800
from your memory.

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.130
"You know, close your eyes and
really try to visualize it,"

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.860
"and put yourself back there,
really try to revisit it."

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:02.860
"Close your eyes,"

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.700
"visualize the memory,"

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.330
and start talking about it.

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:12.030
"We came in, we started
taking machine-gun fire."

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:15.200
"Everybody know that sound.
When you hear that sound,"

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.800
you have to get
down low as you can.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.360
Youre afraid.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.360
"And more and more youre going,"

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.400
you see people lying
there with their guts out.

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.060
"And nothing you
could do for em,"

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:30.060
then theyre calling you by name.

01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.800
"Thats the worst part,
but theres nothing you
could do about it."

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:34.130
Youre no doctor.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.730
You just got to keep moving on.

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:37.600
"You just gotta go
there and do your job,"

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.600
you know what I mean?

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.630
"And, and its-its
no time for guilt."

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:45.330
"Because you was always told,"

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:48.000
"""Kill or be killed."""

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.160
Thats the name of the game.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:01:00.500
(sighs)

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.500
Im okay.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:06.000
"No sweating of the
hands, no headache."

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.500
"A little teary, but..."

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.500
"far as that, Im all right."

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.730
Okay.

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:15.760
GILBERT: Let me ask
you this: If I had PTSD

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.260
"and I was haunted by dreams
and haunted by thoughts,"

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:20.800
Id want to get away from them.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.800
And the last thing I would do

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:26.300
"would go see a
therapist who says, ""Oh,
no, youre going to--"

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.860
"were going to
talk about them."""

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:29.930
"Id say, ""No. I see
enough of that at night."

01:01:29.930 --> 01:01:31.800
"I dont want to see
that during the day."""

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.430
Can you relate to
people feeling that way?

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.300
"KING: Well, I used
to be like that."

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.300
I didnt want to talk about it.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.760
I didnt want to say
nothing about it.

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.460
But you got to face it.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.630
Do you think there
are a lot of soldiers

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:45.630
"who might not
even ask for help,"

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.300
cause they have
kind of this sense

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.960
"that ""Im supposed
to be brave,"

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.130
"""Im supposed to make
my way through this,"

01:01:51.130 --> 01:01:53.300
"Im not supposed to ask
other people to help me""?"

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.800
"Yes, well, theyre fools."

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.060
They are fools.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:58.860
Cause sometime you need
to drop that macho thing

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.200
"and ask for help, because
if you dont ask for help,"

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.660
you gonna die.

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:06.330
"And thats what you
want to be, macho man?"

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:21.400
"Well, you know something, the
graves are full of macho men."

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.900
"ROTHBAUM: Ive been doing this
work for over 20 years now,"

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:28.930
and at times the
emotion in the room...

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.930
is just palpable. Its raw.

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:32.760
I have felt like I was holding

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:35.760
someones broken
heart in my hands.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.760
Its been so raw.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.930
But part of what Ive
taken away from this work

01:02:40.930 --> 01:02:43.600
is the resilience
of the human spirit.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.100
"It is just amazing
what we can go through,"

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.100
"and how we can
come through it,"

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:53.930
"at the other
side, and be okay."

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:55.600
GILBERT: Would you
say youre better now?

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:58.060
"Not just a little
better, but all better?"

01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:00.860
"KING: Well, Im not going
to say Im all better."

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.860
But I know how to handle PTSD.

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:06.730
You never get rid of PTSD.

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.760
Theres no cure for it.

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.160
GILBERT: Doesnt sound like your
treatment helped your life.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.200
It sounds like it gave
you your life back.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.200
"The day I went
to that program,"

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.200
"till today,"

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.630
is the best years of
my life I ever had.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:25.630
I have a life.

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:27.000
You know what I mean?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.030
"Like I said, Im not
letting it beat me."

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:30.360
You know what I mean?

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.030
I am doing well
than Ive ever been

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:34.830
in my whole 30-something
years when I had PTSD.

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:36.830
You know what I mean?

01:03:36.830 --> 01:03:38.130
What more can I say?

01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:39.230
Im a happy camper.

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:46.960
(laughs)

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.800
"GILBERT: Every human life
has its share of sorrow,"

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:55.760
and theres just no
getting around it.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.760
Sadness rolls in like a fog.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.630
We cry. We mourn.

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:05.130
And eventually the fog lifts
and we get on with our lives.

01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:07.860
"But for some people,"

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.360
"sadness gets a grip
and just wont let go,"

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.360
and thats when a
normal human emotion

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.760
becomes a psychological
disorder.

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:17.600
(seagulls squawking)

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:21.100
Depression is these feelings
of sadness and anxiety

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.600
that hit a bottom and continue
inappropriately long.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.630
Its almost about duration.

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:28.630
"Sadness is manageable.
Um, depression is not."

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:30.630
"And I-I think thats, um--"

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:32.130
"thats the major
difference between them,"

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.630
its a question of scale.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.130
And I think its tricky
in our own lives

01:04:36.130 --> 01:04:38.730
"to sometimes make
that distinction, um,"

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:42.730
as to whether we are feeling
simple human sadness

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.230
or whether weve-weve
fallen into something else.

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:47.730
"One of the great, um,
things Ive learned--"

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:50.330
the opposite of depression
is not happiness.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:53.360
"Um, the opposite of
depression is vitality."

01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:55.930
Its not just a
sense of melancholy.

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:57.930
"Its not just, um, a--"

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:01.000
a pervasive sadness.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.830
"Theres, uh... there are
more hideous aspects"

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:08.160
"in the sense that it
affects your concentration,"

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.800
it affects your
cognitive abilities.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:14.460
"...talk to her, um,"

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:17.500
"said that shes
really, really sweet."

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.530
"CAITLIN DAVIES:
Hi, Im Caitlin."

01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:22.200
And Im 18.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.530
"State your last name, too. Oh."

01:05:23.530 --> 01:05:25.460
Caitlin Davies. Go.

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:27.460
"Okay, Im Meghan Davies.
Im Caitlins twin."

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.960
Younger twin by 46 minutes.

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.960
"Yep. Im 18 years old, also."

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.630
Tomorrow we graduate
high school. Mm-hmm.

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.130
"GILBERT: Two years ago,"

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:40.630
Caitlin Davies was diagnosed
with clinical depression.

01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:43.130
"Her identical twin, Meghan,"

01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.130
showed no symptoms
of the illness.

01:05:45.130 --> 01:05:48.300
We asked the twins to
record video diaries

01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:50.630
during the summer after they
graduated from high school.

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:54.660
(overlapping chatter)

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.900
"CAITLIN: Um, is there
anything you feel..."

01:05:56.900 --> 01:06:00.130
youre feeling optimistic about?

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:03.960
The future.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.730
Im excited to go off to college.

01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:06.760
Thats good.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.760
Youre taking a math class?

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.100
Um...

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.530
MEGHAN: Caitlin-- optimistic?

01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:16.560
"CAITLIN: Well, Im feeling
optimistic about next year,"

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.060
"and the possibilities
of the summer,"

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:24.060
"and, um, things like that."

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.730
"But, again, thats"

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:27.730
also for me a
double-edged sword.

01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:30.000
Its also what Im feeling...

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.500
Pessimistic.
...pessimistic about.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.430
"Im worried about next
year, going off to school."

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:39.260
How am I going to be
able to handle that?

01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:40.830
"GILBERT: Despite
her depression,"

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.830
"Caitlin maintained a straight
""A"" average in high school"

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:47.000
and remains determined
to go to college.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.330
"But as she prepares
to graduate,"

01:06:49.330 --> 01:06:53.160
she finds herself spiraling
downward once again.

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.060
CAITLIN: Depression-- its
not like having a bad day.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.400
Its just so much more

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.160
"to that: the exhaustion,"

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.730
"and the lack of focus,
lack of motivation."

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:08.700
"Its just everything, because
sadness is something"

01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:12.700
that you can... its the
easiest of all of those things

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.560
"to deal with, because there
is an outlet for that."

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.230
"Like, how do you have an
outlet for lack of motivation?"

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:22.030
How do you have an
outlet for lack of focus?

01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:23.600
"Like, lack of energy?"

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.430
"Like, what can
you do about that?"

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:27.360
"At least with sadness,
like, you can,"

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.860
"I dont know, you can write,"

01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:31.000
"I mean, you can cry."

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.260
But you cant do anything
about all those.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:39.360
"And its just, its just so much
more than just emotional."

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.500
Its so much more physical

01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:46.660
than what a lot of
people think it is.

01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:49.660
Because your body feels it.

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.130
You feel down. You cant move.

01:07:52.130 --> 01:07:54.960
You cant get up and do
what you want to do.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.500
"And it doesnt matter how much
you want to do something,"

01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.400
you just cant.

01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.900
"GILBERT: At 18, Caitlin
is waging a fight"

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:05.330
that could determine
the course of her life.

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:08.730
She must devote all her
energy to getting well enough

01:08:08.730 --> 01:08:10.730
to leave home at the
end of the summer.

01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:18.200
(Caitlin sighs)

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.500
"BOB ANTONIONI: In closing,
let me just say this."

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.830
This has been the
opportunity of a lifetime

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:24.300
to serve in this branch.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.560
It doesnt get any
better than this.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.400
"You know, time comes on,"

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.500
"and, um, Ive decided that it
was time for me to leave."

01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:37.060
"Um, I never imagined that I
would get elected, and, um,"

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.000
"you know, its been the best."

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.330
Thanks very much.

01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:53.830
(applause)

01:08:53.830 --> 01:08:56.830
GILBERT: Senator Robert
Antonioni has served

01:08:56.830 --> 01:09:00.560
in the Massachusetts state
legislature for 20 years.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:03.330
"For most of that time,
he was a very public man"

01:09:03.330 --> 01:09:06.230
with a very private secret.

01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:08.000
ANTONIONI: I think
that my struggles

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.030
"with depression began in 1999,"

01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:13.300
when my brother
committed suicide.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.660
I had all sorts of feelings

01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:19.160
"of guilt,
responsibility, neglect,"

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:24.360
"um, that, that I
carried with me."

01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:29.000
"I felt very, uh, traumatized
with my brothers death."

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.900
And the way that I dealt
with it most often was

01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:39.460
"to remove myself from, um,
the normal daily events."

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:43.230
"And for a politician,
thats not a good thing."

01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:45.230
"Um, because politicians
dont get elected"

01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:47.700
by removing themselves
from the public.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:59.660
They get elected by
being in the public.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.300
I would frequently go home.

01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:05.100
I would just curl up

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.760
and burrow myself in.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:17.560
"Um, and Id sleep, you
know, excessively."

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.400
"I frequently would think,"

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.430
"""I just gotta get
ahold of myself"

01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.560
"and stop feeling
this way."" You know?"

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.330
"""Real men dont cry."

01:10:28.330 --> 01:10:30.530
"""And if youre a real
man, youll get over it."

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:35.330
"Cut it out. Get it together."""

01:10:35.330 --> 01:10:37.400
I can remember one
day in my office

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.330
"just sitting down, crying."

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:40.830
"And my chief of staff said,"

01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:43.230
"""Bob, we gotta do something
about this, you know?"""

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:44.760
That gave me the inclination

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.500
that something had
to be done here.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.600
"You know, had to, had
to deal with this."

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.100
Yeah.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.330
GILBERT: Bob sought the
help of a psychotherapist.

01:10:55.330 --> 01:10:58.660
"As he began to talk about
the loss of his brother,"

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:02.400
he discovered something
important about himself.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.900
"ANTONIONI: When I began
therapy, I found it very hard"

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.900
"to talk about what
I was feeling,"

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:09.660
because I was not
accustomed to doing that.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.560
I had never opened up

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.730
the way that I did
with the therapist.

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:20.360
"Eventually, I came to
understand that the hurt"

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:23.900
and the feelings that I
had on a regular basis

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:27.560
"werent just related to my
brothers death, but that"

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.600
I had an issue with depression.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:34.300
And its been there for... it
had been there for a long time.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:36.260
CHIDEYA: Its not bad to be sad

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:38.130
"or bad to be angry,"

01:11:38.130 --> 01:11:42.230
"but when you are persistently
sad over a long period of time,"

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:43.730
"and its not about the moment,"

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:45.830
its about something
that happened...

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:47.930
"you know, thats a time
when you have to say,"

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.860
"""Well, whats going
on with my mind and my
body and my spirit?"""

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:53.530
"I remember thinking, ""Im
having a bad week."""

01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:56.060
You know? And then the bad
week turned into a bad month.

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:57.700
And then that turned
into a bad year.

01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.630
And then it turned
into a bad four years.

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:02.400
"And then I remember being
absolutely terrified,"

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.230
"because I thought,
""Have I turned a corner"

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:09.330
"that I will never,
ever be able to fix?"""

01:12:09.330 --> 01:12:12.300
The most fascinating
thing about depression

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.660
is that you cant pin it down.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.000
You cant say its just sadness.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.930
Youre saddened by the fact that

01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:21.100
youre not in control
of your thoughts.

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:24.560
"Theres no desire to get
out of bed and do things,"

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.860
because youre not
sure you can do them

01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.960
with any great sense of judgment

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.460
or without any sense that
itll make you feel better.

01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:38.460
GILBERT: Depression doesnt
just change the way we feel.

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:43.160
It actually changes the
way we see the world.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.830
"Dr. Ian Gotlib,
professor of psychology"

01:12:45.830 --> 01:12:48.560
"at Stanford University,
is trying to understand"

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:52.330
just how deep these changes go.

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:54.160
"In one of his experiments,"

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.630
a group of women with
a history of depression

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:58.760
and a group of healthy
control subjects

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.900
watched faces on
a computer screen.

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:03.900
The faces started out
with a neutral expression

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.560
that slowly transformed
into either a happy

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.700
or a sad expression.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:11.160
The women were told
to press a button

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.930
as soon as they noticed
the transformation.

01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:18.260
Gotlib found that
nondepressed women

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:21.230
were much faster to notice
the expression becoming happy

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:26.160
"than the women who were,
or had been, depressed."

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.600
GOTLIB: Weve been finding
that depressed people tend

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.860
to guide their attention
to negative things.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:34.660
"When there are both negative
and positive things happening,"

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:42.530
theyll tend to really
focus on the negative.

01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:44.630
"They attend to more
sadness, and importantly,"

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:46.660
they remember more sadness.

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:48.730
So those memories of sadness

01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:50.830
stay with them longer.

01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:54.660
"Depressed people
remember the criticism,"

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:56.260
they dont remember the praise.

01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:57.760
"Or they discount the praise,"

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.230
"and they say, ""It
just wasnt warranted."

01:14:00.230 --> 01:14:01.960
"I didnt deserve it."""

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.060
"Um, and even things
that are neutral,"

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.030
they tend to interpret
as more negative.

01:14:06.030 --> 01:14:08.530
GILBERT: Gotlibs studies suggest

01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:10.500
that this isnt something
that depressed people

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:11.900
are conscious of doing.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:15.900
"Rather, they just seem to
be especially sensitive"

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.960
to negative information--

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.500
one of the things that
distinguishes depression

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.000
from normal sadness.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.060
GOTLIB: These thoughts
are so automatic

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.360
theyre part of us.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.730
"We go, uh, through the day."

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.260
"We have all sorts of
thoughts, reactions."

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.100
And Im sure youve been in a car

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.500
and 15 minutes later youre
at a different intersection

01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:36.060
with no real memory
of how you got

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.630
from the last one to this one.

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.300
But you did it and
you did it safely.

01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.160
"But you did it
outside of awareness,"

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.900
and you did it automatically.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:45.560
"And for depressed people, thats
what these thoughts are like."

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:48.230
"Theyre, theyre just automatic,"

01:14:48.230 --> 01:14:50.900
"um, knee-jerk reactions."

01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:54.400
"So, well start with the
first saliva sample."

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.500
If you could take
the top off of that

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.700
and put the cotton
swab in your mouth.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.560
And Ill time you
for three minutes.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.800
GILBERT: But why are
some depressed people

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.960
prone to negative thinking?

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:09.660
"In another experiment,
Gotlib set out to explore"

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:12.430
the biological underpinnings
of this thinking style.

01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:15.230
So now were going to
do a math activity.

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:17.960
"And for this task, well
ask you to start off"

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:21.500
at the number 400 and
count backwards by sevens.

01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:24.030
GILBERT: He subjected a
number of volunteers--

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:26.400
"some at risk for
depression, some not--"

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.000
to a difficult mental task
and measured the level

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.830
of the stress hormone cortisol

01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:32.300
that was in their saliva.

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:34.700
Start. 400...

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.230
393...

01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:40.330
383...

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.730
300... Thats incorrect.

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:45.560
Please start over. 400...

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.960
393...

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:52.730
386

01:15:52.730 --> 01:16:01.430
370...

01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:03.660
371

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.000
Thats incorrect.
Please start over.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.730
400...

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.300
GILBERT: The results were clear.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.000
"Under stress,"

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.800
people who were
vulnerable to depression

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:15.160
generally produced
higher levels of cortisol

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.600
than people who werent.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.230
"GOTLIB: In doing this,"

01:16:19.230 --> 01:16:21.400
"one of the things
we found is that,"

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.060
"um, people who are depressed
and people who are prone"

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.830
to becoming depressed
are actually

01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:32.000
more biologically
reactive to stressors.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.300
"When theyre confronted
with a stressor,"

01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:36.300
they have no control over it.

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.900
"They secrete more cortisol,
the stress hormone."

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:42.300
They dont mean to
be more reactive.

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:45.860
Thats a genetic factor over
which they have no control.

01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:49.360
And that goes along with this
attention to negative events.

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:51.330
Theres a whole picture

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:54.260
of just a greater reactivity
to negative information.

01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:57.460
"You cant learn, for
example, easily,"

01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:58.630
"to control your cortisol,"

01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:01.500
"uh, to control this
stress hormone."

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.460
But you can learn

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.660
to respond differently
to stressors.

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:09.500
"You can learn to
recognize stressors,"

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:12.100
to not have a gut
reaction to them

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:14.500
"as, ""Oh, my God,
this is horrible."""

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.960
"But to say, ""Aha, now I
need to do something."""

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:20.760
And thats a very
different response.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:26.830
And it elicits a very different
stress hormone response.

01:17:26.830 --> 01:17:29.330
GILBERT: Psychotherapy
helped Bob Antonioni

01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:31.760
realize the role stress
played in his depression.

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.060
But he was unprepared

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.100
for his therapists
recommendation

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:42.330
that he combine therapy
with medication.

01:17:42.330 --> 01:17:44.000
ANTONIONI: It took
me several years

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.500
to feel comfortable
taking medication.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.500
I was afraid political
opponents or the media

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.830
"would somehow uncover that
I was taking medication,"

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:58.830
"receiving therapy,
for depression."

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:02.460
I would go to a
drugstore that was

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:04.760
half an hour from my house.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:11.060
I saw a therapist 45 miles away.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:14.160
"GILBERT: As a senator, Bob
began advocating for funds"

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.730
to combat mental illness
and prevent suicide.

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:18.560
But he hid his own depression

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.630
from all but a
few close friends.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:26.630
"Then one day in 2003, he
decided hed had enough."

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:29.230
ANTONIONI: I was asked
by a local reporter

01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:33.000
why was I advocating so
much for these things?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
And I disclosed

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.160
"my brothers passing,"

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.930
"and how he died, by suicide."

01:18:39.930 --> 01:18:42.260
"And the reporter asked,"

01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:44.760
"""Bob, did you ever
suffer from depression?"""

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:48.300
"I said that, ""Yes,
I have depression."""

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:52.660
"And she said, ""Are you sure
you want to say that?"""

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.030
"And I said, ""Yeah. I gotta,
cause its the truth."""

01:18:56.030 --> 01:18:58.730
"The day after the
story appeared,"

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:01.230
I went to a big
function in Boston.

01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:03.730
All the political
people were there.

01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:08.460
"And I remember walking into
that auditorium thinking,"

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.960
"""What an idiot!"

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:11.460
"""Why did I say all that?"

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.230
"These people are going to
think Im nuts!"" you know?"

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:18.000
"Well, let me tell you, as soon
as I saw someone who knew me,"

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
"they came up, hugged me,
""Bob, Im so proud of you."

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.160
"Im so glad you
talked about this."""

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.500
"Um, thank God, you know."

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.660
"More people, they just
kept running up to me."

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.230
"You know, youd
think Id just won"

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:31.630
the Stanley Cup or something.

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:35.160
"And, you know, I was really
taken aback, I was shocked."

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:39.000
"And, uh, I said,
""Wow, okay."""

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.600
"You know, ""Thank
you. Thank you."""

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.800
"I didnt know what the reaction
would be from the public,"

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.330
"but people were like,
""Wow. Thank you."""

01:19:48.330 --> 01:19:51.030
"You know, ""Im so happy that
youre talking about this."""

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:55.260
"And um, it was, uh..."

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:58.460
"The reaction was just
unbelievable, it really was."

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:00.960
It was pretty cool.

01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.130
Yeah.

01:20:03.130 --> 01:20:05.130
GILBERT: Youve been
to the bottom of this.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:06.800
You look like youre
at the top. (laughs)

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.700
"I mean, you seem...
you look like a guy,"

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.160
"you strike me as a person
who, at least at the moment,"

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.730
"is feeling pretty happy, pretty
optimistic about the future,"

01:20:13.730 --> 01:20:15.930
pretty confident in the
decisions you made.

01:20:15.930 --> 01:20:18.000
"I do, Im really
happy about it."

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.360
Im very fortunate.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.300
Im in a place where I am now

01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.430
because of the medication

01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:24.830
and because of the therapy.

01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:26.530
But life-changing decisions

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:27.900
"can make things
easier, too. Thats..."

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.500
Deciding... deciding not
to run for re-election

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:33.160
and to have one focus--

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:36.260
"um, in this case,
practicing law--"

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:40.100
has made life so much more
manageable and enjoyable.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.360
Im not constantly anticipating

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.860
"the next shoe to
fall, you know?"

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:47.200
"Um, or the next
problem to arise."

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.930
"Now, Im, I feel like Im
more in control of things"

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:54.660
"and, uh, managing
things easier."

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:58.360
There are many moments in my
life now when I am happy.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:02.300
Bicycling promotes
happiness for me.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:07.260
Doing fun things
promotes happiness.

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:13.430
I dont consider myself
cured from depression.

01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:17.000
Its something I have to
continue to deal with.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.860
"But like high blood
pressure or cholesterol,"

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.260
theres medication I can take

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.930
and things that I can do

01:21:23.930 --> 01:21:28.300
so that happiness
becomes more possible.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.160
"CHASE: I went through,
like, six or seven years"

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.630
of real depression.

01:21:31.630 --> 01:21:34.560
"I just couldnt quite figure
out what it was, how..."

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.530
And I just was never quite
given the right pill.

01:21:37.530 --> 01:21:40.160
"You know? ""Oh, put him on
Prozac, put him on..."""

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.900
"Thats, you know..."

01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.330
"Its still trial and error
with most people, I think,"

01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:45.500
who suffer from depression.

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:48.400
But with the help of
the right therapist

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.930
"and with the
help of finally the right
prescription medication,"

01:21:51.930 --> 01:21:54.230
somehow I knew Id
come out of it.

01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:57.460
Im someone who has
been on antidepressants

01:21:57.460 --> 01:21:59.400
for 15 years.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:03.560
"And I always question, is it--
not just is it good or bad--"

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:07.060
but am I making the right
choices for my mind and my body?

01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:09.860
"I felt very conflicted
about medication, um..."

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:12.760
because I felt that it was
some sort of a concession.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.460
That I was a failure.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:17.330
"However, it helped me a lot."

01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:21.530
"I had felt there was this
sort of endless, infinite"

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:25.530
pit of despair that I had
fallen into that had no bottom

01:22:25.530 --> 01:22:29.530
and that was very likely
going to end in suicide.

01:22:29.530 --> 01:22:33.200
And the medication
brought that up to a point

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.160
where I knew I
could land on that

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.930
and I wasnt going
to go any deeper.

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:42.100
GILBERT: Its clear
that depression can
have a profound effect

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:44.600
on the way we think and feel.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.860
But theres growing evidence

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.600
that it might do
more than that--

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:53.560
that it may affect the physical
structures of our brains.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:55.600
"Yvette Sheline,
professor of psychiatry"

01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.300
"at Washington University,"

01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.760
has been studying
this possibility

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.900
for over 15 years.

01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:03.830
"In 1993, she began a
series of experiments"

01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:07.360
to see if she could find an
abnormality in the brains

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.530
of people with depression.

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.600
"Including loss of
interest in things,"

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.160
you just didnt care about things

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.560
that used to give you pleasure?

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.100
"SHELINE: At the time that
I started to do this work,"

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:20.360
the idea that there was a
connection between depression

01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:23.730
"and the brain was, was
kind of, um, anathema."

01:23:23.730 --> 01:23:25.800
"I mean, people really
didnt believe that."

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:29.360
It took me four different
times to get my grant funded

01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.560
because people really
didnt buy that idea.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.800
"SUBJECT: No, I can
usually always asleep."

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:36.160
Mm-hmm...

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.300
"GILBERT: In her studies,"

01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:39.430
Sheline compared
a group of women

01:23:39.430 --> 01:23:40.730
who suffered from depression

01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:42.330
with a group of women who didnt.

01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:43.960
SHELINE: So what I wanted to do

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.730
was to go back and talk about
some of the different episodes

01:23:48.730 --> 01:23:51.330
of depression youve had
throughout your life.

01:23:51.330 --> 01:23:54.530
"GILBERT: After a detailed
psychological examination,"

01:23:54.530 --> 01:24:00.300
Sheline used MRI to measure the
activity in each womans brain.

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:02.960
She was especially interested
in the part of the brain

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.660
known as the hippocampus.

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:08.930
SHELINE: This is the very
outer edge of the hippocampus.

01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:12.160
"And, as we get really close to
the center of the hippocampus,"

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:15.160
this is the sort of
typical seahorse shape

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:16.900
that people talk about.

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:20.130
"GILBERT: From previous
studies, Sheline knew
that depressed people"

01:24:20.130 --> 01:24:22.000
"experience elevated
levels of stress hormones,"

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.160
"and that over time,
these hormones"

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.860
can damage the hippocampus.

01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:30.230
"SHELINE: The hippocampus
is a very delicate
part of the brain,"

01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:31.600
so it gets damaged easily.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.700
"Its kind of like the
canary in the coal mine,"

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.860
a signaler of
something being wrong.

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.100
"GILBERT: After the brain
scans were completed,"

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.930
Sheline began the
painstaking task

01:24:42.930 --> 01:24:45.500
of measuring the size of
each womans hippocampus.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.130
SHELINE: I was doing all this

01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:50.800
"data analysis myself, because
I didnt have a statistician"

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:52.830
"or, you know, anything
at that point in time."

01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:55.800
"Um, and we... and we
finally had all the data,"

01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.360
and we got the results.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.230
I was just really excited.

01:24:59.230 --> 01:25:04.830
GILBERT: A pattern emerged from
the rows and rows of numbers.

01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:07.400
The hippocampus of the
average depressed woman

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.200
was smaller than the hippocampus

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.300
of her non-depressed
counterpart.

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:17.230
A second study revealed
even more disturbing news--

01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:19.500
"the longer a woman
had been depressed,"

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.860
the smaller her
hippocampus tended to be.

01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:24.160
SHELINE: Its evidence that this

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.560
is a brain disease.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.430
Its not just a
lack of willpower.

01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:30.260
Its not that people
are just being lazy.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.300
"It really is an illness,
like any other illness."

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:38.060
GILBERT: Shelines findings
remind us that mental illnesses

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:40.630
are nothing more or less
than physical illnesses

01:25:40.630 --> 01:25:45.100
that happen to impair
psychological functioning.

01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:48.030
"SHELINE: To have a physical
basis for depression,"

01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:50.600
"I think, really is helpful."

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:55.530
"You can say, ""Look,
this illness not only
makes you feel lousy"

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:58.860
"""and have trouble with all
these aspects of your life,"

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:01.760
"""but theres a physical
basis in... in the brain,"

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.700
"""and we can... we can
show you right here,"

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:08.900
"this part of the
brain is affected."""

01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:11.660
"GILBERT: Remarkably,
Sheline also found"

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.460
that people who took
antidepressants

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:16.500
"did not show
hippocampal shrinkage,"

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:19.500
suggesting that the medication
may actually keep the brain

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.700
from being damaged
by depression.

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:23.500
SHELINE: So the good
news from examining

01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:26.200
treated versus
untreated depression

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:29.660
"is that if you have been
treated for depression,"

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:31.960
you dont get the volume
reduction in hippocampus.

01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:34.600
It means its absolutely critical

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.760
"to have early intervention,
early treatment for depression."

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.230
That the sooner you can catch it

01:26:39.230 --> 01:26:42.400
the more likely
you are to not have

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:48.830
any hippocampal volume loss.

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:51.030
GILBERT: Although
antidepressant medications

01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:53.330
"clearly can help
people with depression,"

01:26:53.330 --> 01:26:56.260
no one really understands why.

01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:59.100
Many scientists have assumed
that antidepressants work

01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.500
by changing the
chemistry of the brain--

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.830
by increasing or
decreasing the level

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:06.500
of important chemicals
known as neurotransmitters.

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:08.500
But recent discoveries suggest

01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:11.060
that antidepressants may
actually do much more than that.

01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:13.960
RONALD DUMAN: ...neurons
of the hippocampus. These
newborn neurons triple...

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.830
"GILBERT: Ronald Duman,"

01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:18.200
"professor of psychiatry
at Yale University,"

01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:24.100
suspected that antidepressants
might alter the brain itself.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:27.260
He and his team gave
antidepressants to rats

01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:29.760
and then analyzed
their brain tissue.

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.000
After months of carefully
counting the number of cells

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.860
"in each rats hippocampus,"

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.800
their analysis
revealed something

01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.130
that no one had ever expected.

01:27:39.130 --> 01:27:42.160
The antidepressant
medication didnt just change

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.530
"the brains chemistry,"

01:27:43.530 --> 01:27:47.760
it actually caused the
brain to grow new cells.

01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.530
DUMAN: So this is an example

01:27:49.530 --> 01:27:52.130
of how were able to see
new neurons in the brain.

01:27:52.130 --> 01:27:54.660
"And this is a cross
section of a rodent brain,"

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:56.330
through the hippocampus--

01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:58.960
the part of the hippocampus
where new cells are born.

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:02.100
"And you can see with the
antidepressant treatment,"

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.330
you get an increase

01:28:03.330 --> 01:28:05.830
in the number of these
new darker cells.

01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:07.400
This looks really quite amazing.

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.530
"Three weeks of treatment
with an antidepressant,"

01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:11.330
and Im seeing substantially
more cell growth

01:28:11.330 --> 01:28:13.100
in the hippocampus of the rat

01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:14.660
thats gotten the
drug than hasnt.

01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:17.630
Whatd you do the first
time you saw this picture?

01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:19.630
We were just jumping up and...

01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:22.300
"jumping off the, uh...
lab bench here, and..."

01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:24.130
Growing new neurons
of your own. Yeah.

01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:28.460
"GILBERT: Dumans
findings stunned the
scientific community,"

01:28:28.460 --> 01:28:31.630
because they suggested
that antidepressant drugs

01:28:31.630 --> 01:28:34.730
might be helping the brain
repair the cellular damage

01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:37.430
associated with depression.

01:28:37.430 --> 01:28:39.200
DUMAN: It was really

01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:43.000
"just incredibly, uh,
novel and remarkable."

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.360
"I mean, its something that
has really changed the way"

01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360
the field thinks
about depression

01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.300
and how antidepressants work.

01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:52.260
"There are actually,
uh, new cells"

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:56.130
that are being born with chronic
antidepressant treatment.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:29:00.230
GILBERT: Dumans research is
helping scientists understand

01:29:00.230 --> 01:29:03.260
how antidepressants might
help reverse the effects

01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:11.000
of clinical depression.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:15.260
But antidepressants
dont work for everyone.

01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:17.660
"Depression, like most
mental illnesses,"

01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:22.730
is a combination of
experience and biology.

01:29:22.730 --> 01:29:25.930
"Experiences such as divorce,
death of a loved one,"

01:29:25.930 --> 01:29:28.260
"even the birth of a child
can trigger depression,"

01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:31.030
but they only seem
to do so among those

01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:33.700
who are already
vulnerable to the disease.

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:36.730
"Thats why two people can
have identical experiences,"

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:39.630
"or identical genes, and
yet only one of them"

01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:41.000
will become depressed.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.460
"MEGHAN: Were taking
pictures, Mom?"

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:45.560
TRICIA DAVIES: Yes.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.630
(phone ringing)

01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:51.700
(indistinct conversations)

01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:53.800
I have so many things.

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:54.900
(laughing)

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.660
"""Im so talented!"""

01:29:57.660 --> 01:29:58.960
"I dont know, Meghan."

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.730
That sort of looks
good. Sort of looks...?

01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:02.730
GILBERT: Its graduation day--

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:06.130
just ten weeks before Caitlin
is supposed to go to college.

01:30:06.130 --> 01:30:08.530
"Although she rallies
when she has to,"

01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:11.030
her family is
increasingly worried

01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:13.330
that the antidepressants
are not helping.

01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:15.930
Okay. Theyll tell us how
to wear it when we go...

01:30:15.930 --> 01:30:17.230
All right. All right.

01:30:17.230 --> 01:30:18.760
Aah... Yay.

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.800
Youre almost there.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:22.300
"All right, give
us a ""cheese."""

01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:24.160
Cheese.

01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:27.430
"GILBERT: When Bob and
Tricia married, they knew
they wanted a family."

01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:29.960
"Their son Evan was born first,"

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.460
and two years later
they had twins.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:34.660
There we go. Is that the side
youre supposed to have it on?

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:37.300
We dont know. This is how...

01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:39.260
Its me.

01:30:39.260 --> 01:30:43.000
"TRICIA: Meghan and
Caitlin may have come out
of the womb together,"

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:50.530
but theyve been
different ever since.

01:30:50.530 --> 01:30:53.930
"From the beginning they
were always holding hands,"

01:30:53.930 --> 01:30:57.830
constantly playing
with each other.

01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:02.960
They always had a special
bond from the beginning.

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:07.230
(both singing)

01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:10.760
TRICIA: Caitlin always seemed
to be a little dominant

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.530
"in terms of kind of
arranging their social life,"

01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:17.030
"and doing things, and,
um, being in charge."

01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:19.430
Hell come down...

01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:21.760
"Starting at the end
of eighth grade, um..."

01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:24.860
I started to notice
that they kind of did

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.600
almost a complete reversal.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.530
Meghan was always
filling the silence

01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:34.330
"and becoming the social,
outgoing, talkative one."

01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:37.100
"And I noticed that
Caitlin-- I dont know,"

01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:40.860
she just didnt seem to
be always chattering

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:44.530
"and always happy,
like she used to."

01:31:44.530 --> 01:31:47.130
"I used to call her
my little sunshine,"

01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:48.930
and it occurred to me

01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:53.500
"that, um, there were
not a whole lot of
sunny days anymore."

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.160
So I really started to worry

01:31:56.160 --> 01:32:09.100
that her life was not the way
she really wanted it to be.

01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:13.360
"At this point, I was thinking
that Caitlin needed help."

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.930
I finally went online

01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:17.700
"and the Depression Centers
questionnaire came up,"

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:21.900
"and that was very
scary because when I was
able to answer ""yes"""

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.100
"to pretty much every question,"

01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:28.200
"it occurred to me that, um...
that she must be depressed."

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:30.000
"Hey, theres Sheila."

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.160
"Hey, Sheila."

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:32.730
"Hey, guys. How are you?"

01:32:32.730 --> 01:32:35.130
"Good. Howdy, stranger.
How are you? Good."

01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:37.760
First time youve seen
Caitlin in a long time.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:40.800
"SHEILA MARCUS: When Caitlin
initially came in, I felt"

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.060
quite confident that we would
be able to turn her around

01:32:44.060 --> 01:32:48.630
very quickly with our
traditional first approaches.

01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:52.760
"So, typically we would begin
with one class of medicines."

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:55.360
"And that, I felt, would
certainly turn her around"

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.200
"within the first three months,"

01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.200
and thats fully what I expected.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:04.460
"However, for Caitlin, that
turned out not to be the case."

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:08.830
"So, we found ourselves going
through one, and then two,"

01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:11.360
"and then three, and then four,"

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:30.230
and then five different classes
of medication treatments.

01:33:30.230 --> 01:33:33.930
"GILBERT: As summer
begins, Caitlin is
running out of options."

01:33:33.930 --> 01:33:36.660
"Shes tried different kinds of
medications and therapies,"

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:41.960
but she isnt getting better.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:49.900
CAITLIN; I would love
to not be having the
worst summer of my life.

01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:51.730
I cant get out of bed.

01:33:51.730 --> 01:33:54.660
"If I can get out of bed, maybe
I can make it downstairs."

01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:59.430
But its not like I want to
watch TV all day or sit inside.

01:33:59.430 --> 01:34:01.100
"Its, like, you
want to go outside,"

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:03.000
"you want to be
with your friends,"

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.330
"you want to be running
around, and you cant."

01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:10.460
"Doesnt matter how much
you want to, you cant,"

01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:14.860
and it just sucks.

01:34:14.860 --> 01:34:25.760
It just really does.

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:29.460
"MEGHAN: Okay, so its
Thursday, and this is Meghan."

01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.830
Caitlin doesnt mind that Im
off doing things on my own.

01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:35.930
"She actually, like, encourages
it, she thinks its fine."

01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:39.730
"(voice breaking):
But, I mean..."

01:34:39.730 --> 01:34:46.600
"its just-just really
hard, because..."

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.860
I always have that
sense of guilt.

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:53.800
But if Im going out
there and Im having fun

01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.300
"and Im enjoying life,"

01:34:55.300 --> 01:35:00.360
but shes not being able to
do the same things that I am

01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.500
and not finding joy in life

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:05.460
"and not having fun in
everyday situations,"

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:11.360
how can I not feel
guilty about that?

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:15.930
"I think she knows that the
rest of us are struggling,"

01:35:15.930 --> 01:35:19.400
but I just dont think
she knows how much

01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:26.060
and how deeply this is
affecting the rest of us.

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:34.060
"Once again, this is
Meghan, and Im out."

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:37.260
"GILBERT: Because therapy
and medication have
failed to help Caitlin,"

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:39.760
"one last option
remains open to her,"

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.900
one that might
surprise many people.

01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:46.530
"Most of us know it as
electric shock treatment,"

01:35:46.530 --> 01:35:47.960
but its actually called

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.600
"electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT."

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.060
"For 70 years, ECTs been
used to treat severe cases"

01:35:54.060 --> 01:35:55.560
of depression that
havent responded

01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.260
to psychotherapy or medication.

01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:00.760
"As movies like One Flew Over
the Cuckoos Nest remind us,"

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:04.560
ECT was once a primitive
and painful procedure.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.700
But technological advances have
made it far less traumatic

01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:09.260
and virtually pain-free.

01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:13.400
ECT is a highly effective
treatment for depression.

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.300
But no one really
understands why.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:17.630
Do we know if ECT
is more effective

01:36:17.630 --> 01:36:20.560
than the antidepressants in
causing the neurogenesis?

01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:23.930
Ronald Dumans studies
might offer a clue.

01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:29.430
"Working with rats, hes found
that ECT is even more effective"

01:36:29.430 --> 01:36:33.300
than antidepressants in
stimulating cell growth.

01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:35.100
Tell me what Im looking at.

01:36:35.100 --> 01:36:36.160
"Theyre beautiful,"

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.100
but theyre more
significant than that.

01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:41.300
DUMAN: Here were showing that
the cells that give rise

01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:43.200
to new neurons are actually

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.100
increased in number by
electroconvulsive therapy.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.330
This is really quite amazing.

01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:49.300
Theres just a lot more
of these blue cells

01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:52.200
on this side than on that side.

01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:55.900
The example that were
showing here is the effect

01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:59.230
of chronic electroconvulsive
therapy; that ECT leads

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:02.300
"to a very dramatic increase
in numbers of new neurons,"

01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:05.900
"much greater than what we see
with antidepressant treatment,"

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.600
with a chemical
antidepressant treatment.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:12.300
GILBERT: Although
experiments with rats cant
necessarily be generalized

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:17.060
"to human beings, these results
do offer an intriguing insight"

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:24.230
"into how ECT might
work, and why."

01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:27.160
"In the early morning
hours of July 7,"

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:29.260
Tricia drives Caitlin
to the hospital

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:32.430
for her first round
of treatment with ECT.

01:37:32.430 --> 01:37:33.430
You all right?

01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:38.400
Should have brought your pillow.

01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:41.560
TRICIA: Caitlin herself was
the one who made the decision

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.730
that the life that
she was leading was

01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:47.760
not how she wanted to be.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:53.960
"So, I... I was taking
a cue from Caitlin."

01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:56.730
"I remember her
screaming at one point,"

01:37:56.730 --> 01:37:59.300
"""You dont understand how
horrible it is to be caught"

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:03.430
"""in this brain of mine,
this brain that doesnt work,"

01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:07.000
"""and youll never know
how awful this is,"

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.400
"and I want you to fix this!"""

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:17.000
She would strike out at
me at unexpected times.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.230
Nothing I could do was
good enough for her.

01:38:21.230 --> 01:38:23.830
"But I knew in my
heart that, I mean,"

01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:26.100
"shes such a sweet,
thoughtful kid,"

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:29.230
and she had told me how much
she loved me at one point

01:38:29.230 --> 01:38:32.630
in her life-- and points during
this whole process-- that I knew

01:38:32.630 --> 01:38:34.860
that she really didnt mean it.

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:36.030
NURSE: Welcome.

01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:37.100
"TRICIA AND CAITLIN: Hi, Brad."

01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:38.100
BRAD: How are you?

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:39.400
TRICIA: Good to see you again.

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:40.960
BRAD: Nice to see you.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:48.030
"TRICIA: Um, I was the one
who said to the doctor,
""What about ECT?"""

01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:51.300
I just kept researching

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:54.300
what kind of things
help with depression.

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:57.500
So Ive kind of put it out there.

01:38:57.500 --> 01:39:00.330
"So, hows your mood now?"

01:39:00.330 --> 01:39:02.330
I take it your moods been down?

01:39:02.330 --> 01:39:03.660
"Yeah, its been down."

01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.230
Do you have any periods
in which you feel good?

01:39:06.230 --> 01:39:08.500
In which your mood feels good?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.200
"Not really, I would say. No."

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:14.900
TRICIA: We definitely had a lot

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:16.530
"of reservations,
because we knew"

01:39:16.530 --> 01:39:18.860
"that it was a serious
process and procedure,"

01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:22.230
but Caitlin was
severely depressed.

01:39:22.230 --> 01:39:25.100
Any thoughts of suicide?

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:26.200
Uh-uh.

01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.960
"Not even to the
point where, uh..."

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.760
you wish you were dead?

01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:31.960
CAITLIN: Sometimes. Okay.

01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.130
I just felt like nothing
was going to stop us

01:39:34.130 --> 01:39:35.860
from getting to
the solution here.

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:38.630
"Uh, do you understand
this is treatment"

01:39:38.630 --> 01:39:40.630
for depression beyond the meds?

01:39:40.630 --> 01:39:42.760
CAITLIN: Yeah.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.300
You got some hope
that thisll work?

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:47.530
Yeah.

01:39:47.530 --> 01:39:50.430
"Dads going to say
good-bye, okay?"

01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:51.700
Im going to be around.

01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:53.600
(Bob murmuring)

01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:57.530
"CAITLIN: ""Functioning"" is..."

01:39:57.530 --> 01:40:01.260
its like a four-letter
word to me.

01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:03.430
"I mean, its good,
youre functioning,"

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:07.000
but thats no way to live.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:12.530
And its no way to
continue going on.

01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:15.730
Its the worst thing
in the world for me.

01:40:15.730 --> 01:40:18.800
"WOMAN: Bob. Good
morning. How you doing
here, Caitlin? You okay?"

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.030
TECH: Your anesthesia team
here taking care of you today.

01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:24.530
Were going to hook you
up to some monitors here.

01:40:24.530 --> 01:40:26.300
Can we do a time-out?

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:27.460
Yeah. Okay.

01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:29.960
"Can you tell us what
your name is, Caitlin?"

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:31.000
Caitlin Davies.

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.460
What are you having done today?

01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:33.730
Im having ECT.

01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:35.700
Okay. Everybody concur?

01:40:35.700 --> 01:40:36.730
We concur.

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.630
"Okay, all right."

01:40:38.630 --> 01:40:41.460
Turn your head
towards me. Great.

01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:43.330
MARCUS: ECT is perhaps one

01:40:43.330 --> 01:40:47.000
of the most misunderstood
treatments for depression.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.560
I think many people view
ECT with an eye toward

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.900
"One Flew Over
the Cuckoos Nest,"

01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:56.200
a sort of archaic
medieval treatment

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.160
that they cant fathom
anyone receiving.

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:02.760
"In point of fact, ECT
is one of the treatments"

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:06.660
that turns around difficult
depression more quickly

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.130
"than many other treatments,"

01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:10.800
"and for moderate-to-severe
depression,"

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:13.000
"frankly, is a
treatment of choice,"

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.300
particularly if an
individual has failed

01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:17.900
the traditional
psychotherapeutics

01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:19.360
and pharmacological treatments.

01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.430
You okay with that?

01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:22.330
Yeah. Okay.

01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:24.830
"MARCUS: Most of the time,
anesthesia is present"

01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:27.460
so the individual does
not have any memory

01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:29.100
of the procedure itself.

01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:32.300
"They will remember some of
the preoperative procedures,"

01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:36.160
"and often will remember waking
up in the recovery room,"

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:39.130
but otherwise they have no
memory of the event itself.

01:41:39.130 --> 01:41:48.460
"MAN: Okay, I think were
ready, guys. Lets go ahead."

01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:50.060
"DOCTOR: Okay, go
ahead, please."

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:52.260
Go ahead.

01:41:52.260 --> 01:41:56.830
(device beeping)

01:41:56.830 --> 01:42:11.600
(steady tone)

01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:16.260
"So, shes still
seizing right here."

01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:29.200
(device beeping)

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.600
(device beeps)

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.100
Are you okay if we take these?

01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:33.830
"Yes, thats great. Okay."

01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:35.330
"DOCTOR: So, she got
the Zofran, too?"

01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:37.700
She did get the Zofran 4.

01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:41.960
(device beeps)

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:46.760
"Shes slowly waking up,
probably with the extra..."

01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:59.360
"All right, Caitlin, were going
to take you to recovery now."

01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:01.860
MARCUS: The problem with
letting depression linger

01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:05.630
is we know that there are
subtle changes in the brain

01:43:05.630 --> 01:43:09.630
such that its an illness
that becomes harder to treat

01:43:09.630 --> 01:43:13.100
"as you... as you let it take
its course, so to speak."

01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:16.200
"The other major problem
with depression,"

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.830
"especially in young people,
is that you lose years"

01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:21.300
of that individuals life.

01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:25.600
Human beings change a great
deal during adolescence.

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:28.330
"So while somebody is
struggling with depression,"

01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:31.560
"theyre unable to make
the social gains,"

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:33.660
"the intimacy gains,
the academic gains"

01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:36.930
that are so necessary when
somebody is developing

01:43:36.930 --> 01:43:39.800
from an adolescent
to a young adult.

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:43.600
"So, it essentially robs people
of years of their lives"

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.630
during a period that
theyre struggling

01:43:45.630 --> 01:43:47.700
with these internal symptoms.

01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:52.160
"TRICIA: Caitlin,
can you hear me?"

01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.160
Im done?

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.000
Youre done. Its all over.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:56.060
It went really well.

01:43:56.060 --> 01:43:57.200
(mutters)

01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.530
"Yeah, its all over.
Yeah, were good."

01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:01.830
You want to just
get a little sip?

01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:03.430
Its going to be a little hard

01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:05.330
for me to do that.

01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:06.830
Take a sip.

01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:15.730
You dont have to sit
up all the way. Okay.

01:44:15.730 --> 01:44:17.130
Its ginger ale.

01:44:17.130 --> 01:44:18.860
Does that hurt?

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:23.400
You want water?

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:25.000
GILBERT: The
doctors told Caitlin

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.060
that the average course
of ECT is nine sessions.

01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:32.830
But the number of treatments
Caitlin will have

01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:39.160
depends on how she responds.

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:43.200
"Hi, its Caitlin."

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:47.230
"Um, I think
treatments going okay."

01:44:47.230 --> 01:44:51.530
"Um, I wish I could see a
little more improvement."

01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:55.830
"I... you know, I saw a
little bit, like, last week."

01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:59.530
"I saw a little bit of an
improvement, where, you know,"

01:44:59.530 --> 01:45:02.660
"for the first time, I mean, I
was like... I was really happy."

01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:04.460
I was just happy.

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:07.730
"Didnt have, like,
anything going on."

01:45:07.730 --> 01:45:10.230
I was just happy.

01:45:10.230 --> 01:45:12.060
(sniffles)

01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:17.200
And I wish that would
have stayed longer.

01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:22.700
Not where I am right now.

01:45:22.700 --> 01:45:25.260
"GILBERT: Several weeks later,"

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:28.960
Caitlins family is starting
to realize that ECT is not

01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:32.300
going to be the miracle cure
for which they all were hoping.

01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:35.430
TRICIA: Caitlin came
home from treatment--

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:38.460
this wouldve been the
seventh treatment--

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:43.260
"and it was, at that moment, the
worst treatment day wed had."

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:46.130
"We had been told that maybe
after about six treatments,"

01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:47.900
she would start to feel better.

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:50.630
And so she had it in her head
that she would feel better.

01:45:50.630 --> 01:45:56.030
"So she came home, and she
was angry and she was..."

01:45:56.030 --> 01:45:57.730
felt horrible.

01:45:57.730 --> 01:45:59.960
And I finally lost it with her.

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:02.600
And I made this little comment

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:06.100
that she needed to
try harder to move on.

01:46:06.100 --> 01:46:09.830
And she absolutely
lost it with me.

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:12.600
She started screaming
that I didnt know how hard

01:46:12.600 --> 01:46:15.760
she had been trying
and how awful this was

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.830
and that she didnt want
me to be anywhere near her

01:46:18.830 --> 01:46:21.930
"and screamed at me to
leave the room, so I did."

01:46:21.930 --> 01:46:25.330
"And I think what happened was
that she had felt better,"

01:46:25.330 --> 01:46:28.260
and she was so upset about not
feeling better all the time.

01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:30.600
And this is one of the
things I think is such--

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.330
"I-I dont want to
blame the doctors,"

01:46:32.330 --> 01:46:35.430
but no one ever
prepared us for this--

01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:44.700
ups and downs quite so
much at the right times.

01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:46.100
"GILBERT: Despite the
disappointments,"

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:48.230
the doctors suggest
moving forward

01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:49.630
with additional treatments...

01:46:49.630 --> 01:47:01.930
as many as three times a week.

01:47:01.930 --> 01:47:06.130
"By mid-August, something
seems to be changing."

01:47:06.130 --> 01:47:07.430
"MEGHAN: Hello, its Meghan."

01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:08.860
CAITLIN: And Caitlin.

01:47:08.860 --> 01:47:11.560
"MEGHAN: Its been a while since
our last, uh, video entry."

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:16.260
"For the first time,
I actually, um..."

01:47:16.260 --> 01:47:19.560
I remember just for the
first time being happy

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:25.160
"for longer than, you know..."

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:26.230
(sniffles)

01:47:26.230 --> 01:47:30.000
"I just remember being
happy for longer than,"

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.030
"you know, like, five seconds."

01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:35.360
"And it was just the
most wonderful thing,"

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:39.060
because I hadnt
felt happy like that

01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:41.830
"for an extended
period of time,"

01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:44.730
in as long as I could remember.

01:47:44.730 --> 01:47:49.530
"And it was just the most
amazing thing for me,"

01:47:49.530 --> 01:47:52.330
because I did feel happy.

01:47:52.330 --> 01:47:56.660
And it did last longer
than for a second.

01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:59.430
"And it was just
really, really nice."

01:47:59.430 --> 01:48:04.030
"And, I mean, its still
really hard for me"

01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:06.060
to get moving.

01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:10.400
"But that was just
really great, because"

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:15.200
I... go off to school
in less than a month.

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:18.160
"So its looking good,
and I guess well do"

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:20.030
another entry later in the week.

01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:22.030
And well fill you in
more. Probably tomorrow.

01:48:22.030 --> 01:48:24.500
"So once again, this
is Meghan. Caitlin."

01:48:24.500 --> 01:48:28.930
"MEGHAN: Um, and well catch
you guys up later this week."

01:48:28.930 --> 01:48:31.100
Bye.

01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.800
Happy?

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:34.030
Sit up straight.

01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:35.030
I am.

01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:36.030
(laughs)

01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:37.430
I hate when you do that.

01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:47.700
"I know. Well, look at me."

01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:50.400
"GILBERT: Shortly after
her 16th treatment,"

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:53.630
Caitlin tells her family she
feels ready to try college.

01:48:53.630 --> 01:48:56.530
Why should I let you
go to school tomorrow?

01:48:56.530 --> 01:48:58.100
Because you... Im
scared to death.

01:48:58.100 --> 01:48:59.330
(both laugh)

01:48:59.330 --> 01:49:02.900
You have to let me try.

01:49:02.900 --> 01:49:06.030
But how can I let you go?

01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:10.700
Cause Im doing so much better.

01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:12.200
Why do you want to leave?

01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.260
(both laugh)

01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:15.760
Im worried to death.

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.760
I know. Tell me why
I shouldnt worry.

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.900
Because Ill do fine.

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:21.130
Why?

01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:24.360
Because Im responsible.

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.330
"And Im a strong person, and..."

01:49:27.330 --> 01:49:29.260
TRICIA: Okay. And you
feeling up to this?

01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:32.000
"CAITLIN: Im feeling--
yes, Im feeling up to it."

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.160
TRICIA: Okay.

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.230
All right. (laughs)

01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:36.730
Just wanted to know.

01:49:36.730 --> 01:49:38.500
(laughs)

01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:39.500
All right.

01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:40.630
Youre scared?

01:49:40.630 --> 01:49:41.760
"Yes, Im scared."

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.000
Are you scared?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.100
A little bit.

01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:45.130
Just a little?

01:49:45.130 --> 01:49:46.600
Ill be fine. Youll be fine.

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:47.600
Okay.

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.730
(both laugh)

01:49:49.730 --> 01:49:51.530
Ill be fine.

01:49:51.530 --> 01:49:53.460
"All right, thats all
I needed to hear."

01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:55.130
That youll be fine.

01:49:55.130 --> 01:49:57.330
All right?

01:49:57.330 --> 01:49:59.600
"All right, good girl."

01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:00.630
Oops.

01:50:00.630 --> 01:50:10.830
Meghan!

01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:12.460
TRICIA: Were headed to school.

01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:16.130
"Im ready for this little
birdie to fly the nest,"

01:50:16.130 --> 01:50:17.560
broken wing and all.

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.430
Its just going to be
such a huge leap for her.

01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:23.100
"Thats the biggest,
scariest part."

01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:26.830
But Caitlin is in great shape.

01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:30.400
She has really come
through this experience

01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:31.900
so much better.

01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:34.500
"The doctor said that her
assessment was wonderful,"

01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:38.860
that shes way out of any
kind of depression level.

01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:41.530
"Um, so its very exciting."

01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:43.560
"All right, now really
hug each other."

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.300
What does that mean? What...

01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.630
TRICIA: I dont want anybody to
think that going through ECT

01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:52.860
is going to be an easy solution.

01:50:52.860 --> 01:50:55.600
There was just so much
pain and-and struggle

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.060
that went through that.

01:50:57.060 --> 01:50:59.960
Its not like taking a
drug and going to bed.

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.530
"It was just, it
was just awful."

01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:03.700
"Bye, Caitlin."

01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:04.730
Love you. Have fun.

01:51:04.730 --> 01:51:05.760
"You, too."

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:07.600
TRICIA: So I think
she just really

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:10.100
"showed her inner strength
throughout this process,"

01:51:10.100 --> 01:51:15.730
cause it was very difficult.

01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:17.730
"Im really in a good spot, too."

01:51:17.730 --> 01:51:28.500
Im really happy for her.

01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:32.230
GILBERT: Everyone
wants to feel happy.

01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:34.830
Happy all the time.

01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:37.060
But nature has a
different plan for us.

01:51:37.060 --> 01:51:39.760
"Our brains were
designed for survival,"

01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:41.160
and the negative
emotions they create

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.960
are vital to that mission.

01:51:42.960 --> 01:51:46.530
We need to feel afraid...

01:51:46.530 --> 01:51:48.630
sad...

01:51:48.630 --> 01:51:51.460
"angry, sometimes."

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:53.160
But we need to
feel those emotions

01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.830
in just the right amount.

01:51:54.830 --> 01:52:00.100
"Too little is bad,
and too much is worse."

01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.660
Science reminds us
that were of two minds:

01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:06.430
a rational brain
thats relatively new

01:52:06.430 --> 01:52:09.130
and an emotional brain
thats relatively old.

01:52:09.130 --> 01:52:11.030
Sometimes emotion
overwhelms reason.

01:52:11.030 --> 01:52:13.300
Sometimes reason
outwits emotion.

01:52:13.300 --> 01:52:15.630
But its the endless
struggle between these two

01:52:15.630 --> 01:52:17.530
"that makes life
such a wonderful,"

01:52:17.530 --> 01:52:17.530
scary and mysterious ride.
