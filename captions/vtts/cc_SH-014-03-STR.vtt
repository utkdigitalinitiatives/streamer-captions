00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800


2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.600


3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.670
that Antonio hath a shipof rich lading

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.070
wrecked in the narrowseas,

5
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.530
the Goodwins I think theycall the place,

6
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.500
a very dangerous flat, andfatal,

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.130
where the carcasses ofmany a tall ship

8
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.400
lie buried as they say

9
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.470
if my gossip report be anhonest woman of her word.

10
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.330
I would she were as lyinga gossip in that

11
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.330
as ever knapped ginger ormade her neighbors believe

12
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.070
she wept for the death ofa third husband.

13
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.730
But it is true, withoutany slips of prolixity

14
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.270
or crossing the plainhighway of talk,

15
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.930
that the good Antonio, thehonest Antonio--

16
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.230
oh, that I had a title

17
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.870
good enough to keep hisname company.

18
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.170
Come, the full stop.

19
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.600
Hey, what sayest thou?

20
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.500
Why the end is, he hathlost a ship.

21
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.500
I would it might prove anend to his losses.

22
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.600
Let me say amen betimes,

23
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.530
lest the devil cross myprayer,

24
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.270
for here he comes in thelikeness of a Jew.

25
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.400
How now, Shylock?

26
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.930
What news among themerchants?

27
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.230
You knew.

28
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.030
None so well, none so wellas you

29
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.200
of my daughter's flight.

30
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.530
That's certain.

31
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.970
I, for my part, knew thetailor made the wings sheflew withal.

32
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.230
And Shylock, for his own part,knew the bird was fledged

33
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.970
and that it is thecomplexion of them all

34
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.400
to leave the dam.

35
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.730
She is damned for it.

36
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.630
That's certain, if thedevil may be a judge.

37
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.700
My own flesh and blood torebel!

38
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.200
Out upon it, old carrion.

39
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.800
Rebels it at these years?

40
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.970
I say my daughter is myflesh and my blood.

41
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.400
There is more differencebetween thy flesh and hers

42
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670
than between jet andivory,

43
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.100
more between your bloods

44
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.730
than there is between redwine and Rhenish.

45
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.270
But tell us, do you hearwhether Antonio

46
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.770
have any loss at sea orno?

47
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.130
There I have another badmatch.

48
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.800
A bankrupt, a prodigal

49
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.670
who dare scarce show hishead on the Rialto.

50
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.900
A beggar that was used tocome so smug upon the mart.

51
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.730
Let him look to his bond.

52
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.970
He was wont to call meusurer.

53
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.670
Let him look to his bond.

54
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.230
He was wont to lend outmoney for a Christiancourtesy.

55
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.870
Let him look to his bond.

56
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.300
Why, I am sure if heforfeit thou wilt not takehis flesh.

57
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.030
What's that good for?

58
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.170
To bait fish withal.

59
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.670
If it will feed nothingelse, it will feed myrevenge.

60
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.930
He hath disgraced me andhindered me half amillion,

61
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.930
laughed at my losses,mocked at my gains,

62
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.370
scorned my nation,thwarted my bargains,

63
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.000
cooled my friends, heatedmine enemies,

64
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.600
and what's his reason?

65
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.430
I am a Jew.

66
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.470
Ah!

67
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.900
Hath not a Jew eyes?

68
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.900
Hath not a Jew hands,organs, dimensions,

69
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.030
senses, affections,passions,

70
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.700
fed with the same food,hurt with the same weapons,

71
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.430
subject to the samediseases, healed by thesame means,

72
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.000
warmed and cooled by thesame winter and summer

73
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.370
as a Christian is?

74
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.570
If you prick us, do we notbleed?

75
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.830
If you tickle us, do wenot laugh?

76
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.170
If you poison us, do wenot die?

77
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.800
And if you wrong us, shallwe not revenge?

78
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.730
If we are like you in therest, we will resemble youin that.

79
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.270
If a Jew wrong a Christian,what is his humility?

80
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.000
Revenge.

81
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.930
If a Christian wrong aJew,

82
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.000
what should his sufferancebe by Christian example?

83
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.170
Why, revenge.

84
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.030
The villainy you teach meI will execute,

85
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.700
and it shall go hard,

86
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.870
but I will better theinstruction.

87
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.730
Gentlemen.

88
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.130
My master Antonio is athis house

89
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.670
and has asked to speakwith you both.

90
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.200
We have been up and downto seek him.

91
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.430
Here comes another of thetribe.

92
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.400
A third cannot be matchedunless the devil himselfturn Jew.

93
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.230
How now, Tubal, what newsfrom Genoa?

94
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.730
Hast thou found mydaughter?

95
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.330
I often came where I didhear of her, but cannotfind her.

96
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.670
Why there, there, there,there!

97
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.170
A diamond gone cost me2,000 ducats in Frankfurt.

98
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.130
The curse never fell uponour nation till now.

99
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.570
I never felt it till now!

100
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.130
2,000 ducats in that

101
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.170
and other precious,precious jewels.

102
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.930
I would my daughter weredead at my foot,

103
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.200
and the jewels in her ear.

104
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.370
Would she were hearsed atmy foot and the ducats inher coffin.

105
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.530
No news of them, huh?

106
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.800
Why so?

107
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.170
And I know not what'sspent on the search.

108
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.530
Why thou--

109
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.670
Shh!

110
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.800
Loss upon loss!

111
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.930
The thief gone with somuch, and so much to findthe thief.

112
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.270
And no satisfaction, norevenge,

113
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.130
nor no ill luck stirring

114
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.070
but what lights o'er myshoulders,

115
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.870
no sighs but o'er mybreathing,

116
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.400
no tears but o'er myshedding.

117
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.670
Yes, other men have illluck too.

118
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.100
Antonio, as I heard inGenoa--

119
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.300
What, what? what?

120
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.000
Ill luck, ill luck?

121
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.830
Hath an Argosy cast awaycoming from Tripolis.

122
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.600
I thank God! I thank God!

123
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.900
Is it true? Is it true?

124
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.600
I spoke with some of thesailors that escaped the wreck.

125
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.470
I thank thee, good Tubal.

126
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.900
Good news, good news.

127
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.130
Ha!

128
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.730
Heard in Genoa?

129
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.670
your daughter spent inGenoa, as I heard,

130
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.470
one night, fourscoreducats.

131
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.030
Thou stick'st a dagger inme.

132
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.230
I shall never see my goldagain.

133
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.430
Fourscore ducats at asitting?

134
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.730
Fourscore ducats!

135
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.170
There came divers ofAntonio's creditors

136
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.530
in my company to Venice

137
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.430
that swear he cannotchoose but break.

138
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.800
I am very glad of it.

139
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.230
I'll plague him.

140
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.800
I'll torture him.

141
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.070
I am glad of it.

142
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.330
One of them showed me aring

143
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.770
he had of your daughterfor a monkey.

144
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.200
Out upon her.

145
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.800
Thou torturest me, Tubal.

146
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.330
It was my turquoise.

147
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.200
I had it of Leah when Iwas a bachelor.

148
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.230
I would not have given itfor a wilderness of monkeys.

149
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.800
But Antonio is certainlyundone.

150
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.630
Nay, that's true.

151
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.130
That's very true.

152
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.570
Go, Tubal, fee me anofficer.

153
00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.030
Bespeak him a fortnightbefore.

154
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.030
I will have the heart ofhim if he forfeit,

155
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:01.130
for were he out of Venice,

156
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.200
I can make whatmerchandise I will.

157
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.270
Go, Tubal, and meet me atour synagogue.

158
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.200
Go, good Tubal.

159
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.530
At our synagogue, Tubal.

160
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.930
I pray you, tarry,

161
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.500
pause a day or two beforeyou hazard,

162
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.900
for in choosing wrong, Ilose your company.

163
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.200
Therefore, forbear awhile.

164
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.830
There's something tellsme-- but it is not love--

165
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.900
I would not lose you.

166
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.170
And you know yourself hatecounsels not in such a quality.

167
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.870
But lest you should notunderstand me well--

168
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.500
and yet a maiden hath notongue but thought--

169
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.370
I would detain you heresome month or two

170
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.830
before you venture for me.

171
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.930
I could teach you how tochoose right,

172
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:34.730
but then I am forsworn.

173
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:39.000
So will I never be.

174
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.330
So may you miss me.

175
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.000
but if you do, you'll makeme wish a sin

176
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.830
that I had been forsworn.

177
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.470
Beshrew your eyes.

178
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:54.100
They have o'erlooked meand divided me.

179
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:59.930
One half of me is yours,the other half, yours.

180
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.200
Mine own, I would say, butif mine, then yours,

181
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.230
and so all yours.

182
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.600
Oh, these naughty timesput bars

183
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.330
between the owners andtheir rights.

184
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.170
And so, though yours,

185
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.330
not yours.

186
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.570
Prove it so,

187
00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.670
let fortune go to hell forit, not I.

188
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:25.870
I speak too long, but 'tisto piece the time,

189
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:27.870
to eke it and to draw itout in length

190
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.700
to stay you from election.

191
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.370
Let me choose, for as Iam, I live upon the rack.

192
00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.300
Upon the rack, Bassanio?

193
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.400
Then confess.

194
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.330
What treason is theremingled with your love?

195
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:41.370
None but that ugly treasonof mistrust

196
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.870
which makes me fear theenjoying of my love.

197
00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.070
There may as well be amityin life

198
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.970
'tween snow and fire astreason and my love.

199
00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.600
Ay, but I fear you speakupon the rack

200
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.530
where men enforced dospeak anything.

201
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.400
Promise me life, and I'llconfess the truth.

202
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.500
Well, then, confess andlive.

203
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.930
Confess and love had beenthe very sum of myconfession.

204
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.800
Oh, happy torment

205
00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.100
when my torturer dothteach me answers fordeliverance.

206
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.570
But let me to my fortuneand the caskets.

207
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.900
Away then.

208
00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.600
I am locked in one ofthem.

209
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.270
If you do love me, youwill find me out.

210
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:33.300
Nerissa and the rest,stand all aloof.

211
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.800
Let music sound while hedoth make his choice,

212
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.570
then if he lose,

213
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.500
he makes a swan-like endfading in music.

214
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.630
That the comparison maystand more proper,

215
00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.200
my eye shall be the streamand watery deathbed forhim.

216
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.800
He may win, and what ismusic then?

217
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.870
Why then music is even asthe flourish

218
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:01.170
when new subjects bow to anew-crowned monarch.

219
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.300
Such it is as are thosedulcet sounds at break ofday

220
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.770
that creep into thedreaming bridegroom's ear

221
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.800
and summon him tomarriage.

222
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.670
Now he goes, with no lesspresence,

223
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.630
but with much more lovethan young Alcaides

224
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.270
when he did redeem thevirgin tribute

225
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:23.070
paid by howling Troy tothe sea monster.

226
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.970
I stand for sacrifice.

227
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.830
The rest aloof are theDardanian wives

228
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.670
with bleared visages

229
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.000
come forth to view theissue of the exploit.

230
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.300
Go, Hercules.

231
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.570
Live thou; I live.

232
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:44.800
With much, much moredismay, I view the fight

233
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.270
than thou that makes thefray.

234
00:11:49.370 --> 00:12:03.430
Tell me where is fancybred?

235
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:11.200
Or in the heart or in thehead?

236
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:21.930
How begot, how nourished?

237
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:29.200
Reply, reply.

238
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:39.130
It is engendered in theeyes

239
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.370
with gazing fed,

240
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:50.770
and fancy dies

241
00:12:50.770 --> 00:13:05.230
in the cradle where itlies.

242
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:17.430
Let us all ring fancy'sknell.

243
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:23.170
I'll begin it.

244
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.030
Ding, dong, bell.

245
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.530
Ding, dong, bell.

246
00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:36.800
Ding, dong, bell.

247
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.970
Ding, dong, bell.

248
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.930
So may the outward showsbe least themselves.

249
00:13:54.930 --> 00:14:00.900
The world is stilldeceived with ornament.

250
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.430
In law, what plea sotainted and corrupt

251
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:08.330
but being seasoned with agracious voice

252
00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.870
obscures the show of evil?

253
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.630
In religion, what damnederror

254
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.200
but some sober brow willbless it,

255
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.670
and approve it with atext,

256
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.270
hiding the grossness withfair ornament?

257
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:23.470
There is no vice so simple

258
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:26.000
but assumes some mark ofvirtue

259
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.930
on his outward parts.

260
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.030
How many cowards,

261
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.400
whose hearts are all asfalse as stairs of sand,

262
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.430
wear yet upon their chins

263
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.200
the beards of Hercules andfrowning Mars,

264
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.300
who inward searched, havelivers white as milk.

265
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:45.900
And these assume butvalor's excrement

266
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.070
to render them redoubted.

267
00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:53.170
Look on beauty, and youshall see 'tis purchasedby the weight

268
00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.400
which therein works amiracle in nature,

269
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.530
making them lightest thatwear most of it.

270
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.930
So are those crisped snakygolden locks

271
00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.430
which make such wantongambols with the wind

272
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.900
upon supposed fairness,

273
00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.070
often known to be thedowry of a second head,

274
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.430
the skull that bred themin the sepulchre.

275
00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:20.230
Thus ornament is but aguiled shore

276
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.900
to a most dangerous sea,

277
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.730
the beauteous scarfveiling an Indian beauty.

278
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.600
In a word, the seeming truthwhich cunning times put on

279
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.130
to entrap the wisest.

280
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:37.370
Therefore then, thou gaudygold, hard food for Midas,

281
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.830
I will none of thee.

282
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.870
Nor none of thee, thoupale and common drudge

283
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.130
'tween man and man.

284
00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:45.800
But thou, thou meagrelead,

285
00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.970
which rather threaten'stthan dost promise aught.

286
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:56.570
Thy plainness moves memore than eloquence,

287
00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.670
and here choose I.

288
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.100
Joy be the consequence.

289
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.730
How all other passionsfleet to air

290
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:14.330
as doubtful thoughts, andrash-embraced despair

291
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.270
and shudd'ring fear, andgreen-eyed jealousy.

292
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:19.830
Oh, love, be moderate.

293
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.900
Allay thy ecstasy.

294
00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.130
In measure rain thy joy.

295
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.130
Scant this excess.

296
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:26.400
I feel too much thyblessing.

297
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.370
Make it less for fear Isurfeit.

298
00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:35.470
What find I here?

299
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:41.630
Fair Portia's counterfeit!

300
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:50.430
What demigod hath come sonear creation?

301
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.530
Move these eyes, orwhether,

302
00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.130
riding on the balls ofmine, seem they in motion?

303
00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.600
Here are severed lips,parted with sugar breath

304
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.970
so sweet a bar shouldsunder such sweet friends.

305
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.630
Here in her hairs, thepainter plays the spider

306
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.500
and hath woven a golden meshto entrap the hearts of men

307
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.400
faster than gnats incobwebs.

308
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.030
But her eyes,

309
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:14.330
how could he see to dothem?

310
00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:16.230
Having made one, methinksit should have power

311
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:19.430
to steal both his andleave itself unfurnished.

312
00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.830
But look, how far thesubstance of my praise

313
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.230
doth wrong this shadow inunderprizing it.

314
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:30.970
So far this shadow dothlimp behind the substance.

315
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:34.830
Here is the scroll,

316
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.700
the continent, and summaryof my fortune.

317
00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.970
"You that choose not bythe view

318
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.130
"chance as fair and chooseas true.

319
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:47.070
"Since this fortune fallsto you, be content andseek no new.

320
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:51.100
"If you be well pleasedwith this and hold yourfortune for your bliss,

321
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.700
turn you where your ladyis and claim her with aloving kiss."

322
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.800
A gentle scroll.

323
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.870
Fair lady, by your leave

324
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:10.530
I come by note, to giveand to receive,

325
00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.800
like one of two contendingin a prize

326
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.930
that thinks he hath donewell in people's eyes

327
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.300
hearing applause anduniversal shout,

328
00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.970
giddy in spirit, stillgazing in a doubt

329
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.930
whether those peals ofpraise be his or no.

330
00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:27.130
So thrice-fair lady, standI,

331
00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:30.230
even so as doubtfulwhether what I see be true

332
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:34.870
until confirmed, signed,ratified by you.

333
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:38.870
You see me, lord Bassanio,

334
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.830
where I stand

335
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.430
such as I am.

336
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:46.000
Though for myself alone,

337
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.030
I would not be ambitiousin my wish

338
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.600
to wish myself muchbetter,

339
00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.530
yet for you, I would betrebled twenty timesmyself,

340
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.770
a thousand times morerich, ten thousand timesmore fair

341
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.200
that only to stand high inyour account

342
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.400
I might in virtues,beauties, livings, friendsexceed account.

343
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.270
But the full sum of me issum of something

344
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:12.170
which, to term in gross,is an unlessoned girl

345
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.630
unschooled, unpracticed.

346
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:20.800
Happy in this, she is notyet so old but she maylearn.

347
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.900
Happier than this, she isnot bred so dull but shecan learn.

348
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.430
Happiest of all is thather gentle spirit

349
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.930
commits itself to yours tobe directed

350
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:39.600
as from her lord, hergovernor, her king.

351
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:45.230
Myself and what is mine toyou and yours is nowconverted.

352
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.470
But now I was the lord ofthis fair mansion,

353
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.470
master of my servants,queen o'er myself.

354
00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:01.630
And even now, but now, thishouse, these servants,

355
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:10.400
and this same myself areyours, my lord.

356
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.530
I give them with thisring,

357
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:20.700
which when you part from,lose, or give away,

358
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.630
let it presage the ruin ofyour love

359
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.930
and be my vantage toexclaim on you.

360
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:30.800
Madam, you have bereft meof all words.

361
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.630
Only my blood speaks toyou in my veins,

362
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:36.570
and there is suchconfusion in my powers

363
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.630
as, after some orationfairly spoke by a belovedprince,

364
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.100
there doth appear amongthe buzzing, pleasedmultitude

365
00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:45.130
where every something,being blent together,

366
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.000
turns to a wild ofnothing,

367
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.130
save of joy expressed andnot expressed.

368
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:56.300
But when this ring partsfrom this finger,

369
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.700
then parts life fromhence.

370
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.430
Oh, then be bold to sayBassanio's dead.

371
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.100
My lord and lady, it isnow our time

372
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.370
that have stood by andseen our wishes prosper

373
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.400
to cry "good joy."

374
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.470
Good joy, my lord andlady.

375
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.770
My lord Bassanio, and mygentle lady,

376
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.430
I wish you all the joythat you can wish,

377
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.170
for I am sure you can wishnone from me.

378
00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:43.630
And when your honors meanto solemnize

379
00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.030
the bargain of your faith,

380
00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.730
I do beseech you, even atthat time,

381
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.930
I may be married too.

382
00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.700
With all my heart,

383
00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.130
so thou can'st get a wife.

384
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.600
I thank your lordship, youhave got me one.

385
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.700
My eyes, my lord, can lookas swift as yours.

386
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.630
You saw the mistress.

387
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.330
I beheld the maid.

388
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.430
You loved; I loved.

389
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.770
For intermission,

390
00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.430
no more pertains to me, mylord, than you.

391
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.370
Your fortune stood uponthe caskets there

392
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:13.100
and so did mine too, asthe matter falls.

393
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.870
For wooing here until Isweat again

394
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.600
and swearing till my veryroof was dry

395
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.070
with oaths of love,

396
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.770
at last-- if promiselast--

397
00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.470
I got a promise of thisfair one here

398
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:27.600
to have her love,

399
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.130
provided that your fortuneachieved her mistress.

400
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.600
Is this true, Nerissa?

401
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.700
Madam, it is.

402
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.870
So you stand pleasedwithal.

403
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.130
And do you, Gratiano,

404
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.130
mean good faith?

405
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.400
Yes, faith, my lord.

406
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.130
Our feast shall be muchhonored in your marriage.

407
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.130
We'll play with them thefirst boy for a thousandducats.

408
00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.500
What, and stake down?

409
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.700
No, we shall ne'er win atthat sport and stake down.

410
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.670
But who comes here?

411
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.430
Lorenzo and his infidel?

412
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.300
What, and my old venetianfriend, Salerio?

413
00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.370
Lorenzo and Salerio,welcome hither,

414
00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.400
if that the youth of mynew interest here

415
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.830
have power to bid youwelcome.

416
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.500
By your leave, I bid my veryfriends and countrymen,

417
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.800
sweet Portia, welcome.

418
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.000
So do I, my lord.

419
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.200
They are entirely welcome.

420
00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.470
I thank your honor.

421
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.800
For my part, my lord,

422
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.870
my purpose was not to haveseen you here.

423
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.900
But meeting with Salerioby the way,

424
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.300
he did entreat me, pastall saying nay,

425
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.600
to come with him along.

426
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.070
I did, my lord, and I havereason for it.

427
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.800
Signior Antonio commendshim to you.

428
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.800
Ere I ope his letter, Ipray thee tell me

429
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.500
how my good friend doth.

430
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.270
Not sick, my lord, unlessit be in mind.

431
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.400
Nor well, unless in mind.

432
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.700
His letter here will showyou his estate.

433
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:41.500
Nerissa, cheer yondstranger.

434
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.200
Bid her welcome.

435
00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.900
Your hand, Salerio.

436
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.300
What's the news fromVenice?

437
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.600
How doth that royalmerchant, good Antonio?

438
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.230
I know he will be glad ofour success.

439
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.530
We are the Jasons.

440
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:54.800
We have won the fleece.

441
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.330
I would you had won thefleece that he hath lost.

442
00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:00.270
There are some shrewdcontents in yond same paper

443
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:02.270
that steal the color fromBassanio's cheek.

444
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.300
Some dear friend dead.

445
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.530
Else nothing in the world

446
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.100
could turn so much theconstitution

447
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.270
of any constant man.

448
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.570
What, worse and worse?

449
00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:12.030
With leave, Bassanio, I amhalf yourself,

450
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:14.070
and I must freely have thehalf of anything

451
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.700
that this same paperbrings you.

452
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.930
Oh, sweet Portia, here area few of the unpleasant'stwords

453
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:20.500
that ever blotted paper.

454
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.530
Gentle lady, when I didfirst impart my love toyou,

455
00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.930
I freely told you all thewealth I had ran in myveins--

456
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.230
I was a gentleman--

457
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.630
and then I told you true.

458
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.000
And yet, dear lady,

459
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.630
rating myself at nothing,you shall see how much Iwas a braggart.

460
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.770
When I told you my statewas nothing,

461
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.400
I should then have toldyou that I was worse thannothing,

462
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.630
for indeed I have engagedmyself to a dear friend,

463
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:48.300
engaged my friend to hismere enemy to feed my means.

464
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.800
Here is a letter, lady.

465
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.170
The paper as the body ofmy friend

466
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.270
and every word in it a gapingwound issuing lifeblood.

467
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.870
But is it true, Salerio?

468
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.400
Have all his venturesfailed?

469
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.600
What, not one hit?

470
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.100
From Tripolis, from Mexicoand England?

471
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.500
From Lisbon, Barbary, andIndia?

472
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.670
And not one vessel 'scapethe dreadful touch

473
00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:13.970
of merchant-marring rocks?

474
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.370
Not one, my lord.

475
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:16.770
Besides, it should appearthat,

476
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.170
if he had the present moneyto discharge the Jew,

477
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:20.430
he would not take it.

478
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.170
Never did I know acreature that did bear theshape of man

479
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:26.230
so keen and greedy toconfound a man.

480
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.100
He plies the Duke atmorning and at night

481
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.900
and doth impeach thefreedom of the state

482
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.030
if they deny him justice.

483
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.900
Twenty merchants, the Dukehimself,

484
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.070
and the magnificoes ofgreatest port have allpersuaded with him.

485
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.930
But none can drive himfrom the envious plea

486
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:45.030
of forfeiture, of justice,and his bond.

487
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.670
When I was with him, Ihave heard him swear

488
00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:50.100
to Tubal and to Chus, hiscountrymen,

489
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.330
that he would rather haveAntonio's flesh

490
00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.300
than twenty times thevalue of the sum

491
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.570
that he did owe him.

492
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.830
And I know, my lord,

493
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.070
if law, authority, andpower deny not,

494
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.070
it will go hard with poorAntonio.

495
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.430
Is it your dear friendthat is thus in trouble?

496
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.470
The dearest friend to me,the kindest man,

497
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.400
the best-conditioned andunwearied spirit in doingcourtesies,

498
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.970
and one in whom theancient Roman honor moreappears

499
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.570
than any that draws breathin Italy.

500
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:19.130
What sum owes he the Jew?

501
00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:21.800
For me, 3,000 ducats.

502
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.130
What, no more?

503
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.870
Pay him 6,000 and defacethe bond.

504
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:32.570
Double 6,000 and thentreble that before afriend of this description

505
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.530
shall lose a hair throughBassanio's fault.

506
00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:40.030
First, go with me tochurch and call me wife

507
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.570
and then away to Venice toyour friend,

508
00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:46.770
for never shall you lie byPortia's side with anunquiet soul.

509
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.530
You shall have gold to paythe petty debt twentytimes over.

510
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.900
When it is paid, bringyour true friend along.

511
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.000
My maid Nerissa and myselfmeantime will live asmaids and widows.

512
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.570
Come, away.

513
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.000
For you must hence uponyour wedding day.

514
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.300
Bid your friends welcome.

515
00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.500
Show a merry cheer.

516
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.670
Since you are dear bought,I will love you dear.

517
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.630
But let me hear the letterof your friend.

518
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.870
"Sweet Bassanio, my shipshave all miscarried,

519
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.330
"my creditors grow cruel,my estate is very low,

520
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.400
"my bond to the Jew isforfeit,

521
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.370
"and since in paying it itis impossible I should live,

522
00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.030
"all debts are clearedbetween you and I

523
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.200
"if I might but see you atmy death.

524
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.730
"Notwithstanding, use yourpleasure.

525
00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:41.370
If your love do notpersuade you to come, letnot my letter."

526
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.200
Oh, love, dispatch allbusiness and be gone.

527
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.430
Since I have your goodleave to go away, I willmake haste.

528
00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.070
But till I come again,

529
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.170
no bed shall e'er beguilty of my stay,

530
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:54.970
nor rest be interposer'twixt us twain.

531
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:01.830
Jailer, look to him.

532
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.070
Tell not me of mercy.

533
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:06.270
This is the fool that lentout money gratis.

534
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.400
Jailer, look to him.

535
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.530
Hear me yet, good Shylock.

536
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:09.830
I'll have my bond!

537
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.970
Speak not against my bond.

538
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:14.170
I have sworn an oath thatI will have my bond.

539
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.930
Thou call'dst me dogbefore thou hadst a cause,

540
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.700
but since I am a dog,beware my fangs.

541
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.800
The Duke shall grant mejustice.

542
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.770
I do wonder, thou naughtyjailer, that thou art so fond

543
00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.700
to come abroad with him athis request.

544
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:28.970
I pray thee, hear mespeak.

545
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:30.230
I'll have my bond.

546
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:31.730
I will not hear theespeak.

547
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.900
I'll have my bond, andtherefore speak no more.

548
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.700
I'll not be made a softand dull-eyed fool

549
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.800
to shake the head, relent,and sigh,

550
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.370
and yield to Christianintercessors.

551
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.700
Follow not.

552
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.330
I'll have no speaking.

553
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.930
I will have my bond.

554
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.000
It is the mostimpenetrable cur that everkept with man.

555
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.800
Let him alone.

556
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.900
I'll follow him no morewith bootless prayers.

557
00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.200
He seeks my life.

558
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.530
His reason well I know.

559
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.570
I oft delivered from hisforfeitures

560
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.370
many that have at timesmade moan to me.

561
00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.170
Therefore he hates me.

562
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.270
I am sure the Duke willnever grant thisforfeiture to hold.

563
00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.000
The Duke cannot deny thecourse of law.

564
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.700
For the commodity thatstrangers have with us inVenice,

565
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.270
if it be denied, will muchimpeach

566
00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.930
the justice of the state sincethat the trade and profit

567
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.730
of the city consisteth ofall nations.

568
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:26.500
Therefore, go.

569
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.100
These griefs and losseshave so bated me

570
00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.000
that I shall hardly sparea pound of flesh tomorrowto my bloody creditor.

571
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.370
Well, jailer, on.

572
00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.600
Pray God Bassanio come tosee me pay his debt.

573
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.600
And then I care not.

574
00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.300
Madam, although I speak itin your presence,

575
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.430
you have a noble and atrue conceit

576
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.700
of godlike amity, whichappears most strongly

577
00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.270
in bearing thus theabsence of your lord.

578
00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.800
But if you knew to whomyou show this honor,

579
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.200
how true a gentleman yousend relief,

580
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.300
how dear a lover of mylord, your husband,

581
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.030
I know you would beprouder of the work

582
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.870
than customary bounty canenforce you.

583
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.100
I never did repent for doinggood, nor shall not now.

584
00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.670
For in companions that doconverse and waste thetime together

585
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.300
whose souls do bear anequal yoke of love,

586
00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.330
there must be needs a likeproportion

587
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.500
of lineaments, of manners,and of spirit,

588
00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.230
which makes me think thatthis Antonio, being thebosom lover of my lord,

589
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.800
must needs be like mylord.

590
00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.700
If it be so, how little isthe cost I have bestowed

591
00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:45.630
in purchasing thesemblance of my soul

592
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:48.330
from out the state ofhellish cruelty.

593
00:30:48.330 --> 00:30:50.930
But this comes too nearthe praising of myself.

594
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.230
Therefore, no more of it.

595
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.870
Hear other things.

596
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.400
Lorenzo, I commit intoyour hands

597
00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.570
the husbandry and manageof my house until mylord's return.

598
00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:04.600
For mine own part, I havetoward heaven breathed asecret vow

599
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.000
to live in prayer andcontemplation onlyattended by Nerissa here

600
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.030
until her husband and mylord's return.

601
00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.130
There is a monastery threemiles off, and there wewill abide.

602
00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:17.670
I do desire you not todeny this imposition,

603
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:21.800
the which my love and somenecessity now lays uponyou.

604
00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.770
Madam, with all my heart Ishall obey you in all faircommands.

605
00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.330
My people do already knowmy mind

606
00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:30.970
and will acknowledge youand Jessica in place oflord Bassanio and myself.

607
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.370
So fare you well till weshall meet again.

608
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.800
Fair thoughts and happyhours attend on you.

609
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.600
I wish your ladyship allheart's content.

610
00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.900
I thank you for your wish,

611
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.200
and I'm well pleased towish it back on you.

612
00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.930
Fare ye well, Jessica.

613
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:54.130
Now, Balthasar, as I haveever found thee honest-true,

614
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:55.730
so let me find thee still.

615
00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.130
Take this same letter,

616
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.300
and use thou all theendeavor of a man in speedto Padua.

617
00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.300
See thou deliver this intomy cousin's hand, Dr.Bellario.

618
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.500
And look what notes andgarments he doth give thee.

619
00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.030
Bring them, I pray thee,with imagined speed untothe traject,

620
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:09.770
to the common ferry whichtrades to Venice.

621
00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.000
Waste no time in words.

622
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.270
Get thee gone.

623
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.870
I shall be there beforethee.

624
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.200
Madam, I go with allconvenient speed.

625
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.630
Come on, Nerissa.

626
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:21.870
I have work in hand thatyou yet know not of.

627
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:24.500
We'll see our husbandsbefore they think of us.

628
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:25.670
Shall they see us?

629
00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.770
They shall, Nerissa, butin such a habit

630
00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.230
that they shall think weare accomplished with thatwe lack.

631
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:32.530
I'll hold thee any wager

632
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.230
when we are bothaccoutered like young men,

633
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.230
I'll prove the prettierfellow of the two

634
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.300
and wear my dagger withthe braver grace

635
00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:43.030
and speak between thechange of man and boy in areed voice

636
00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:46.570
and turn two mincing stepsinto a manly stride

637
00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.700
and speak of frays like afine bragging youth

638
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:53.170
and tell quaint lies howhonorable ladies sought mylove,

639
00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.170
which I denying, they fellsick and died.

640
00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.470
I could not do withal.

641
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.530
And then I'll repent andwish, for all that,

642
00:32:58.530 --> 00:32:59.830
that I had not killedthem.

643
00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.830
And twenty of these punylies I'll tell that menshall swear

644
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.100
I have discontinued schoolabove a twelvemonth.

645
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.830
I have, within my mind,

646
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.270
a thousand raw tricks ofthese bragging jacks

647
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.800
which I will practice.

648
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.230
Why, shall we turn to men?

649
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.830
Fie, what a question'sthat if thou wert near alewd interpreter.

650
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:18.670
But come, I'll tell theeall my whole device

651
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:21.570
when I'm in my coach,which stays for us at thepark gate.

652
00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:25.930
Therefore haste away, forwe must measure twentymiles today.

653
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.170
Yes, truly, for look you,the sins of the father

654
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.000
are to be laid upon thechildren.

655
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.730
Therefore, I promise you,I fear you.

656
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:36.730
I was always plain withyou.

657
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.430
And so now I speak myagitation of the matter.

658
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:44.300
Therefore be of goodcheer, for truly I thinkyou are damned.

659
00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.670
There is but one hope in itthat can do you any good

660
00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.300
and that is but a kind ofbastard hope neither.

661
00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.630
And what hope is that, Ipray thee?

662
00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.470
Marry, you may partly hopethat your father got you not,

663
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.930
that you are not the Jew'sdaughter.

664
00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:01.800
That were a kind ofbastard hope indeed.

665
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:05.300
So the sins of my mothershould be visited upon me.

666
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.770
Truly then, I fear you aredamned

667
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.500
both by father and mother.

668
00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.330
Thus when I shun Scylla,your father,

669
00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.570
I fall into Charybdis,your mother.

670
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.330
Well, you are gone bothways.

671
00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.200
I shall be saved by myhusband.

672
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.800
He hath made me aChristian.

673
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.200
Truly, the more to blamehe.

674
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.030
We were Christians enoughbefore

675
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.270
e'en as many could welllive one by another.

676
00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:30.830
This making of Christianswill raise the price of hogs.

677
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.370
If we grow all to bepork-eaters,

678
00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.070
we shall not shortly have arasher on the coals for money.

679
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:39.000
I'll tell my husband,Launcelot, what you say.

680
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.870
Here he comes.

681
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.870
I shall grow jealous ofyou shortly, Launcelot,

682
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:53.870
if you thus get my wifeinto corners.

683
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:56.000
Nay, you need not fear us,Lorenzo.

684
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.970
Launcelot and I are out.

685
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.770
He tells me flatly there'sno mercy for me in heaven

686
00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.430
because I am a Jew'sdaughter.

687
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.930
And he says you are nogood member of thecommonwealth,

688
00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:12.130
for in converting Jews toChristians, you raise theprice of pork.

689
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.170
I shall answer that betterto the commonwealth

690
00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.970
than you can the gettingup of the negro's belly.

691
00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:20.930
The moor is with child byyou, Launcelot.

692
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:26.300
Well, it is much that the moorshould be more than reason.

693
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.800
But if she be less than anhonest woman,

694
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.230
she is indeed more than Itook her for.

695
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.930
How every fool can playupon the word.

696
00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.370
I think the best grace ofwit will shortly turn intosilence

697
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:40.970
and discourse growcommendable in none onlybut parrots.

698
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.630
Go in, sirrah.

699
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:43.830
Bid them prepare fordinner.

700
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:45.030
That is done, sir.

701
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:46.230
They have all stomachs.

702
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:49.900
Goodly lord, what awit-snapper are you.

703
00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.070
Then bid them preparedinner.

704
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:54.170
Oh, that is done too, sir.

705
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.370
Only "cover" is the word.

706
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.570
Will you cover then, sir?

707
00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.970
Not so, neither, sir.

708
00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.070
I know my duty.

709
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.970
Yet more quarrelling withoccasion?

710
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.430
Wilt thou show the whole wealthof thy wit in an instant?

711
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.800
I pray thee understand a plainman in his plain meaning.

712
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.730
Go to thy fellows, bidthem cover the table,

713

714
00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.970
For the table, sir, itshall be served in.

715
00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:18.470
For the meat, sir, itshall be covered.

716
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:20.470
For your coming in todinner, sir,

717
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.830
why, let it be as humorsand conceits shall govern.

718
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.470
Oh, dear discretion, howhis words are suited.

719
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:32.070
The fool hath planted inhis memory an army of goodwords.

720
00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.300
And I do know a many foolsthat stand in better place

721
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:39.170
garnished like him, thatfor a tricksy word defythe matter.

722
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.300
How cheer'st thou,Jessica?

723
00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.500
And now, good sweet, saythy opinion.

724
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.730
How dost thou like thelord Bassanio's wife?

725
00:36:56.730 --> 00:36:59.000
Past all expressing.

726
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.170
It is very meet the lordBassanio live an uprightlife,

727
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:07.000
for, having such ablessing in his lady,

728
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.800
he finds the joys ofheaven here on earth.

729
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.200
And if on earth he do notmerit it,

730
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.830
in reason he should nevercome to heaven.

731
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.370
Why, if two gods shouldplay some heavenly match

732
00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:24.400
and on the wager lay twoearthly women and Portiaone,

733
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.530
there must be somethingelse pawned with theother,

734
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.370
for the poor rude worldhath not her fellow.

735
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:34.100
Even such a husband hast thouof me as she is for a wife.

736
00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.230
Nay, but ask my opiniontoo of that.

737
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.130
I will anon.

738
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:40.130
